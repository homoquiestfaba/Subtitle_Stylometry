1
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,441
Shh.

2
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:33,731
It's a beautiful summer day

3
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,367
temperatures expected to reach
the upper 80s.

4
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:39,836
In recent news,
a health advisory was reported

5
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,838
from happy poultry farms.

6
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,273
Now, they're telling us that
they're issuing a full recall

7
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,308
for their precooked
chicken tenders

8
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,276
and also their buffalo chicken
tenders.

9
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:49,977
Now, this only applies
to the chicken

10
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,279
that was packaged on Friday
and delivered to suburbs

11
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,381
such as fort chicken
and Danville.

12
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:57,650
Happy poultry advises...
Morning, honey.

13
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:58,784
Rise and shine.

14
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,619
Morning, mom.

15
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,720
How's the book going?

16
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:02,754
Good.

17
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,956
I've been working really
hard on it...

18
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,923
rewriting it.

19
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,724
It's a first draft, you know?

20
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,959
Did you get a chance
to read the manuscript?

21
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,927
I did, and I loved it.

22
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,662
Oh, well, any thoughts?

23
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:14,663
Criticisms?

24
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:15,597
No.

25
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,432
I thought it was wonderful.

26
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,634
I'm not gonna become
a better writer if I don't get

27
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:20,735
constructive criticism.

28
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:22,403
Please, I'm begging you.

29
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:24,505
Well, um...

30
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:30,711
I did think the characters were
a tiny bit unlikable.

31
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,679
That's more like it.

32
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,780
Noted.

33
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:37,550
I found myself a little bored
to be honest.

34
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,985
And I heart honesty.

35
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,487
I also didn't know what was
going on and where we were.

36
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,788
It wasn't explained very well.

37
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,656
Frankly, I couldn't figure out
the plot.

38
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,391
It was kind of insulting,
and there was no specificity

39
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:48,992
in the writing
in terms of time and place.

40
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:50,026
Okay.

41
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,594
And where was
the inciting incident?

42
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:52,628
Okay, okay.

43
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,997
This is... this is... wow!

44
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,366
Thank you.

45
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:59,968
But mostly I loved it.

46
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,803
Now, get on up and teach
those summer school kids

47
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,905
how to write like you.

48
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,742
The boat was evil,

49
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:12,711
but he loved the boat.

50
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,813
The boat was evil

51
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,349
but he didn't know
just how evil.

52
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,720
The boat was evil,
but it was an acceptable level

53
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,288
of evil.

54
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,390
The seafaring vessel...

55
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,525
the schooner was evil.

56
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:39,534
It's getting there.

57
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:40,835
Jesus.

58
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:41,936
I've come full circle.

59
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:46,706
How very, very utterly
depressing.

60
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,907
What's up, amigo?

61
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,743
Hey, You're not my dealer.

62
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,978
No. No, I'm... I'm Clint...
hey, you don't sell 'shrooms,

63
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,845
do ya?

64
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:56,047
No, um, I'm Clint Hadson.

65
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,348
Is that Hudson?

66
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,883
Hadson.

67
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:00,750
Yeah, it's him.

68
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

69
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,087
So that's a no on the 'shrooms?

70
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,955
Right.

71
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:24,802
Excuse me!

72
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,603
I'm... I'm having trouble.

73
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,687
Don't you forget, mister,
You're grounded.

74
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,722
And when school's over,
you come straight home.

75
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:49,723
Fuck you, mom.

76
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,657
Oh, yeah?

77
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,724
Fuck you!

78
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,659
I'm just gonna miss you
so much.

79
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,127
Can't I take it off?

80
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,398
No, the playground
is a war zone.

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Watch it!

82
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,768
Sorry. Didn't see you there.

83
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,971
Well, maybe you should
take in your surroundings more.

84
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,006
Yeah.

85
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,078
Mr. Hudson!

86
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,412
Hadson.

87
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:18,546
Hi, uh, call me Clint.

88
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:21,081
Thanks so much for coming in
on such short notice.

89
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,083
Looks like Mrs. Kenner is down
with the stomach flu,

90
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:26,986
'cause she is mormon,
so that's always a possibility.

91
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,089
Principal Hadgis
is in the Bahamas,

92
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,957
when the cat's away,

93
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,592
the vice principal
becomes acting principal.

94
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:35,859
Yeah, I forgot they say that.

95
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,627
Teachers lounge is just
across the way, so go get

96
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,496
well, it's not strong
enough for my taste.

97
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:43,098
To deal with these terrors,
I need the high-octane stuff.

98
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,166
Isn't that right, Mrs. Gordon?

99
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,400
She's hilarious.

100
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:47,701
A lot of personal tragedy.

101
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:48,968
Come on into this office.

102
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,403
Pull up a ball chair.

103
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,971
Got a cell phone?

104
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,106
Um, yeah.

105
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,575
Afraid I'm gonna
have to take it.

106
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,711
Yep, this is a no
cell phone campus,

107
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,479
and we Can't ask the kids
to give up something

108
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,648
so hand over that crackberry.

109
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:08,917
A-booyah.

110
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:09,884
Now, I gotta warn you.

111
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,586
I run a pretty tight ship.

112
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,888
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

113
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,856
Actually, it's... it's funny
you should say that.

114
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:19,058
I'm actually writing a book
about a ship.

115
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,426
Well, it's more of a boat.

116
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:21,193
I have it with me.

117
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:22,928
If You're asking me to describe

118
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,863
my pedagogical "philosophy"...

119
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:26,064
I'm not.

120
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,665
There are some
charter schools out of Boston

121
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:31,201
that are "absolutely"
"revolutionizing" education.

122
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,102
I'm not sure you know
how air quotes work.

123
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:36,738
I want to bring these kids
back to a pre-digital era.

124
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,773
No cell phones,
and I don't care

125
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:42,209
if it's raining labradoodles,
I wanna get those kids outside

126
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,176
during recess.

127
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:45,444
Heck, I'll lock 'em out.

128
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,778
And I will do that.

129
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,746
Now, here's a map of the school.

130
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,848
Mrs. Kenner is in room 12.

131
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,082
Oh, I don't need that.

132
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,516
I actually used to go here.

133
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,484
Class of '88.

134
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,118
Hey, you know what that is?

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,186
That's out of sight.

136
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,854
All right.

137
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,755
Shouldn't joke about
guns, though.

138
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:03,622
No.

139
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:04,489
Not in a school.

140
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:05,156
Yeah.

141
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,224
That's not funny.

142
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,025
Yeah, my partner's
name is David.

143
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,593
He is awesome.

144
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,828
He's a little bit older
but weirdly has

145
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,896
this amazing body.

146
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:17,965
If I'm being completely honest,
he does have

147
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,834
these fantastic balls
that I just love to play with.

148
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:25,071
They're firmer and
fuzzier, so...

149
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,039
Tennis partner.

150
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,241
Dave is my tennis partner.

151
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,476
Hi, there.

152
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,782
Um, you know which one of these
is Mrs. Kenner's?

153
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,217
Buddy, I don't know
what that bitch drinks out of.

154
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:41,251
Here's what I do know.

155
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,187
I know that this
is a rape button.

156
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,557
It emits a shit-crazy alarm
that'll inform local police

157
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,126
who arrive within two minutes
should you decide to get touchy

158
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,861
and/or feely.

159
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:53,729
You wanna know why I have
a rape button?

160
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:54,596
Don't answer.

161
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,532
Because the government
of the state of Illinois doesn't

162
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,835
trust the citizenry enough
to pass safe, sensible

163
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,169
conceal and carry laws.

164
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,771
Okay.

165
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:06,972
So any of these then?

166
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,010
Hmm, she's a little

167
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,246
tightly wound, huh?

168
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:24,353
Oh, my God.

169
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,895
Lucy?

170
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:35,829
Lucy Mccormick?

171
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:36,896
It... it... it's Clint Hadson.

172
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:38,063
Oh, my God!

173
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,898
Wow, what are you doing here?

174
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,866
Well, I'm subbing
for Mrs. Kenner.

175
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,401
Oh, my God, amazing.

176
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,703
I heard you lived in New York.

177
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:47,704
Yeah, I did.

178
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:52,141
But now I'm in town for a while,
staying at Charman's.

179
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,243
Oh.

180
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,177
Who's Charman?

181
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,045
My mom.

182
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,112
Ah!

183
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:01,648
But it's like a guesthouse,
so it's...

184
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,750
So You're a teacher now?

185
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:04,917
No.

186
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,752
Well, I mean, yes.

187
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,920
I, uh, I ended up subbing
a little in New York.

188
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:12,156
But really I'm a writer.

189
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,258
That's great.

190
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,361
Oh, well... God, it's a scorcher

191
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:19,062
out there, huh?

192
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:20,296
Unseasonably warm.

193
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:20,798
Yeah.

194
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:28,937
Uh, wade, have you met Clint?

195
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:29,904
I have not.

196
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:33,040
Pleased to meet you
with meat to please you.

197
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,075
Actually, we kinda met earlier.

198
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:38,711
You parked me in.

199
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,312
What are you talking about?

200
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:41,279
Nothing.

201
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,715
It's just that, um,
you parked so close that.

202
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,150
I-I couldn't get out of my...
my truck's got

203
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:49,085
a dual reeow weeow.

204
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,453
I'm sorry?

205
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,855
Dual reeow weeow.

206
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:55,791
Dual weeow... dual weeow...

207
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:56,758
dual reeow weeow.

208
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,728
It's... dual weeow...

209
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,797
dual real wheel.

210
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,333
Dual real... reow reow.

211
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,934
Got a dual reeow weeow.

212
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:13,238
Dual weeow...

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,274
dual weeow...
I don't understand.

214
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,410
It's got two extra wheels
on the back part of it.

215
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,245
Ah.

216
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:24,147
Dual rear... so, Clint,

217
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,781
heard tell you were a writer.

218
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:26,882
Hmm?

219
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:31,386
Oh, nothing that you've read,
yet.

220
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,921
I'm actually working
on my first novel.

221
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:34,788
Really?

222
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,456
Yeah.

223
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,491
Oh, yeah, actually why I'm home.

224
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:42,728
You know, just to hunker down
and bang out that story.

225
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,763
But, uh, I need a few shekels.

226
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,309
Shekels.

227
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,235
Hebrew for...

228
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,236
Doug.

229
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,170
Currency.

230
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,471
Okay.

231
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,039
Wow, good for you.

232
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,040
That's so exciting!

233
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:57,940
Oh, thanks.

234
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:59,341
What's it about?

235
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,976
Oh, uh, well,
it's... it's a horror novel.

236
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:05,179
Um, it... it's about a guy
who buys a boat,

237
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:10,083
but the boat turns out
to be possessed.

238
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:11,184
Like<i> Christine.</i>

239
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,886
I'm sorry?

240
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,254
<i>Christine,</i> Stephen king.

241
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,823
Guy buys a car
and it's possessed.

242
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,357
Oh.

243
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,991
Um...

244
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:22,525
But... but this is about a boat.

245
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,860
So it's like<i> speed 2.</i>

246
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,828
Starring?

247
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,198
Sandra bullock, yes, of course,
and?

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,132
Keanu Reeves?

249
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:32,999
Jason Patric!

250
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,033
Right.

251
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,467
I am the biggest
Jason Patric fan.

252
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:36,334
Jason Patric.

253
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:37,201
Oh,<i> lost boys!</i>

254
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,068
They're not lost.

255
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,935
Kiefer.

256
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:40,036
They're vampires.

257
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,806
Yeah, they got lost...

258
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,341
all right, let's roll!

259
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,876
Your classroom is actually
right next to mine.

260
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,244
I can walk you if you want.

261
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,045
Oh, um, yeah.

262
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:54,914
That'd be great.

263
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:05,123
You are so fuckin' ugly.

264
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,793
If my butthole had a butthole,
that's what you'd look like.

265
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:12,429
Yeah, you look like
my butthole's ass.

266
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,297
You look like you got
chicken pox,

267
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,232
if chicken pox was made
out of hemorrhoids

268
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:19,501
yeah, if chicken pox
was made out of my ass.

269
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,036
And here we are, fourth grade.

270
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:23,170
That's me.

271
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,272
And You're right up there.

272
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,373
Good luck.

273
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,907
Holler if you need anything.

274
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,576
The athletic office
is right down there.

275
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,377
Yeah, what's with that guy?

276
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,478
He seems like a bit of a dick.

277
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,415
He's my boyfriend.

278
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,516
Sorry I'm late, guys.

279
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:39,917
I was helping a friend out.

280
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,152
Eric, what is that?

281
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,220
You put that right down now.

282
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,594
Hey, did somebody order a sub?

283
00:14:53,596 --> 00:15:00,133
Ooh, tough crowd.

284
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:03,836
My Uncle's cancer

285
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,270
took his stomach.

286
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:09,040
But his divorce...

287
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,009
Took his mind.

288
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,946
Anyhoo, that was my weekend.

289
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,113
Let's begin, class.

290
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:20,116
Maybe we were created
by an all-knowing God

291
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:23,285
who sent down his only son
to die for us.

292
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:27,088
Or maybe we were monkey people
who sat around

293
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,590
crappin' in each other's mouths
until one day we were like,

294
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:31,158
"I don't like all this hair.

295
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,528
Just on my head and crotch,
please."

296
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,162
Who can say?

297
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:38,898
I Can't
because the state of Illinois

298
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,367
doesn't allow me to, Hank.

299
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:47,973
I know I'm the substitute,
but I'm also a friend.

300
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:49,908
It wasn't so long ago
that I was sitting exactly where

301
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,175
you are.

302
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:53,477
In fact, don't tell
those other teachers,

303
00:15:53,479 --> 00:16:01,479
but I want you to call me
by my first name.

304
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,053
Cunt?

305
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:05,888
What?

306
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,226
No, you... you Can't say...
okay, no, uh, my name is Clint.

307
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:12,327
You know what?

308
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,997
Just call me Mr. Hadson.

309
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,933
Now, I'm not really a teacher.

310
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:21,902
I'm only substituting
to pay the bills.

311
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:24,638
I'm actually writing
a horror novel.

312
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,639
Pretty cool, huh?

313
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:27,374
Yeah, real cool, asshole.

314
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,275
Excuse me.

315
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,142
What's your name?

316
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,076
Patriot.

317
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,410
He got held back.

318
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:33,978
Shut up!

319
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Your name is patriot?

320
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,514
That's right.

321
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,449
I was born on September 11th.

322
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,318
God sent me on that day.

323
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,422
That's why, on my 18th birthday,
I'm joining the marines, just

324
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,291
to kick some towel-head ass.

325
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:52,460
Wow, a lot to unpack there.

326
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:54,562
First off, could you keep
the language down, please,

327
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,563
patriot?

328
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,064
Otherwise I'll send you outside.

329
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,565
Yeah, while you were just
talking, I just looked at,

330
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,567
like, a hundred vaginas.

331
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:01,434
All right.

332
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,334
Give me that.

333
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:03,435
Why?

334
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:05,370
Because You're not allowed
to have it.

335
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:06,938
Your principal told me.

336
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,440
How about I start crying
and then suggest to my parents

337
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:15,979
about how you touched me
inappropriately?

338
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,315
You didn't happen to write
something on a prius

339
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,683
this morning, did you?

340
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:29,123
So I actually have
the first draft of my new novel

341
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,259
who would like to come up here
and read the first chapter

342
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,395
and then you guys can give me
some notes.

343
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:36,562
Great. What's your name?

344
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:39,197
Douche.

345
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,198
Calvin.

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,600
Calvin, come on down.

347
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:50,707
Go ahead.

348
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:53,042
Trent always loved boats.

349
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:55,677
But when he spent his
life savings on the<i> Anna Marie,</i>

350
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,112
"he didn't know he just chartered
a course to evil."

351
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:00,180
"It was an easy money

352
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:01,181
transaction"...

353
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:04,083
You'd be good
in a horror novel.

354
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,351
"And didn't ask any
questions"...

355
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:06,853
Hey.

356
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,489
You listening to me?

357
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,697
Ow!

358
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,139
All right,

359
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:31,806
everyone, calm down.

360
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,508
I'm gonna take patriot
to the nurse's office.

361
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,310
Come on.

362
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,312
Don't be a baby.

363
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,247
Come on, patriot, let me see.

364
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:43,382
Come on.

365
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:46,451
This is going to need.

366
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,220
There's nothing I can do
about it here.

367
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,322
He's gonna have to go
to the hospital.

368
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:52,456
That's okay.

369
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,124
Patriot can handle it.

370
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,258
Right, patriot?

371
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,158
You're a marine.

372
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:14,308
Beautiful, beautiful

373
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:23,315
'shrooms.

374
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:36,292
So one of my students tried
to eat another one's face off.

375
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,826
How's your day going?

376
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,727
I'm... I'm really sorry
about this morning.

377
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,161
What happened?

378
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,862
I... when I called
your boyfriend a dick.

379
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:45,164
I didn't know you guys were
dating and... and now I feel

380
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,231
really awkward.

381
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,266
No, in your classroom,
what happened?

382
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,868
Oh, this girl
just went apeshit on this kid.

383
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,935
She was biting him.

384
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,303
I had to send him to the nurse.

385
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:54,837
Did you send her
to the principal's office?

386
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,439
I wanted to give her
a high five.

387
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:59,240
That kid was a dick.

388
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:20,927
Hey!

389
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:27,299
You bit my friend's face.

390
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,669
What, are you sick or something?

391
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,203
Hey, you bitch!

392
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,271
I just wanted to say to them,

393
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:37,841
like, "guys, I'm a writer who
moved here from New York City."

394
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:41,244
Like, I'm way cooler
than your regular teacher."

395
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,812
This day could've been
super fun.

396
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:44,547
Kids are always rough on subs.

397
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,916
Yeah, but this is different
from what we were like

398
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:47,950
growing up.

399
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:51,253
They're, like, not even kids.

400
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:52,921
Waah!

401
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,798
The fuck?

402
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,766
Oh, it Can't be that funny.

403
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:24,607
Ooh LA LA.

404
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,977
Yeah, I'm such a catch.

405
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,779
Oh, you...
you'll be beating off the women

406
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,046
in fort chicken.

407
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:33,414
Oh, yeah.

408
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,515
Fort chicken girls.

409
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,716
Yeah, the hottest!

410
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:43,422
Aah!

411
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:45,056
What is happening here, kids?

412
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,965
Goddamn it!

413
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,434
What is wrong with me?

414
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:09,344
Oh, no, you didn't.

415
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,680
Vice principal Simms.

416
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,684
Yeah, You're go for Simms.

417
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,788
I'm under some medication
for a medical condition,

418
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:27,727
so I may not be seeing things
correctly, but I'm pretty sure

419
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:30,396
I might be seeing
some of your students

420
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:34,466
possibly eating Mr. Pedersen.

421
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:38,536
Again, it could be

422
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:39,436
the medication.

423
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,575
Okay, all right.

424
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,743
Show's over!

425
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:54,514
I may be acting principal,
but you all are acting crazy!

426
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:58,017
Hey, don't... don't...
I have bursitis.

427
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,820
Who... who is your homeroom?

428
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:02,322
Aah!

429
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:15,599
Aah!

430
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,070
Aah!

431
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,105
Oh!

432
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:33,514
Get... get out of there!

433
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:36,817
It's so good to see you, Clint.

434
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:37,784
It's good to see you, too.

435
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:41,654
Oh, look, carnage.

436
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:45,457
Aah!

437
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:46,991
Some... somebody call the police!

438
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,158
Wait! I'm hitting my button!

439
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,926
Ow!

440
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh! Ah!

441
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:53,094
Come on, Johnson!

442
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:55,463
What the fuck is happening?

443
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,569
What the fuck is happening?

444
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:07,906
Wait, There's wade.

445
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,208
Wade.

446
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,945
Oh, God.

447
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:19,784
All right, listen up!

448
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,787
I'd back off if I was you!

449
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,889
I was an all-state
football champion.

450
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,223
Y'all are a bunch of kids.

451
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,624
Oh.

452
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,159
Look, we've all wanted
to do that

453
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,560
to vice principal Simms, okay?

454
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,694
I know I have.

455
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,829
But a...

456
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:36,897
a line has been crossed.

457
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:42,568
You Can't eat the teachers,

458
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,102
man!

459
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:48,672
Hold it right now!

460
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:49,174
Aah!

461
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:53,742
Ah!

462
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:54,843
Fwip! Ha!

463
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:00,980
Come on, Johnson!

464
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:02,815
Run, Johnson!

465
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:05,217
You can do... no, no.

466
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:07,552
Aah!

467
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:13,891
They... they attacked
the vice principal.

468
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:16,760
And then they started chasing
the...

469
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:18,795
hello? Hello?

470
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,831
The phones are dead.

471
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:32,942
Aah!

472
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:35,044
Oh, those kids are fast.

473
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:37,613
I was twice voted

474
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:40,248
running back of the year,
kerry county.

475
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,550
I should have won
a third year...

476
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:45,819
But it was political.

477
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,587
What the fuck
are you trying to say?

478
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:48,254
Do not go out there!

479
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:50,222
Those kids... aah!

480
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,924
Oh, God!

481
00:26:52,926 --> 00:26:53,925
Oh, no, no, no, no.

482
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:54,926
It's Angela.

483
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:57,194
Angela, it's me, Mr. Lacey.

484
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:00,096
Ugh.

485
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,231
Oh, There's Dave!

486
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,799
Dave's coming!

487
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:05,734
See?

488
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:07,235
Everything's gonna be fine!

489
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,269
Ooh, shit, man.

490
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,603
Five-o!

491
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:10,637
Fuck it.

492
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,244
I ain't goin' down!

493
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,145
All right, kids, settle down.

494
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,780
You little guys need to tell me
what's going on.

495
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,552
You guys all eat cherry pie
for lunch or something?

496
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:32,121
What's going on?

497
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,021
I'm here to help.

498
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:34,989
Think of me just like Batman.

499
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:36,156
I'm a helper.

500
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,192
Aah!

501
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:46,999
What the fuck?

502
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,034
Aah!

503
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:51,135
Ow!

504
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,380
Oh, my God!

505
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,381
Fuck this!

506
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:06,348
I gotta do something!

507
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,315
No, wade!

508
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:08,249
You Can't go back out there!

509
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,116
No! Let me alone!

510
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:09,983
Oh, my God.

511
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:10,850
Wade.

512
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,952
Aah!

513
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,788
Oh, my God!

514
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,122
Aah!

515
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:17,624
Ow!

516
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,261
What the fuck, freak?

517
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,762
Oh, God!

518
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:27,430
He's gonna bite into your face!

519
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:28,431
Yes, I can see that!

520
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,166
He'll tear
your goddamn face off!

521
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,201
You'll look like
that chimp woman!

522
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:33,335
Aah!

523
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,236
You're achieving nothing!

524
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:37,304
Help me!

525
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:40,006
Let me burn his face!

526
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:41,474
Aah! Oh!

527
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:43,776
Aah!

528
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:47,713
Oh!

529
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,214
Who is that lady?

530
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,884
Anybody have a key?

531
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,185
Probably not.

532
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:57,888
Let's go.

533
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,922
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:28:58,924 --> 00:28:59,989
We Can't just leave her there.

535
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:01,824
You bet your ass we are!

536
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:04,459

00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:06,493
Move! Move!

538
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:10,496
We gotta get out of here!

539
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,463
Aah!

540
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:12,831
Follow me, I do crossfit!

541
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,165
No! Don't do it!

542
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,400
You sons of...

00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:27,143
In here!

548

No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

life beautiful.

553
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:37,984
What's going on?

554
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:38,884
Kill him!

555
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:40,051
No! Wait!

556
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,053
Tracy's right.

557
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:43,320
Calvin, are you okay?

558
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,855
You don't have a thirst
for blood or anything?

559
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:46,822
Why would I do that?

560
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:48,456
I'm studying
for my English test.

561
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,890
Oh, great. How's it going?

562
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:53,260
We gotta seek out
some higher ground.

563
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:54,227
Okay, come on, Calvin.

564
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,261
You come with us.

565
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,801
We're clear!

566
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,505
In here, come on!

567
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,839
Come on.

568
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,807
Close the door! Close the door!

569
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,507
Okay, all right.

570
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,242
Hey, hey, is everyone okay?

571
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,811
Can we please take a moment

572
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:17,978
of sil... aah!

573
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,945
Get in here, come on!

574
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:19,946
Calvin, don't look!

575
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:20,913
Don't look! Don't look!

576
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:22,214
She has blisters.

577
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:23,515
Okay, I think We're safe.

578
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,849
The door is locked.

579
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,984
They cannot get up through
these windows.

580
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:28,418
The phone's out in here, too.

581
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,486
Can somebody please explain
to me what the hell is going on?

582
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:32,221
What is going on?

583
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:35,224
> I mean, I hated my teachers
in school.

584
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:37,192
I hated them, but I never tried
to kill them.

585
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,493
They got cooties.

586
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:41,028
What?

587
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,030
That's what they're always
saying that girl shelley has.

588
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:44,064
Cooties.

589
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:45,198
She's dirty.

590
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,567
Calvin, that's not very nice.

591
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,569
No, he's right.

592
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,170
In a... in a... in a way.

593
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:53,305
If you'll follow me, you'll see.

594
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:55,173
Wade, You're not hurt, are you?

595
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:56,274
No, babe, I'm good.

596
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:58,943
She has the raised blisters
of a...

597
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:01,145
a virus.

598
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,279
I'm okay.

599
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:04,247
We're safe here, right?

600
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:05,815
Everybody feels okay?

601
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:07,516
And We're all safe.

602
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:12,120
It's pretty interesting
actually.

603
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,243
I knew we'd work it all out.

604
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,600
I would love to get inside
your head.

605
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:35,073
Oh, guess she's gone
to commit murder somewhere else.

606
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:37,175
All right, ladies,
here's the plan.

607
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:39,977
We get down on that ledge,
jump to the ground, hightail it

608
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:42,012
like linebackers to our cars.

609
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,246
Boom!

610
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:45,414
What? I thought you just
tried to outrun them.

611
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,349
You... you said they were too fast
for you.

612
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:52,019
Yeah, but that was before
I had a weapon.

613
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:54,921
A violin?

614
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:59,025
Not just a violin,
it's an instrument of death.

615
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:01,427
I propose we create
a symphony of death.

616
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:02,594
Everyone, grab an instrument.

617
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:04,629
Here, you take this.

618
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,164
Oh, yeah,
that'll be real effective.

619
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,333
What are you offering,
besides throwing hot pots

620
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:13,102
of coffee at people,
or writing a stupid book

621
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:15,170
that no one wants to read
about some guy who wants

622
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:16,504
to fuck a boat?

623
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,172
Wait, it's not about a guy
who wants to fuck a boat.

624
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:20,874
It's a book about obsession
and possession on the high seas.

625
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,942
He wants to fuck the boat,
and you know it.

626
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:24,543
Listen...
listen, little Stevie king...

627
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,978
There's an invention called
a cell phone that your stupid,

628
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,147
we need to get to
the principal's office,

629
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,449
grab our phones,
and call someone who can

630
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,184
help quarantine these kids.

631
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,586
We're in a total lockdown,
in case you haven't noticed!

632
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,121
We have been breached,
and there are little cootie kids

633
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,556
right out there in the hallway
who are willing

634
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:43,457
to fuckin' rip your face off
with their little teeth!

635
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:44,591
Well, shit!

636
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:47,594
Their big teeth haven't even
come in yet!

637
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,065
Aah!

638
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,667
You know what, you carry on

639
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,370
I'll sneak around the school
where there aren't any kids.

640
00:32:58,372 --> 00:32:59,404
Oh, you'll sneak around, huh?

641
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:01,406
Sneak around
like a little hobbit.

642
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:04,409
I'm takin' the fight to them
like a fuckin' orc.

643
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,277
And that is the difference
between you and me.

644
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,078
I don't wanna scurry...
oh, really?

645
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
I don't wanna scurry around
the hallway

646
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:10,947
like a common squirrel.

647
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:14,350
The only way We're gonna get
anywhere is if we turn

648
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:17,386
our frowns upside down
and try to get along.

649
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:21,623
You know how I beat
the terrorists after 9/11?

650
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,124
With a positive attitude.

651
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,559
It's true, she did.

652
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:28,595
Now, I-I don't think going
back for our cell phones is

653
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:32,365
necessarily a great idea,
even though it's wonderful

654
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,633
that You're trying,
and we welcome all suggestions.

655
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:35,567
Wait, I... wait.

656
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:36,534
I just thought of something.

657
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,035
What is it?

658
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:39,703
Um, it's just an idea for...
for<i> keel them all.</i>

659
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:41,971
The hero's trapped on the boat,
and my mom had this note where

660
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:44,006
she didn't understand why
he wouldn't just call for help.

661
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:45,374
I-I got it.

662
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,009
He... he left his... his phone
on the dock.

663
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,311
What are you talking about?

664
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:51,378
Oh, sorry.

665
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,278
It's my book.

666
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,079
Are you fucking kidding me?

667
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,214
Unbelievable.

668
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:58,182
Your... your book is called
<i>keel them all?</i>

669
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:00,184
Okay, ladies, can we convene
the book club

670
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,351
a little later on, please?

671
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:04,654
Wade, I think maybe
your idea is maybe

672
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:07,023
an unwise idea also.

673
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,157
Seriously, Lucy?

674
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,559
I'm sorry.

675
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:12,494
So what do you propose?

676
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:15,463
That we wait here until 3:00.

677
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,199
Um...

678
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:21,201
Okay... okay, what... what happens
at 3:00?

679
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:24,137
At 3:00, the parents will
come to pick up their kids.

680
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,606
We can get up on the roof
and signal them for help.

681
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,707
Oh, I like that idea.

682
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,674
It's... it's a good one.

683
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:30,475
Better than your fucking idea.

684
00:34:30,477 --> 00:34:32,410
Anything is better
than your idea.

685
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:34,412
Oh!

686
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:35,579
Clint, are you okay?

687
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:37,647
That sounds...
yeah, no, I'm... I'm fine.

688
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:38,714
I'm fine.

689
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:40,682
What happened to your arm?

690
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:43,251
Oh, nothing, it's...

691
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,118
oh, shit.

692
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,086
It's just... it's just a scratch.

693
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:47,620
Son of a bitch, he's infected!

694
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:48,587
No, no, no, it's nothing.

695
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,288
You got cooties, motherfucker!

696
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,189
No, no, no, I'm feeling fine!

697
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,056
Wade, wait!

698
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,590
You're coming with me!

699
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,858
Stop resisting!

700
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,825
I feel fine!

701
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,326
Don't resist the quarantine!

702
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:05,399
Wade! Wade, hon...
let me out, asshole.

703
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:06,767
Nobody else go in there.

704
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:08,168
Oh.

705
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,269
Oh!

706
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:14,240
I'm going in.

707
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,307
Doug, don't... ugh.

708
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:17,809
I don't care.

709
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:35,123
We have some breaking news
developing in the suburb

710
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,525
of fort chicken this morning.

711
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:40,461
You don't...
excuse me. Listen up, please.

712
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:45,866
Could everybody
please listen up?

713
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,167
Guys, don't make me ask again.

714
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:51,204
Quiet, quiet, please.

715
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,271
Please be quiet.

716
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:53,839
None of us are talking.

717
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,874
Rebekkah.

718
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:58,376
Quiet, please.

719
00:35:58,378 --> 00:35:59,777
Thank you.

720
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:03,480
It is my opinion
that Clint has been infected

721
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:04,414
with whatever those kids have...

722
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,381
Yeah, I knew it.

723
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:06,281
Out there.

724
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:07,649
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

725
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:10,451
But it doesn't seem to be
affecting him in the same way.

726
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:13,887
He's only exhibiting
mild stomach flu symptoms...

727
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:17,690
nausea, cramps,
a little diarrhea, vomiting,

728
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:22,861
mild anal leakage...
but it is my hypothesis

729
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:25,864
that we are safe from him
for now.

730
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:29,701
He will not attempt to murder us
or tear us limb from limb.

731
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:31,335
He just has the flu.

732
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:34,871
How do you...
how do you know all this?

733
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,807
Well, rebekkah,
I just examined his fluids

734
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:41,310
with two of history's oldest
scientific instruments...

735
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,244
my hands.

736
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:43,245
Oh, Doug.

737
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:45,680
Don't worry.

738
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:46,814
I'm wearing gloves.

739
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:47,748
Oh, no, You're not.

740
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,818
No. No, You're not.

741
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,586
God damn it, Doug.

742
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,688
I see.

743
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,789
Oh, God.

744
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,323
Okay, okay, it doesn't matter.

745
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:00,325
Listen, the sub stays locked
in the closet.

746
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:08,327
If he gets a clean bill of
health at 3:00, then we'll talk.

747
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:18,369
If he gets a clean bill of
health at 3:00, then we'll talk.

748
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:25,848
If he gets a clean bill of
health at 3:00, then we'll talk.

749
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:07,452
Keep your distance, Grisham.

750
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,353
Oh, there...
There's vomit there.

751
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:10,487
Ugh, God!

752
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:11,387
Just watch your step.

753
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,254
Are you all right?

754
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:12,954
Hey, how are you feeling?

755
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:13,821
Um, better.

756
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:14,788
Come on, okay.

757
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,789
That's yours.

758
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:16,756
Oh, thank you.

759
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:17,957
Wait, oh, I know that car.

760
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,592
That's the pta president,
racer Dobkins' mom.

761
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,994
She always gets here early
to open the gates.

762
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:23,928
Hey, hey, over here!

763
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,397
Hey!

764
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:29,900
Call for help!

765
00:38:29,902 --> 00:38:31,001
Use the phone!

766
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:32,669
Over here!

767
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:34,537
This could fall apart
at any minute, all right?

768
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,572
And I'm just thinking
about the children.

769
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:38,807
Those little bastards

770
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:39,707
are gonna kill her.

771
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:40,641
She's... it's fine.

772
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:41,642
She's gonna be fine.

773
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:42,676
Wait, there he is.

774
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:43,610
No, no, no, no, no, no.

775
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,577
Don't open the door.

776
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,511
She Can't even see us.

777
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:46,512
Don't let him get in!

778
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,847
Don't let him in!

779
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:51,783
Who's mommy's angel?

780
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,050
Who's mommy's little angel?

781
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,651
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

782
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:55,518
Get out of the car!

783
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,785
Don't!

784
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:57,886
No!

785
00:38:57,888 --> 00:38:59,921
You tell Simms that $300
won't cut it.

786
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,791
Oh, God, Steve,

787
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:07,027
I know what's going on with
this school 24/7, all right?

788
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:08,862
Come on, racer, let's go!

789
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,904
You wanna go to soccer practice
or not, honeypuckle?

790
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,566
I'm not gonna be the one
holding the bag at the goddamn

791
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:16,868
book drive again this year,
all right?

792
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,937
No, you...

793
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:21,905
Racer, what the hell
are you doing to your brother

794
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:22,872
back there now, huh?

795
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:23,873
What are you doing?

796
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,375
Oh!

797
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:31,312
They go right for the face!

798
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:32,613
I told you!

799
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:35,849
The other parents are gonna be
here any second.

800
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,584
They'll massacre
the other parents.

801
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,352
Aah!

802
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:40,086
Oh, my God!

803
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:40,953
Get off of me!

804
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:41,820
Help me!

805
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:43,054
She's not one of them!

806
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:43,988
How do you know?

807
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,922
Look at her face.

808
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,857
It's not covered in pox.

809
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:47,958
Help her up! Help her up!

810
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,926
Oh, God, they're coming!

811
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:52,328
They're coming!

812
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,429
Come on!

813
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:55,531
They're getting up on the roof!

814
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:57,833
They're in the trees!

815
00:39:57,835 --> 00:39:59,734
Move!

816
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:02,369
Come on!

817
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:04,738
Where do we go?

818
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,840
To the auditorium!

819
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:13,045
Aah!

820
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:16,114
Move! Move! Move! Move!

821
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:19,917
Aah! Help!

822
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,119
Get him off me!

823
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:22,621
Aah!

824
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:09,996
Wade, I... Tammy, why don't you

825
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:28,046
and Calvin come on over here
with me?

826
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:29,914
That guy always cheated off me.

827
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:30,848
Calvin, come on.

828
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:38,850
I'll make sure all the doors
are secure.

829
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:45,995
Why... why is his blood black?

830
00:41:45,997 --> 00:41:49,465
I don't know.

831
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,967
That's what I want to find out.

832
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:54,469
I-I think I'm gonna dissect him.

833
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,203
You guys help me.

834
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,504
Hey, look at us.

835
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:57,638
We're fine.

836
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,843
You know, We're... We're still us,
because you know why?

837
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:06,012
Because none of us got bitten
or scratched.

838
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:09,081
I did.

839
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:14,052
Oh.

840
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh, no, it's fine.

841
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:18,822
We'll just... we'll go
to the washroom and... and we'll...

842
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:20,824
you'll wash it out with soap
so it won't get infected, okay?

843
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:23,193
How... what do you say?

844
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:26,728
Okay.

845
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,499
Oh, my God, I Can't believe
You're doing this.

846
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,667
I Can't believe boys pee
in those.

847
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:36,502
I mean, that's disgusting.

848
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:37,803
That's disgusting?

849
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,539
It's not disgusting
to have boys staring

850
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,007
at each other's penises?

851
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,975
What... what is wrong with
that, okay?

852
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:46,043
We got bigger things
to worry about.

853
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:47,711
Well, this is interesting.

854
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:48,812
Oh, God!

855
00:42:48,814 --> 00:42:49,979
Oh, my God!

856
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:50,946
Oh, God.

857
00:42:50,948 --> 00:42:52,013
I'm gonna extract the brain.

858
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:53,614
Oh, that's just rude.

859
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:55,649
Tracy, God damn it.

860
00:42:57,852 --> 00:43:00,854
It appears the preliminary
reports have been confirmed.

861
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:03,523
Children are, for some reason,
violently attacking

862
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:06,058
their parents in front of
fort chicken elementary.

863
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,260
We now have reports of victims
around the city,

864
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:10,262
and authorities have no idea
what is going on.

865
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:11,263
Stay inside.

866
00:43:11,265 --> 00:43:12,564
Stay in your cars.

867
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:15,633
Do not go...

868
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:20,003
dude, this is totally

869
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:22,771
tripping me out.

870
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,709
Are you on 'shrooms, too?

871
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,947
Hey.

872
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:40,285
Can I get you anything?

873
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:44,889
I'd really rather be
left alone, Lucy.

874
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:47,057
Wade, can we please talk?

875
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,159
I don't want to talk.

876
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:51,928
I know you don't, but I do.

877
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,097
Then why don't you talk
to your boyfriend about it?

878
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,135
Clint and I
went to school together.

879
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,637
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

880
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,207
I walked in this morning,
guy was fuckin' hittin' on you,

881
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,341
and you were eatin' it up.

882
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,308
Are you kidding me?

883
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,143
No, I'm not kiddin' you, Lucy.

884
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:10,110
You Can't even deny it.

885
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:11,744
Deny it.

886
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:15,681
Clint and I were just
talking, and I'm sorry

887
00:44:15,683 --> 00:44:16,682
if I hurt your feelings.

888
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:17,749
I didn't mean to.

889
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:18,750
Oh.

890
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:21,018
Look, I'm sorry.

891
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,820
But I know neither of us thought
this was how the day

892
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:25,888
was gonna go
when we woke up this morning.

893
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,892
I thought today was gonna go
way different than this.

894
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:31,994
You have no idea.

895
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:35,664
I bought you a ring yesterday,
Lucy.

896
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:38,833
And then I walk in, and I see
you laughing and smiling

897
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:42,002
at that little asshole.

898
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:44,938
And you know what I thought?

899
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,407
I thought, wow,
she looks so pretty

900
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:51,177
when she smiles.

901
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:57,783
How come she never smiles at me
like that?

902
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:00,152
I'll talk to you later, Lucy.

903
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:07,726
And go fuck yourself.

904
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,700
Prognosis is not good.

905
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:19,269
Oh!

906
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:21,371
As you can see,
most of the gray

907
00:45:21,373 --> 00:45:27,176
and white matter has been...
rebekkah, quiet, please.

908
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:29,311
Most of the gray
and white matter has been

909
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,845
severely infected.

910
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:32,913
It's showing the beginning
stages of necroptosis

911
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:34,080
and decomposition.

912
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:36,782
All of these black areas
are basically dead.

913
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:40,719
I mean, they can run, jump, eat,
but they're not human anymore,

914
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:41,786
not really.

915
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:44,722
Once again,
how do you know all this?

916
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,758
I learned all about the brain
when I had a 6-inch spike lodged

917
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,260
in my skull as a child,
which is the reason why

918
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,295
you may have noticed
that sometimes when I'm talking

919
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:53,729
I use the wrong rowboat.

920
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,731
Word.

921
00:45:55,733 --> 00:46:00,402
Now, bacteria Can't cross
the blood/brain barrier.

922
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:05,807
So I'm thinking this is
more likely a virus.

923
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:08,042
What kind of virus
would do that?

924
00:46:08,044 --> 00:46:10,210
A pretty nasty one.

925
00:46:10,212 --> 00:46:12,045
Calvin said that shelley linker
was the first one to bite,

926
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:12,912
right?

927
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:14,013
Yeah.

928
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,148
But what about Clint and tamra?

929
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,182
All it did was make them sick.

930
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:19,250
I have a theory about this.

931
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:21,285
Hold on a moment.

932
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:24,388
Tamra?

933
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,455
Yeah?

934
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:27,957
Have you achieved menses?

935
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,325
What?

936
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:32,961
No, he's, uh, asking you
if you've had your period yet.

937
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:34,529
Um, I really don't wanna say.

938
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,197
You wear a bra, right?

939
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,164
Yeah.

940
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,100
Thank you.

941
00:46:40,102 --> 00:46:43,303
Gave you an "a" in sex ed,
tamra.

942
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:46,272
Little disappointed
you don't know what menses are.

943
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:48,474
Why is sex ed always taught
by the creepiest teachers?

944
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:50,242
Clint, quiet, please.

945
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,044
It seems that the virus is
susceptible to androgens.

946
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:56,347
I mean, the prepubescent body
has testosterone and estrogen.

947
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:59,383
But at puberty, the body's
glands create a feedback cycle

948
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:01,451
that increases the gonadotropins
by about 2.000.

949
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:03,553
Just what are you trying
to say?

950
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,354
Talk like a person.

951
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,788
Please.

952
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,792
The... the virus is only
dangerous is you haven't

953
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,127
gone through puberty.

954
00:47:21,235 --> 00:47:22,968
Was that them?

955
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:23,835
What's going on?

956
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:24,502
How'd they do that?

957
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:25,402
Okay, everyone, stay calm!

958
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:26,269
Calvin.

959
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:27,169
Huh?

960
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:28,436
Oh, shit. Calvin!

961
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:29,570
Calvin!

962
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:30,470
Over here, guys.

963
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,404
Quick, quick, quick!

964
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:32,805
Calvin, wake up.

965
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,106
Wake up, Calvin.

966
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:35,207
Quit slapping me.

967
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:36,908
He needs to eat something.

968
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,310
We need to get him a candy bar
or a soda.

969
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:42,379
Wade, do you have any snack bars
or something?

970
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:43,446
I got creatine powder.

971
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:45,414
Well, he needs something
with sugar.

972
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,882
This body is a no-carb zone.

973
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:49,084
Ah, what was that?

974
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:51,486
Probably one of the demented
children that's been trying

975
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:56,123
it's coming from over there.

976
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,959
They're in the boiler room.

977
00:47:58,961 --> 00:47:59,893
They Can't be.

978
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:00,860
I've checked all these doors.

979
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:01,902
They're... they're locked.

980
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,272
Oh, my God, they have keys!

981
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:17,340
Doug, I thought you said they
couldn't do stuff like that.

982
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:19,342
Oh, they're gonna get in here.

983
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:20,376
We're all gonna die!

984
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:21,310
This Can't be the end.

985
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:22,277
I'm not even published yet.

986
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:23,311
Wade, I've thought about it.

987
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:24,312
I don't think I can marry you.

988
00:48:24,314 --> 00:48:25,946
I'm sorry!

989
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:26,448
Jesus!

990
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:31,518
It's the fucking janitor!

991
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,417
Hatachi?

992
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:33,418
What are you doing here?

993
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,019
The lights are out.

994
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,255
Okay, we gotta move!

995
00:48:38,257 --> 00:48:39,356
Go!

996
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:49,063
Move it! Move it!

997
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:52,032
Watch your step.

998
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:55,001
What the hell?

999
00:48:55,003 --> 00:48:56,035
You live down here?

1000
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:56,935
Yes.

1001
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:57,936
When is this gonna end?

1002
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:58,937
Where are we going?

1003
00:48:58,939 --> 00:48:59,971
Oh, my God.

1004
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:00,972
Where are we?

1005
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:01,973
We have a kid who needs help.

1006
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:03,007
He's diabetic.

1007
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:07,077
Do you have any food?

1008
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,378
Nori.

1009
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,113
Oh, seaweed.

1010
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,114
Oh.

1011
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:12,181
I'm afraid that won't work.

1012
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,215
No.

1013
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,549
Oh.

1014
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,017
Oh, the microwave.

1015
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,085
This is the activation of

1016
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,620
the emergency broadcast system
for the township

1017
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:22,455
of fort chicken, Illinois.

1018
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:26,025
Effective immediately,
the mayor of fort chicken

1019
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:29,028
has announced mandatory
evacuations of neighborhoods

1020
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,896
east of Winslow Avenue.

1021
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:33,031
Authorities are reporting
the spread

1022
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:35,099
of a highly contagious virus.

1023
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:39,136
Reports say...

1024
00:49:39,138 --> 00:49:41,972
We're alone.

1025
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:48,477
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

1026
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:50,979
No. No, We're not.

1027
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:07,695
There's a snack machine
in the teachers lounge, right?

1028
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:10,497
Wade, how many people can fit
in your truck?

1029
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:12,265
I told you,
it's a dual reow weeow...

1030
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:15,601
dual reow...
it's a dual rear wee...

1031
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:16,635
probably eight, Max.

1032
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:17,702
Where are the keys?

1033
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:18,936
Up with my jacket.

1034
00:50:18,938 --> 00:50:26,938
Back in the teachers lounge,
which is impossible to get to.

1035
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,483
Where does that lead?

1036
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:36,318
Conditioning of air.

1037
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,521
So this duct takes us
to the teachers lounge.

1038
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:41,623
Guys, we take the duct
to the lounge.

1039
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,725
We... we get Calvin something
from the vending machine,

1040
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:48,029
we get back here, fix Calvin up,
and take the duct as close to

1041
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:51,098
if We're near the office, we
should grab our cell phones too.

1042
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,232
Right.

1043
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,600
Yeah, but who's going up
into that thing?

1044
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:59,338
Who's teensy-weensy enough
to fit up...

1045
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,439
Me?

1046
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,207
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1047
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:05,076
No, I... no, I-I definitely don't
do brave stuff.

1048
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,011
Like, I've never even been
camping.

1049
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:08,112
Look, I-I have a blog.

1050
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:09,980
I-I get excited about
apple products.

1051
00:51:09,982 --> 00:51:15,684
That's what I'm comfortable
with.

1052
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,386
Here we go.

1053
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:26,359
By letting you guard this,
I'm trusting you

1054
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:27,660
with my entire life.

1055
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:35,767
Circle, circle, dot, dot.

1056
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:39,670
Now you have a cooties shot.

1057
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:41,538
It'll protect you.

1058
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,007
Thanks, tamra.

1059
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:15,502
Remember, Clint, if you fail,
We're all gonna die.

1060
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:19,739
I appreciate the update, Doug.

1061
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:21,774
You're doing great.

1062
00:52:21,776 --> 00:52:23,275
Just trust yourself.

1063
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:25,176
Yeah, and your cock is
girthy, too.

1064
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:26,043
Oh, fuck off, wade.

1065
00:52:26,045 --> 00:52:27,244
You fuck off.

1066
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:28,678
Both of you cut it...
both of you cut it out.

1067
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,146
You know who you sound like?

1068
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,081
You sound like your students.

1069
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,148
I don't have students.

1070
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,416
I'm not a teacher, I'm a writer.

1071
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,418
Yeah, a self-published writer.

1072
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,286
Guess what, I'm self-published,
too.

1073
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,321
Doug, do you wanna buy my book?

1074
00:52:42,223 --> 00:52:43,790
There are no words on this.

1075
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:44,791
You know what?

1076
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:46,492
I'm going, too.

1077
00:52:46,494 --> 00:52:47,526
Lucy, what are you doing?

1078
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:49,661
You Can't...
no! No, you are not!

1079
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:51,896
You Can't do anything
to stop me!

1080
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:55,799
If I wanna go in the fucking
air-conditioning duct, I'll go!

1081
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,568
I'm just gonna die anyway,
just like the rest of you

1082
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,704
assholes, so maybe I'm gonna try
and do something brave

1083
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:06,275
as a final pointless gesture
of kindness in this cruel,

1084
00:53:06,277 --> 00:53:08,377
shitty world
that likes taking gestures

1085
00:53:08,379 --> 00:53:12,581
of kindness and shitting
and peeing on them!

1086
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:18,253
Since You're all gonna be dead
soon anyway, I should tell you,

1087
00:53:18,255 --> 00:53:21,256
I hate every single one of you.

1088
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:36,370
Aah!

1089
00:53:36,372 --> 00:53:41,375
I'm coming with you whether you
like it or not, so shut up.

1090
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:42,576
Okay.

1091
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:44,711
This makes me so nervous.

1092
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:46,979
He paces like this late at night

1093
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:48,914
when he's on the phone, too.

1094
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,682
It's so ridiculous.

1095
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:54,452
How do you know that?

1096
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:56,554
You better not let anything
happen to her, asshole.

1097
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:59,290
That's funny, because I was
thinking of letting

1098
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:00,758
really bad things happen to her.

1099
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,928
I will squeeze up in there
and slap your dick off.

1100
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:07,664
Thanks for coming to help me.

1101
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:09,966
No problem.

1102
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:50,592
I think this is it.

1103
00:56:07,408 --> 00:56:09,708
Careful...

1104
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:24,454
Oh, um...

1105
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:25,755
Do you have a dollar?

1106
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,790
Yeah.

1107
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:35,696
There's wade's keys.

1108
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:40,399
I'm gonna go check and see
if There's a phone.

1109
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:41,466
No, no, no, wait for me.

1110
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:42,700
No, we don't have time.

1111
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:43,834
You get the candy bar.

1112
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:45,435
I'm gonna get a phone.

1113
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:46,736
Okay, be... be careful.

1114
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,770
Yeah.

1115
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,640
Come on.

1116
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:57,810
Come on. Come on.

1117
00:56:57,812 --> 00:56:59,945
Shit!

1118
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,888
Did you get it?

1119
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,192
Did you get it?

1120
00:58:24,194 --> 00:58:25,159
I'm working on it!

1121
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:29,897
Hurry up!

1122
00:58:38,106 --> 00:58:40,473
We're not gonna make it!

1123
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:46,945
Go left!

1124
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:51,916
Guys, heads up!

1125
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:53,150
They did it.

1126
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,618
Hey, look what we got for you.

1127
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:10,064
The desk! The desk!

1128
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:12,633
I don't know how much longer

1129
00:59:12,635 --> 00:59:14,234
I can hold this.

1130
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:16,703
Aah!

1131
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:26,678
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1132
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,545
Miss Hanford!

1133
00:59:27,547 --> 00:59:29,980
Oh!

1134
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:32,549
After the fifth
half-eaten corpse you see,

1135
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:35,218
it's... Still horrifying
but somehow slightly less

1136
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,053
horrifying.

1137
00:59:37,055 --> 00:59:40,088
Shit!

1138
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,592
Guys, look out!

1139
00:59:45,594 --> 00:59:46,626
They're in the vents!

1140
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,928
They're heading your way!

1141
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,764
I'll get the locks.

1142
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:52,865
More stuff, come on.

1143
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:53,899
Here!

1144
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,833
Here.

1145
00:59:54,835 --> 00:59:56,234
Let's go!

1146
00:59:56,236 --> 00:59:58,803
They're coming!

1147
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:00,037
Straps!

1148
01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:03,418
Come on!

1149
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,916
Got it!

1150
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:19,787
Why do they pound?

1151
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:22,022
What does all the pounding
accomplish?

1152
01:00:22,024 --> 01:00:23,123
Are you guys okay?

1153
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,091
Yeah, We're all good.

1154
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:26,192
Thanks for the heads up.

1155
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:27,960
We are not all good!

1156
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,962
We are trapped in here.

1157
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,064
Oh, God, those kids are gonna
come in here.

1158
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,265
They're gonna rip us to shreds.

1159
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:34,699
Tracy, we get it.

1160
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:37,334
You've got to calm down
right now!

1161
01:00:37,336 --> 01:00:39,602
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1162
01:00:39,604 --> 01:00:41,604
I'm... calm!

1163
01:00:41,606 --> 01:00:42,705
I'm fine.

1164
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,740
I'm calm.

1165
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:45,674
Okay.

1166
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,676
Thank you.

1167
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,210
Calm down!

1168
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,845
I'm calm!

1169
01:00:51,847 --> 01:00:54,647
I already said I was calm.

1170
01:00:54,649 --> 01:01:02,221
This is, like,
the worst Monday ever.

1171
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:23,007
This probably isn't

1172
01:01:29,113 --> 01:01:34,750
the greatest timing,
but I have a confession to make.

1173
01:01:34,752 --> 01:01:37,619
When I saw you this morning,
I was only pretending

1174
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,287
to be surprised.

1175
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:41,722
I knew you taught here.

1176
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:47,761
Wait, really?

1177
01:01:47,763 --> 01:01:50,830
I've been
pretty depressed lately,

1178
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,133
and I just wanted to see you.

1179
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:55,300
It... it's stupid.

1180
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:57,235
I mean, we... we haven't had
a conversation in,

1181
01:01:57,237 --> 01:02:02,673
I guess I kinda missed you
somehow.

1182
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,074
Sorry, that's... that's so creepy.

1183
01:02:04,076 --> 01:02:05,175
No.

1184
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:07,110
It's not creepy.

1185
01:02:07,112 --> 01:02:12,348
I heard you were in New York
following your dream

1186
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:15,317
of being a writer.

1187
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:21,089
Oh, well, I have
another confession to make.

1188
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:25,293
Remember when I-I said
I-I wasn't a teacher?

1189
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,094
That was a lie, too.

1190
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:29,863
That's what I was doing
in New York.

1191
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:30,365
Really?

1192
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:35,767
Yeah.

1193
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:43,040
Yeah, I've been teaching
first grade for two years.

1194
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:46,109
I mean, I thought
I would have free time to write,

1195
01:02:46,111 --> 01:02:49,078
on my free time,
but as it turns out,

1196
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,179
there is no free time.

1197
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:52,848
Teaching's the hardest job

1198
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,149
in the world.

1199
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:57,452
And I would
look out at the kids

1200
01:02:57,454 --> 01:03:01,022
in my class,
and I-I found myself getting

1201
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,157
jealous of them.

1202
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:07,361
They have the whole world
ahead of them.

1203
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:08,462
Their whole lives ahead of them.

1204
01:03:08,464 --> 01:03:10,430
They have all these
opportunities

1205
01:03:10,432 --> 01:03:14,867
that have already passed me by.

1206
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:17,903
Mm... what?

1207
01:03:17,905 --> 01:03:20,472
Nothing, I was... Gonna tell
you you were wrong,

1208
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:22,140
but you sort of have a point.

1209
01:03:22,142 --> 01:03:23,040
Oh.

1210
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,941
That's super comforting.

1211
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:26,008
Thanks.

1212
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,143
Oh!

1213
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:49,463
I prob... I probably shouldn't
have done that.

1214
01:03:49,465 --> 01:03:53,066
I-I Can't just barge into
your life like that.

1215
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:55,968
Even if I do kind of hate
your boyfriend.

1216
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:59,805
Just need a bottle of wine.

1217
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,206
Right?

1218
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,741
One of those backpacks
must have some beer in it.

1219
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:06,477
Definitely ritalin,
probably Adderall, too.

1220
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:06,979
Wait.

1221
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,120
There's still so much
I haven't done.

1222
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:22,357
Like... like I've always wanted
to fire an uzi.

1223
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,892
I don't know.

1224
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,195
I wanted a bunny.

1225
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,931
I always wanted a bunny
growing up

1226
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,098
and never got one.

1227
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,101
You know what I want?

1228
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,203
I wanna know why
my brother-in-law

1229
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,404
makes tens times what I do.

1230
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:40,240
And you know what he does
for a living?

1231
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:43,343
He makes giant foam fingers
for football games.

1232
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:45,411
Like, you tell people
You're a teacher,

1233
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:47,479
and they look at you like,
"oh, you must have wanted to do

1234
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,481
something else and you couldn't
get anything going."

1235
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,416
And it's like, "fuck you, man."

1236
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:54,152
I'm raising your kids."

1237
01:04:54,154 --> 01:04:58,355
I love my job,
and teachers deserve respect.

1238
01:04:58,357 --> 01:04:59,889
Yeah.

1239
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:02,958
I'm sorry that it took me
till today to realize this,

1240
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,261
but...

1241
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:09,897
I really actually like you guys.

1242
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:15,969
I always wanted to have sex
with a prostitute

1243
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:18,671
who was nonwhite.

1244
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:21,273
Is anybody there?

1245
01:05:21,275 --> 01:05:24,309
Wade?

1246
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,376
Hey.

1247
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:26,577
You okay?

1248
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:28,045
Yeah.

1249
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:31,181
Hey, listen, Lucy,
about today...

1250
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:34,184
wade, we can talk about this
another time.

1251
01:05:34,186 --> 01:05:36,486
Let's not talk about this
right now.

1252
01:05:36,488 --> 01:05:37,520
No, I wanna talk about it.

1253
01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:39,188
Lucy, I love you.

1254
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:43,225
And I'm so sorry
that I was an asshole today.

1255
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:44,659
Clint's not listening, is he?

1256
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:48,996
No, it's just me.

1257
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:53,700
'Cause look, I know You're not
crazy about your hometown.

1258
01:05:53,702 --> 01:05:56,669
Okay, and this is probably not
what you pictured growing up,

1259
01:05:56,671 --> 01:06:00,139
that you'd be dating
some p. E. Teacher.

1260
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:03,609
And I guess I just got jealous
that some fancy pants New York

1261
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,043
writer was gonna swoop in and...

1262
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,277
No, wait!

1263
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:10,014
To live there, and I just don't
know that that's something

1264
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:11,615
that I can ever...
wade, it's Clint.

1265
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:12,616
Goddamn it, asshole!

1266
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:13,683
Put Lucy back on.

1267
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:15,718
I'm not a fancy writer
from New York.

1268
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,586
I'm a bad writer
from fort chicken.

1269
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:20,555
I sleep in a bed
I used to pee in.

1270
01:06:20,557 --> 01:06:23,090
You're a handsome guy
who Lucy likes.

1271
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:25,325
And if you guys are meant
to be together,

1272
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:26,459
I'm all for it.

1273
01:06:26,461 --> 01:06:27,526
I'm sorry I got in the way.

1274
01:06:27,528 --> 01:06:29,594
You really think

1275
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,600
I'm a handsome guy?

1276
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:40,971
Listen, thanks, Clint.

1277
01:06:40,973 --> 01:06:43,473
Just...

1278
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:45,508
Can you put Lucy back on,
please?

1279
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:49,478
Wade, I love you, but I...

1280
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,313
Lucy, I... wade, it's me again.

1281
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:52,547
Goddamn it!

1282
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:53,414
I have an idea.

1283
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,449
Listen up.

1284
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:03,489
Oh, dear lord.

1285
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:05,624
Is the coast clear?

1286
01:07:05,626 --> 01:07:09,327
If by clear, you mean
filled with terrifying imagery

1287
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:13,230
that will take me
years of therapy to unsee...

1288
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:14,564
Hey!

1289
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:17,466
Hey, sweetie!

1290
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:21,369
Put those drugs down.

1291
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,403
Look! Drugs!

1292
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,670
Are you hungry for some drugs?

1293
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,104
You want some ritalin?

1294
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:26,205
Some Adderall?

1295
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,573
You remember how

1296
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,644
in that movie<i> commando</i>
and every other

1297
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:34,779
'80s action film,
there was that

1298
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:36,580
suiting up montage?

1299
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:39,182
Well, this is that scene.

1300
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,349
Yeah.

1301
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,451
Now, they've got us
outnumbered, outgunned,

1302
01:07:42,453 --> 01:07:44,719
and out...

1303
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:48,789
But There's one thing we have
that they don't...

1304
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,658
the drive to win!

1305
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,760
They seem very driven to me.

1306
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:56,262
We need to turn this room

1307
01:07:56,264 --> 01:07:57,463
inside out.

1308
01:07:57,465 --> 01:08:01,033
Look under every shelf,
inside every box.

1309
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,635
Gather anything you
or someone else can use.

1310
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:05,570
We gotta collect everything.

1311
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:10,241
We gotta have bats and tools
and ropes and pointy things,

1312
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:14,144
anything that has a spike on it,
anything that's serrated.

1313
01:08:14,146 --> 01:08:16,379
We're not playing defense
anymore.

1314
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:18,748
Our third and fourth graders,
you can forget about them.

1315
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,684
So forget who you think
You're fighting,

1316
01:08:21,686 --> 01:08:23,619
'cause We're going to war!

1317
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:25,754
I used to be a champion!

1318
01:08:25,756 --> 01:08:27,555
I'm a little fatter now.

1319
01:08:27,557 --> 01:08:32,759
Yeah, I'm a little balder, too,
but I still got that spirit.

1320
01:08:32,761 --> 01:08:35,695
And they are not taking that
away from me!

1321
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:39,799
I played dodgeball a million

1322
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:42,334
times with these little shits.

1323
01:08:42,336 --> 01:08:43,835
Go for the face.

1324
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:47,705
It's the weak spot.

1325
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,106
Huh.

1326
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:52,442
I guess they really can overdose
on that stuff.

1327
01:08:52,444 --> 01:08:54,377
Okay, looks like the Adderall

1328
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:57,279
they should be knocked out
for a while.

1329
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,414
Remember, when we say "go",
we rendezvous in the main hall,

1330
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,849
head straight for the back door,
then haul ass for wade's truck.

1331
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:03,851
Are you guys ready?

1332
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:05,452
We are good to go.

1333
01:09:05,454 --> 01:09:07,187
We can do this.

1334
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:11,424
Between us, we've got 18
regional championship trophies,

1335
01:09:11,426 --> 01:09:16,128
three mvps,
and one state championship ring.

1336
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,096
Wade, those are all
your awards.

1337
01:09:18,098 --> 01:09:20,364
Exactly,
and I'm a part of this team.

1338
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:23,266
That makes us all champions!

1339
01:09:23,268 --> 01:09:24,767
Now, are we ready?

1340
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:25,634
Ready!

1341
01:09:25,636 --> 01:09:26,234
Ready.

1342
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:27,134
I'm gay.

1343
01:09:27,136 --> 01:09:28,268
Oh! I fucking knew it.

1344
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:31,704
Hatachi, you ready?

1345
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:33,806
Yes, hatachi ready to die.

1346
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:37,876
My father told me story once,
story of frog and caterpillar.

1347
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:41,145
It was winter,
and frog is sitting on

1348
01:09:41,147 --> 01:09:43,280
snow-covered branch.

1349
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:45,548
The frog looked and saw
the caterpillar and ask him...

1350
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,583
okay, this story is taking
way too long.

1351
01:09:47,585 --> 01:09:48,584
Let's play some dodgeball!

1352
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:50,619
Hey, guys.

1353
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:24,915
Okay, I got this.

1354
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:28,184
Uhh!

1355
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:31,153
Come on.

1356
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:08,250
Aah!

1357
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,691
Fuck yeah! Let's go!

1358
01:11:17,693 --> 01:11:18,591
Go! Go!

1359
01:11:18,593 --> 01:11:20,192
Move it!

1360
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:21,193
Let's go!

1361
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:22,894
Come on!

1362
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,231
Damn it, I'm out of balls!

1363
01:11:31,536 --> 01:11:32,148
Oh, shit.

1364
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:40,709
Ha!

1365
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:48,949
Ah!

1366
01:12:03,697 --> 01:12:04,797
Rock 'n' roll!

1367
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,011
Aah!

1368
01:12:20,013 --> 01:12:22,313
Lucy! Where's Lucy?

1369
01:12:22,315 --> 01:12:23,314
I don't know!

1370
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:26,684
Aah!

1371
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,790
Come on! Come on!

1372
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:34,292
Aah!

1373
01:12:39,764 --> 01:12:41,029
You motherfuckers!

1374
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:11,752
Clint,
take me to subway sometime.

1375
01:13:16,765 --> 01:13:17,930
Aah!

1376
01:13:17,932 --> 01:13:20,065
Give her the keys!

1377
01:13:21,967 --> 01:13:24,868
Get those kids to the truck!

1378
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,035
Move!

1379
01:13:26,037 --> 01:13:27,503
Go, go, go, go!

1380
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:29,872
Get out of here!

1381
01:13:37,314 --> 01:13:39,047
Get in! Get in!

1382
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:48,956
Hah! Hah!

1383
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,591
Hey, Danielle steel!

1384
01:13:53,927 --> 01:13:56,028
Take care of her.

1385
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,095
Aaaah!

1386
01:13:57,097 --> 01:14:01,665
No!

1387
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,599
No, Lucy, no!

1388
01:14:02,601 --> 01:14:03,466
Wade!

1389
01:14:03,468 --> 01:14:06,502
Hah! Ahh!

1390
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:14,943
Wade!

1391
01:14:14,945 --> 01:14:16,978
Oh, no! No!

1392
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:23,484
Aah! Aah!

1393
01:14:31,692 --> 01:14:33,092
No, we gotta go!

1394
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,626
We gotta go! Go!

1395
01:14:34,628 --> 01:14:35,627
Get in!

1396
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:37,628
Oh, my God!

1397
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,164
Wade! Oh!

1398
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:44,233
Aah!

1399
01:14:44,235 --> 01:14:45,634
No!

1400
01:14:45,636 --> 01:14:48,136
Lucy, I'm sorry.

1401
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:23,637
What about these kids' parents?

1402
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:27,140
What about our parents?

1403
01:15:36,883 --> 01:15:39,618
Oh, shit.

1404
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,853
What?

1405
01:15:41,855 --> 01:15:43,855
We're almost out of... aah!

1406
01:15:48,094 --> 01:15:50,527
Get him off!

1407
01:15:58,135 --> 01:16:01,970
He must have been in the back

1408
01:16:01,972 --> 01:16:09,972
oh, my God, what is he doing?

1409
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:14,147
Ram him!

1410
01:16:18,652 --> 01:16:21,186
Eat a cock.

1411
01:16:28,194 --> 01:16:30,894
Uhh... Eh...

1412
01:16:33,097 --> 01:16:35,698
Well, that ought to do it.

1413
01:16:43,339 --> 01:16:44,906
Guys, up ahead.

1414
01:16:44,908 --> 01:16:46,173
It's Danville.

1415
01:16:46,175 --> 01:16:49,609
Danville is the worst place
on the planet.

1416
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:57,611
At least it's not fort chicken.

1417
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:07,625
Oh, my God!

1418
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:21,271
Well, I'd feel worse
if all these dead people

1419
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:23,973
weren't from fucking Danville.

1420
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:38,279
Well, now We're really
out of gas.

1421
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:43,323
Everybody stay close.

1422
01:17:54,301 --> 01:17:55,734
Wait, Where's Doug?

1423
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:58,036
There he is.

1424
01:17:58,038 --> 01:17:59,837
Doug, come on!

1425
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:02,339
No, you come here.

1426
01:18:09,046 --> 01:18:11,080
They're everywhere.

1427
01:18:17,086 --> 01:18:19,320
Well, that's Indiana.

1428
01:18:19,322 --> 01:18:22,089
That's Ohio.

1429
01:18:22,091 --> 01:18:23,924
It's an epidemic.

1430
01:18:23,926 --> 01:18:26,026
Actually, the correct term
is pandemic.

1431
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:28,762
A pandemic covers a much wider
geographical...

1432
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:34,066
that's the fort chicken
factory.

1433
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:36,101
Is there anything
from that factory served

1434
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:37,902
in the school cafeteria?

1435
01:18:37,904 --> 01:18:39,403
The chicken nuggets.

1436
01:18:39,405 --> 01:18:41,738
Of course, a foodborne virus.

1437
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,407
If I could get a handful
of homing endonucleases,

1438
01:18:44,409 --> 01:18:46,275
each one targeting a different
specific section of the genome...

1439
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:48,242
You're doing it again.

1440
01:18:48,244 --> 01:18:50,410
Rebekkah, quiet please.

1441
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:53,312
You see, that time
I was actually talking.

1442
01:18:53,314 --> 01:18:55,981
If we could isolate the virus
and kill it while preserving

1443
01:18:55,983 --> 01:18:58,016
the capsid protein...
Doug, please dumb it down

1444
01:18:58,018 --> 01:18:59,183
a little.

1445
01:18:59,185 --> 01:19:00,984
If I could find
one of the infected nuggets,

1446
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,118
