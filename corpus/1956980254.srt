00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,966
[ sighs ] WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR PJs ON?

211
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,966

00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:16,100
- WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING WITH?
- WELL, THIS IS BOBBY.

213
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,633

- HONEY, HE'S FILTHY.

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,833
YES, BUT HE'S NOT FILTHY
ON THE INSIDE.

217
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,966
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE IS
ON THE INSIDE, HONEY.

218
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:29,800
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO ARGUE WITH YOU, OKAY.

219
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,566
IT'S TOO LATE.

00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,533
WELL, WHY WERE YOU MAD
AT DINNER TONIGHT?

222
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,833
I WASN'T MAD AT DINNER.
WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THAT?

223
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,466
WELL, YOU WEREN'T HAPPY.

OKAY.
IT'S NOT THAT I WAS MAD.

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,800
CARRIE JUST DOES THINGS A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY TO HOW WE DO,

227
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,633
AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT.

228
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,066

I KNOW,
BUT THAT'S CARRIE.

00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,300
THAT'S THE WAY SHE'S GROWN UP.

THE SPIRIT WILL REALIZE
WHAT'S HAPPENED

AND HE'S TRAPPED IN
A CERTAIN LOCATION.

727

OF THEIR OWN DEATH.
