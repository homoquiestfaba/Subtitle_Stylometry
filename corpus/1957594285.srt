00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,700
(intense music)

5
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,067
- Ow!

00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,833
(computer beeps)

7
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,800

 Game.

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,367
(sighs)

9
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,900
Come on.

10
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,833
Come on. (computer beeps)

11
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,300
Yes.

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,133
(energetic drum music)

13
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's go, let's go.

14
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,733
Alright.

15
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,633
(breathes heavily)

16
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,133
Come on, come on,
 come on, come on,

00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,633
come on, come on, come on.

(dramatic music)

24
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:25,933
- What a joy.

25
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,267
Now I am gonna have some fun.

26
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,533

00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,233
(loud typing)

28
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,467
- Valerie, are you home?

29
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,167
I hope, I hope.

30
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,500
(water lapping)

31
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,067
- [Voiceover] You
 have a call, Valerie.

32
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:42,867
- Who is it?

33
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,367
- [Voiceover] Andrew.

34
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,233
(loud beep)

35
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,500
- Hello Andrew,
 aren't you supposed

36
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,067
to be in bed or something?

37
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,333
(chuckles)

38
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,367
- No, I just had to talk to you

39
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,933
before I went to sleep.

40
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,367
(chuckles)

41
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,433
- Well it's nice to know
 that I'm so important to you.

42
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,600
- Yeah, I really like
 our little chats.

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,933
I wonder what we'd say if
 we met for real some time.

44
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,833
- Well, I'm sure
 we will eventually.

45
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,333
What are you doing for real?

46
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,600
- Oh, just finishing
 a term paper

47
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,967
for Mr. Anderson's
 Science class.

48
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,267
- Your favorite teacher?

49
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,500
- Bingo.

50
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,067
This report should
 knock his socks off,

51
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,067
soon as he learns how to
 read, that is. (chuckles)

52
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,233
Is that a new office,
 that looks different?

53
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,833
- New job, I know
 you gonna like it.

54
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,667
- Me, why?

55
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,067
What is it?

56
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,700
- I'm a new game designer
 at KL Interactive.

57
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,300
- Wow, right on!

58
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,933
- And I'm sure I can use
 some of your expert help.

59
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,400
- You really think
 I'm an expert?

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,167
- Listen, I've got
 a demo of the game.

61
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,767
I'd like to send it
 to and maybe you can

62
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,833
take a look at it for me.

63
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,367
- You bet.

64
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,567
But I can't tonight, I'm dead
 if I don't finish this report.

65
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,933
- Oh, yes, high school.

66
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,567
Well, maybe I'll
 send it to you later.

67
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,767
Bye for now.

68
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,267
(loud computer beep)

69
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:51,067
- See you later,
 alligator. (loud chirping)

70
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,733
(water lapping)

71
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
(sighs)

72
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,067
(loud beep)

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,867
(dramatic music)

74
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,467
(loud beeping)

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,500
(loud chirping)

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
(alarm clock rings)

77
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,700
(dog barks)

78
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
Oh.

79
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,967
(loud ringing)

80
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:35,800
Yes!

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,567
(loud beeping)

82
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,733
Valerie, you are the best.

83
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,600
(dog barks)

84
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,067
(chuckles) Oops.

85
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,200
Thanks, Rocky.

86
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,067
- Morning, Einstein.

87
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,700
- Thanks, Super Mom.

88
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,100
Gotta run.

89
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,133
Late for butthead's class.

90
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,900
- Andrew, really.

91
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,067
- Sorry mom, Mr. Butthead.

92
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,533
(Rocky barks)

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,600
- Good catch.

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,300
(laughs)

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,067
- Rocky, you know you're
not allowed on campus.

96
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:21,900
(Rocky barks)

97
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,167
Woof back.

98
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,633
You know perfectly
 well I had to redo

99
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,733
the entire cafeteria after
 your little incident.

100
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:27,667
(Rocky barks)

101
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,567
Yes, I know you were framed,

102
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,067
but you know the rules.

103
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:35,567
Stay out of trouble, I'll
 see you after school.

104
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,567
(happy music)

105
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,133
Good mornin', Pop.

106
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:43,400
- Have you ever seen a
more marvelous mailbox?

107
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,167
- It is special, alright.

108
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,300
It's the most marvelous mailbox

109
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,733
in the whole neighborhood.

110
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,067
- I wanna get a first
 coat of paint on,

111
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,300
before we leave for Aunt Edna's.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,600
You sure you don't
 wanna come to dinner?

113
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,967
- Yeah, Pasadena, Pop.

114
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,633
By the way, you missed a spot.

115
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,067
Careful, you painted the top.

116
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,300
(optimistic rock music)

117
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,533
(bell rings)

118
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,100
Ah, think I'm late.

119
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,933
- Oops.

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,433
Did I bump into you?

121
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,633
- No man, listen,
alright, it's my fault.

122
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,833
Gotta go to school.

123
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,867
- Late for school?

124
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:36,133
Sounds like a personal problem.

125
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,833
Maybe too much studying.

126
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,600
- Hey, you should
 try it some time.

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
I thought you were expelled.

128
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,667
- Yeah, clever, huh?

129
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,067
I figured this is the one place

130
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,633
my parole officer
 wouldn't find me.

131
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,667
(Andrew laughs)

132
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,133
- Hey listen, I'd love
to sit and chat with you

133
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,367
and your honor students here,

134
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,267
but I got run, alright?

135
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,667
(laughter)

136
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,333
(birds singing)

137
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,333
Now I'm really late.

138
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,300
- Take the gum
 out of your mouth.

139
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,333
Please try to stay awake.

140
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,167
Mr. Henderson.

141
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Hm, too bad.

142
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,067
Mr. Williams.

143
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:26,967
- Yes, sir.

144
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,800
Ready, sir.

145
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,433
- I don't know
 whether to read this

146
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,533
or look at it
 under a microscope.

147
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:40,700
- (chuckles) Good
 one, Mr. Anderson.

148
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,133
(loud bang on table)

149
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,100
- I especially like the mustard
stain on the front cover.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,333
Nice touch.

151
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,300
- (chuckles) That's
 not just any mustard,

152
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,967
that's gourmet mustard.

153
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,300
(class laughs)

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,067
Only the best for you, sir.

155
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,067
(chuckles mockingly)

156
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,067
(loud rapid footsteps)

157
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,067
- Oh, Mr. Anderson.

158
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,700
(dramatic music)

159
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,200
Morning, sir.

160
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,700
(happy music)

161
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,900
- Nice manoeuvre, Andrew.

162
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
(Andrew chuckles)

163
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,167
(moves into dramatic music)

164
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,533
- Did we forget
 something, Mr. Henderson?

165
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,700
- No, no, it's right here.

166
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,233
- What's this?

167
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,133
Can't be a term paper.

168
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:32,167
No, I distinctly remember saying

169
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,333
no term papers would
 be accepted late.

170
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,733
- That's not fair!

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,733
- Perhaps you'd like
an F on your own paper?

172
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,767
Hm?

173
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,600
Maybe yes?

174
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,333
Maybe no?

175
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,033
Maybe yes?

176
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,667
Maybe no?

177
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,667
I'll take that as a no.

178
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,567
We really want that
 scholarship to MIT, don't we?

179
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,900
(sad music)

180
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,933
Your parents will be very proud.

181
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,767
(laughter)

182
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,433
(ominous music)

183
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,067
(loud chirping)

184
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,233
- Anderson is such a jerk.

185
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,467
- Whatever.

186
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,267
- Yeah, that will
 teach him, Cat.

187
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,067
- That's Catherine, Gary.

188
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,467
- Oh, yeah, right, Catherine.

189
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,467
How can you be so
 cool about this?

190
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,833
Aa, even if I tried,
 which I don't,

191
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,567
but if I wanted to and did,

192
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,100
I'd still get an F.

193
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,467
I mean, you deserve an A on
 your paper, I guarantee it.

194
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:36,667
- How do you know that?

195
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,433
- I mean you're smart,
 you're real smart,

196
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,433
you're, you're like a
 genius or something.

197
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,767
- How do you know
 how smart I am?

198
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,900
- Hey man, I'm an expert.

199
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,267
I cheat off you.
 (laughs nervously)

200
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,467
Yet if it weren't for you,

201
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,367
I'd have trouble
 keeping my D average.

202
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,800
(bell rings)

203
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,067
- You've gotta care about it.

204
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,633
- I don't.

205
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:09,067
- What about getting
 into a good school?

206
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:09,967
- I'm just thinking about going

207
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,667
right into the private sector.

208
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:14,100
I already have a consultant
 job with KL Interactive.

209
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,567
- KL Interactive?

210
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,433
That's one of the top
 think tanks in the world.

211
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,700
- Yep.

212
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,067
- I bet I how he
 got the job, too.

213
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,233
- How?

214
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,133
- Through his online girlfriend.

215
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,400
- Online girlfriend?

216
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,433
Do I know her?

217
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,600
- Doubtful.

218
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,733
She's an older
 woman, college girl.

219
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,900
Your basic game designer
supermodel type.

220
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,833
- (sighs) The whole package.

221
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,067
- Ah, she sent me a prototype

222
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,200
of a new game
 called Mind Chaser.

223
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,333
- Mind Chaser?

224
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,500
- The cool.
 - [Gary] Excellent.

225
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,800
- [Andrew] Yeah.
 - And when do we play?

226
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,100
How about tonight after school?

227
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,067
- Yeah, why not?

228
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,567
How about you, Cat,
 you wanna come over

229
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,533
and give this new game a try?

230
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:53,867
- It's Catherine and
 I wouldn't miss it.

231
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,567
- Basketball?

232
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,400
- Yeah.

233
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,600
(sad romantic music)

234
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,200
- So this is the famous mailbox?

235
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,667
(light playful music)

236
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,467
- Yeah, it's hard to believe
 my dad ever had a life.

237
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,667
(Catherine laughs)

238
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,933
- Nice mailbox.

239
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,300
- Thank you, nice bike.

240
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,200
- Hey thanks, I
 fixed it up myself.

241
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:29,967
(Gary sighs)

242
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,767
Being an adult is
 so embarrassing.

243
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,467
- [Mr. Anderson]
 Hey, about a hand?

244
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,900
(loud clapping)
(Andrew cheers)

245
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,267
- I'm sorry, Dad.

246
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,633
I got so excited I'm not going

247
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,067
to Aunt Edna's, I forgot myself.

248
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,733
- If it were up to me, I'd
 be staying home myself.

249
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,833
- Yeah, looks like the mailbox

250
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,400
needs another coat of paint.

251
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,700
- Really?

252
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,533
- Honey, stop looking
 at the mailbox,

253
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,933
you're gonna go blind.

254
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,100
Hi Cat.

255
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,133
- I prefer Catherine,
 Mrs. Henderson.

256
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,400
- I like your new
 haircut, looks nice,

257
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I used to wear my hair that way.

258
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,667
Who's this?

259
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,733
- Gary Williams, at your
service, Mrs. Henderson.

260
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,967
No job to low for me to go.

261
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,800
- Well, how charming.

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,400
Well, there's food
 in the freezer

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,700
if you can figure out how
 to work the microwave.

264
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,133
I'm just kidding.

265
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,133
And what else?

266
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,267
- No parties!

267
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,267
- Thank you.

268
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,133
- Not even the Republican Party?

269
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,900
(engine revving)

270
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,433
- Bye.

271
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,567
(water lapping)

272
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,733
(dramatic music)

273
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:38,067
(loud keyboard typing)

274
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,733
(moves into ominous scary music)

275
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,367
(Valerie loses breath in terror)

276
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,600
- (sighs) You startled me.

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
- Sorry.

278
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,733
I love what you're
 doing with the game.

279
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,467
It's so lifelike.

280
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,067
So real.

281
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,800
- You ever play your games?

282
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,533
- Not anymore.

283
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,267
I used to, but
 then I got hooked.

284
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,733
On bigger game. (laughs)

285
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,567
Keep up the good work.

286
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,200
(loud chirping)

287
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,533
- Gotta dig your crib, bro.

288
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,800
- Yeah, thanks.

289
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,433
- Hey, what's this?

290
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,667
Your retainer?

291
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,600
- Yeah, be careful
 with that, alright?

292
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,467
It's a Waldo, I built that.

293
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,667
- Say what?

294
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,200
- It's a digital facial
telemetry interface.

295
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,500
- Oh, yeah, awesome.

296
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,667
Aa, what does that mean?

297
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,733
- Watch this.

298
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,900
(loud computer beep)

299
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:59,467
(high pitch undulating music)

300
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:01,733
Hello, my name is Rocky.

301
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,433
(Rocky barks)

302
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,833
How are you?

303
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,933
(Rocky barks)

304
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,067
- Wow.

305
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,733
Rocky, I'm doing great.

306
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,300
- Righteous.

307
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,733
Hello, Cat.

308
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,067
You're looking
 mighty pretty today.

309
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,733
Want a big wet kiss?

310
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,300
- Any time, Rocky, any time.

311
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,533
- Hey, speaking of games,
 how about Mind Chaser?

312
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,267
- Yeah, Mind Chaser.

313
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,700
- Mind Chaser it is.

314
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,833
(loud beep)
 (loud thunder)

315
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,733
- It says you need a KL
 Interactive VR Game Interface.

316
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,267
- Got three right here,

317
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:35,300
they're practically givin' 'em
 away at all the video stores.

318
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,533
(loud chirping)
(Rocky barks)

319
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,533
- Girlfriend, you are good.

320
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,267
- I am good, and I'm
 not your girlfriend.

321
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,667
(loud beeps)
 - Ouch.

322
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,933
- But if Andrew's
 looking I might consider,

323
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:46,933
or maybe not.

324
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,133
(loud explosion)
(Andrew screams)

325
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,067
(Rocky barks)

326
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,067
Darn.

327
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:50,933
- Ha ha.

328
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,300
You have your four seconds.

329
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,467
- Yeah, but the
 game keeps crashing

330
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,467
at the same point,
right when it gets good.

331
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:56,400
- Can you fix it?

332
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
- I don't know, my computer's

333
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
just not strong
 enough to handle it.

334
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,200
- It's a sloppy craftsman
 who blames his tools.

335
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,767
- I can't figure it out.

336
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,867
- Well maybe your
 friend, Valerie,

337
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,200
can help us out.

338
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,567
- I'll call her.

339
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,133
(loud ringing)

340
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,567
- (sighs) Problem is gotta be

341
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,167
with one of these
 original master disks.

342
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,400
- [Voiceover] Sorry,
 no one available.

343
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,933
Do you wish to leave
 a virtual message?

344
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,700
- Yes I do.

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,267
One second, please.

346
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,667
(palms snap loudly)
 Valerie, hi, hi you doin'?

347
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,900
Andrew here.

348
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,933
Uhm, listen, Mind
 Chaser's a great game,

349
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,833
I'm lovin' it, but I can't seem

350
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,900
to get past the
 problems with it.

351
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,233
Aa, I don't think my
 system's strong enough

352
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,467
to handle it, and
 what I think I need

353
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:44,867
is access to a really,
 really hot mainframe.

354
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,067
I was wonderin' if
 you could do it.

355
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,533
Uhm, so I hope to see you soon.

356
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:51,533
Bye. (loud beeps)

357
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,633
- Oh, well, I've
 got to split anyway.

358
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:12,800
- [Voiceover] Good
 evening, Valerie,

359
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,567
you have a virtual message.

360
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,500
- From whom?

361
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,567
- [Voiceover] From Andrew.

362
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,167
- Fire it up.

363
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,100
(loud beeps)

364
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,633
- Valerie, Andrew here.

365
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,333
Uhm, listen, Mind Chaser's
 a really great game,

366
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,200
and I'm lovin' it,
 but I can't seem

367
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,400
to get past the
 problems with it.

368
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,233
What I really need is access
 to a really hot mainframe,

369
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:33,200
and I was wondering
 if you could do it.

370
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,067
Uhm, I hope to see you soon.

371
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,533
Bye.

372
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,967
(loud typing)

373
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,233
- Well, if Simon wants his game

374
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,767
to be finished quickly,

375
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,333
I'm gonna have to give
 Andrew a little help.

376
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,300
Send computer tie in for US
 Government research computer,

377
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,533
all access pass.

378
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:49,867
- [Voiceover] Access
 code required.

379
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,300
(loud typing)
Access granted.

380
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,967
(loud typing)

381
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,333
- Hello, Andrew.

382
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,300
I'm sending you a direct
backdoor Ethernet access

383
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,400
to a very powerful mainframe.

384
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,633
I hope it helps.

385
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,867
Good luck, handsome.

386
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,467
(loud beeping)

387
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,833
(ominous music)

388
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,233
That's pretty weird.

389
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:19,467
US Military developing
 game technology?

390
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,067
- [Voiceover] You have
 entered a secure disk.

391
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,767
You will need top security
 access codes to enter.

392
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,600
(loud typing)

393
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Code accepted, welcome
 to Project Quest.

394
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,067
- Let's see what
 secrets you hold.

395
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,567
- It looks like
 we got mice again.

396
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,900
- It's a weapon.

397
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,167
We're developing a weapon.

398
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,933
(dramatic music)

399
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:06,467
Andrew.

400
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,967
(loud typing)

401
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,633
- [Voiceover] Terminal
 still occupied.

402
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,133
Do you wish to send a
delayed visual message?

403
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:14,967
- Yes.

404
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,833
Andrew, stop playing
 with the game,

405
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,033
destroy all copies, it's
very, very dangerous.

406
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,033
My life my be in danger.

407
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,700
- Working late, Val?

408
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,533
I think you may
 have dropped this.

409
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,500
Oh, my.

410
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,533
What have we found?

411
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,833
- This is a military
 weapon, not a game.

412
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,833
- War is a game, in a way.

413
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,000
I told you I still play games,

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,867
just on a bigger playing field.

415
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,200
- You disgust me.

416
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,333
- I'm sorry to hear that.

417
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,067
I was hoping we could become
 good friends and colleagues,

418
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,800
but that doesn't alter the fact

419
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,700
that this game must
 finish on time.

420
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,600
- Well you can
 finish it without me.

421
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,133
- I think you misunderstand me.

422
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,933
You're not gonna like
 our retirement plan.

423
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,600
(loud chirping)

424
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:21,967
(loud beep)

425
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:22,800
- Hm?

426
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
(computer beeps)

427
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,867
Yeah right, Valerie did it.

428
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,133
- Did what?

429
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,133
- She tied us into a
 government computer.

430
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,800
All right, wait till I tell Cat.

431
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,867
(loud chirping)

432
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,533
- So we waitin' on an
 invitation or what?

433
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,400
Are you gonna get this
 game up and running?

434
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,500
- Patience,

435
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,333
the product of public education.

436
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,367
My genius, and Cat's planning,

437
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,733
we should have it up in no time.

438
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:52,967
(loud typing)

439
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,733
- This computer is
 amazing, it's so fast.

440
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,700
What exactly did
this Valerie do?

441
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,533
- She tied me into a
 government computer.

442
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,067
- (sighs) No wonder you
like her, connections.

443
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:06,167
- Yeah, you should see
 what she looks like.

444
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,067
- Why not?

445
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,600
- Hello, Andrew, I'm sending
 you a direct backdoor

446
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,167
Ethernet access to a
very powerful mainframe.

447
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,233
Hope it helps.

448
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,633
Good luck, handsome.

449
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,967
- Ha, wow, what a fox.

450
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:22,067
- (sighs) I think
 I'm gonna barf.

451
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,533
Just kidding.

452
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,067
(Rocky whimpers)

453
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,633
(loud computer beeps)
 What's this?

454
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,267
- It's an encrypted message.

455
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,200
- Encrypted, you mean
 like Tales from the Crypt,

456
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,467
like zombies and stuff?

457
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,833
- You're the zombie.

458
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,367
This is code, like spy stuff.

459
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,600
- No kiddin'.

460
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
- I don't really know
this kind of encryption.

461
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,567
- Let's try the mainframe thing,

462
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,900
see if that can open the file.

463
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,067
(fun music)
 (loud buzz)

464
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:50,500
I mean, if you guys
 think that's a good idea.

465
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
- Might not be as big
 a screw-up as you act.

466
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,700
- That'd be just about
impossible, wouldn't it?

467
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,467
- Do it to it, dude.

468
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,900
- Please decipher and return.

469
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,533
Thank you.

470
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,733
(loud beeping)

471
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,267
(dramatic music)

472
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,800
- We have a Code One violation,

473
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,867
some entity is trying
 to hack our computer.

474
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,233
We have a problem.

475
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,500
(telephone rings)

476
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,733
- Yes, Jackson.

477
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,633
A Code One on our mainframe?

478
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,767
That's impossible.

479
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,900
Yes, I agree, I consider
that compromise.

480
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Okay, I'll look into it.

481
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,600
Totally a compromise.

482
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,600
Impressive.

483
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,667
- I wonder how powerful this
 government computer really is.

484
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,500
- Let's take this
 thing for a ride.

485
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,267
- Alright, look
 who came to play.

486
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,300
- Let me show you
 what a woman can do.

487
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Andrew, crank the music.

488
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,133
Gentlemen, to the window.

489
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,667
(loud rock music)

490
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,500
(roaring thunder)

491
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:01,933
- Who are these guys?

492
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:04,567
They've devectored one of
 our primary satellites.

493
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:05,933
- Awesome.

494
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,100
- No one would believe
 we ever did this.

495
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,800
- Would be an urban legend.

496
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,533
- Urban legend?

497
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,400
- Yeah, like in Florida,

498
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
the guy was in the toilet,

499
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,767
and the snakes climbs
 up the sewer pipe

500
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,433
and bites him on the butt.

501
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,167
- That's not a true story?

502
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,367
- D'oh!

503
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,933
For a smart guy you got
some short circuits.

504
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,500
- Well I believe if
 one kind of stuff

505
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,400
can go out in one direction,

506
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,767
then another kind of
 stuff, like a snake,

507
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,300
find its way in the other way.

508
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,867
(loud beeping)

509
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,333
- Yo Cat, impressive.

510
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:41,433
- Thanks.

511
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,933
(Rocky barks)

512
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,433
- It's a message
 from Valerie but,

513
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:54,467
that's funny, she never
encrypts anything.

514
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,567
- Woman of endless surprises.

515
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:57,733
Just my type.

516
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:59,300
Hey, let's play it.

517
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,467
- Andrew, stop
 playing with the game,

518
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,133
destroy all copies, it's
very, very dangerous.

519
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,200
My life may be in danger.

520
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,733
- Kind of short on the
sense of humor, though.

521
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,933
(dramatic music)
 - This is no joke.

522
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,167
- You're right, she
 looks scared to me.

523
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:26,833
(loud beeps)
 - [Voiceover] No such terminal

524
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,800
number, please check your
 number and call again.

525
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,067
(loud typing)

526
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,200
No such terminal number,

527
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,100
please check your
 number and call again.

528
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,533
- Something's happened to her.

529
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,300
- Something bad.

530
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,967
- It's up to us now.

531
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,133
We're the only us
 who can save Valerie.

532
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,533
Let's ride.

533
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:46,867
(energetic happy music)

534
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,433
I think we're being followed.

535
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,433
- Oh, right.

536
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,567
- Oh oh, black
 car, we're doomed.

537
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:04,700
- Alright, maybe I do have
 an overactive imagination.

538
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:13,567
Turn here.

539
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,133
(car skids loudly)

540
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,733
Well now what do you think?

541
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,233
- [Catherine And
 Gary] Coincidence.

542
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,400
- [Andrew] Let's lose him.

543
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,067
- [Catherine] Off we go.

544
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,933
(car skids loudly)

545
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,733
- Woo-hoo, that was close.

546
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,067
- We're bad.

547
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,133
- [Gary] Alright.
 (Catherine laughs)

548
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,667
- Excellent riding.

549
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,333
Who were those guys?

550
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,667
(dramatic guitar music)

551
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,333
- Nice riding, kids.

552
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,600
Hacking into a
 government computer,

553
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,500
redirecting a
 government satellite,

554
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,567
you kids are looking at
a whole mess of trouble.

555
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,200
We're talking jail,
 humiliation, scandal.

556
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,467
Throw away any thoughts
 you had about scholarships.

557
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,600
Forget your parents'
hopes for your futures.

558
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,067
What on earth were you thinkin'?

559
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,600
- We think Andrew's
 friend has been kidnapped

560
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,133
by KL Interactive.

561
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,200
- Yeah, kidnapped.

562
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,667
- Aha.

563
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,633
- We think they're developing
 a dangerous computer game.

564
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,533
- A death game.

565
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,600
- Aha.

566
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,767
- Um, look, sir.

567
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,200
They're not to blame, alright?

568
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,700
It's my fault.

569
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,433
I have a friend, an
 acquaintance actually,

570
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,533
her name's Valerie.

571
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:47,967
- Did you say Valerie?

572
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,867
- Oh, I knew she was trouble
 the minute I saw her.

573
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:50,800
- Yeah, Valerie.

574
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,767
(sighs)

575
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:55,067
- I have to level with
 you, I have a problem.

576
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,500
- We'll never do it again.

577
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,933
- No, you're not my problem,
 but you might be my solution.

578
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,967
You say KL Interactive
 has been developing

579
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,167
a dangerous game?

580
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,833
Well I believe
 that to be a fact.

581
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,533
You think Valerie was kidnapped?

582
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,800
So do I.

583
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,667
See, Valerie was working for me,

584
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,933
she was, is one
 of my best agents,

585
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:13,667
and I've lost contact with her.

586
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,433
I need a team to rescue her.

587
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,067
I need you.

588
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:18,100
- Why us?

589
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,167
- Because KL Interactive
is closed down

590
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,800
as tight as a drum, I
 can't get an agent inside.

591
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,367
They're so tied into the
 military industrial complex

592
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:27,100
that they know who
 all my agents are.

593
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,600
- So you want us?

594
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,733
- Yes, because no one would
 believe I would use kids.

595
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,333
I really have no choice.

596
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,133
- We don't know
 anything about spying.

597
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,400
We're just teenagers.

598
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,700
- Yeah, it's teenagers.

599
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,933
- In the next few days,
you'll become bigger,

600
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,467
better and brawnier than
you've ever imagined,

601
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:43,633
with training.

602
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,733
- (sighs incredulously)
What about school?

603
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,433
What about our parents?

604
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,467
What about homework?

605
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:50,167
- Now you leave that to me.

606
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,333
I'll prepare a letter saying

607
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,233
you'd been accepted
 into a special

608
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:57,167
one-month training program
 for exceptional teenagers.

609
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,200
(light chiming)
- No school,

610
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,267
no parents, no homework?

611
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,067
(light music)
 Gotta love it.

612
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,567
(military drumming music)
 - Come on, maggot,

613
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,067
you can do it, come on!

614
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,233
Two, one, two!

615
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,633
- I did those numbers already,

616
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:11,800
can we move on to three?

617
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,833
- Drop and give me 20, dogmeat!

618
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,867
(Gary sighs)

619
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:18,967
(sad music)

620
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,467
(light music)

621
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,067
This is a Special
Forces climbing harness,

622
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,733
used in insertion and
 extraction of troops.

623
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,233
- No problemo.

624
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,067
- Piece of cake.

625
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,133
- Born climbing.

626
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:34,700
- Well let's do it.

627
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,833
- Well what do you think?

628
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,133
(wacky music)

629
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,967
- I think if you've mastered
 the art of rappelling

630
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,067
you'll not have this
 kind of problem again.

631
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,067
- What are you
 talking about problem,

632
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,433
what's wrong with this?

633
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,233
- Well look at you, you're
 hanging upside down,

634
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,167
for crying out loud.

635
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,400
- 'Cause I'm supposed to be!

636
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,333
- This is not how
 it's supposed to be,

637
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,267
if this was a real situation,

638
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:53,533
you'd be a dead man by now.

639
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,200
You got that?
 - [Andrew] I'm ready, alright?

640
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,067
I'm ready to go.

641
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:55,900
Let's go.

642
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,767
- Five, six, seven,

643
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,033
eight.

644
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:05,033
- Now we're getting somewhere.

645
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,533
(laughter)

646
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:09,967
(loud beeping)

647
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,333
- The computer development
isn't moving as fast as we need.

648
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,533
- She needs prodding.

649
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,933
Perhaps we should do to Valerie

650
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:19,700
what we're going to do
 to the world at large.

651
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,800
- Her entire mind
 could be scrambled.

652
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,200
- Ow, silly me.

653
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,267
Perhaps another time.

654
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:35,300
(gong rings loudly)

655
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,800
(traditional Asian music)

656
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,167
- Now remember be your opponent,

657
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,133
and you can defeat
 your opponent.

658
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,833
(Andrew screams a battle cry)

659
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,900
(hits thud on flesh)

660
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,233
(gong rings loudly)

661
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,400
(Rocky barks)

662
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,733
I said be your opponent,
not be the mat.

663
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,067
- That's more like it,

664
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:10,667
this is going better
than our wildest dreams.

665
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,900
I mean your wildest dreams.

666
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,667
(intense drumming)

667
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,467
(gong rings loudly)
 (traditional Asian music)

668
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:29,133
- Purple belt?

669
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,700
- I like the color.

670
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,900
(hits thud against flesh)

671
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,267
(gong rings loudly)

672
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:44,900
Don't you think purple's a
 prettier color than white now?

673
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,133
(Rocky barks)

674
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:47,567
- Ready, I'm tellin' you.

675
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:48,833
- Well I say you're not.

676
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,100
You're too young, too green

677
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,367
and too soft, and
 if you slip up,

678
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,900
it's over, for you
 and for Valerie.

679
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,067
- We can do it.

680
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,700
- Yeah, we're ready.

681
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,200
- Give us a field test,

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,067
toughest one you got.

683
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,533
(ominous music)

684
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,167
- The Drop.

685
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,100
(mysterious music)

686
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,300
(Rocky barks)

687
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,433
- It's the dog!

688
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,067
(intense music)

689
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,733
- I got him in my
 sights, (speaker is
 drowned out by music).

690
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:29,567
- Yes!

691
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,967
- [Voiceover] I got him!

692
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:35,800
Hey!

693
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,067
- Hey!

694
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,933
Come back here with my bag.

695
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,533
Get him.

696
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,133
He dropped the bag.

697
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,367
He dropped the bag, (speaker
 is drowned out by music).

698
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:56,200
Hey!

699
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,200
- [Blonde Man] Hey!

700
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,167
(ominous music)
 - Well, well, well,

701
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,400
looks like the
 little loser is back

702
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,567
for some extracurricular
activity.

703
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,400
- Look, I don't want any trouble

704
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,933
from you guys, alright?

705
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,733
I'm working as a secret
government agent.

706
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:32,067
- (laughs) Yeah, and my
grandma's in the FBI.

707
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,200
What you got in the bag?

708
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
- Nothing, please
 don't take my bag.

709
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,767
- You mean my bag?

710
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,700
(sighs)

711
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,600
- Amateurs.

712
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:44,600
(Andrew mumbles)

713
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,400
- [Blonde Man]
 Alright, game's over.

714
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,667
- You're under arrest,

715
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,933
you have the right
 to remain silent.

716
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,500
- I knew they weren't ready.

717
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,067
(Rocky barks)

718
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,167
- Well what do you think?

719
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:09,267
- I think you need another
 six months of training,

720
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,200
I think if this works,
it's gonna be a miracle.

721
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,433
- You mean we got no choice?

722
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,267
- Exactly.

723
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,333
We begin now.

724
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,433
- Cool TV.

725
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,267
- It's a holographic screen,

726
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,667
I've read about these,
 but I never knew

727
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,167
they really existed.

728
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,500
- You're gonna see a lot of
stuff you thought didn't exist.

729
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,067
Just remember, you
 make one mistake

730
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:34,633
and we may never see
 any of you again.

731
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,500
Thanks to this man. (loud beep)

732
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,833
This is Simon Westbourne,

733
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,433
owner of KL Interactive.

734
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:42,100
He's one of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world.

735
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,700
As you know, he's
 developing a weapon

736
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,467
disguised as a game, but
 that's all we know about him.

737
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:49,100
Your mission is to sneak
into KL Interactive

738
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,633
and establish yourselves
as games experts.

739
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,800
Once you're in, you
 connect with Valerie,

740
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,667
she's your primary mission.

741
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,067
- Wait a minute!

742
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,333
Valerie's email message,

743
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,867
maybe there's a clue.

744
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,967
(intense music)

745
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,467
(loud typing)

746
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,067
- Andrew, stop
 playing with the game,

747
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,633
destroy all copies, it's
very, very dangerous.

748
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,133
My life may be in danger.

749
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,067
- She's really scared.

750
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:16,867
- Shh!

751
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:23,067
Look, she's scared and
 yet what does she do?

752
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,867
- She grabs something.

753
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,100
A disk!

754
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,800
- And she hides it
 behind that picture.

755
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,533
- [Andrew] It must've
 been important to her.

756
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,500
- Well it just became
 important to us.

757
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,167
We have to get you in there now.

758
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,800
(loud beeping)

759
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
- Excellent.

760
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,267
The simulators prove
 the game will work.

761
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:58,067
I knew you'd have the
 wisdom to come around.

762
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,200
- I'm a professional,
 I do my job,

763
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,733
that doesn't mean I like it.

764
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:05,667
- Please, such harsh
 words from such soft lips.

765
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,533
Can't we just get along?

766
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,933
- Are we quite finished?

767
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:11,933
- Not quite.

768
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,500
(scary music)

769
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:20,767
Not until I release
 it on the Internet.

770
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:22,067
- The Internet?

771
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,300
This is a weapon.

772
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,100
- A game first, that
 becomes a weapon,

773
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,067
a mind control device
 directed at anyone who plays.

774
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:30,767
Delightful, isn't it?

775
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,433
And soon we'll
 share our pleasure

776
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:36,267
with the entire galaxy
of Internet cyberspace.

777
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,167
- May I help you?

778
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,067
- Yeah, we're the
 new game testers.

779
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,967
- Pros from Oak Valley.

780
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:49,167
(loud beeps)

781
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:52,067
- Well, I guess you
 are game testers.

782
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:55,767
I swear they get younger
looking every day.

783
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:59,533
These are access passes
only to the main floor.

784
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,400
Don't go wandering around.

785
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,233
- Thanks.

786
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:07,167
- Yeah, thank you.
- [Catherine] Thank you.

787
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:12,867
So, what's in the bag?

788
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:13,700
- Backup.

789
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:26,500
- We're the new game testers.

790
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,833
- I don't remember
 any new game testers.

791
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,100
- Andrew, I can't
 believe they only offered

792
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,733
you a salary of 750,000.

793
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,800
- Yeah.

794
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,133
- I get 850,000.

795
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,533
With incentives.

796
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,767
(Rocky barks)

797
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,267
- [Catherine] He gets 100,000.

798
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:54,967
- $850,000, huh?

799
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,800
- Yeah, people over 30
 will believe anything.

800
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,900
- We are in.

801
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,133
- Coming in loud and clear.

802
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,700
- This place is huge.

803
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,433
(dramatic music)

804
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,967
(loud beeps)

805
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,767
- Valerie's office.

806
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,700
Alright, you guys
 keep a lookout.

807
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,833
(sad music)

808
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,167
Well, Valerie, I almost
met you in person.

809
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,233
- How's it going in there?

810
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,467
(intense music)
- It's going.

811
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,800
- Andrew, will you hurry up?

812
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,667
- We gotta split.

813
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,267
- What's taking them so long?

814
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:59,133
- I can't believe Valerie's
 in trouble over a disk.

815
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,533
No, there's gotta be more.

816
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,867
- Can I help you?

817
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:22,533
- (clears throat) Yes,
 I'm looking for my office.

818
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,633
- Who are you again?

819
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:30,867
- A game tester.

820
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,033
- Yeah, right.

821
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,367
(loud squeaking)

822
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,633
(energetic music)

823
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,633
This is a
highly-secured facility,

824
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:55,033
you, you can't
 just wander around.

825
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:59,067
I got a kid here says
 he's a game tester.

826
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:02,333
- Yeah, he's
 authorized to be here.

827
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,900
No listing of an office,
he just started today.

828
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,400
- Okay, copy that.

829
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:08,600
Get going.

830
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,500
And stay out of secured areas

831
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,933
until I find out
 where your office is.

832
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,533
- I think it's a corner office.

833
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,133
Eh, south facing, I don't think

834
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,700
they gave me a corner office.

835
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,600
I can tell.

836
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,600
Good boy, Rocky.

837
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Good boy, that's a good boy,

838
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,300
what you find?

839
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,833
(dramatic music)

840
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:49,667
Valerie?

841
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:55,467
It's you.

842
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:57,700
- Andrew?

843
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,733
(sighs) What are you doing here?

844
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,567
I told you it was dangerous.

845
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:03,967
- I've come to rescue you.

846
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:05,200
- How'd you get in?

847
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,167
- We pretended to
 be game testers.

848
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,400
- (sighs) You
 shouldn't have come.

849
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,733
- I had to, alright?

850
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:13,467
I was worried I'd never
meet you for real.

851
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:15,133
- That's very sweet.

852
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,167
(moves into ominous music)

853
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,333
You're on the wrong floor.

854
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:27,133
Simon, I'd like you to meet

855
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,333
one of our newest game testers.

856
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,567
- How charming,

857
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,167
that would explain
 the other one.

858
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,833
- This is a
highly-secured facility,

859
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,700
we can't have kids
 wandering around.

860
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,967
She says they're game testers.

861
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:41,833
- Yeah, we're your
 new game testers.

862
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:42,667
- I see.

863
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:45,200
- Yes, I brought them in to help

864
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,833
speed up research
 on the new game.

865
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,067
- Good idea.

866
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:50,400
- And boy are we good.

867
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,967
- Well, I hope you
 enjoy our games.

868
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:55,067
Show them out, could you?

869
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:03,933
Security, I don't know
 what these kids know,

870
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,967
get rid of them.

871
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:09,167
(chuckles maliciously)
 No, second thoughts,

872
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:12,900
they could be our new
game testers after all.

873
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,300
- Lost or something, man?

874
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,500
- Gee, I might be, but
 not as lost as you.

875
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,200
At least I know where
 waste disposal is.

876
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,067
(energetic music)

877
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,767
(speaker is drowned
 out by music)

878
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,167
Come and get you.

879
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:46,533
- [Andrew] Go, go, go, go.

880
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:48,200
- [Catherine] I'm
 going, I'm going.

881
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,667
- [Security Guard] Freeze!

882
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,233
Hold it!

883
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,067
- Okay.

884
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,067
Got 'em!

885
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:03,400
- Get him!

886
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,067
(loud thud)

887
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:09,433
(scientist screams in panic)

888
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:10,833
- No, no, no, no!

889
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,967
(loud crash)

890
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,267
- [Security Officer] Hold it!

891
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,067
I almost got 'em.

892
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,200
- I need your badges.

893
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,933
- Yeah, I'll get 'em.

894
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:34,400
(loud chirping)

895
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,633
- (heavy breathing) We made it.

896
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:38,233
- [Security Officer]
 You two are crazy.

897
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:39,233
- I see I'm gonna
 have to keep you

898
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:41,233
on a much tighter leash.

899
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,700
- It's just as I thought,

900
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,533
Simon is dipping in some
 dangerous and banned projects.

901
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,100
- What's Project Quest?

902
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,333
- It was new technology
that used computers

903
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,800
to broadcast directly
 into the human brain

904
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,767
and manipulate it.

905
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,067
The program was shut down,

906
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,667
or at least it was
 supposed to be.

907
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,700
- Can he pull it off?

908
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,833
- Well, if anyone can, he can.

909
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,267
- If anyone can stop him.

910
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:10,767
- [Catherine And Gary] We can!

911
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,267
(loud beeping)

912
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:17,367
- I was able to tie into the
 city's planning archives.

913
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,200
- Yes!

914
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,500
This isn't gonna be
 easy to figure out.

915
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,700
- Watch this.

916
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,067
(loud beep)

917
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,767
- Oh, it's like
 you can touch it.

918
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,700
- Only with your brain.

919
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:33,867
(dramatic music)

920
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,400
- Welcome to your
 splendid new quarters.

921
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:46,600
I apologize if it's not
 everything you dreamed of.

922
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:52,567
This could all change
 if you fix the game.

923
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:54,867
- How can you ask
 me to work on this?

924
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:56,200
It's not right.

925
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,367
- Right?

926
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,933
Wrong?

927
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,833
These terms are relative, the
 world is changing every day,

928
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,433
why not be a part of the team

929
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:05,400
that's controlling
 those changes?

930
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,533
And become wealthy
 while you're at it.

931
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:10,333
You know, if you
don't cooperate,

932
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,167
I'll find someone who will,

933
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,400
and then you'll be history.

934
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,267
- Valerie is most likely located
in a cell on level three.

935
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:22,100
It's protected by a
 specialized card key access.

936
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,767
- What about the mainframe?

937
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:25,533
- It's isolated right here.

938
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,567
KL Interactive's
 mainframe computer

939
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,467
is one of the
 fastest in the world,

940
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,633
it's cooled with
liquid nitrogen.

941
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,900
It says here that it's
 a standalone system,

942
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,400
and it's not connected
 to any other computer.

943
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,633
There's no way to hack it,

944
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:39,967
you'd have to get inside
the room to access it.

945
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,767
- Yeah, but with a
nitrogen-cooled system,

946
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:43,400
they'd have to have
 extensive venting

947
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,867
and ducting to keep the
temperature constant.

948
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,067
- Just ask.

949
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:49,233
(loud beep)

950
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:52,633
- Yeah, a vent leads right
 into the computer room.

951
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:53,567
Piece of cake.

952
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,067
- Not so easy.

953
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,067
- Why, why not?

954
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,567
- Well, the room is protected

955
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,833
by a weight-sensitive
 security system,

956
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,067
anything over 50
pounds will trigger it.

957
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:04,900
Not close.

958
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,767
(Rocky barks)

959
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,667
- No problem.

960
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,433
- The door to the room is
 guarded 24 hours a day.

961
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:15,900
- Yeah, and it requires
an electronic key

962
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,800
to deactivate the weight
trigger security system.

963
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,633
(chuckles) I cheated.

964
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:22,833
I read their training manual.

965
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,900
(classy music)
 (Catherine laughs)

966
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,833
Only two exist, Simon has one

967
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,533
and the computer
designer has the other.

968
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:31,667
They keys are kept
 around the neck

969
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,233
and they never take 'em off.

970
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,067
- Never?

971
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,067
- Never.

972
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,067
- How about stealing one of 'em?

973
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,933
- As soon as one of the
 keys was reported missing,

974
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:40,833
they would just create new keys.

975
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:44,467
- New keys, new code, and
 we're back to square one.

976
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:46,267
- Well how about
 copying the keys?

977
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,267
- The keys are unique,
 the code is hardwired

978
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,967
into the circuitry.

979
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,067
We would need to
 have one in order

980
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:52,700
to make a duplicate.

981
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,567
And I'd need the
right equipment.

982
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:58,567
- You will have the
 right equipment.

983
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:02,767
(dramatic music)

984
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,300
- Can I help you?

985
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,567
- Do you know what this is?

986
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,233
It's a pen.

987
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,433
A pen.

988
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,133
(sighs in relief)

989
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:15,967
Sign here.

990
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,867
Complements of
 your friend, John.

991
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,333
Here is our card, we
 have an Internet website,

992
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:29,200
if you need anything
 else, just order it.

993
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,067
(loud banging on steel suitcase)

994
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:33,300
We usually ship
 in under 24 hours.

995
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,367
(taller man clears throat)

996
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,667
Well under 24 hours.

997
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:38,500
- Thanks.

998
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:42,633
- It's a key duplicating device,

999
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:45,067
electronic imaging to
 clone the circuitry.

1000
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:46,467
- Excellent.

1001
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,967
I wonder how long it
 would take to make a copy.

1002
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,133
- Two minutes.

1003
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:54,133
(chuckles) I cheated,
 I read the manual.

1004
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:55,633
(Catherine chuckles)

1005
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:59,200
- Now all we have to do is
 figure out how to get a key.

1006
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,100
(mysterious music)

1007
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,833
- [Catherine] Every
 day at exactly 12:30,

1008
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:11,067
Bill goes to Charly Temmel's
 for an ice cream cone.

1009
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,933
(camera shutter clicks)

1010
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:21,600
Then when he finishes
 with his cone,

1011
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,133
he plays pinball for
 exactly half an hour.

1012
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:27,133
(pinball machine beeps)

1013
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:31,333
- He always plays this
 one pinball machine?

1014
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,833
- Give me the key,
 and I can clone it.

1015
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,333
- You have a plan?

1016
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:38,067
- I think they do.

1017
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:01,467
- Excuse me, I alwas
 play Weenie Brain

1018
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:03,267
from 12:30 to one.

1019
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,067
- Sorry to hear that.
(pinball machine beeps)

1020
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,600
- See all those high scores?

1021
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,433
All mine.

1022
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,533
Next game.

1023
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:40,400
(pinball machine
game over music)

1024
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,667
- What's that around your
 neck, good luck charm?

1025
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:54,000
(pinball machine beeps)

1026
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,900
(intense fun music)

1027
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,633
- I'm stuck, somebody help me.

1028
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,667
Somebody help me.

1029
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:21,767
(game designer screams)

1030
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:25,100
(pinball machine beeps)

1031
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,067
- One, two, three.

1032
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:57,967
Wow, I've never seen anyone
 use that technique before.

1033
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:58,800
- Oh,

1034
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:03,067
oh, that's the highest score

1035
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,733
I've ever gotten, oh.

1036
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:09,867
- That's great, I will
 name a ice cream after you,

1037
00:52:09,867 --> 00:52:11,933
you will be world famous.

1038
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,467
(game designer sighs)

1039
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,433
- What do you mean you
 can't find the key?

1040
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:19,933
- I know it's one of these.

1041
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:22,767
- I thought those were the
 ones you already tried.

1042
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:24,833
(key chain clinks)

1043
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,100
- Oh, (speaks quietly).

1044
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,933
Next time you guys crawl into
 the tight spot and I watch.

1045
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:32,567
Anyway, here's the key.

1046
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:33,700
I know more about pinball

1047
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,433
than I ever thought I would.

1048
00:52:35,433 --> 00:52:37,167
- Alright, look,
 now we got the key.

1049
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,100
Now we need to figure out

1050
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,867
how to get into the system.

1051
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:44,700
And we're gonna need some
pretty sophisticated technology.

1052
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,300
Anything we want.

1053
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,333
- In under 24 hours.

1054
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,100
- Way under 24 hours.

1055
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:54,933
(continuous loud beeping)

1056
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:57,333
- This is an exciting moment,

1057
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,867
the edge of a new millennium.

1058
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:05,700
With me as the most
 powerful man in the world.

1059
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:11,633
And you by my side.

1060
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:16,633
- Excuse me while I throw up.

1061
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:18,367
- Communication devices.

1062
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:21,133
- Ah, virtual reality
 computer headset.

1063
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:25,833
- Six million in US negotiable
 treasure certificates.

1064
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:26,967
Gotcha. (chuckles)

1065
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,800
- Security badges. (loud beeps)

1066
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,633
- Aa, face-morphing device.

1067
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:34,133
- [All] Gotta have one.

1068
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:36,433
- How about a Special
 Forces cyber dog combat suit

1069
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:37,767
with camera mount?

1070
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,233
(Rocky barks)

1071
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:43,400
(Catherine laughs)
- [All] Gotta have one.

1072
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:52,300
- Night vision goggles.

1073
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,967
- Face-morpher.

1074
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:55,967
- Excellent.

1075
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,967
- I'm sorry, Rocky,
 no cyber dog outfit.

1076
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,133
Ah, just kidding, it's
 right here, Rocky!

1077
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,100
(Rocky barks)

1078
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,733
- What do you suppose this is?

1079
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,300
- It's a laser pen.

1080
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,267
(loud explosion)

1081
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:13,467
Awesome.

1082
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:14,933
- Oh, I hope nobody
 wanted more tea.

1083
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,367
- Huh, excellent.

1084
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,833
- Those look good on you.

1085
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,300
- Hey, check this out.

1086
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,900
Hey, say something.

1087
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,433
- Andrew is a hunk.

1088
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,267
(Andrew laughs)

1089
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,900
- [Voiceover] Andrew is a hunk.

1090
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,100
- Not!

1091
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,300
- Wow, voice wave
 automatic synthesizer.

1092
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,133
Nice.

1093
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,433
- It's only a
 question of hours now.

1094
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:38,833
Finally a world in which
 children are under control.

1095
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,133
(dramatic music)
No more whining,

1096
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,100
no more complaining.

1097
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,533
Kids, how do we
 stomach them? (sighs)

1098
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,367
Simon says will
actually mean something.

1099
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:51,367
Simon says, "Do the dishes."

1100
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,367
Simon says, "Clean your room."

1101
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:54,333
(laughs maniacally)

1102
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:57,133
Simon says, "Eat your liver."

1103
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:00,200
(laughs maniacally)

1104
00:55:01,867 --> 00:55:03,267
- [John] So what do you think?

1105
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:04,133
- About what?

1106
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,600
- Our training ground.

1107
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,400
This is the duct termination,

1108
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,167
here is the key
 code insert monitor.

1109
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,067
- I think it looks like a bunch

1110
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:13,067
of trash cans and boxes.

1111
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:14,800
- Here, try these on.

1112
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,967
Might give you a better
 idea of what you're in for.

1113
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,600
- [Andrew] How do you
 know it's accurate?

1114
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,067
- [Catherine] We used
the computer coordinates

1115
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,633
(dramatic music)
 from the building plants.

1116
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:28,633
- Excellent.

1117
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:38,900
Wow, this is amazing technology,

1118
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,667
I can see everything.

1119
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:44,667
Mainframe's right here,

1120
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,500
the front door's right here.

1121
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,333
(palms snap loudly)
 Come here, Rocky,

1122
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,400
come here boy.

1123
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,867
Come on, come on, come here boy.

1124
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:54,933
There you go.

1125
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,467
Welcome to the mainframe, Rocky.

1126
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,833
Come here, Rocky, come here,

1127
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,067
here's the card key, pick it up,

1128
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,133
pick it up, good,
good, hold it, hold it.

1129
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:06,867
Good boy, good boy, Rocky.

1130
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,067
Good boy, there you go.

1131
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:08,867
(applause)

1132
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:11,400
- Good. (laughs)

1133
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,800
- You can access the face
 and voice files, right?

1134
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,333
Like that nerdy Bill guy?

1135
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,467
(laughter)

1136
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:18,767
How to state.

1137
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:21,500
Hey, load it into the morpher.

1138
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,600
(loud beep)

1139
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,867
- Done.

1140
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,100
- Alright, let's see if
this thing really works.

1141
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,333
- There's no time,
 it'll have to work.

1142
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:31,367
(ominous music)
(water lapping)

1143
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:32,900
- Bill?

1144
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,200
Didn't you just leave?

1145
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,633
- I forgot something
 in my office.

1146
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:40,500
- Oh, sounds like
you're catching a cold.

1147
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,067
(Bill clears throat)

1148
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,067
(mysterious music)

1149
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,967
- Man, this thing itches.

1150
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:53,067
I'm in.

1151
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:55,667
- And we read you, five by five.

1152
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,833
- We're good to go.

1153
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:58,967
Wish us luck.

1154
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,500
- Good luck, team.

1155
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,100
(drill buzzes loudly)

1156
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,933
- I'm off.

1157
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,833
I've got Simon in my sights.

1158
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:19,667
- Be careful with him.

1159
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:23,833
- Oops, oops.

1160
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:26,300
- You klutz.

1161
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,500
(whimsical music)
 - Oops, sorry sir.

1162
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:40,300
(intense music)

1163
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,300
Ready to tie in.

1164
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
- Ready.

1165
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
First stage.

1166
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:03,067
That's it, we are in,
disconnecting perimeter.

1167
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,533
- It's showtime.

1168
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,067
How do we look?

1169
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,067
(loud beeps)

1170
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:29,533
- Looking good and vice versa.

1171
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,733
Take the second right.

1172
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,267
(loud beeps)

1173
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:56,167
- What do you want?

1174
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,100
Can't you see I'm
 working as fast as I can?

1175
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,933
(whimsical music)

1176
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:06,733
- Oh my god.

1177
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,700
- Ta da.

1178
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,233
It's me.

1179
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:13,867
Your hero.

1180
00:59:13,867 --> 00:59:15,467
I'm here to rescue you.

1181
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:17,500
- How'd you do that?

1182
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,333
- It's a science, don't ask.

1183
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,367
Let's boogie.

1184
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:21,700
- I can't leave.

1185
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:24,367
- Well, maybe if
 I would've morphed

1186
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:27,133
into Andrew, then you'll leave?

1187
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:28,767
- Listen, if I leave,
 Simon will know

1188
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:30,233
that you're on to him.

1189
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,733
He plans to release the game
tomorrow night on the Internet.

1190
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,467
You have to stop him.

1191
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:37,133
(intense music)

1192
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,167
- You're looking
good, as always.

1193
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:56,433
(Andrew breaths heavily)

1194
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,833
- This place is a maze.

1195
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,567
Ha, it's the vent
 to the mainframe.

1196
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:53,900
Good boy, Rocky.

1197
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,433
We're at the mainframe.

1198
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:59,267
- Copy that.

1199
01:00:59,267 --> 01:01:02,433
(drill buzzes loudly)

1200
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,300
- Ready, Rocky?

1201
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,200
(Rocky barks)

1202
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,067
I'm counting on you.

1203
01:01:26,067 --> 01:01:28,367
(loud beeps)

1204
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:31,067
(intense music)

1205
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,233
(loud beep)

1206
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:51,600
Geronimo.

1207
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:56,733
(Rocky barks)

1208
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:06,100
Good boy, Rocky.

1209
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,133
Go over there.

1210
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,767
Yeah, good boy,
 Rocky. (loud beeps)

1211
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,767
- Alarm off.

1212
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,667
- I'm on the floor.

1213
01:02:23,667 --> 01:02:26,167
(Rocky barks)

1214
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:35,667
(loud beeping)

1215
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,100
Okay, I'm hooked
 into the mainframe.

1216
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,667
(loud beeping)

1217
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:50,633
(loud beeping)

1218
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,933
- Simon's on the move
heading toward the safe.

1219
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,533
- [Voiceover] Access denied.

1220
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:56,067
- Something's wrong.

1221
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:57,067
- What is it?

1222
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,300
- [Voiceover] Access code

1223
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,233
two, two, two, three,
 three, eight required.

1224
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,167
- Access code two, two,
two, three, three, eight

1225
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:04,800
is a request for
 Simon's personal code,

1226
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,400
it's locked in the mainframe.

1227
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,733
Only he knows it.

1228
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:10,133
- (sighs) Come on, Andrew.

1229
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:11,667
You can do it.

1230
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,900
- [John] Gary, Simon's on
 the, turning into Straten.

1231
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,667
- I'm on it.

1232
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:16,667
- What can we do?

1233
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,600
- Wait!

1234
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,800
The launch program for the game

1235
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,467
is stored in a different
part of the system.

1236
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,567
You should be able to
 download enough of it

1237
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,500
to prevent the
 release of the game.

1238
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,067
At least temporarily.

1239
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:29,467
- The launch program's huge,
 I can only take a part of it.

1240
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:31,500
- [Both] Do it!

1241
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,233
(dramatic music)

1242
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:39,267
- Simon is coming,
 you have to get out.

1243
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:41,833
- I'm working as fast as I can.

1244
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,300
- Simon's at the door.

1245
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,700
Have to stop him.

1246
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,100
Oh.

1247
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:12,233
- You blithering idiot.

1248
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:13,333
- Sorry, sir.

1249
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,067
(Gary screams)

1250
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:19,833
(whimsical music)

1251
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:25,667
- Are you alright?

1252
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:36,433
- Come on.

1253
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:37,267
Not now.

1254
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,333
You know timing is everything.

1255
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:45,167
(machine buzzes continuously)

1256
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:47,700
- All cleaned up?

1257
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,433
(whimsical music)

1258
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,800
- Simon has Gary.

1259
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,333
- I better see what I can do.

1260
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,767
- Okay, I've got it.

1261
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,533
(dramatic music)

1262
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,400
The door, Rocky.

1263
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,567
(loud beeps)

1264
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:31,333
- Welcome to the heart
 of KL Interactive.

1265
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,300
The home of Mind Chaser.

1266
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,133
(loud beeps)

1267
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:50,067
It appears that someone has
 left the computer port open.

1268
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:52,067
You wouldn't know anything
 about that, would you?

1269
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:52,867
- Me?

1270
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,300
No.

1271
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,367
So, Simon, you don't
 mind if I call you Simon?

1272
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,200
- I do.

1273
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:01,100
- I think you got me all wrong.

1274
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,200
See you, you and I
 are very similar.

1275
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,367
- Similar?

1276
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:07,700
- Yeah, like two peas in a pod.

1277
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,267
- And your point is?

1278
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:10,833
- We should go in
 business together.

1279
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,600
All I need is the West Coast.

1280
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,833
Did I say West Coast?

1281
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,767
What I really meant is
 Southern California.

1282
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:16,600
- What?

1283
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,767
- Make me an offer.

1284
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:18,900
- How about nothing?

1285
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,867
- Nothing?

1286
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:20,833
Could be good.

1287
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,467
- And in exchange for nothing

1288
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:25,567
you'll tell me everything
 and who you're working for.

1289
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,633
Don't worry, you'll
 have plenty of time.

1290
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:30,500
Like the rest of
your short life.

1291
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,333
- No.

1292
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:39,500
- That's my cue to run.

1293
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,567
(ominous music)

1294
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:42,400
- Guards!

1295
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,767
- Rocky, you are
insane! (laughs)

1296
01:06:46,767 --> 01:06:47,833
(energetic music)

1297
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,233
Let's rock.

1298
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:50,467
Yeehaw!

1299
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:53,200
(Andrew screams)

1300
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:06,233
- You're almost out.

1301
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:10,433
(door slides open loudly)

1302
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:13,700
(moves dramatic music)

1303
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:16,967
- Thanks for trying to help.

1304
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:18,533
- Don't mention it.

1305
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,167
- Listen, I know
you think that--

1306
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,467
- No, you listen.

1307
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:25,067
I'm just gonna spit
 it out and that's it.

1308
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:26,667
I really like Andrew, okay?

1309
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,067
And he doesn't pay
 attention to me

1310
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:30,133
because he has a
 total crush on you.

1311
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,067
So let's not pretend
 to be friends.

1312
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:34,167
You're way too
 smart and beautiful.

1313
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:35,233
Let's not pretend anything,

1314
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,767
and let's just figure out

1315
01:07:36,767 --> 01:07:39,633
a way to get out of this place.

1316
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:42,533
- Andrew and I are just friends.

1317
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:43,367
- But he thinks--

1318
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:44,200
- I know.

1319
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:46,767
But if he knows that
he has someone like you

1320
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:49,300
who really likes him.

1321
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,833
(hopeful music)
 You're very pretty, you know?

1322
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,833
You just need a little
 self-confidence.

1323
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,933
If he's the right guy,

1324
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:58,667
just give him a smile and
 a wink, and he'll know.

1325
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,100
- (chuckles) This is so stupid.

1326
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,967
- Hey, it's all about attitude.

1327
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:05,667
If you don't believe in
 yourself, no one else will.

1328
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:06,900
- What I believe is that we're

1329
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,367
never gonna get
 out of this place.

1330
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,833
- Hey, it's about confidence.

1331
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,100
(Catherine chuckles)

1332
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,933
- Thanks.

1333
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:16,600
(Valerie chuckles)

1334
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,533
- It's my fault, I slipped up.

1335
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:21,067
- No, you couldn't
 have done anything.

1336
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:22,767
Now we just have
to get him back.

1337
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:23,600
- But how?

1338
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:27,733
- We have a bargaining chip.

1339
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,133
Just need a plan.

1340
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:33,900
- Okay, we've gotta
 get out of here.

1341
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,633
Simon plans to
 release game tonight,

1342
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:37,667
it has amazing mind
 control properties.

1343
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,300
It's a mental virus.

1344
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,800
- We'll stop them, Andrew
 has part of the launch code.

1345
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,667
- No, that'll just
 slow him down.

1346
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,067
We need to destroy the mainframe

1347
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,600
before he goes online tonight.

1348
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,833
- Then there's no
 way into the system.

1349
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,200
- [Valerie] None.

1350
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,200
(hopeful music)
 - Wait, I've got it!

1351
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,233
It's like the urban legend.

1352
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:57,167
- What do you mean?

1353
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,433
- I know how to stop Simon.

1354
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,767
(moves into dramatic music)

1355
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,833
- Well, you wanted
 to be game testers,

1356
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:13,267
I guess you can be
 the first test pilots.

1357
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:15,167
- You're insane.

1358
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,667
- The world is
 changing every day,

1359
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,333
we must change with it.

1360
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:20,833
I've enjoyed our
 relationship, Valerie.

1361
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,833
(telephone rings)

1362
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,300
- Call for you.

1363
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,833
- Right on time.

1364
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,067
- Andrew.

1365
01:09:28,067 --> 01:09:29,100
- Yeah, Simon.

1366
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,533
I have a deal to offer you.

1367
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,633
- I'm listening.

1368
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:34,467
- Your disk for the girls.

1369
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,067
- Disk for the girls?

1370
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:37,333
- Don't do it, Andrew!

1371
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,667
Remember the snake that
bit the guy in the butt.

1372
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:40,500
- Cute.

1373
01:09:42,267 --> 01:09:44,567
You bring me the disk,
I'll give you the girls.

1374
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:46,467
- I'm not coming to you.

1375
01:09:46,467 --> 01:09:49,067
- Very well, where are we
 going to do the exchange?

1376
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:50,867
- Front of my house, tonight.

1377
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:53,800
- Alone, no police,
 and no friends.

1378
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:55,767
- Alone.

1379
01:09:58,767 --> 01:10:02,567
- I can't think of a better
 place to launch Mind Chaser.

1380
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:04,433
I'm afraid you're
 gonna have to wait.

1381
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,900
I don't want to show
 up with damaged goods.

1382
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,767
(scary screeching music)

1383
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:10,967
- Why would Cat mention the guy

1384
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:12,800
that got bit on the
 butt by a snake?

1385
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,133
- Bit on the butt?

1386
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:15,233
By a snake?

1387
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:16,700
- You know the urban legend?

1388
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,500
- Wait a minute, I know
 what she was talking about.

1389
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,800
I have a plan.

1390
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,467
(loud chirping)

1391
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:34,300
(intense music)

1392
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:40,867
- Go on, out.

1393
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:42,033
(Rocky barks)

1394
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:42,867
- Stay.

1395
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:43,700
(Rocky barks)

1396
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,533
Stay.

1397
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,367
- Where's the disk?

1398
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:54,333
- It's right here, Simon.

1399
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,200
- Toss it here.

1400
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,367
- Don't do it!

1401
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,700
- Where's that idiot Bill?

1402
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,067
- Who, Mr. Westbourne?

1403
01:11:05,067 --> 01:11:07,333
- The computer nerd, Bill!

1404
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:10,267
(car brakes loudly)

1405
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,300
(Rocky barks)

1406
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,367
- My dad's mailbox.

1407
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:15,400
Now you guys are
 really in trouble.

1408
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,067
- Sorry I'm late, car trouble.

1409
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:17,933
- So I see.

1410
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:25,833
- This is the right disk.

1411
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,667
- Clever boy.

1412
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,700
Check it for viruses.

1413
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,633
(loud beeping)

1414
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:35,800
- The disk is cleared, no
 viruses, no trojan horses.

1415
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:38,400
- Send it to the mainframe.

1416
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,133
Let's get this show started.

1417
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,233
- Oh, I'll need your access code

1418
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:43,167
to enter the mainframe.

1419
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:51,400
- It's showtime.

1420
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,533
- [Voiceover] Access granted.

1421
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:56,167
- What are you doing?

1422
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:57,600
- Simon,

1423
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,200
I couldn't figure
 out what Cat meant

1424
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,200
when she mentioned the snake,

1425
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,767
but then it came to me.

1426
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:04,400
See, Simon, when your
 computer's connected

1427
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,067
to the Internet, it's like a
 toilet connected to the sewer.

1428
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:11,900
And when your garbage
goes out, we can get in.

1429
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,733
(mischievous music)
And just like the snake

1430
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,267
that bit the man's butt,

1431
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:16,700
I can bite yours.

1432
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,067
- You can't access my
 mainframe without my codes.

1433
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:23,200
- That's true, but we
 have your code now.

1434
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,467
You just gave it to us.

1435
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,300
(whimsical music)

1436
01:12:33,533 --> 01:12:36,067
(Rocky barks)

1437
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,533
- This can't be!

1438
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:42,067
(loud beeps)

1439
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,700
You're in my system.

1440
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,967
- You wanna play a game, Simon?

1441
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:46,800
Play ours!

1442
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,500
(energetic music)
 Land holdings in Asia.

1443
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,333
(loud beeps)
 Gone.

1444
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,200
Looks like you have
 offshore accounts

1445
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,267
for one billion dollars.

1446
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:03,300
(loud beeps)

1447
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,267
Gone.

1448
01:13:04,267 --> 01:13:06,767
- You can't ruin me.

1449
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:08,767
(loud beeps)

1450
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:11,500
- US Treasury certificates.

1451
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,100
What do you think Gary,

1452
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,133
you need six million
 in negotiable US
 Treasury certificates?

1453
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:18,933
- Donate it to save the whales.

1454
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:20,167
- Hey, you know what?

1455
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,067
Let's just erase
 the whole empire.

1456
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:23,233
(loud beeps)

1457
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:27,067
(loud continuous explosions)

1458
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,267
Bankrupt Simon, it's over.

1459
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:37,300
You've lost.

1460
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,133
(police sirens wailing)

1461
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:39,567
You have nothing.

1462
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,067
- Simon, you're under arrest.

1463
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:56,733
(dramatic music)

1464
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,367
(gun is cocked loudly)

1465
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:05,200
(Rocky barks)

1466
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,767
- You may have ruined me,

1467
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:09,567
but I'm not giving
 up that easily.

1468
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:10,933
- Don't do it.

1469
01:14:10,933 --> 01:14:12,733
- You stay where you are.

1470
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:13,667
(Rocky barks)

1471
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:14,833
- It's time to give up, Simon.

1472
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,167
- Wrong, Andrew.

1473
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,933
(loud gunshot)

1474
01:14:17,933 --> 01:14:21,100
(Rocky wails in pain)

1475
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:27,567
- Rocky?

1476
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:33,833
Rocky?

1477
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,133
(sad music)
 You need to get up.

1478
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:38,300
Get up, Rocky.

1479
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:46,700
Rocky, get up boy. (cries)

1480
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:52,067
Don't die, Rocky.

1481
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,567
Help.

1482
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:00,433
- Rocky.

1483
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:07,800
(Rocky barks)

1484
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,633
- Rocky!

1485
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:10,400
(energetic music)

1486
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,767
Rocky. (laughs)

1487
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,067
- The cyber suit,
 it's bullet proof.

1488
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:15,867
- Rocky!

1489
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:18,567
Oh god.

1490
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,900
- Attaboy, Rocky.

1491
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,733
- Rocky!

1492
01:15:23,633 --> 01:15:25,533
Oh, good boy, good boy!

1493
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:28,767
- Beaten by kids.

1494
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,733
- Not just any kids.

1495
01:15:36,067 --> 01:15:40,233
- (sighs in relief)
 Rocky saved my life.

1496
01:15:40,233 --> 01:15:43,267
(Rocky barks)

1497
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:44,100
And you.

1498
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:48,533
You're pretty amazing yourself.

1499
01:15:48,533 --> 01:15:51,133
Were you always
 this amazing, Cat?

1500
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:52,233
(optimistic music)

1501
01:15:52,233 --> 01:15:53,067
Catherine.

1502
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:56,867
(Catherine laughs)

1503
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:04,233
(Simon groans)

1504
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,067
- This is a top secret
 government project.

1505
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:13,067
Your son's a hero, but you
 can't tell anyone about it.

1506
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:14,967
- My mailbox!

1507
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:17,100
- Everything will be
 back in order by dawn.

1508
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,533
Better than ever.

1509
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:22,833
(Mrs. Henderson gasps)

1510
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,333
(happy music)

1511
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:37,200
- And this is the last
 remaining copy of the game.

1512
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:43,400
(loud beeps)
 (roaring thunder)

1513
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,433
Anybody wanna play Mind Chaser?

1514
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:47,333
- [Catherine And Gary] Not.

1515
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,433
(loud beeps)

1516
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:50,167
- [Voiceover] Disk erased.

1517
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,533
You have a virtual caller.

1518
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:53,900
- Oh.
 - [Catherine] Uh oh.

1519
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,367
- [Andrew] Send it through.

1520
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:59,367
- Andrew, Catherine,
 Gary and Rocky.

1521
01:17:00,467 --> 01:17:01,767
(Rocky barks)

1522
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:03,967
I have a mission for you,

1523
01:17:03,967 --> 01:17:06,133
if you choose to accept it.

1524
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:09,433
(dramatic music)

1525
01:17:09,433 --> 01:17:12,067
(Rocky barks)

1526
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:15,767
(moves into energetic music)

1527
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:11,767
(MultiCom Jingle)
