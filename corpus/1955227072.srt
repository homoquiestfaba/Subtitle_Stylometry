Let's get Tromatized!

207
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,785
[Cheering]

208
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,260
The movie business is unique
in that it's both an art

209
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,264
Form and a business, and that's
why a movie studio like Troma

210
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,634
Is required to have
a board of directors.

211
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,968
These are people
who are specially

212
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,137
Trained to make the
kind of decisions

213
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,439
That we artists aren't
prepared to make.

214
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,508
Decisions about
budgets, about banks,

215
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,678
About philosophy, about
stock, leveraged buyouts, god

216
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,813
Knows what.

217
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,581
But right in here there's
a meeting going on

218
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,683
And we've got
permission to go inside,

219
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,218
But you must be
very, very quiet.

220
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,186
Let's see what's going on
with the... with the Troma

221
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:13,987
Board of directors.

222
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:21,528
We have to be
very, very naughty.

223
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,363
Quick, when do the
banks open in Geneva?

224
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,564
ALL: 2:00 AM.

225
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,600
What was the Deutsche
Mark selling at yesterday?

226
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,135
ALL: 1.54.

227
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,770
Current value of Troma Class A?

228
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,304
ALL: 36 and 5/8.

229
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,239
OK.

230
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,241
Ginger, get on the
phone with Hans.

231
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,542
Tell him we need
to set up three-way

232
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,177
With the boys in Tokyo.

233
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,649
Heather, I need spreadsheets
and fiscal '91, '92, and '93.

234
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,317
Darlene, do you have
any clear nail polish?

235
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,086
I just broke another one.

236
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:46,954
ALL: Oh, no!

237
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,255
[Interposing voices]

238
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,692
Can you tell us anything
about the situation?

239
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,927
Well, Susan, you know we
can't discuss the case.

240
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:58,265
But a male suspect
named... [laughs]

241
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,702
Officer Ressler,
Susan Wonton, Action...

242
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,836
[Laughter]

243
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,038
Can you tell us anything
about this situation?

244
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,141
Well, Susan, we cannot
discuss this case, as you know.

245
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,477
[Laughter]

246
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,413
Susan Wonton, Action
69 News, Tromaville.

247
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,049
Can you tell us anything
about the situation?

248
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,385
Now, Susan, you know we
cannot discuss the case,

249
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,353
But I can tell you
that there's a suspect

250
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,524
Named Guruse who has led a
female hostage into a gang...

251
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,360
[Laughter]

252
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,762
Susan, I can
categorically say you

253
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,397
Look great in that trench coat.

254
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,732
Where'd you get it?

255
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,366
Waffles Are Us.

256
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,601
That's in Little Belgium.

257
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,437
Oh, I'm... that's wonderful.

258
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,239
[Laughter]

259
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,209
This is live TV.

260
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,111
Fuck, I me... I
mean... I mean fudge.

261
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,050
Now, getting back
to the police...

262
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,384
[Laughter]

263
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,854
What do you think is going
on with the hostage situation?

264
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,291
[Laughter]

265
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,092
[Inaudible]

266
00:10:59,192 --> 00:10:59,893
Braaaaains!

267
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,231
Oh, OK.

268
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,301
Um, Officer Ressler, uh, now
that you're a mindless zombie

269
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,569
Just shambling around...

270
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,904
[Laughter]

271
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,575
Officer Ressler,
how do you feel?

272
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,444
How do you feel?

273
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,278
Braaaaains.

274
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,847
[Laughter]

275
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,647
Fuck.

276
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,984
How do you feel right now?

277
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,419
Tell us how you feel.

278
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,855
Braaaains.

279
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,725
Officer Nessler... er,
Ressler... Officer,

280
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,061
Ressler how do you feel?

281
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,896
[Laughter]

282
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,297
Hi.

283
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,699
My name is Larry McGinley, and
I work at Troma Entertainment,

284
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,935
And I'm, uh, new here at Troma.

285
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,139
I edit all the segments
for DVDs, and I also, uh,

286
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,009
Manage the DVDs, try to make
sure they get out on time.

287
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,211
For the DVD of
"Sugar Cookies," I

288
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,981
Was asked to get in touch with
Oliver Stone for an interview.

289
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,616
Oliver Stone associate-produced
"Sugar Cookies."

290
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,386
So I emailed Oliver Stone.

291
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,354
I called his office.

292
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,657
And basically was
told that Oliver Stone

293
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,693
Is very busy editing his movie.

294
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,562
And I told Lloyd this, and
he said, no, try again.

295
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,530
Try again.

296
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,400
And he said,
basically, that Oliver

297
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,768
Stone and him were very close.

298
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,671
They grew up together, and they
had a very deep friendship.

299
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,107
And so I called
the assistant back

300
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,442
And, uh, told her
about the closeness

301
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,711
Between Oliver Stone and Lloyd.

302
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,213
Because they were
so close growing up.

303
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,048
But I... I can't
stress enough the, uh,

304
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,983
Closeness between
Oliver and Lloyd.

305
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,952
It's just to emphasize
the closeness...

306
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,386
The closeness... the closeness...

307
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,222
And she told me to
write another email,

308
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,725
Basically expressing the points
that I had discussed with her.

309
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:43,230
And I did that, and I called
back after I sent the email

310
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,198
And they told me that
Oliver Stone was going out

311
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,368
Of the country again, because
he's doing post-production

312
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,470
For "Alexander."

313
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,607
And I told Lloyd this, and
he said to me, look, Larry.

314
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,143
You need to get an
interview with Oliver

315
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,610
Stone for "Sugar Cookies."

316
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,747
If you don't, there will
be dire consequences.

317
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,049
So I begged.

318
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,116
I fellated.

319
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,684
I did everything
humanly possible

320
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,587
To bring your Larry
McGinley's exclusive interview

321
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,089
With Oliver Stone.

322
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,423
Let's watch.

323
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,926
The truth is, I was not allowed
to conduct this interview.

324
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,929
After the persistent calling,
Oliver Stone put a restraining

325
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,832
Order out on me, and I
could not do it because it

326
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,200
Would be considered harassment.

327
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,071
So we flew Troma superstar,
Debbie Rochon, out to Alaska,

328
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,306
Where Oliver Stone was
staying with his friends,

329
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,608
Yasser Arafat and Fidel Castro.

330
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,044
That's why he's wearing
the fur coat that you'll

331
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,312
See in this interview.

332
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,048
So without further ado, I
bring you Debbie Rochon's

333
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,017
Interview with Oliver Stone.

334
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:37,817
Enjoy.

335
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:42,856
[Shivers] Hi, and welcome.

336
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,793
This is Debbie Rochon for
Troma, and I'm here in Alaska

337
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:51,965
Where it's sunny, it's cold, and
there's lots of mass transit...

338
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,102
And a lot of development, as
you can see in the background.

339
00:13:55,202 --> 00:14:00,207
I have got the exclusive
interview with Oliver Stone,

340
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,610
And he is sitting
right now, as we speak,

341
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,446
With Fidel Castro
and Yasser Arafat.

342
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,315
This is history in the making.

343
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:12,185
Only Troma can provide you
with this critical interview,

344
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,955
OK, uh, Mr. Stone,
the first question

345
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,826
Is, why were you always
late to be on the set

346
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,861
For "Sugar Cookies?"

347
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,363
I'm sorry I'm late for work.

348
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,398
I needed to pick up
bird seed for my wife.

349
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:33,740
[Shivers] OK, Mr. Stone, what
did your wife say to you when

350
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,543
She found out she was pregnant?

351
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,477
I'm sorry I'm late.

352
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,379
OK, Mr. Stone.

353
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,214
Last question for you, sir.

354
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,352
Why did it take you so long
to grant us an interview?

355
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,420
Well, I had to pick up
bird seed for my wife.

356
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,022
OK.

357
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:52,759
'Bout wraps it up for,
uh, Troma Team News.

358
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,728
Thank you very much for
doing this interview.

359
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:01,268
We appreciate it, and, um,
hope you enjoy "Sugar Cookies."

360
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,972
[Music]

361
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,475
Good news, Lloyd.

362
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,980
I just fixed your Windows XP
Professional and wireless LAN.

363
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,314
That's great, Asphyxia.

364
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,984
Hey, Michael, now we can get
back on the NAMBLA website!

365
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,752
Now if she could only
help me with my golf swing.

366
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,853
Oh, Michael.

367
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,256
[Laughter] You just
are too mu... [laughs]

368
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,292
Ooh, that will
be all, Asphyxia.

369
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,460
Thank you very much, uh...

370
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,062
Cheap motherfucker. [Laughs]

371
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,098
Greetings from Tromaville,
and welcome to the lovingly

372
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,201
Recreated, digitally remastered
director's cut version

373
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,904
Of the DVD of "Tales
from the Crapper"...

374
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,906
Julie Strain's "Tales
from the Crapper."

375
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,108
You know, this
introduction is gonna

376
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,943
Be a bit different from
how we usually do things

377
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,478
Around here in Tromaville.

378
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,248
Lloyd and I felt it was
time to shed some insight

379
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,883
Into the turbulent history
of Troma Entertainment

380
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,785
And the long, hard
road of bringing

381
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,887
"Tales from the Crapper"
to the big screen.

382
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,824
It's a little-known fact,
but when Troma was established

383
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,527
Many, many, many
moons ago, we actually

384
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,363
Had three founding partners.

385
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,399
Sure, everyone knows of
the flamboyant and outgoing

386
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,968
President of Troma
Entertainment and the creator

387
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,371
Of "The Toxic Adventure,"
Lloyd Kaufman.

388
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,373
And, even though he
remains in the shadows

389
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,943
And is publicity-averse,
everyone knows and loves

390
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,780
Vice President Michael Herz, who
transformed a simple taco stand

391
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,051
By the sea into the
media empire known

392
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,886
Today as Troma Entertainment.

393
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,422
But few of you know of the
third and most silent founding

394
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,091
Member of the Troma Team...

395
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,526
[Music]

396
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,997
Zelda Lipshitz.

397
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,268
She was our Yale classmate
and the true creative genius

398
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,203
Behind Troma's success.

399
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,506
And the mediator and
pragmatist of our rag-tag group.

400
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,409
For years, Michael and
I argued continually

401
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,880
About whose dream project we'd
make into cinematic reality.

402
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,084
[Chuckles] Oh, ugh.

403
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,524
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I wanted to
spin a gritty, feminist yarn

404
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:08,861
About a big-breasted bimbo
cop who must go undercover

405
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:14,334
At a sleazy strip bar to
catch the topless alien mantis

406
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,938
Whore who's laying waste to
our fair city's perverts.

407
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,875
And I, still pissed off at the
high price of my Yale tuition,

408
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,977
Caused my poor family to starve.

409
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,315
Felt we should tell a
cautionary tale, dealing

410
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,084
With the blood-sucking,
money-hungry college admission

411
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,154
Boards with those
bastards being represented

412
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:38,158
By a trio of big-titted
vampire lesbian strippers.

413
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,561
But being a small, struggling,
independent movie studio,

414
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,332
Troma only had enough money
to finance one motion picture.

415
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,734
On more than one
occasion, Lloyd and I

416
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:48,901
Nearly came to blows.

417
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,677
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But
like clockwork, Zelda

418
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,247
Would intervene with a
brilliant compromise,

419
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,516
Continuing a steady flow
of financial success

420
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,984
For the Troma Team.

421
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,357
NARRATOR: After the
multimillion-dollar success

422
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,325
Of Troma's "The
Girl Who Returned,"

423
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,527
The net profits were
split three ways.

424
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,797
Lloyd squandered his earnings
on polyester, perm treatments,

425
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,599
And an extensive
toupee collection

426
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,201
Resulting from too many perms.

427
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,236
Michael's millions went
towards the production of his

428
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,306
Yet-to-be-released country
album, "It Herz to Be Me"

429
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,508
AKA "Chinese Demiracy."

430
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,678
This left them with little money
for their future endeavors.

431
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,114
Fortunately for Troma, Zelda
had wisely invested her money,

432
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,050
Enabling them to finance
the international smash hit

433
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,787
And 10-time Academy
Award-winning film, "The Battle"

434
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,055
Of Love's Return,"
thus allowing Troma

435
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,292
To survive another decade.

436
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:49,128
Which leads us to the 1980s,
Troma's best and worst era.

437
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,963
It was the decade of
the "me" generation,

438
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,932
A credo Lloyd Kaufman
and Michael Herz

439
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,667
Took quite literally to heart.

440
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,036
Michael embraced the
popular fads of the time,

441
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,839
Blowing his money on
things like new coke.

442
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,609
Lloyd spent his time with
the local Boy Scout chapters

443
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,412
And liquidated his fund,
paying off his legal fees

444
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,880
For his involvement in
the notorious Brinks

445
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,583
Sperm bank heist of 1984.

446
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,685
P.S., if you don't
get by now, we

447
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:17,390
Are saying that Lloyd Kaufman
is gay... very, very gay.

448
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,526
And, like before,
Michael and Lloyd

449
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,429
Still argued over whose
stupid, crappy dream movie

450
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,896
Would be shot.

451
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,132
In this decade of
selfishness, all Zelda

452
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,368
Could think of was
Troma Entertainment,

453
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,404
And how her beloved
company could persevere.

454
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,839
It was during this
turbulent time

455
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,741
That she created
Troma's flagship

456
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,644
Franchise, "The Toxic Avenger."

457
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,446
Yet three decades of
dealing with Lloyd

458
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,249
And Michael's bullshit took
a toll on her well being.

459
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,217
She went fucking nuts.

460
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,854
That, and not hiring Madonna
for the first turn-on,

461
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:51,324
And Lloyd's addiction
to ladies' footwear,

462
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:55,695
And my horrifying
battle with anorexia

463
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,130
Finally proved to be
too much for Zelda

464
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,000
And she committed suicide.

465
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,101
[Horn]
[scream]

466
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,169
[Splat]

467
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,937
Some people say that
Zelda killed herself

468
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,774
Because of the pressure of
having to be the peacekeeper

469
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,743
At Troma Film Studios,
but everyone knows women

470
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,979
Just can't run movie studios.

471
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,481
Look at Sherry Lansing.

472
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:18,785
And besides, Zelda's suicide
note was so forgiving.

473
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,786
She loved us.

474
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,493
All she ever wanted was for
us to learn to work together.

475
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,228
But it took her death for
us to realize that we are

476
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,598
Strongest when we compromise.

477
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,334
And that, little
Johnny, is how "Tales"

478
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,503
From the Crapper...
Julie Strain's Tales

479
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,938
"From the Crapper" came to be.

480
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,341
You see, we combined
our two dream

481
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,176
Projects into one great film.

482
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,446
Sure, we had to
use shitty, cheap,

483
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,749
Digital video with no
semblance of a plot,

484
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,752
And resort to cheapo
fart jokes and use

485
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,322
Drunken crews and
have absolutely

486
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,223
No production values...

487
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,491
Because that's the
way Zelda would've

488
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,393
Wanted us to spend
the money intended

489
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,161
For her funeral and coffin.

490
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,597
So Zelda Lipshitz,
wherever you are,

491
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:08,335
"Julie Strain's Tales from the
Crapper" is dedicated to you.

492
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,603
This movie is your legacy.

493
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,839
Now how about that
blow job, Skinny?

494
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,140
You got it, partner.

495
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,678

496
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,615

MAN: More!

498
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,951
Faster!

499
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,986
(SINGING) I like
sex and violence...

500
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,488
MAN: Lloyd, oh Lloyd!

501
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,189
(SINGING) I like
blood and guts.

502
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,223
MAN: Oh, Lloyd!

503
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,892
I'm in heaven, Lloyd.

504
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,694
(SINGING) I like
the sound of silence

505
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,830
'Til it drives me totally nuts.

506
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,898
[Interposing voices]

507
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,867
(SINGING) And every
time I come around,

508
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:41,901
MAN: More!

509
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,303
(SINGING) You better
watch your yapper.

510
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,206
How many souls are buried
underground, watching

511
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,642
"Tales from the Crapper?"

512
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,643
Ah!

513
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,778
Don't forget the ballsack!

514
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:52,579
Ah!

515
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,546
Ah!

516
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,347
Ahhhhh!

517
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,886
Greetings from Tromaville
and welcome to the lovingly

518
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,555
Recreated, digitally
remastered, director's cut,

519
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,657
DVD version of...

520
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,060
MAN: That Troma triple beheader
of "Bloodspell," "Alien

521
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,598
Blood," and "Drawing Blood."

522
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,200
Directed by... oh, excuse
me, I gotta sneeze before I

523
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,402
Tell you who directed it.

524
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,636
Directed by...

525
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:20,973
MAN: Darren Warren, John
Sorensen, and Sergio Lapel.

526
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,942
One of my favorite directors.

527
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:23,976
How about you, Debbie Rochon?

528
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,678
Mine, too!

529
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,547
You know, I've been
having difficulty hearing,

530
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,915
Debbie Rochon.

531
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,118
Could you, perhaps, use this
to tell me who stars in, uh...

532
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,687
MAN: "Bloodspell?"

533
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,089
Tell us who stars in
that movie, Debbie.

534
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,091
Well, Lloyd.

535
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,927
MAN: Aaron Teach.

536
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,261
Woohoo!

537
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,697
Oh, that's fascinating
because... because...

538
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,333
MAN: Aaron Teach from
"Mirror of Death."

539
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,268
He's my favorite actor.

540
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:54,173
And who else stars in...
In, uh, in, uh, in, uh...

541
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,041
MAN: "Bloodspell."

542
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,376
[Vomiting]

543
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,145
MAN: Anthony Jenkins!

544
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,913
Waah!

545
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,015
Why, that's a great
cast, Debbie Rochon.

546
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,553
I... you know, I think that's one
of the reasons why... [vomiting]

547
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:10,156
MAN: The Troma triple beheader
of "Bloodspell," "Alien

548
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,225
Blood," and "Drawing Blood."

549
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,326
Is my very favorite.

550
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,528
I... I just love it.

551
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,630
I love the color and the
sound and the... you know,

552
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,365
It's an amazing film.

553
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,233
And I'll tell you
another thing, Debbie.

554
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,134
Did you know that...

555
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,636
MAN: "Alien Blood."

556
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,205
Was shot entirely
on location in...

557
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,574
MAN: England.

558
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,710
And... and another thing is
that did you know that the, uh,

559
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,044
It was produced by...

560
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,613
MAN: John Sorensen.

561
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,581
Thank you.

562
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,182
Eh... any more questions, Debbie?

563
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,451
Uh, I do have a question.

564
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:39,886
How did they do the thing...

565
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,456
MAN: in "Bloodspell" where
the guy gets set on fire?

566
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,290
Ah.

567
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,492
That's a very simple question.

568
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,193
That's what makes

569
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,961
MAN: "Bloodspell."

570
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,498
My favorite film of the...

571
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,732
MAN: Late '80s.

572
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,634
That period of time
is so fascinating.

573
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,936
Well, Debbie Rochon,
let's get ready to watch

574
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,338
The lovingly recreated,
digitally remastered,

575
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,940
Director's cut version of...

576
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,944
The Troma triple beheader of
"Bloodspell," "Alien Blood,"

577
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,646
And "Drawing Blood."

578
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:10,349
Let's watch.

579
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,218
[Heavy music]

580
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,086
I'm having so much fun.

581
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,955
Oh, greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

582
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,558
To the lovingly recreated,
digitally remastered,

583
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,960
Director's cut, DVD
version of Chris

584
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,862
Watson's "Slaughter Party."

585
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,331
And we're having a great party
here, aren't we Debbie Rochon?

586
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,766
Yeah!

587
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,835
Anyway, Chris Watson,
as you may know,

588
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,871
Is the director and creator
of the classic movie

589
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,072
"Zombiegeddon."

590
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,107
And it's a little-known
fact that "Zombiegeddon"

591
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:39,178
Is actually a shot-by-shot
remake of Spielberg's classic,

592
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,181
Seminal, epic,
black-men-on-a-boat movie,

593
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,449
"Amistad."

594
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,952
And speaking of seminal
movies, I made a movie called,

595
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,620
"I Am a Stud."

596
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,421
I'm having so much fun.

597
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,357
With "Slaughter Party,"
Chris Watson made

598
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,527
His own version of Spielberg's
"Schindler's List."

599
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,530
Instead of using
Nazis, he used midgets.

600
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,000
Instead of using pretentious
black-and-white film,

601
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,337
He uses crappy, digital
video... just like this intro!

602
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,207
I'm having so much fun!

603
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,710
And instead of
using European Jews,

604
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,479
He uses porno Jews,
like Adam Seymour

605
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,948
Butts Glasser and Ron Jeremy.

606
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,585
Wow, there are many famous
penises in this movie.

607
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,586
That's right, Lloyd.

608
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,688
But there's one more.

609
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:24,423
Falissa Rose is in this
movie, and if you remember,

610
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,593
She had a penis in
"Sleepaway Camp."

611
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,628
You know, I used to
have a penis once,

612
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:31,063
Uh, but it was a
small price to pay

613
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,265
For this Adonis-like physique.

614
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,267
Thank you, anabolic steroids.

615
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,003
You know, a little blood doping.

616
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,738
Oh, what... what time is it?

617
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,507
[Growls] How big is the
world, Debbie Rochon?

618
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,042
It's big, baby.

619
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:43,810
[Interposing voices]

620
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,977
Oh!

621
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,947
I'm so juiced up, I
could work for Tropicana.

622
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,916
Lloyd, you acted in this movie.

623
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,718
What can you tell us about it?

624
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:52,518
Wh... I was?

625
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,986
I acted in this movie?

626
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,622
You know, I gotta start
watching these Troma

627
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,223
Movies once in a while.

628
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,326
You know, Lloyd, some of us do
a little bit more around here

629
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,361
Than just playing with our cock.

630
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,162
Huh?

631
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,463
[Chicken noises]

632
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,233
It's not like I'm clucking
things up, Anorexia, right?

633
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,936
I'm having so much fun!

634
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,938
So let's watch "Slaughter
Party," directed

635
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:16,208
By Chris Watson, lovingly
made, digitally remastered,

636
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,410
Director's cut DVD.

637
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,211
Let's watch.

638
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,885
Greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

639
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,688
To the lovingly remastered,
digitally recreated,

640
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:33,893
Director's cut, DVD version
of Darren Warren's "Mirror"

641
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,962
Of Death."

642
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:39,799
Speaking of the mirror of death,
uh, on further reflection,

643
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,268
It has come to my attention
that many ugly people who

644
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,870
Have looked into
the mirror of death

645
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,039
Have... have had horrible
tragedies befall them.

646
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,342
We now switch you to Debbie
Rochon, roving reporter,

647
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,846
On location to investigate this
serious matter of the mirror

648
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,616
Of death and the ugly people.

649
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,553
Lloyd, I'm standing outside
the Troma building right now.

650
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:05,391
I'm investigating the origins
of the mirror of death.

651
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:09,328
It seems that ever since Troma
has released Mirror of Death

652
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:13,833
On DVD, ugly people have died
after looking in mirrors.

653
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,303
In fact, the Troma Homoland
Security Department

654
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,807
Has put celebrities like
Kathie Lee Gifford, Barbra

655
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,610
Streisand, Rosie O'Donnell,
and even Camryn Manheim

656
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,212
On orange alert.

657
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,414
They are not allowed
to look into mirrors.

658
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,750
Let's go now to some man
in the street interviews

659
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,451
I conducted earlier.

660
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,285
[Speaking german]

661
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,932
And now back to you, asshole!

662
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,900
That is fascinating, Debbie.

663
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,869
Now could give us
some more detail

664
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,105
About that classic
movie, Mirror of Death?

665
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,843
Mirror of Death stars Julie
Merrill, who played Woman

666
00:27:56,943 --> 00:28:01,981
At Bar in episode 2.5 of
that famous '90s sitcom,

667
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,415
Herman's Head.

668
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,584
Back to you, head cheese.

669
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,454
And Julie Merrill's performance
in that particular episode

670
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,857
Was almost as seamless
and as spotless

671
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,926
As Troma superstar, Will
Keenan's performance in Eternal

672
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:14,894
Sunshin of the Spotless Mind.

673
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,198
You hardly even know
Will's in the movie.

674
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,900
In fact, you can't even
find him in the movie.

675
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,435
That shows you the
genius of my brother,

676
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,138
The director, Charlie Kaufman.

677
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:26,939
OK, biatch.

678
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,340
Back to you.

679
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,178
It also stars Jack
Castro, who has

680
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,116
Been president of The Poseidon
Adventure fan club since 1999.

681
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,585
Back to you, fuck head.

682
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,153
That's fascinating,
Debbie, but I'm

683
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,456
President of The Return to the
Poseidon Adventure fan club.

684
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,525
Now that's a true classic.

685
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,027
And now Debbie, would
you please tell me

686
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:51,463
What that crappy, movie,
Mario of Death is all about?

687
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:56,002
Mirror of Death is about an
abused woman who conjures up

688
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,270
Evil spirits to
get revenge on all

689
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,773
The men who mistreated
her, just like you've

690
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:03,109
Mistreated me, fuckwad.

691
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:06,846
You talentless hack,
bullshit filmmaker.

692
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:07,646
Back to you.

693
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,348
That's fascinating, Debbie.

694
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,584
But it's a little known fact,
Debbie, that Mirror of Death

695
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,055
Was going to be one of the
great movie franchises.

696
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,624
There was going to be many
Mirror of Death movies.

697
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:22,061
There was going to be Fork
of Death, Toothpick of Death,

698
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,730
Dental Floss of Death,
Salami of Death,

699
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,699
Doorknob of Deathm A Gunshot
in the Head of Death,

700
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,236
And my personal
favorite, Dom Deluise

701
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,238
And the Magic Muffin of Death.

702
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,941
Yes, The Mirror of Death was
destined to be the world's

703
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,475
Greatest film franchise.

704
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,111
Unfortunately, there was a
terrible, terrible problem

705
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,280
In the copyright office
because it turns out

706
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,149
That all those films
have already been

707
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,117
Made by Francis Ford Coppola.

708
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,618
Now back to you, cunt.

709
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,589
Well, shit for
brains, Mirror of Death

710
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,358
Is a very serious movie.

711
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:58,397
If you break a mirror, you
get seven queers bad fuck.

712
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,933
I'm sorry, Debbie,
but you're breaking up.

713
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,904
It sounded like you said,
seven queers of bad fuck.

714
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:05,972
Yes, Lloyd.

715
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,641
I did say, seven
queers bad fuck.

716
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,912
If you break a mirror,
Lloyd, you will get the worst

717
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,414
Gay gang banging ever.

718
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,684
And your ass will
bleed for weeks.

719
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,587
Seven queers bad fuck?

720
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,155
Oh, Debbie, that
sounds horrible.

721
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,424
That sounds just terrible.

722
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,360
That sounds... Oh!

723
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,331
I... Oh, I guess I broke
the mirror of death.

724
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,100
MAN (OFF SCREEN): Are
you ready, sailor?

725
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,036
Because you have
seven pink torpedoes

726
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,671
Aimed at the SS Brown Eye.

727
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,807
What?

728
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,643
I've never done anything
like that before.

729
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,078
Let me just get my
whip, and my mask,

730
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,547
And the hot candle
wax, and the gerbil.

731
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,548
No, no.

732
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,516
I've got a hamster
in here somewhere.

733
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:51,683
Hold on a sec,
where's that hamster?

734
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,751
Goddammit.

735
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,155
Oh... wha... back to
you, Debbie, and hi-ho!

736
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:59,058
[Television static]

737
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,132
OK, boys!

738
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,233
Come on, now.

739
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,367
This bung hole isn't
going to fill itself.

740
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,301
[Farting noises]

741
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,203
Now where is that hamster?

742
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,671
Where the hell is that...

743
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,306
Greetings from
Tromaville and welcome

744
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,342
To the lovingly
recreated, digitally

745
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:22,714
Mastered director's cut DVD of
The Triple Beheader of... what?

746
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,515
Wait a minute.

747
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,516
What triple beheader?

748
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,851
I don't even know
what I'm... I need

749
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,486
An expert on triple beheaders.

750
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:28,587
What... oh, my heavens!

751
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,688
Look who's here!

752
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,490
Oh, ow, oh!

753
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,491
Hey, Lloyd.

754
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,825
Why, it's Debbie Rochon.

755
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,762
Debbie Rochon, star of Terror
Firmer, Tromeo and Juliet,

756
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,597
The independent screen goddess.

757
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,632
Debbie, what... what...
Tell us what's up!

758
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,069
Well, uh, your
colon and checks out.

759
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,436
Why, thank you, Debbie
Rochon, but we're

760
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,038
Talking about triple beheaders.

761
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:51,477
Oh, well, on this DVD, we
have Killy Billy Vampire.

762
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,278
My!

763
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:53,879
And what else?

764
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,581
Sucker the Vampire.

765
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:56,949
And?

766
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,350
Tainted.

767
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,153
By the way, I do need
to check out your taint.

768
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,855
I guess people can enjoy
the movies while I go

769
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,024
And check out your taint.

770
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,158
Hold on.

771
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,393
Why, thank you, Debbie Rochon.

772
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,860
That's fascinating.

773
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,963
At any rate, triple
beheader is a...

774
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,131
[Sucking sounds]

775
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,933
Three movies on one disk,
thank to the miracle

776
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,669
Psychology of V3 technology.

[Chainsaw buzzing]

778
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,240
V3 technology is
the only technology

779
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,043
That can produce the
highest quality to put

780
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,145
Three movies on one disk.

781
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:30,649
It's like... it's not a
box set, it's a boxette.

782
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,987
Now Debbie Rochon, what were
those movies that are on this?

783
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,522
Oh, that was, uh,
taint-a-riffic!

784
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,657
By the way, your taints
look really good.

785
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,458
Thank you.

786
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,292
Yeah.

787
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,860
You're taint... tainted welcome.

788
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,296
Uh, we have Rockabilly Vampire.

789
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,232
Where is Rockabilly
Vampire from?

790
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,766
Uh, the south?

791
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,734
No, it's from Taintsilvania.

792
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,002
Oh!

793
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,303
Sorry!

794
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,106
And we have Sucker, the
Vampire, which, you know,

795
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,741
I'll have to check
that out later, too.

796
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,543
And we have Taint.

797
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,477
Tainted, the movie.

798
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,278
Tainted.

799
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:00,246
Oh, yeah.
Tainted.

800
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,913
Da Vinci was a great
tainter, I know.

801
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,783
At any rate, this is
Lloyd Kaufman and...

802
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,085
Debbie Rochon.

803
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:10,222
And we're pleased to bring
you the triple beheader of...

804
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,490
Tainted.

805
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,960
Let's watch!

Yahoo!

808
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,701
Yeah, greetings
from Tromaville.

809
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,337
And welcome to the lovingly
recreated, digitally

810
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:29,007
Remastered director's cut
DVD of "Ragin' Cajun."

811
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,877
Now Debbie Rochon,
what can you tell us

812
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,380
About this amazing
film, "Ragin' Cajun."

813
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,748
Well, like many movies
from the '90s, from "Home"

814
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,817
Alone " to " Terminator 2.

815
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,788
"Ragin' Cajun" is about a
Vietnam vet kick boxer who

816
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,257
Becomes a country music singer!

817
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:50,062
Only, in "Ragin' Cajun," Troma's
terminator is David Heavener.

818
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,029
Wow.

819
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,564
That is fascinating,
Debbie Rochon,

820
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,600
But I would like
to know, Anorexia,

821
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,735
Could you tell us please,
who is the director?

822
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,036
The style is fascinating.

823
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:58,837
Definitely.

824
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,239
William Byron Hillman.

825
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,440
Woo!

826
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,008
William Byron Hillman
is not only the director,

827
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,777
But he has three names,
just like Mary Kate Olsen,

828
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,045
Only he's not as fat.

829
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,314
Who else, for example?

830
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:09,848
There must be some other
stars in this wonderful film?

831
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:10,882
Yes.

832
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,884
Sam Bottoms, who was
in Apocalypse Now.

833
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,722
And let's not forget Samantha
Eggers, who was in The Brude.

834
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,624
Well, I like to keep
my bottoms in shape

835
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,560
By starting every day
with two delicious eggers

836
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,995
And some fresh brewed coffee.

837
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,098
You know, I was thinking,
Debbie Rochon, while we're

838
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,333
Having this great hoedown.

839
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,934
You know, I got those
airplane tickets.

840
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,903
I'm going to go down to New
Orleans, home of Ragin' Cajun

841
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,839
Because we're getting ready
to do Tromance Gone Wild.

842
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:34,640
Yeah!

843
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,841
And I'm so excited!

844
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,943
I was so excited about
going down to Mardi Gras,

845
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,646
I bought myself a plane
ticket way, way in advance.

846
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,214
And it cost me a
lot of money, too.

847
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,350
In fact, it made
me into a po'boy.

848
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,119
I think this Ragin'
Cajun DVD... I think

849
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,388
It's going to be the biggest
thing to hit New Orleans

850
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,257
Since Katrina and the waves.

851
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:52,658
MAN (OFF SCREEN): Oh!

852
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,459
[Growling]

853
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,427
Have you no decency, sir?

854
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,864
As usual, Lloyd,
very bad taste.

855
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,499
Well, what... what are
you looking so sore about?

856
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,868
Katrina and The Waves
had a big hit song.

857
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,736
It was called,
Walking on Sunshine.

858
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,538
There were people in New
Orleans that loved it.

859
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:07,606
Yeah, it was a big hit!
New Orleans loved...

860
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,840
Lloyd!
Lloyd!

861
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,809
There was just a big
hurricane down in New Orleans

862
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,010
Called Katrina.

863
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,613
It almost wiped everything
out, killed hundreds,

864
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:15,847
And made the police go looting.

865
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,648
What?

866
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:17,449
What?

867
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,017
Oh, the humanity!

868
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,786
My ticket's nonrefundable!

869
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:24,656
Call FEMA, call The Red
Cross, call my travel agent.

870
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,558
Lloyd, you can't joke
about the hurricane.

871
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,660
Only politicians can!

872
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,729
If you can't joke
about the hurricane,

873
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,732
Then the terrorists
will have won!

874
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,735
The terrorists didn't create
the hurricane, God did!

875
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,371
Then God is a terrorist
and we must bring him down!

876
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,339
We must kill him!

877
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,340
Mission accomplished!

878
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,408
Mission accomplished!

879
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:43,209
Hey, bring it on!

880
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,476
Bring it on!

881
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,677
We've won!

882
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:46,512
Albert Gore!

883
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,679
You take over, Debbie Rochon!

884
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,215
Debbie Rochon, take over!

885
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:51,283
I've got... I've got to take
care of these plane tickets.

886
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,351
I want my money back!

887
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:53,552
All right.

888
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,722
Well, this DVD, Ragin'
Cajun also features Trauma

889
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,258
System Troma Informercial.

890
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,992
It aired on Comedy
Central and it

891
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,128
Featured that thin
guy who tried to pan

892
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,631
Himself off as Michael Herz.

893
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,965
Now look, you!

894
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,334
I don't care, you get me the
money... you can get someone

895
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,835
Else to buy my airplane ticket!

896
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,337
What are you talking
about, people don't want

897
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:12,838
To go to a city underwater?

898
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,940
Tourists go to
Venice every year!

899
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,342
Oh!

900
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:19,745
Anyway, let's get ready to watch
the... the lovingly recreated,

901
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,715
Digitally remastered directors
DVD version of William

902
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:27,786
Jennings Bryan's classic
film, Ragin' Cajun

903
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,121
Now Debbie Rochon...

904
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,022
(IN UNISON) Let's watch!

905
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,208
Greetings from Tromavile.

906
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,978
This is Debbie Rochon and
as some of you may know,

907
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,081
I recently had brain surgery!

908
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,616
[Groaning]

909
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,285
But it all worked out!

910
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,587
[Cheering]

911
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,955
Yeah, but the bad news is
there is some bad news.

912
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,657
My doctors don't think
I'm going to make it

913
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,158
Through this DVD introduction.

914
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,360
[Groaning]

915
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,663
But... But there is good news.

916
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,466
From the same happy
accidents of technology,

917
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,802
The same happy accidents
where those idiot

918
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,537
Astronauts were walking
around on the moon and they

919
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,638
Discovered Tang...

920
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,239
[Cheering]

921
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,309
Yeah, baby, Tang!

922
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,810
[Cheering]

923
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,077
That's right.

924
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,213
When the doctors were rummaging
around through my brain,

925
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,317
They found the same
type of happy accident.

926
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,053
A new technology,
Brain-O-Vision.

927
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,055
[Cheering]

928
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,390
Yeah!

929
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,660
It's this groovy new chip
that's implanted in your head

930
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,429
Where you can
actually read people's

931
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,764
Thoughts right on the screen.

932
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,467
That is, if you have a brain.

933
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,468
Hey, Debbie!
Debbie Rochon!

934
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,736
Lloyd Kaufman!

935
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,671
Why, thank you so much for
introducing this lovingly

936
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,640
Recreated, digitally
remastered director's

937
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,311
Cut DVD of the fifth volume
of The Best of Troma Dance.

938
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,812
I would have done this
introduction myself,

939
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:01,847
But I'm just so busy.

940
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,720
No problem, Lloyd.

941
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,088
Anything for you.

942
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:14,225
Did you know that Troma Dance...

943
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,462
Now did you know that
Troma Dance, the only truly

944
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:19,398
Independent film festival
on the entire planet,

945
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,100
Is celebrating it's 10th
anniversary this year?

946
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,202
Wow, Debbie Rochon, queen
of independent cinema, that

947
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,604
Is terrific!

948
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,906
And you know, Troma Dance is the
only festival where you don't

949
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,808
Have to pay submission fees.

950
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,410
When you submit your
movie, it's free.

951
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,678
It's not like
Sundance where they

952
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:34,680
Make you pay a lot of
money to submit your movie

953
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,515
And then they don't even
give you a fuck you letter.

954
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,283
Yes, Troma Dance is also free.

955
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:41,987
You can watch the movies for
free and there's no VIP policy.

956
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,355
Everyone is equal.

957
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:46,024
Even Karen Black, who was our
big guest, big super guest,

958
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,361
Last year, ate the cold pizza
just like everybody else.

959
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:50,796
It's hard to believe
that Troma Dance

960
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,263
Has been around for 10 years.

961
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,533
If I'm not mistaken,
that's an entire decade

962
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:58,136
Of real independence in Park
City, not fake independence.

963
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,305
And that's because
of the Troma fans!

964
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,106
Wow!

965
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,140
We love our fans.

966
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,575
That's why we're
bringing you the

967
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:09,247
Fifth... the fifth big volume
of The Best of Troma Dance DVD!

968
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,215
[Cheering]

969
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,517
Hey, hey, can we
have your autograph?

970
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,684
Oh, certainly, my young man.

971
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,119
Oh, not you, you
fucking old man.

972
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,721
Debbie, can we have
your autograph, please?

973
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,465
Lloyd, can I borrow your pen?

974
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,766
Thank you.
Right here?

975
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,767
Yeah.

976
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,301
A little lower?

977
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,102
Oh, sure.

978
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:31,903
A little lower.

979
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,840
Um, OK.

980
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,775
Oh, yeah.

981
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,743
Debbie, oh, yes!

982
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:38,577
Oh!

983
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:39,645
That scar looks so sexy on you.

984
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:40,512
That's so...

985
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,780
- Oh, the one on my head?
- Yeah.

986
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,581
Thank you.

987
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,784
Yeah, it looks
really, really hot.

988
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,391
Let's get read to watch the
lovingly recreated, digitally

989
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:28,860
Remastered director's
cut DVD of The Best

990
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,996
Of Troma Dance Volume Five.

991
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,466
Let's watch!

992
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,435
[Music playing]

993
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,844
[Silly music playing]

994
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:21,947
[Dance music playing]

995
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:22,948
How are you?

996
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:23,915
You made it!

997
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,854
How are you guys doing?

998
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,427
Turn the camera off.

999
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,805
Greetings not from Tromaville,
but from the luxurious,

1000
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:50,141
All steel and glass
Raymond Chandler Pavilion,

1001
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,843
Here in sunny Hollywood.

1002
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,145
I'm Lloyd Kaufman, president
of Troma Entertainment

1003
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,047
And creator of
The Toxic Avenger.

1004
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,718
And we're hosting the
Debbie Rochon Tribute.

1005
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,419
Yes, it's only
logical that I should

1006
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,723
Be the host because I'm the one
who discovered Debbie Rochon.

1007
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,491
You know, one of the
reasons Troma is so famous

1008
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:07,693
Is that we have
been the breeding

1009
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:10,829
Ground, the discoverers
of amazing, new talent.

1010
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:14,432
Samuel L. Jackson appears
in... in Death by Temptation.

1011
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,636
And Kevin Costner's
in Sizzle Beach USA.

1012
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,105
Robert De Niro's first
film is The Wedding Party.

1013
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,674
Trey Parker and Matt Stone
are in Troma's Cannibal,

1014
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:23,642
The Musical.

1015
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,310
But I think our
greatest discovery,

1016
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,878
Our greatest
achievement is bringing

1017
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:30,882
Forth to the silver screen the
talents of Miss Debbie Rochon.

1018
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:34,419
Yes, I immediately noticed
her two greatest talents.

1019
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,220
Acting...

1020
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,655
[Fog horn blowing]

1021
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:37,623
And acting.

1022
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,024
[Fog horn blowing]

1023
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,926
To tell you the
truth, I was blinded

1024
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,394
By the fabulousness
of Debbie Rochon

1025
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,964
And I decided to make
a major investment.

1026
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,066
So I showered her with gold.

1027
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,400
LLOYD KAUFMANN (VOICE
OVER): Oh, Debbie.

1028
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,302
You are so talented
and beautiful,

1029
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,605
I'm going to shower
you with gold.

1030
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:56,975
I think you are Troma-riffic.

1031
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,277
[1980's music playing]

1032
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:03,314
I've just been pissed on by
a blind, independent movie

1033
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,449
Director!

1034
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,851
Yuck!

1035
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,654
At any rate, I am not the only
fan of the award winning Miss

1036
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,089
Rochon and her Golden Globes.

1037
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,925
She has legions of loyal
fans all over the world

1038
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,828
And we have asked some of
them to film themselves

1039
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,329
Paying tribute to her.

1040
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,331
For example, in this
first one, you're

1041
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,769
Going to observe choreographer
Mikhail Baryshnikov.

1042
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,571
But what's interesting is he
has chosen as his director

1043
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:30,008
None other than the legendary
Russian filmmaker, Andrei

1044
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,009
Tarkovsky.

1045
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,244
Note, if you will,
how Tarkovsky uses

1046
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:37,248
The masterful wide shot and
never ever cuts to a close up.

1047
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,951
You'll also notice
that Baryshnikov, who

1048
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:44,189
Refers to himself now as
Debbie's superfan Tim...

1049
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,892
Baryshnikov also has a
complete Debbie Rochon

1050
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,195
Collection in his basement,
but the brilliant Tarkovsky

1051
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,031
Does not dare to tempt
us with closeups of any

1052
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,667
Of the Debbie memorabilia.

1053
00:43:55,767 --> 00:44:00,872
Let's watch superfan Tim,
aka Mikhail Baryshnikov.

1054
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,174
I am here with The
Wall's creator, The Buck.

1055
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:07,779
What exactly is
The Wall of Rochon?

1056
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,114
Let me tell you there, brother.

1057
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:14,986
The Wall of Rochon, it's
the most electrifying wall

1058
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:18,156
In the world today.

1059
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,326
This wall has it all.

1060
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,361
But what makes this
wall really special

1061
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:28,566
Is that it's entirely
dedicated to the goddess

1062
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:33,171
Of all that is good and evil,
the lovely and talented Debbie

1063
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:33,972
Rochon.

1064
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,044
So why, out of all the
people in the entire world,

1065
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:40,812
Would you choose Debbie Rochon?

1066
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:46,617
Well, that's simple.

1067
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:53,024
Debbie Rochon is the best
there is, the best there was,

1068
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:55,526
And the best there ever will be.

1069
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,196
She is truly an inspiration.

1070
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,199
She's overcome the
odds her entire life

1071
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,869
And is still a
sweet, kind, caring,

1072
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,837
And wonderful human being.

1073
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:11,542
Debbie Rochon truly
is one of a kind.

1074
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:16,014
So let's discuss exactly what
is on The Wall of Rochon.

1075
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:22,153
We have Scream Queen
Illustrated signed

1076
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,389
Trading cards right here.

1077
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,859
We have cards from
The Santa Claus,

1078
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,361
They're from Scream
Queens Illustrated also.

1079
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,363
They're signed by Debbie Rochon.

1080
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,866
Then we have some
signed terror cards.

1081
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,668
I actually busted a 60 box case.

1082
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:38,804
It took me forever.

1083
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,639
I even put the sets
together of terror cards

1084
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,875
Just to get Debbie
Rochon's autos.

1085
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:54,485
Then if you take a close look,
over here, in the corner,

1086
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,023
You will see a
gold sequin dress.

1087
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,491
That dress right there
is the exact dress

1088
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,328
You can see Debbie wearing
in the movie, Terror Firmer,

1089
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,831
At the end of the movie.

1090
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:06,865
It's a very lovely dress.

1091
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:08,967
I am very proud to own it.

1092
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,036
If you look in the
middle here, you'll

1093
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:15,773
See a white tank top
covered in blood, which is

1094
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:18,409
Also signed by Debbie Rochon.

1095
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,378
And you will also
see a blue nurse's

1096
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,115
Scrub, which is also
covered in blood

1097
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,516
And signed by Debbie Rochon.

1098
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,319
Both of these pieces were worn
by the lovely and talented

1099
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:31,722
Actress in the opening
kill seen of the movie,

1100
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:33,224
American Nightmare.

1101
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,225
She was great in that movie.

1102
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,427
She was a true, true psycho.

1103
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,333
And if you look over here,
in this corner over here,

1104
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,903
You will a lovely jacket.

1105
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:47,205
This jacket is a
favorite piece of mine

1106
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,574
Because it was worn
by Debbie Rochon

1107
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,409
In the movie, Abducted 2.

1108
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,945
But what makes it
really special is

1109
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:57,248
This jacket here was
Debbie Rochon's jacket

1110
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,616
Before and after the movie.

1111
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,818
It was her personal jacket.

1112
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:01,887
It's an amazing piece.

1113
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,188
It really is.

1114
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,690
And then if you look down
here, you'll see the latest

1115
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,426
Addition to my collection.

1116
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:13,364
These gloves were worn by Debbie
Rochon in the movie, Zeppo.

1117
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,000
Debbie Rochon actually
gave these to me

1118
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,735
As a gift when I
met her for the very

1119
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,440
First time at Fangoria Weekend
in Chicago, Illinois this year.

1120
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,343
It was truly a wonderful event.

1121
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,578
And then down here, you will
see my DVD collection and

1122
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,016
A few VHSs from Debbie Rochon.

1123
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:32,984
I've only got about
60 total right now,

1124
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,485
So I got a ways to go there.

1125
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,387
Basically, you'll
see others items,

1126
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:39,357
Like the autographed Scream
Queens Illustrated magazines,

1127
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,293
The B Movie Survival
Guide, Debbie's poster

1128
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,230
Book, and some other photos.

1129
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,400
But Debbie Rochon truly
is an amazing woman.

1130
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,039
And I'm truly honored to
have this wall right here,

1131
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:58,276
Right in my home, as a tribute
to such a wonderful woman.

1132
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:04,349
Wow, Buck.

1133
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:07,618
Seems like you are a really
good fan of Debbie Rochon.

1134
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,356
Until next time, this is Biff.

1135
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:12,223
See you around the corner.

1136
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:16,928
For our next piece, we
called upon the talents

1137
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,965
Of none other than
French New Wave director,

1138
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:23,701
Jean-Luc Godard, who, as you
know, pioneered the jump cut.

1139
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:30,208
In this particular sequence that
pays tribute to Debbie Rochon,

1140
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:34,612
Gerard Depardieu plays the
part of Joe the Truckdriver.

1141
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,082
And we needed a
blank wall for this.

1142
00:48:37,182 --> 00:48:40,218
So even though this sequence
was filmed on the Champs Elysees

1143
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,820
During The Cannes Film Festival,
thanks to those good dream

Has been invested in the highest
state of the art brown screen

1146
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:56,501
CGI, so that the drab wall
that you see behind Joe

1147
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,569
The Truckdriver
could be created.

1148
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,839
You'd never guess that this
sequence wasn't actually shot

1149
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,175
Against a crappy looking wall.

1150
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:04,976
Let's watch!

1151
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,429

but during the filming

Featuring Mary Woronov,
many of the cast

1154
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:08,139
Would sit back and watch
Debbie Rochon footage.

1155
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,142
So when you're watching this
archival footage of Fanatic

Mike watching Debbie
Rochon's movie,

1157
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:17,282
Nowhere Man, make sure you watch
for the experimental technique

It's movie night.

1162

I'm figuring out what to watch.

1163
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,729
That's easy around here.

1164
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:34,365
It's usually a
Debbie Rochon film.

1165
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:37,468
Her movies usually give
me a lot of entertainment

1166
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,904

off to getting the ever

Well, tonight,
we're going to try

1169
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:49,013
And sit down and watch a great
film called, Nowhere Man.

1170
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,850
One of Debbie's latest movies,
very critically acclaimed,

1171
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,885
Great all around family film.

1172

If you've seen it, don't
give me ending here.

I want to find for myself.

1174
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:00,658
It's taking me
enough courage just

1175
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,527
To try and even get to
watch a movie like this

1176
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:05,130
Because frankly,
getting my penis

1177
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,633
Cut off, or watching
a man's penis cut off

1178
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,101
Gives me the shivers.

1179
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:15,206

1189
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:40,298
That your penis was

sharp instrument.

Would be the erectile

1197
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:00,117

folded over the skin

1198
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,586

00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:01,906
You ready?

1229
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:02,840
Yes, go!

1230
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,009
Lloyd, I think
we should go now!

1231
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,477

1232
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,478
Lloyd!

1233
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,279

1234

1235
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:12,417
Lloyd, I think
we should go now!

1236
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:15,553
That is... sadly, that
is a perfect, uh...

1237
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:16,354
Imitation?

1238
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,187
Impression?

1239
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:18,523
Imitation... impression of me.

1240
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,357
Yes.

1241
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:20,391
That was me being Debbie Rochon.

1242
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,792
And look, it's George!

1243
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:25,730
And look at George, who is...
Who can tell you a quote

1244
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,831
From American Nightmare.

1245
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,400
If you can, a quote
from American Nightmare.

1246
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,335
SAL (OFF SCREEN): Uh oh.

1247
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:33,304
My game and I'll
play by my rules!

1248
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:34,238
Wow!

1249
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:35,205
That's good!

1250
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,575
And look, it's [inaudible]!

1251
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,009
And I can tell you
right now exactly what

1252
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,478

1253
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:41,712
Sorry!

1254
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,280
And as a matter of fact,
he probably bought something

1255
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,450
He can show you right now.

1256
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,418
Sure.

1257
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,420
See!

1258
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,890
GEORGE (OFF SCREEN): And don't
forget to buy a grave digger!

1259
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,862

guys on television?

1260
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,465
Like, limited edition!

1261
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:02,333
Now who can resist
the irresistible

1262
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:06,504
And wacky filmmaking style of
Scandinavian pioneer, Lars Von

1263

Trier.

1264
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:09,907
Yes, that Danish cheese
cake has brought you

1265
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:13,378
An incredible sequence using
his famous Dogpile95 method

1266
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,814
Of filmmaking in his
native language, entitled...

1267
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,248
[Speaking fake danish]

1268
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:27,625
Loosely translated, it refers to
webmaster of debbierochon.com.

1269
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,294
Let's watch!

1270
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:33,163
I've actually know
Debbie since 2000.

1271
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,201
We met through a mutual
friend of ours, Dick Culpa.

1272
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:41,305
Dick was the then owner and
publisher of Crack Magazine.

1273
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:44,074
And I was working for
him as Crack's webmaster,

1274
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,612
One of its contributing
writers, artists and editors.

1275
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:52,550
And Debbie had signed on to be
a character called Miss Cracked.

1276
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,619
Anybody that's familiar
with the magazine

1277
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,754
Would recall Nancy
Dickering, she

1278
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:01,826
Is a Hollywood Reporter
type... crack reporter

1279
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:03,694
Character within the magazine.

1280
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:06,063
And we were going to go
ahead and replace her

1281
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,633
With the Miss Crack character.

1282
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:11,769
Now we did do a couple
photo shoots with Debbie.

1283
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,870
We did do a couple parodies.

1284
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,138
In the magazine.

1285
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,674
As a matter of fact, I believe
it was issue number 357.

1286
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:22,112
We actually did a Toxic
Avenger, Citizen Toxi parody.

1287
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,382
I actually didn't sign on
to be Debbie's webmaster

1288
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:28,886
Until Halloween of 2002.

1289
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,921
During that time,
I took the website

1290
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:34,492
And completely tore it
down and redesigned it.

1291
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:38,863
I gave it more of a
look of Debbie Rochon.

1292
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:44,234
I gave it more of a horror,
more of a Hollywood,

1293
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:48,606
More of a scream
queen... more Debbie.

Rochon in cherry blossoms

I'm also the world's number
one fan of Debbie Rochon

1305
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,839
And her nudity in film.

1306
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,508
Talk about a reason
to celebrate,

1307
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,710
Actually make that two reasons.

1308
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,645
Debbie debuted in
the 1981 jail bait

1309
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:30,681
Classic, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Fabulous Stains.

1310
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,717
Even then, it was clear
that this Utah native

1311
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,552
Radiated pure star power.

1312
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:37,354
And I've got some fabulous
stains to prove it!

1313
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,356
Thankfully, has Debbie
scaled the heights of B

D cup at a time,

1317

In the 1996 classic,
Tromeo and Juliet... it's

1318
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:51,836
One of the all time
great lesbian scenes.

1319
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:54,872
Forget Shakespearean
monologues, this is the Vagina

1320
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,307
Monologues done right.

1321
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:00,077
After Tromeo, Debbie went
on to do dazzling nude work

1322
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:02,613
In the Troma epics,
Terror Firmer and Tales

well on Troma's, Edge TV.

from The Toxic Avenger

1329
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:20,264
And keep a mop handy.

so many talented people,

We have seen many sides
of Miss Debbie Rochon.

1339
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:44,488
I prefer her front side and
her backside, of course.
