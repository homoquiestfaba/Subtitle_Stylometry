1
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,956
Luther.

2
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:23,955
Luther.

3
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:30,275
Where is this guy?

4
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,658
Are you ready?
- If.

5
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,249
You nervous.
- No, Dad.

6
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:58,773
If you lie, your nose will grow.
- It will not.

7
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,179
When you feel nervous,
remember what I said.

8
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,895
Close your eyes and make
realize you're there.

9
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,995
Right.

10
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:11,403
What is this?

11
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:16,545
I wanted to show my friends.

12
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:20,762
We are all very proud,
reverend. Very proud.

13
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:24,075
Come on, Luther.
- Come on.

14
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,114
Farewell to all.

15
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,568
God bless.

16
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,621
What is it?
- Nothing.

17
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:48,852
Come on, tell me you have.

18
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:57,041
Why did you kill her?
- Because I was scared.

19
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,165
Mama.

20
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:16,117
Do you believe God created
heaven and earth...

21
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,047
...and populated the world... </ i>...

22
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:23,247
...without a specific purpose?
If so, you are wrong. </ I>...

23
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:28,469
...We were made to live apart. </ I>...

24
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,309
What?
- Changed the channel.

25
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,498
Outside.

26
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:45,047
I forbid you see that guy in
front of your brothers, Owen.

27
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,969
What will you do today?

28
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,465
Riding Underwear drinking beer?

29
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:56,154
There is a place in the canteen.

30
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:58,109
I'm not flipping burgers.

31
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,238
Need your help.
Are also part of this family.

32
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,898
Call this family.?

33
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,340
Good day.
How are you, Margo?

34
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:10,397
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
I tried to call but you were out.

35
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:13,387
What is it?
Tell me.

36
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:19,063
BLACK DIE.

37
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:24,375
If you are going to get names, at least
could write well.

38
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,218
We will continue.

39
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:59,139
Never miss sacred oath.

40
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:05,127
To join us, you're missing
and government favoritism towards...

41
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:08,011
Blacks.
Sentences yellow hordes...

42
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:12,468
...and the crowds of Latinos
invade our own shores.

43
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:19,357
Y complaints
dirty money vile Jewish bankers.

44
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,424
Never betray your white brothers.

45
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,480
Never rest until we obtain our Aryan Nation,

46
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:33,376
under one God as one race pristine.

47
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:37,667
While contaminated slag there between us,

48
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,832
hatred is our law and our mission revenge.

49
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:46,800
Owen Tucker,
what do you say?

50
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,366
Patriots let me join their ranks.

51
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:18,204
Now you have a home.
And you are welcome.

52
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:29,883
White Power.
White Power.

53
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:37,376
Well, calm down.

54
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,154
Davey, Mikey,
Behave.

55
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:48,970
For today's meeting,
I have a very special surprise.

56
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:54,555
Under the direction of
Miss Elizabeth Jackson...

57
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,071
,

58
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:59,536
please receive the vocal group
that was state champion...

59
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,636
...

60
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:03,513
Liberty Baptist Choir.

61
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:42,137
Brothers, today we have something special
.

62
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,662
Reverend Phelps.
Good to see.

63
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,304
Before a black
knew the meaning of a cross on fire.

64
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:12,814
Killing me will not shut up the truth.

65
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,208
No, no, Reverend, nobody said
anything about killing...

66
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,308
.

67
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:20,313
I just want to read the newspaper.

68
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,107
It's amazing what one can find. Like today.

69
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:27,294
Luther Reverend Phelps father,

70
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:30,639
Liberty Baptist preacher,

71
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,890
used his pulpit to attack racial,

72
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:40,028
blah, blah, blah,
lots of chatter...

73
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,726
Here follows.
And I quote:

74
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:50,303
Earth
Aria has attracted radical racists, </ i>...

75
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,854
......

76
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:56,280
...are here just to spread
their message of hate. </ I>...

77
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,560
...says Phelps called these groups...

78
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,587
A scourge of the earth.

79
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:05,357
Spank?

80
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,677
Strong words, right?

81
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:19,216
Tell me, have you ever played to baseball?

82
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:22,671
Surely if.

83
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:28,654
Abner Doubleday,
a white,

84
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,731
invented baseball...

85
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:38,794
For people to learn coordination...

86
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:43,651
...and to keep your eyes on the ball.

87
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:55,465
Reverend, I invited today...

88
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:01,674
...
promoting some computer game.

89
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,790
You have to have some respect...

90
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,010
On the other team.
Do you understand?

91
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,763
What I mean, black?.

92
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,753
Respect applies to everyone,

93
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,123
or not true for anyone.

94
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:25,129
God does not judge us by
the color of our skin...

95
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,478
.

96
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:29,405
Take that as a 'yes.'

97
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:35,151
Reverend, I'm glad we had this talk,

98
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:40,666
and could share his wisdom with us
black, white trash.

99
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:45,890
Go.

100
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:49,393
Go and take care, okay?

101
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:53,886
Come on, no kidding.
Go.

102
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,266
Damn, I forgot something, Reverend.

103
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,509
Make
a message to all those who oppose us.

104
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:10,439
No longer we will be a silent majority.

105
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:15,828
This is the land of the white man.

106
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:21,210
Blacks will not be tolerated.

107
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:25,154
What do they say?
- White Power.

108
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:31,307
White Power.
White Power.

109
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,869
Sorry, does a payphone?

110
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,708
At the side of the men's room.
- Thanks.

111
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,633
Thank you, Georgia.

112
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,184
A bat.

113
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,647
Problem, honey?

114
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,108
You're hurting me.
- He's right.

115
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:31,002
Misconduct had not.
Do not hurt you, right?

116
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,909
Miss, could you give me a cup of coffee?

117
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,447
Does not seem right.

118
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:49,492
Maybe it's friendly.

119
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:55,239
Best show him what kind of
can be friends, right?

120
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,439
Free.
- Are you sure?

121
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,428
Thanks.

122
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,585
Hello, how are you?
- What?

123
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:10,748
're Not from around here or
you meet. Are you passing through?

124
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:13,653
Yes, sorry...
- I'm Donnie Hensen.

125
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,067
How is? Tommy Lee.
- Lee?

126
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:23,572
Is a good southern name,

127
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:26,710
as the Confederation
General Robert E. Lee.

128
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,810
Is it related?

129
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,304
A taste, sorry.

130
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,615
Where are you going?

131
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:39,715
Maybe we can catch up.

132
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:44,597
It's fine.
- Are you sure?

133
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
If.
- Agreed.

134
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,876
Volverás.

135
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:17,319
MISSING Reverend Luther
Phelps, father. </ I>.

136
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
By God.

137
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:41,298
Problem, Officer?
- If.

138
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:45,425
're Late...
And you walk.

139
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:49,510
I got your message.
- Good to see you, Jack.

140
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,343
Good thing see me.

141
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:56,713
How are you? Dejame.
- No, I will send a tow truck for the car.

142
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:00,674
Susan takes all week waiting.
Cooked everything you bought.

143
00:23:00,774 --> 00:23:05,194
Cooking? - Is improving.
- You can not get any worse.

144
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
What happened?

145
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,157
Liberty is not what it was, Tommy.

146
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:37,765
Come on, Luther...
should have been able to grab easily.

147
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:39,905
Justin, I said 'enough'.

148
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:45,562
Do not want to do anything, Mom.
- It may not feel like it..

149
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:56,856
Look who came.
- Come, Luther.

150
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,321
Look what I found.

151
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,395
Tommy?

152
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,495
Sister.

153
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,431
I can not believe you're here. Let me see.

154
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,940
Hello, Uncle Tommy.
- Justin.

155
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:15,379
Wow, look at you.

156
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,585
Come on, take them out.

157
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,370
Is faster.

158
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:30,795
Tommy, remember to Luther?
- Sure. How are you?

159
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,385
You know when I saw you last? -No.

160
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:40,522
You were so small.
How are you, Luther?

161
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,333
I guess.
- Are you hungry?

162
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,938
If.
- Well. There are liver and onions.

163
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:18,555
Our cities became war zones.

164
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:23,995
The streets in our neighborhood are
filled with children's charities..

165
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:28,033
They stole our jobs and
were given to immigrants,

166
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,930
Zionist and this government does not care.

167
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:37,018
Unless, of course, that just
arrive into the country.

168
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:44,521
But to us, the Church of the
Crusade Aria, if we care.

169
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:48,630
And so we came to help.

170
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:53,556
Expanding Aria Earth is our future.

171
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:57,591
With our work we create our own nation,

172
00:25:57,713 --> 00:26:00,596
with God, justice and
freedom for our children...

173
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:03,586
..... and our children's children.

174
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:12,783
Count on your commitment.

175
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,050
I know I can rely on your dedication,

176
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:21,893
because we all have the same ultimate goal
.

177
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:58,527
Where have you been?
- Over there.

178
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:17,801
What are you doing?
- I'm going.

179
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:20,876
Go back and talk to me,
Owen Tucker.

180
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,532
Look at me.

181
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,895
Good God...

182
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:37,683
If your father were here -
- Not. You took care of that.

183
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:45,951
Owen, please. You know what that
people are doing to the people.

184
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:50,776
We fight for our race.
- No, the demerit.

185
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:56,443
One of them attacked me today.
- What?

186
00:27:59,048 --> 00:28:01,475
You probably deserved it.

187
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:11,727
Not brought you into this
world that go around...

188
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,827
...choking people.

189
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,928
To what brought me into this world?

190
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,725
Owen.

191
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:24,560
Owene Tucker.

192
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:28,674
Hatred gives me something to live for.

193
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:36,160
Hate will get you killed.

194
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:41,269
Hatred will kill you.

195
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:59,764
Why not arrest him?
- There were no witnesses.

196
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:03,604
Ni corpse. So no case.
- But suppose who was?

197
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,190
Si.

198
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:11,043
And Luther?
- Is living with us.

199
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:17,067
Do not know what it is.
See it every day and give you hope,

200
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,167
when there is no.

201
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:30,049
I'll bring the kids to find ice cream.
Will you come?

202
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:33,501
No, go.
- Come on, Uncle Tommy.

203
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:37,735
Well.
Just had to buy some things.

204
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:41,954
Do not you want chocolate?
- Do not tempt me.

205
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:03,978
Come on, guys.

206
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,736
Where is the store? - There.
- Now we come.

207
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:15,002
Guys, just a taste.

208
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,539
Get down.

209
00:30:46,992 --> 00:30:49,202
Out of here, yellow whore.

210
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,395
One.. two...

211
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:57,697
I'm coming, I'm coming.

212
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:11,554
Back to where you belong.

213
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:14,148
Tommy.
- Karen.

214
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:17,366
Go.

215
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:21,461
The Chinese are multiplying
like rabbits. Come.

216
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,580
Look what we have here.

217
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:31,110
Look, I do not want problems.

218
00:31:32,196 --> 00:31:38,100
You're far from home, boy.
- Do not have to do this. We're leaving.

219
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
Yes, they will.

220
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:54,904
That nice guy. Very pretty.
- I said I did not want trouble.

221
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,550
I broke my nose,
motherfucker.

222
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,981
Let, larguémosnos.

223
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:44,914
You all right?
- I'm fine. It's over.

224
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:57,629
Karen.

225
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,351
Dad.
- Justin, okay?

226
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,374
Let us children home now.

227
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:27,936
Did you see anything?
- No.

228
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:31,174
Come on, do anything?

229
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:35,965

I have a wife and two children.
- So nobody knows how...

232
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:45,553
...how I feel.

233
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:05,290
What a day, eh? How are you?
- Well.

234
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:11,747
It's okay to be afraid sometimes.

235
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,246
We called 'crusaders'.
What does it mean?

236
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,532
Means you are ignorant.

237
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:28,747
Sorry I was not there.
- You can not be everywhere.

238
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,078

239
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:37,691
You know how I love you, right?
Do you know it?

240
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:41,790
I promise this will not happen again.

241
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:46,085
Okay, Dad.
- Will not happen again.

242
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:48,801
I promise.

243
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,388

00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:09,795
Justin, it's time. Go to freshen up.

247
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,522
See you later, Uncle Tommy.
- See you, boy.

248
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:19,025
Missed you.
As everyone.

249
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:22,107
I missed you too.

250
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:25,741

Help me to upload and go.

At the Four H's fair.
- The Four H's?

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,743
You volunteer.
- Really?

256

Strips as a child.

263
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,937
Wait a moment. David, I'll buy the shot

264
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:26,409

Should have let you hit.

Are you okay?

331
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:58,930
They are the ones who killed my dad.

332
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:02,569
How do you know?
- I've seen it before.

333
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:07,346
Burned a cross and... took him away.

334
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:12,983
I did not do anything.
Why do they hate me?

335
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:19,386
Luther, I'll tell you something
and I want you to listen...

336

.

337
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:26,880
Do not hate you.
Hate all those who are different from them.

338
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:31,372
My dad told me he wanted them all.
I can not help it.

00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:33,472
Hate them.

340
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,243
You can not fight hate with hate
. You consume.

341
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:42,161
Would you feel if you killed your father?

342
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:48,721
Not know, Luther.

343
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:52,494

We are neighbors.

360
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:08,475
And we all know Mr. Bryan.
It is also our neighbor.

361
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:13,904
Many do not like what it says Mr. Bryan,

362
00:48:14,376 --> 00:48:18,177
but always respect your right to say it.

363
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:22,991
But now Mr. Bryan wants to buy our land...

364
00:48:23,528 --> 00:48:27,075
...to build a monument to hatred.

365
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:31,522
But I believe that freedom is not for sale.

366
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:34,132
Tell, Margo.
Tell.

367
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:48,749
The law allows me to buy
lands. This is still a free country.

368
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:52,177
Yes, it's a free country.

369
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:57,332
Know the words but not their meaning.

370
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:03,975
You can see it in the faces of the children
looking to the future,

371
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:08,039
hoping they can always live in freedom,

372
00:49:08,564 --> 00:49:14,616
decently as God wants,
regardless of race, creed or color.

373
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,561
I want to say something.

374
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:24,467
A threat to freedom here is a
threat to freedom anywhere.

375
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:25,468
What I mean?

376
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:30,328
A threat to freedom here is a
threat to freedom anywhere.

377
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:34,348
I just preach segregation.

378
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:38,046
I have the right to take -
- We all do.

379
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:41,194
But
some of his followers take their words...

380
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:45,129
...
as permission to hate and kill.

381
00:49:47,475 --> 00:49:53,557
We no longer intimidate Mr. Bryan.
Neither your followers.

382
00:49:54,185 --> 00:49:59,253
In Liberty no place for
prejudice, hatred or violence.

383
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:14,433
Order.

384
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:16,798
Mr. Bryan.

385
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:21,753
It seems clear that the
interests of his church...

386
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:23,353
...do not match...

387
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,361
...with our city.

388
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,069
YES. What hicimos1.

389
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:04,027
You liked the campfire last night?

390
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,750
I hate it as much as I hate, Chinaman.

391
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:13,052
Remember that your blood is red like mine.

392
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:14,831
You wish.

393
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:17,534
Hansen
do yourself a favor and get out of here.

394
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,674
People, break.
It's over.

395
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:31,692
Tommy,
what the hell were you doing?

396
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:35,994
Jack, are you going to sit
back and let us do what...

397
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,369
...the Rev.. Phelps?

398
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:42,065
I'll but I have to do so by law.

399
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:47,677
No I think they are following the law.

400
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:22,538
Margo, why did you put Rose?
- The name is Rosebeth.

401
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:25,737
But you can call her Rose.

402
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:42,567
Sometimes
have to pay the price for what you believe.

403
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:47,650
Is that why you stopped teaching?
- Karen told you?

404
00:52:57,524 --> 00:53:01,845
What else did he say?
- I killed a man.

405
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:16,318
Killed my friend and came for me.

406
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:25,748
I had no choice.

407
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:29,077
I'm sorry, I should not
have brought the issue...

408
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:30,463
.

409
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:35,390
What I did was against
all what I believe. Everything.

410
00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:42,337
Tommy, you have to stop blaming.

411
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:46,827
You said you had no choice
and I believe you.

412
00:53:47,426 --> 00:53:49,860
Now if you have a choice.

413
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:53,942
You can stay to help your family, or leave.

414
00:53:55,337 --> 00:53:58,737
Hansen will not let them hurt my family.

415
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:43,848
Give one to Small.

416
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:05,878
Sorry, sorry.

417
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:43,637
Where the hell is Hansen?
- In the meeting room, sir.

418
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:56,163
How could you betray me?
Are assault weapons, weapons of war.

419
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:59,985
Yes, sir. A race war.
Is imminent.

420
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:02,907
Is why people fear us. They
think we want to exterminate...

421
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:04,007
,

422
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:07,243
not separate them.
- But pastor,

423
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:12,644
if we want.
- I trusted you.

424
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:17,995
I gave you a life.
How well you repay me?

425
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:21,688
The preaches war is the devil's chaplain.

426
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,931
For tomorrow, I want to
you and him out of here.

427
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,987
Men need a new leader.
- I agree.

428
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,446
Out of my way.

429
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:45,155
Yes men need a new leader.

430
00:57:48,817 --> 00:57:50,817
It was one of ours.

431
00:57:52,993 --> 00:57:56,485
I will decide who they are ours.

432
00:57:56,959 --> 00:58:01,192
What are you doing here?
I told you to follow the Chinese.

433
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:03,292
I did.

434
00:58:03,488 --> 00:58:08,418
Until last night, that was what the teacher
...Ms. Preston.

435
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,685
Two birds with one stone.

436
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:17,883
Small, know what to do.

437
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:28,675
Who are you?

438
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:41,939
Hey, you.
Stop.

439
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:46,756
After him.
Come on.

440
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:22,431
Rosy, shut up.

441
01:00:25,795 --> 01:00:28,055
Rosy, what happens?

442
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:57,021
Get away from me.

443
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:03,171
Come on, hit me.
I like to be rude, right?

444
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:08,968
Stay still or I'll cut your throat.

445
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,309
Enough.

446
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,409
Not here.

447
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:23,492
Find him.

448
01:01:24,168 --> 01:01:26,634
No, you first.

449
01:01:28,302 --> 01:01:30,302
Acérquenla.

450
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:34,364
Give me the knife.

451
01:01:35,706 --> 01:01:37,706
Watch...

452
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:48,692
Think about that.

453
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,590
I.
I.

454
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,791
Thanks for the ride.

455
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:47,961
Karen.

456
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:54,204
Sons of bitches.

457
01:04:57,468 --> 01:04:59,537
They took the children.

458
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:11,572
You continue fulfilling the law, Sheriff?

459
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:48,181
My brothers Aryans,

460
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:53,774
warriors of God,
I have tragic news.

461
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,999
Someone brutally murdered our leader.

462
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:06,739
This garbage wants to
destroy our movement.

463
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:11,174
And tonight, will lead to a troop against us.

464
01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:15,712
God has asked me to assume the
huge challenge...

465
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:19,641
Happened to Pastor Bryan.

466
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:24,959
And I ask
fulfill their destiny as warriors of our race.

467
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:29,405
Do not underestimate the
intelligence of this monster.

468
01:06:29,505 --> 01:06:32,402
Have eyes that see in the dark.

469
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:38,279
There is more evil in his heart that
courage in you. You have no honor.

470
01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:44,491
And so I say, brethren,
Arise.

471
01:06:45,398 --> 01:06:48,990
Y reclaim our destiny.
Arise and claim...

472
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:51,402
...the land that our ancestors died.

473
01:06:51,502 --> 01:06:53,502
We are warriors of God.

474
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,784
We Fall to emerge from
above the black grime,

475
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:04,002
brown and yellow.
Our skin is our uniform.

476
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:09,112
A heart, a heartbeat.
One hundred hearts, one beat.

477
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:15,258
Thousand hearts, one beat.
For the win. Sieg Heil.

478
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,599
Where are the children?

479
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,460
Better talk, kid.

480
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:17,315
Is here.

481
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,555
Children?
Justin.?

482
01:10:45,153 --> 01:10:47,558
Dad?
- Luther.

483
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:55,393
Dad.
- Are you okay?

484
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:58,731
Are they right?

485
01:11:05,214 --> 01:11:07,214
Jack.

486
01:11:09,312 --> 01:11:11,312
Tommy, get down.

487
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:53,122
Back.
Will explode.

488
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,007
Go.

489
01:12:16,202 --> 01:12:18,202
Are you ready, kids?

490
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,700
Luther, Justin, come on.
Go back and crouch.

491
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:31,224
Jack.

492
01:12:39,836 --> 01:12:42,471
Come on, come on, turning back.

493
01:12:47,338 --> 01:12:49,715
Down.
'll Make it.

494
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,080
Keep. The will delay.

495
01:15:05,072 --> 01:15:08,285
Come on.
What do you expect?

496
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:14,278
Go or ruin their asses.

497
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:39,191
God, please...

498
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:12,491
Margo, go.

499
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:18,600
Go on, go.

500
01:16:39,364 --> 01:16:41,200
Idiot.

501
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,533
Out of my way.

502
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:23,274
Over there.

503
01:17:33,626 --> 01:17:35,626
Drop it.

504
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,070
You...

505
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:44,818
When will you learn, boy?

506
01:18:05,636 --> 01:18:11,188
Come on, Lee.
Can not we get along?

507
01:20:53,258 --> 01:20:56,658
We will now see that color your skin is.

508
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,320
Go ahead and do...

509
01:22:48,705 --> 01:22:51,392
I hate this world.

510
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:54,879
Come on, buddy.

511
01:23:07,173 --> 01:23:10,812
Hate is not the solution.

512
01:23:28,221 --> 01:23:31,468
Of course not, friend.

513
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:36,821
Made a big mistake.

514
01:23:37,519 --> 01:23:41,203
Shoot him the son of a bitch.

515
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,935
What are you doing?
I said I'd shoot.

516
01:23:48,346 --> 01:23:53,756
Kill the motherfucker.
Ell Armageddon is coming.

517
01:23:54,317 --> 01:23:57,456
The Apocalypse has arrived.

518
01:25:33,881 --> 01:25:34,881
.

519
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:38,321
Wolf howled also with the
lamb and the cat, </ i>...

520
01:25:38,421 --> 01:25:44,622
...and the young lion
join them. The cow and the bear will. </ I>...

521
01:25:45,155 --> 01:25:48,470
...The youth will be together. </ I>...

522
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:52,136
...bring peace to the earth. </ I>...

523
01:25:52,788 --> 01:25:56,216
...there will be no fear. </ i>.

524
01:25:56,895 --> 01:25:58,895
Amen. </ i>.
