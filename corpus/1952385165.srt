1
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,432
<i>Third day of high school and I, -</i>

2
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,552
<i>Victor Knudsen was hit by epidemic.</i>

3
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,037
<i>And we're not talking about your
everyday epidemic like chicken pox.</i>

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,313
<i>- Or the flu. Nope, we're talking
a case of total, incurable -</i>

5
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,670
<i>- "Anya-itis".</i>

6
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,792
<i>Hello, gorgeous.</i>

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,319
<i>It's not so much the fact -</i>

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,478
<i>- that she's the most beautiful girl
in the history of the world.</i>

9
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,910
<i>It's that... well...</i>

10
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,668
- Whassup, ladies?
- Hey, Peter!

11
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,598
<i>Why don"t you boys
go park my precious?</i>

12
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,677
Sure thing, Peter.

13
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,110
If you scratch her, you die.

14
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,272
<i>Open house this evening.
Please come by.</i>

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,355
<i>Nothing feels quite like expensive
wheels. Not even sex.</i>

16
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,836
<i>You ladies should stop by Nick
and Ernie's party tonight, -</i>

17
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,393
<i>- it's gonna be
off the hook.</i>

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,831
<i>Especially you mama. I'll make sure
you're on the VIP list.</i>

19
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,076
Take a hike, losers.

20
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,032
<i>They"d never set foot
at your retarded little party.</i>

21
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,792
Yo, Vic!

22
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,633
Hey, Vic!

23
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,431
<i>Is he even alive?</i>

24
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,757
<i>Come on, this is your big chance.</i>

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,793
<i>Never mind the fact that she"s
the world's most unattainable girl.</i>

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,878
<i>And that's... maybe her boyfriend.</i>

27
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,913
<i>Just walk on up to herand
invite her to Ernie"s party tonight.</i>

28
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,159
<i>So what if she's a Senior?
Nothing. It means nothing.</i>

29
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,950
<i>Oh my god, what a smile!</i>

30
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,468
<i>I don't think we've been introduced.</i>

31
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,069
<i>Huh, no we haven't.</i>

32
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,995
<i>Those eyes...</i>

33
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,957
<i>My name's Vic...</i>

34
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,072
<i>"Viccup"?</i>

35
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,871
That sure looks like your geek brother
trying to score.

36
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,553
<i>How freaking stupid can you be,
trying to score a Senior?</i>

37
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,718
<i>Must run in the family. You wrote
Paris Hilton, didn't you?</i>

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,434
<i>She's not a senior now, is she?</i>

39
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,200
<i>Besides, she's much more mature
than high school chicks.</i>

40
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,038
Right.

41
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,871
We could make the catastrophic film
of the century...

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,718
...about Victor and Anya.

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,195
<i>"What not to do
when one wants to get some ass".</i>

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,391
<i>We're gonna win Sundance!</i>

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
<i>You do the directing,
I'll cast the floozies.</i>

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,271
- Score!
- Yeah!

47
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,510
I think Esmeralda is just about ready...

48
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,790
<i>Adios, mamacita.</i>

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,309
<i>Now there's pussy in the air, boys.</i>

50
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,274
- She sure does slide nicely.
- Why Esmeralda?

51
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,914
We can name her Anya if you prefer.

52
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,269
What do you think Ernest?

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,517
This is America,
we can all dream, right?

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,038
<i>- Do you think she"ll come?
- Not the first few times.</i>

55
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,310
<i>Victor, my man, she's a senior.</i>

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,875
<i>You'd have a better chance
trying to score Angelina Jolie.</i>

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,231
<i>I don't exactly think she walks around
dreaming about a 15 year old -</i>

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,069
<i>- who's never had any,
except his own right hand.</i>

59
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,272
<i>- Get lost, you little rug rat!
- Alright, fine, l"ll leave.</i>

60
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,276
<i>I'm sorry, -</i>

61
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,755
- I thought you were my hideous
little brother and his stupid camera.

62
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,555
<i>I don't think
Brian looks this great in a dress.</i>

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,157
<i>Very sexy. You're out for some
trouble tonight, aren't you?</i>

64
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,271
<i>- Aren't I always?
- Yeah.</i>

65
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,558
<i>- Anya's bedroom, take four.
- Marker!</i>

66
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,558
<i>Brian and Zack, that's it!!
Get the hell out of my room!</i>

67
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,239
One more time from the top, Sis.

68
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,714
And maybe you could lose
the bathrobe in this take?

69
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,592
Out now!

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,471
<i>Keep that expression, Anya.</i>

71
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,830
<i>You're totally challenging
Uma Thurman in Kill Bill!</i>

72
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,439
Get out! Scram!

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,952
<i>Come on Anya, get dressed.</i>

74
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,958
<i>The Froshes are having a party
and we're crashing it!</i>

75
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,513
What, Freshmen?

76
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,871
<i>Sure you"ll fit right in.
They don't have sex either.</i>

77
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,595
Thanks.

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,278
<i>- Hey, Ernie!
- What's up, baby?</i>

79
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,111
<i>No sandals next time, buddy.
We're running a classy joint here.</i>

80
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,951
<i>Luckily, l"m in a good mood. Hello.</i>

81
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,829
Wearing dancing shoes.

82
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,868
So, have you seen her yet?

83
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,039
If you are referring to your lady
friend Anya, she was just here.

84
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,117
- I told her to take a hike.
- You did what?

85
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,470
<i>She didn't have an invitation, man.
What do you want from me?</i>

86
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,069
<i>But she doesn't,
she doesn't need a... a...</i>

87
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,352
<i>Bu, bu, but...
Okay, geez, I'm just joking.</i>

88
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,835
That broad has totally ruined
your sense of humor.

89
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,838
Madames, proceed to
the Garden of Eden.

90
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,793
Nice!

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,036
Yo, this place is packed with hotties.

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,073
Forget about Anya and just grab
whatever you can get.

93
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,554
<i>Which isn"t a whole lot, -</i>

94
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,513
<i>- but, you know, there"s gotta
be someone desperate enough.</i>

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,352
<i>Man, you are a lost cause. Go make
sure Ernie's still standing, will you?</i>

96
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,429
<i>Come on, lets just try to get into
"Avalon" instead.</i>

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,995
<i>Peter just texted me and said it'd be
happening tonight.</i>

98
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,158
<i>Peter should just be happy you are
practicing on some toddlers.</i>

99
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,952
<i>Thanks for the confidence.</i>

100
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,031
<i>- Are you still scared?
- Of what?</i>

101
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,992
Of actually doing it with Peter.

102
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,918
No.

103
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,194
<i>I mean, when we're alone together
he"s really nice and...</i>

104
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,516
<i>He says
all the right things, it"s just...</i>

105
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,188
<i>Anya, if you don't wanna do it,
you shouldn't do it.</i>

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,834
<i>I do want to, I'm ready!</i>

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,468
<i>I don't know. I guess l"m just not sure
if he"s the right one.</i>

108
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,553
<i>Listen, you can"t just throw away a
woman's greatest treasure, -</i>

109
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,751
<i>- just because he wants you to.</i>

110
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,270
You have to wait
for your one true love.

111
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,119
<i>The one you're gonna marry.</i>

112
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
<i>- What was that?
- It's in the Bible.</i>

113
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,990
You guys ever hear of role playing?

114
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,872
You got it, doll.

115
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,552
<i>Two of Ernie's famous home juice.</i>

116
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,271
<i>Get lost girls, Hanna Montana
starts in 5 minutes.</i>

117
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,994
What was that?

118
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,712
Hi...

119
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,390
<i>Such a lovely dress you're wearing,
Anya.</i>

120
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,790
<i>Nice fabric. They don't
make them like that anymore.</i>

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,991
<i>I just bought it, so I guess they do.</i>

122
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,189
Okay, Tom Ford, fashion week is over.

123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,153
<i>- I'm Victor.
- Hi.</i>

124
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,793
Are you coming or what?

125
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,434
<i>It's the nicest dress
I've seen all night.</i>

126
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,197
Okay.

127
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,876
That freshie really liked your dress.

128
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,594
<i>Hey, let"s make a bet,
whoever gets a freshie hooked first, -</i>

129
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,189
<i>- has to pick up the tab
later on at Avalon.</i>

130
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,038
<i>You're on.</i>

131
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,313
<i>It's the nicest dress
I've seen all night?</i>

132
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,149
<i>That's the dumbest thing
I've said in my entire life!</i>

133
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,235
Ooooh!

134
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,191
Freak out time!

135
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,836
Just, just, just walk up to her
and say...

136
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,430
<i>"Anya, baby, let's, let's groove.</i>

137
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,158
<i>I got some... R-rated moves for ya."</i>

138
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,158
Dude, what are you
doing in here, boy?

139
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,474
<i>Okay. Don't mind me.</i>

140
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,713
<i>Hey, come on, close the door,
it"s not that big.</i>

141
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,836
Or, is it?

142
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,558
Come on, you guys, walk!

143
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,751
You can do it. One foot afterthe other.

144
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,837
<i>Don"t tell me
you're talking to yourfeet, Vic?</i>

145
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,077
<i>- No, I, I...
- Just go on up to her, man. Come on.</i>

146
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,675
<i>Just do it, Vic.</i>

147
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,638
Do it, man,

148
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,836
Here comes your lover boy to
comment on your dress again.

149
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,997
<i>I sense your credit card's
gonna hit the limit tonight.</i>

150
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,996
<i>Victor, my man, you obviously have
something important to say.</i>

151
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,559
<i>I'm, I'm sorry, what was that?</i>

152
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,514
Any hiccup experts in the house?

153
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,789
I know a good trick.

154
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,988
<i>Come on, you've tortured Victor
long enough.</i>

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,313
<i>So Victor, do you want me to try
to fix these hiccups of yours?</i>

156
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,789
<i>I'll give you a great, big kiss if you
can do one more hiccup for me.</i>

157
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,557
Victor?

158
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,591
Victor?

159
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,229
So, what will it be, big boy?

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,591
Go, buddy!

161
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,199
<i>I, I can't do it.</i>

162
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,508
But the most important thing is that
your hiccups are cured, right?

163
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,276
<i>Guess I'm stuck paying the tab
tonight.</i>

164
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,678
<i>That's the price you have to pay for
having such a "lovely dress".</i>

165
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,278
- Hey, I got the hiccups too!
- No, no, no, no, I do!

166
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,994
She would have kissed me!

167
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,679
Zachary Jaaaaaaaaames!!!!

168
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,758
<i>That's my name, don't wear it out.
I got the copyright, lady.</i>

169
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,838
<i>You know I can't stand spiders!</i>

170
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,678
<i>Then it's a good thing
it's made out of licorice.</i>

171
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,269
Where did I go wrong?

172
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,711
<i>- When you and dad were getting...
- Yes, thank you, young man.</i>

173
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,316
Sounds like you woke up your mom,
Zachary.

174
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,193
- Good morning.
- Hi, Dad.

175
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,470
What about Victor? Is he up yet?

176
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,272
The old booze hound is hung over.

177
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,869
<i>Oh, don't be silly. Your brother
doesn't drink.</i>

178
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,832
<i>Yeah, and I don't dig girls over
18.</i>

179
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,114
<i>Victor, breakfast is ready!</i>

180
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,034
Oh, good morning.

181
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,838
So son, any nice-looking girls there
last night?

182
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,792
- Yeah, did you get any pussy?
- Zachary!

183
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,036
You need to use a different
language, young man!

184
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,437
<i>Yes, mom.
Hizole consigue coño?</i>

185
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,151
Did you get to
bump into any big jugs?

186
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,554
Stop it!

187
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,716
Back in my day,
we called them melons.

188
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,989
Christian!

189
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,430
Well, some people did, but, no, no,
not me.

190
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,039
You know, I better get back to work.

191
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,994
<i>- Oh, don't forget this one.
- Thank you, son.</i>

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,435
See you.

193
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,349
<i>So, what kind of trouble are you
boys planning on getting into today?</i>

194
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,959
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary, -</i>

195
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,037
<i>- maybe knock over
a liquor store, hit the titty bar.</i>

196
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,593
<i>Oh, that"s great!</i>

197
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,276
Hey, mom, did anyone call?

198
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,155
<i>No. Who would have called?</i>

199
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,310
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

200
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,435
<i>What if she"s crazy about me,
but just doesn't know it yet?</i>

201
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,791
<i>In theory she already kissed me.
It's all subconscious.</i>

202
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,553
She even smiled at me this morning.

203
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,592
<i>Anya's the type who'd smile
at a child molester.</i>

204
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,313
<i>If she likes you so much, why
don't you go over and talk to her?</i>

205
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,114
<i>Well, she"s sitting
with all the Seniors.</i>

206
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,278
<i>What about that smart-ass Peter?
Is she dating him or what?</i>

207
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
<i>No, I'm sure they're just
really good friends.</i>

208
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,913
<i>Is Victor Knudsen really
gonna go down in history...</i>

209
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,398
<i>...as the Kentucky fried chicken who
didn't dare fight for his own woman?</i>

210
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,436
<i>You're right.</i>

211
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,030
No, time out, time out. Are you sure
there are no hiccups on their way up?

212
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,229
I got it covered.

213
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,989
<i>I didn't drink a single sip
of water today, or yesterday.</i>

214
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,796
Good luck, Titanic!

215
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,355
<i>Can"t you faint from dehydration?</i>

216
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,229
<i>What"s up ladies?</i>

217
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,713
<i>Is this Candid Camera or did you
just say "'what"s up ladies"?</i>

218
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,274
I just wanted to say how great it
was to see you at the party.

219
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,312
Me and my dress?

220
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,355
<i>Don't you know little Freshmen
aren't allowed at the seniortable?</i>

221
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,232
<i>Last I checked there was no
reservation sign.</i>

222
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,389
<i>Listen, you punk, I don't know
what you're trying to pull here.</i>

223
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,192
<i>But don't ever talk
to any of us ever again -</i>

224
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,550
<i>- or I'll split your skull in two!</i>

225
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,475
<i>Go buy yourself a Hershey's kiss,
kid.</i>

226
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,638
No one in their right mind would
ever give such a loser one for free.

227
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,476
<i>- Nice one!
- Huh? You like that? Like that?</i>

228
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,749
Well done.

229
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,518
<i>"Go buy yourself a Hershey"s kiss,
kid"'.</i>

230
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,711
- Hurry up.
- Relax already.

231
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,112
Check the stalls, will ya?

232
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,030
<i>Clear. Make this quick.</i>

233
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,029
I seem to remember you never liked
it when I was too quick about it.

234
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,075
<i>Look, l"m sick and tired of Anya and
her unspoiled, virgin bullshit.</i>

235
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,269
What is she trying to prove?

236
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,597
<i>Don't worry, she knows she can't
graduate a virgin.</i>

237
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,028
She said that?

238
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,435
She said she wants to do it soon,
and...

239
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,996
I told her the best way is to do it
with someone with experience.

240
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,474
<i>Someone
who know's what he's doing.</i>

241
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,715
<i>Thanks for the compliment.
Can"t you -</i>

242
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,478
- prepare her a bit?

243
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,911
<i>- Prepare her, are you crazy?!
- Just give her a few tips.</i>

244
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,350
<i>I'm going to her house on Wednesday
while her parents are playing Bridge.</i>

245
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,869
<i>Seriously Peter,
that"s between you two.</i>

246
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,709
<i>I wanna see my girl happy and
I am not pushing her to do it.</i>

247
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,557
<i>It was a lot easier with you
back in the day.</i>

248
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,557
<i>All it took was a ride in
the Precious Junior -</i>

249
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,716
<i>- and a twenty buck dinner.</i>

250
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,151
<i>Besides, when I've had Anya too,
you girls can finally discuss sex.</i>

251
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,874
<i>So, I guess I'll basically be doing
you a favor.</i>

252
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,672
<i>Chupa mi verga.</i>

253
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,235
Keep talking dirty, baby.

254
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,314
<i>Okay, Casanova. So you're gonna
tell this girl you barely know -</i>

255
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,478
<i>- that she shouldn't sleep with her
boyfriend even though she wants to?</i>

256
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,958
<i>Well, he's not really her boyfriend.
But... yeah.</i>

257
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,549
<i>- Great plan, Vic.
- <! 9>lt's not so bad.</i>

258
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,554
<i>- Ah, God, you"re so young.
- But Peter doesn't love her!</i>

259
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,433
So? When did that become
mandatory for love making?

260
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,790
<i>Come on guys, her house
isn"t that far away.</i>

261
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,388
<i>- Hancock Park.
- Oh, that's a rich neighborhood.</i>

262
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,239
<i>Yeah, I bought the address off Zack,
he"s friends with her little brother.</i>

263
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,795
<i>Doesn't that make you two
practically related?</i>

264
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,711
Yo, the girl that your in love
with...

265
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,480
...happens just to be your cousin,

266
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,638
<i>Oh, doesn't that hurt
a little buzzing...</i>

267
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,638
<i>going around in
your little wedgie stomach.</i>

268
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,310
<i>I can't believe your feelings
just took a plummet.</i>

269
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,879
<i>I can't rap, man, but I'm doing it
for you!</i>

270
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,628
<i>It's right there.</i>

271
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,400
- Wow!
- Oooohhh!

272
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,669
<i>Damn! Yourfuture wife is loaded!</i>

273
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,070
<i>You guys stay here. L"ll handle this.</i>

274
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,112
Heads up, Vic!

275
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,078
- Hi, Victor!
- Hey there, Anya.

276
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,752
So, how about that?

277
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,428
<i>- It's almost Wednesday, huh?
- Yeah, I guess so.</i>

278
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,039
You live around here?

279
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,472
Uh, yeah, yeah. Um... no.

280
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,872
- Here, ah, let me get those.
- Thanks.

281
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,469
<i>So, ah, what"s up with all the cans?</i>

282
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,999
Huh?

283
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,789
Hi Anya!

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,551
<i>Well, we're turning great profits
from the party by selling them.</i>

285
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,714
<i>I didn't know you were
such a businessman.</i>

286
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,558
Oh, yeah, sure.

287
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,196
You know, me and old Billy... Gates,
ha.

288
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,914
<i>Let the profits go to charity.</i>

289
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,114
China, Af-Africa, Ca-California...

290
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,517
<i>- So, it"s almost Wednesday, huh?
- You said that already.</i>

291
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,678
I did, I did, yeah.
That must make it a fact then.

292
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,276
<i>Look, I came to tell you, um...
I wanted to ask you...</i>

293
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,919
You know my little brother Zack,
right?

294
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,588
<i>He's friends with your little
brother. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.</i>

295
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,550
<i>So Zack's your little brother.</i>

296
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,478
Is that a good thing, or...?

297
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,994
<i>Yeah, yeah, he is. Good old Zackie,
he"s a real... bro.</i>

298
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,118
Victor, is everything alright?

299
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,156
<i>Hell, no. Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
everything's just... dandy.</i>

300
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,473
<i>- Well, I gotta get going.
- Are you going to Peter's or...?</i>

301
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,555
<i>No, I actually have
an interview at USC.</i>

302
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,837
<i>I'm really nervous.</i>

303
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,955
Do, do I look alright?

304
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,632
You look... beautiful.

305
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,997
Cool. I, I mean, thank you.

306
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,518
<i>I'll see you later, Victor.</i>

307
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,159
<i>Oh, and I really don't want you to
sleep with Peter on Wednesday.</i>

308
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,151
Come...

309
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,710
<i>I don't...</i>

310
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,036
Come on, what?

311
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
<i>It's a great opening. We need to
make it juicierthough.</i>

312
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,639
<i>Not to worry. That's under control.</i>

313
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,958
<i>Victor's going to a party on
Saturday.</i>

314
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,230
Anya would be delighted
to see Victor, -

315
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,034
Saturday, September 10th at 3 PM, -

316
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,074
for her 18th birthday celebration.
3 PM.

317
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,236
<i>That's an hour after all the
grown-ups arrive.</i>

318
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,351
<i>I like where your head's at.</i>

319
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,396
<i>One question gentlemen...</i>

320
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,479
The Invasion of Normandie is what?

321
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,557
Took place when? Lead by whom?

322
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,355
<i>Sorry Mein Fräulein,
that"s three questions, not one.</i>

323
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,230
D- day, 6th of June 1944.

324
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,793
General Eisenhower.

325
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,355
Damn, you ought to teach that shit!

326
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,758
<i>Yes. And you ought to get down
to the principal"s office. Now!</i>

327
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,111
- Herut!
- Darn!

328
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,275
<i>It's only an overnight trip, right?</i>

329
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,435
<i>Yeah. So, l"m not gonna pass.</i>

330
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,076
<i>- So it's Wednesday...
- <! 9> Yeah...</i>

331
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,473
<i>I can't believe that...</i>

332
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,669
Yeah in Study Hall...

333
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,680
<i>I'm sorry we can't
help you out tonight.</i>

334
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,479
<i>Yeah...</i>

335
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,394
Ernie...

336
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,273
Sorry, we gotta bounce.

337
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,911
<i>The Lakers await us.</i>

338
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,599
You gonna be okay.

339
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,190
Good luck, Vic.

340
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,519
This Napa Pinot
is elegantly smooth, -

341
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,439
- full bodied with
a hint of blueberry.

342
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,558
<i>And it has an exquisite nose.</i>

343
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,036
Cheers, darling.

344
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,273
Cheers.

345
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,195
I think it tastes a little stale.

346
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,992
Stale?

347
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,353
<i>- I'll give you stale! Huh?
- What? Nooo! Nooo!</i>

348
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,356
Huh? Huh?

349
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,198
What? Huh?

350
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,231
Seriously! Stop!

351
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,476
Yourturn.

352
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,954
<i>- I'm actually a little cold.
- I'll keep you warm.</i>

353
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,790
What the hell?

354
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,153
<i>We'll pretend like no one's home.</i>

355
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,874
Oh, no, no, no, let me just
go check it out really quick.

356
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,395
Hi, Anya.

357
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,839
Hey... What are you doing here?

358
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,999
<i>Well, call me a mama's boy, but
I promised I would pick up Zack.</i>

359
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,317
<i>He's not here. Brian's with
my parents playing Bridge.</i>

360
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,919
<i>Really? You sure you don"t have him
hiding in here somewhere?</i>

361
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,518
What the hell is hiccups doing here?

362
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,280
Ah, I just swung by
to pick up my kid brother.

363
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,789
<i>But apparently he's not here.</i>

364
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,877
Why in the world would
your brother be here?

365
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,195
<i>He's friends with Brian.</i>

366
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,674
Exactly.

367
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,273
<i>Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing anything?</i>

368
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,118
<i>Not anything we can't get back to.</i>

369
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,158
<i>- Well, I guess you better be going.
- Peter, don't be rude!</i>

370
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,318
<i>No, I'll, l"ll leave you two
to do it...</i>

371
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,634
To it!

372
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,113
See you later, Victor.

373
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,992
Time for bed.
Kindergarten starts early.

374
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,395
What? Huh...

375
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,838
<i>Okay. Where were we? Oh, yeah...</i>

376
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,110
<i>Yeah... Right there. Right there...
Yeah! You feel that? Lt"s pectorals.</i>

377
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,674
<i>Feel those pectorals, baby?
It's muscle.</i>

378
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,599
<i>- What the hell is this?
- I guess tonight isn't our night.</i>

379
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,111
No shit, Sherlock!

380
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,871
Victor?!

381
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,471
<i>I'm really sorry to bother you,
but I can"t find my wallet.</i>

382
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,955
So I was trying to back track
my night, and I thought, -

383
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,199
<i>- well, I couldn't possibly
have left it here, could I?</i>

384
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,595
<i>Unless you threw the thing through
the door when we weren't looking!</i>

385
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,472
<i>You, you didn"t come in really.</i>

386
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,555
<i>That's true...</i>

387
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,838
<i>Is there something going on
that I don"t know about?</i>

388
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,598
Do you drop by
several times every night?

389
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,030
<i>- No.
- Of course not.</i>

390
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,192
Are you trying to cock block me
or something?

391
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,516
<i>Look, I,
I hope you find your wallet.</i>

392
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,755
Thanks.

393
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,757
<i>Let"s see, your little brother,
your wallet, -</i>

394
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,916
- is there anything else
you want us to check for?

395
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,957
<i>Nope. I think that's about it.</i>

396
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,559
Great!

397
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,796
You alright?

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,149
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,558
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine... Unless it
wouldn't be too much trouble...</i>

400
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,310
<i>...could I get a glass of milk?</i>

401
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,597
Whole milk. My personal favorite.

402
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,157
<i>Lots of energy. Tasty, yet...</i>

403
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,277
...whole.

404
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,869
More?

405
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,311
<i>Ah, what the hell.
The night's still young. Fill me up.</i>

406
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,033
Well... thanks forthe drink.

407
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,912
<i>You sure you don't want more?</i>

408
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,475
<i>They say to drink a full gallon
when you"re still growing.</i>

409
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,150
<i>Naa, I shouldn"t. Biking.</i>

410
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,631
<i>I'll put this bad boy in the
dishwasher, make myself useful.</i>

411
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,876
<i>- No, that's not necessary, Victor.
- I got it.</i>

412
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,955
<i>- Where do the dishes go?
- I'll take care of it! Useless!</i>

413
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,391
Guess I better be going!

414
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,038
<i>Thanks for stopping by, and if you
need a bedtime story or get hungry...</i>

415
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,354
- Do it at home. Okay?!
- Okay.

416
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,755
- See you later.
- Much, much later!

417
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,357
Jesus, God!

418
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,949
<i>I don't believe that kid!</i>

419
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,470
<i>I bet you in five minutes he'll want
to borrow 3 eggs for a cup cake.</i>

420
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,318
<i>Oh, he's not that bad.</i>

421
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,396
<i>"What's up, ladies?</i>

422
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,592
<i>My name is Victor. I'm a mama"s boy
picking up my little brother!"</i>

423
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,553
<i>I think he's sweet,
in his own dorky way.</i>

424
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,718
<i>Sweet? Oh. I'll show you sweet.</i>

425
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,796
I only play to win, Roger.

426
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,509
<i>All l"m saying is
if I open with two diamonds -</i>

427
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,110
<i>- it isn't particularly intelligent
of you to call "no trumps".</i>

428
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,039
<i>I mean for God's sake,
there weren't any more spades!</i>

429
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,514
<i>It's called bluffing, my darling.</i>

430
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,711
You saw it for yourself,
they had no idea what I was doing.

431
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,796
Well, neither did I!

432
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,070
<i>They"re probably porking like pigs
right now.</i>

433
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,350
<i>Watch your language, young man!</i>

434
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,272
<i>You know, maybe we should ring
the bell, just in case.</i>

435
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,074
We are the ones who live here,
are we not?

436
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,430
Yeah, remember when your mother
and father walked in on us?

437
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,835
We were on the kitchen counter...

438
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,998
<i>I'm gonna ring. I'm gonna ring.</i>

439
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,751
<i>That's it, you cock blocking
son of a bitch!</i>

440
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,633
No more Anya to stand between
you and my fist!

441
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,833
<i>Why don"t you fuck off
so I can finally fuck her!!!</i>

442
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,274
Mr. And Mrs. Benton. Hi.

443
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,075
We were just doing some homework.

444
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,191
Drama.

445
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,239
You wanna put your shirt on?

446
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,355
How was Bridge?

447
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,155
<i>You're right. Peter"s facial
expression is priceless!</i>

448
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,431
I know, the sunglass cam was
definitely a good investment.

449
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,835
Especially with the stuff of my dad
cheating in Bridge too.

450
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,634
Yeah, that will make us
a nice blackmail payoff.

451
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,831
<i>So, what do you think
we"ll make on this film?</i>

452
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,996
A couple hundred million at least.

453
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,919
<i>That's what those French folks got
from the animal video on YouPorn.</i>

454
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,588
Oh, the one with the porcupine and
the giraffe screwing?

455
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,475
<i>Dude! And those are mammals.
We're getting people!</i>

456
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,116
- People are mammals, stupid.
- Whatever.

457
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,590
Benton residence, talk to me, bitch.

458
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,432
<i>Hi. It's Victor. Is Anya there?</i>

459
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,756
<i>It's Victor. He's actually buying it.</i>

460
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,150
<i>Well, she"s out taking a dump.</i>

461
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,712
<i>Are you coming
to her birthday party?</i>

462
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,911
I know she really wants to
see you.

463
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,918
<i>Really? Yeah, I'd love to come.</i>

464
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,236
Do you know what kind of present
she would like?

465
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,957
The idiot wants to know what
she wants for her birthday!

466
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,517
<i>Well Vic, if you really
wanna make my sister happy, -</i>

467
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,631
<i>- you'll buy her a tarantula.</i>

468
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,274
<i>She's wanted one of those things
since she was little.</i>

469
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,959
<i>Atarantula? Really?</i>

470
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,479
Hell, yeah.

471
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,240
<i>She's always dreamt of having a
wrestling match between her lizard -</i>

472
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,397
<i>- and one of them black, hairy beasts.</i>

473
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,149
<i>I didn't even know she had a lizard.</i>

474
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,191
Alright. Thanks forthe tip.

475
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,832
Are you sure you guys are related?

476
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,952
I know! How can anyone be that thick?

477
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,638
<i>It balances the color.
That's what you gotta do, honey.</i>

478
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,149
Hey!

479
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,148
Do you guys happen to know -

480
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,716
- if tarantulas are like,
really deadly poisonous?

481
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,753
- Why, did you see one?!
- No. No, I was just curious.

482
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,439
<i>They are one of the most dangerous
of all spiders, Victor.</i>

483
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,790
- If you see one, do not touch it!
- No.

484
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,311
<i>- What's in the bag, son?
- Just some homework.</i>

485
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,316
Wow!

486
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,829
<i>- He's so cool. Let's keep him!
- We can't keep him.</i>

487
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,952
Mom will go ballistic if she found
out we had a tarantula in the house.

488
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,799
<i>Besides, it's a present for Anya.</i>

489
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,668
<i>- Let's name him Hugo.
- Don't piss him off.</i>

490
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,350
<i>- Let's find a dog and feed it.
- They don't eat dogs, you idiot!</i>

491
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,599
<i>The big ones do. The Turners down
the street, they own a Chihuahua.</i>

492
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,916
- Zack, where are you?
- Mom! Mom! Get the door!

493
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,949
Zack!

494
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,596
Zachary James!

495
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,550
What the hell?

496
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,593
<i>I guess he's stronger than we
thought. And hungrier...</i>

497
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,712
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.
We have to find him now!

498
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,794
Where are you?

499
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,229
Zach!

500
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,354
Arrrhhhh.

501
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,395
<i>You're such a wimp.</i>

502
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,033
<i>Whatever you"re doing, young man,
don't!</i>

503
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,309
Zach!

504
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,636
Get up! Get up! Get up!

505
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,598
<i>- Oh, you're in here.
- Hi, Mom.</i>

506
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,475
<i>- How are you today?
- Zachary, what did you do this time?</i>

507
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,518
<i>Nothing at all, mom. I'm just...
helping Victor with his homework.</i>

508
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,439
You know, World War Two and stuff.
Great war.

509
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,478
Is something wrong, Victor?

510
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,908
<i>You look a little worried.</i>

511
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,113
<i>Ah, no, no, no, I just, have a
stomach ache.</i>

512
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,151
Does it hurt bad?
Do you want some yoghurt?

513
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,874
<i>- Oh, I'm alright. It'll pass.
- We ate three packs of cream puffs.</i>

514
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,638
Well, no wonder!

515
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,593
You have to eat something
more substantial.

516
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,031
<i>That's what I kept telling Vic here,
but he kept insisting.</i>

517
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,869
<i>I love cream puffs. What time is it?</i>

518
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,629
<i>Oh, my God, it"s already 5.30.</i>

519
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,389
<i>I'm gonna start dinner shortly. You
boys better be able to eat something.</i>

520
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,397
We will.

521
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,234
And it was freezing cold in
Stalingrad.

522
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,795
<i>The soldiers had bare feet...</i>

523
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,072
...as they walked... where...?

524
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,396
<i>That's question number 8.</i>

525
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,113
<i>It'll make an awesome scene
when he gives it to her.</i>

526
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,470
<i>Word. Hopefully she'll punch him
or something.</i>

527
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,709
<i>Hey! That's mine!</i>

528
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,990
<i>No one get"s away
with cheating in my class!</i>

529
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,111
<i>You can collect it later
at the principal's office.</i>

530
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,754
<i>Out! Both of you! Auf wiedersehen!</i>

531
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,750
<i>- Come on Zack, we're out.
- Yeah, this place is dead anyway.</i>

532
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,277
Question number 9!

533
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,596
Ah.

534
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,959
Are you feeling alright, Victor?

535
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,549
<i>Yeah, Mom. I'm... Just going to a
birthday party.</i>

536
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,512
<i>At a girl's house.</i>

537
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,392
<i>At a girl's house?</i>

538
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,275
A girl named Anya.

539
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,796
Oh, my, my, what did you get her?

540
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,797
<i>Uh. It, it, it's a, it's a book.</i>

541
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,993
<i>- Oh, it's a big book, isn't it?
- Yeah, she reads a bunch.</i>

542
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,919
<i>Anya. Do you take classes together?</i>

543
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,953
<i>No, uh, she"s... she's a senior.</i>

544
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,711
<i>I don't really like the girls
my own age.</i>

545
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,713
<i>Wow!
That's amazing!</i>

546
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,594
Let me.

547
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,719
You should invite her overfor
dinner, so dad and I could meet her.

548
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,550
<i>Uh, I don"t think so. We"re just
friends, ya know...</i>

549
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,199
<i>Is that why you're ironing your
underpants?</i>

550
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,075
Sorry. So, what does
this Anya look like?

551
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,478
<i>She's... she's got dark hair and, -</i>

552
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,956
<i>- she's so...</i>

553
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,839
She needs to be seen.

554
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,588
Well, there you go.

555
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,555
The socks...

556
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,551
<i>I'll let you do yourself.</i>

557
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,829
<i>Who is getting married?</i>

558
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,113
<i>He's going to a birthday party.
For a girl...</i>

559
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,673
<i>...who"s a senior!</i>

560
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,552
<i>So he's not gay, huh?</i>

561
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,155
- I, I got it.
- Well, let me just get the other.

562
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,477
<i>No, I'm gonna leave them down. Mom!</i>

563
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,113
Please! Come on!

564
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,632
Please, stop!

565
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,592
So Victor, how does it feel -

566
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,155
<i>- visiting the girl you"ve had wet
dreams about on her birthday?</i>

567
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,510
Are you nervous?

568
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,280
Brian Henry! Go back in the living
room.

569
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,391
<i>We're not buying anything today.</i>

570
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,229
<i>Mom! This is Victor. Anya's new boy
toy.</i>

571
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,159
Really?

572
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,158
<i>Hi, Mrs. Benton. Victor Knudsen.
Very nice to meet you.</i>

573
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,999
I thought everyone was here.

574
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,838
Victor?

575
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,433
Happy Birthday.
Thanks for inviting me.

576
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,470
<i>You're welcome.</i>

577
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,832
What a lovely present you brought
for my daughter, Victor.

578
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,918
Thanks.

579
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,079
<i>So, Anya, are you as excited as me
to see what's inside that thing?</i>

580
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,877
What the hell is nerd boy doing here?

581
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,029
<i>Why doesn't she just kick him out?
He clearly doesn't belong.</i>

582
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,437
<i>She can't kick him out. He dressed
up and brought a present and all.</i>

583
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,560
Well, come on already,
Anya, open it.

584
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,833
Slower, Sis. With feeling.

585
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,674
<i>Oh. Look at that, there's something
moving in there.</i>

586
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,029
<i>It's a...</i>

587
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,553
<i>Oh, wow! It's an Eximius Colosus
Aranea!!</i>

588
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,553
Oh, my God!

589
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,228
<i>Oh, Victor, that big, hairy fella
must have cost you a fortune, huh?</i>

590
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,919
<i>His name's Hugo.</i>

591
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,669
<i>- Does it attack humans?
- Only when it feels threatened.</i>

592
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,558
<i>But, it was to keep
your lizard company.</i>

593
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,512
<i>I don't own any lizards, Victor.</i>

594
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,675
<i>You don't?</i>

595
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,318
<i>No, no, no, just keep breathing.
It's okay, now he's just...</i>

596
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,512
...you know, just keep breathing.
Take a deep breath.

597
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,392
<i>It's in the box,
it's not gonna harm anyone.</i>

598
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,999
<i>It's not funny.</i>

599
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,513
Let me get you a piece of cake
to calm your nerves.

600
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,753
<i>Honey, it's okay.</i>

601
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,348
Thank you.

602
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,391
Ooooohhh!

603
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,997
<i>Anya, I'm so sorry about all this.</i>

604
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,474
<i>I'm sure you didn't intend -</i>

605
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,592
- on releasing a poisonous creature
in my house on purpose.

606
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,679
<i>Thanks for hiding me in your bedroom.</i>

607
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,348
Your entire family probably
wants to kill me, huh?

608
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,791
For some reason
my dad finds you really hilarious.

609
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,358
He seems like a great guy.

610
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,951
I thought it was very sweet of you
to buy me such a lovely present.

611
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,275
<i>I'm glad you liked it.</i>

612
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,153
What on earth
made you buy me a tarantula?

613
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,958
Brian said you always wanted one!

614
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,312
That little turd had
something to do with this.

615
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,917
<i>You did that on purpose, didn't you?</i>

616
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,512
Not at all.

617
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,194
- Never give up, huh?
- I guess not.

618
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,470
Well, I guess I better kiss you,
then.

619
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,993
<i>Well, we still can't find Hugo.
But the good news is, -</i>

620
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,679
<i>- Aunt Lizzy
didn't get bit after all.</i>

621
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,997
<i>It was just her recent Botox
that made her face go numb.</i>

622
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,031
<i>I hope I didn't ruin your couch.</i>

623
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,838
Hum. 22 grand.

624
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,315
22,000 dollars?!

625
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,078
<i>No, I'm just messing with you. Kid.</i>

626
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,068
You need a ride home?

627
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,033
Yeah. Thanks.

628
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,472
Sorry again I ruined your birthday.

629
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,915
<i>It's a, it's a really great motor.
You can't wear the crankshaft out.</i>

630
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,680
<i>The pistons are cast steel,
and the brakes...</i>

631
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,632
...work every other Tuesday.

632
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,230
<i>Since I don"t have no senior babe,
I have to drill what I got.</i>

633
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,072
<i>Even if it was just a mercy kiss, -</i>

634
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,999
<i>- I think I'll see if she wants to go
to a movie sometime.</i>

635
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,918
<i>Woa, woa, woa, woa, woa.</i>

636
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,350
No, no.

637
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,916
<i>You can't take a girl you really
like to the movies on a first date.</i>

638
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,556
You have to do something
that will really impress her.

639
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,149
Yeah. Something
to get her panties wet.

640
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,038
<i>Imagine you and her alone together...</i>

641
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,077
<i>Close those eyes.</i>

642
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,558
<i>Somewhere romantic... somewhere
that" II make her heart go...</i>

643
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,117
...Victor, Victor, Victor...

644
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,910
Where would you be?

645
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,514
<i>I got it! I'll take her
to Pyramid Lake and, -</i>

646
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,472
- and get some bananas,
organic ones.

647
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,194
Girls like that. And rent a row boat.

648
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,799
Thanks boys, wish me luck!

649
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,708
Bananas? I think we got a situation.

650
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,431
<i>I'm more worried about the row boat.</i>

651
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,790
<i>He doesn't really have
the arms for it, you know?</i>

652
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,150
- Truth.
- Got the legs, though.

653
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,718
<i>Hey Victor. What's up?</i>

654
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,997
I uh... wanted to make it up to you.

655
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,911
Forthe mess I made.

656
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,196
Give me five minutes.

657
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,920
<i>So... where's this apology at?</i>

658
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,269
Thanks.

659
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,349
<i>I was also hoping you"d come with me
somewhere?</i>

660
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,198
For lunch.

661
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,234
<i>Nowhere near poisonous creatures,
I promise.</i>

662
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,232
- Okay.
- Okay.

663
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,875
<i>Sorry, it's my dad"s.</i>

664
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,310
<i>- No Lotus.
- It has character.</i>

665
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,672
<i>Anya, what the hell you doing, baby?</i>

666
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,073
Shit.

667
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,556
<i>Victor's taking me out to apologize
for my birthday party.</i>

668
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,116
But, I was planning to take you to
the Four Seasons today.

669
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,197
I booked a room... ahhh, a table.

670
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,875
Sorry.

671
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,312
<i>Anya, come on, it"s Victor, the
hiccup Freshman, for Christ sake.</i>

672
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,353
<i>Are you seriously choosing to go out
with some 15 year old loser -</i>

673
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,677
<i>- who's so not in your league,
over moi?</i>

674
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,758
<i>You can be such a jackass,
you know that?</i>

675
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,350
<i>- Let's go, Victor.
- Yeah.</i>

676
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,510
<i>If I hadn"t just had a manicure
you'd be dead meat, hiccup boy!</i>

677
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,030
<i>Fine. I hope you two are very happy
together, in your...</i>

678
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,199
...1915 get-out-and-push piece of
shit wheels.

679
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,157
<i>Have fun at Dave and Buster's.</i>

680
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,795
<i>- So, that went well.
- Yeah, I guess that was that.</i>

681
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,598
I, I...

682
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,956
Try it now.

683
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,874
Wow!

684
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,998
Um. The Queen Nefertiti Rose.

685
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,712
<i>Named after the Roman Queen.</i>

686
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,755
Your pink-white, and your white,
and your white pink...

687
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,711
<i>- So, where are you taking me?
- You'll see.</i>

688
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,551
<i>- Hi, we"d like to ah...
- Mr. Victor Knudsen, I presume?</i>

689
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,718
<i>- Yeah...
- Everything is ready, sir.</i>

690
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,878
- Just like you requested.
- Requested?

691
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,268
<i>Oh, Victor, it's absolutely amazing!
How romantic!</i>

692
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,436
<i>- Yeah, well...
- I wanna row!</i>

693
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,272
<i>I'm glad everything is to
the young lady's liking.</i>

694
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,629
The rest is in your hands.

695
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,032
<i>Come on, let's follow "em.
Maybe we'll get to see some live porn.</i>

696
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,268
<i>No man, he's on his own now.
It's so romantic.</i>

697
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,797
<i>Oh, it's so romantic, boo-boo.</i>

698
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,230
<i>You know what's,
what's romantic here?</i>

699
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,749
I like cheese fries.
I want some cheese fries.

700
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,870
<i>Let"s get some cheese fries.</i>

701
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,958
Really? Cheese fries are fat.

702
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,478
My family and I used to come here
when I was a kid.

703
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,558
<i>It's gorgeous. I never knew
this place existed.</i>

704
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,038
<i>I'm sorry for what Peter said
earlier.</i>

705
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,717
<i>It's okay. He's right.
It's a piece of shit car.</i>

706
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,956
<i>No, I mean; you're not a loser.</i>

707
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,469
<i>And I'm not out of your league.</i>

708
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,670
<i>You're not?</i>

709
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,155
<i>I just wanted to make sure
that"s clear.</i>

710
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,638
Victor?

711
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,669
Have you ever done it?

712
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,108
Done what?

713
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,392
<i>You know... "lt"?</i>

714
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,998
Oh, oh, it! Yeah, sure, of course...

715
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,668
<i>All the time... Who hasn't?</i>

716
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,629
No.

717
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,915
<i>Do you... Maybe want to...?</i>

718
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,273
With me?

719
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,593
Here?

720
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,952
<i>No, silly. My parents play cards
on Wednesdays.</i>

721
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,638
Oh, I know.

722
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,558
You do?

723
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,116
You could come by around 8.

724
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,033
<i>Eight? I can do 8, yeah!</i>

725
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,072
<i>And bring something with you.
If you know what I mean.</i>

726
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,993
Right. Right. Something.

727
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,997
Sure.

728
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,273
<i>I'm the king of the world!!</i>

729
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,236
<i>Good day, young man, haven't seen
you before. How may I help you?</i>

730
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,350
My Miniature Pony?

731
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,069
<i>Yeah, it's for my little br...
sister!</i>

732
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,436
Anything else I can get for you?

733
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,393
Yeah, I, I really need some cond...

734
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,431
some, some cond...

735
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,350
...some condensed milk.

736
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,554
Condensed milk? Alright.

737
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,199
<i>- Is that all?
- No, no, I, I, I need some cond...</i>

738
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,753
<i>- Some cond...
- Cond...?</i>

739
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,671
Condoms...

740
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,877
<i>- I, I mean some rubb...
- Rub what?</i>

741
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,555
Some ru... bbing alcohol.
Rubbing alcohol.

742
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,068
<i>Hm hum. Yep, that, that"s the stuff.</i>

743
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,673
And I really need some cond...

744
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,476
<i>Some co... Ca, Ca, Castillo's, Cas,
Castello's.</i>

745
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,476
Those.

746
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,829
How old are you?

747
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,951
<i>Oh, no, I wouldn't
touch those things.</i>

748
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,277
<i>- They"re for my dad.
- Ahh, someone's having a party...</i>

749
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,631
Yo, Victor. Whatcha doing?

750
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,910
<i>Didn't look like a Havana.</i>

751
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,957
You wanna make 5 bucks?

752
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,754
<i>Not really, but I wouldn't mind
making 20.</i>

753
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,156
And what may I get for you today,
son?

754
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,316
<i>I'd like to buy some jimmy hats.</i>

755
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,193
<i>I'm sorry I'm not familiar with
the name. What may they be?</i>

756
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,518
Dingers, johnnies, gloves.

757
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,598
<i>The thing you need when
you're banging a chick, of course.</i>

758
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,755
Oh, my!

759
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,396
I suppose you mean condoms,
my young fellow?

760
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,672
Duh, what are you deaf?
Rubbers with colors.

761
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,475
<i>And you don't suppose you're a bit
too young for that sort of thing?</i>

762
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,752
<i>I don't think so mister, the fat
one"s getting hairy already.</i>

763
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,032
<i>I'm sorry, are you feeling alright,
ma"am?</i>

764
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,835
I just need to lean up against
something.

765
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,315
Or should I rather buy
the ribbed ones?

766
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,589
<i>They're supposed
to prolong the pleasure.</i>

767
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,509
Listen, kid. We only have normal
kinds, no colors, knobs or flavors!

768
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,030
<i>Alright, I'll make do with the
smooth ones. A carton of Trojans.</i>

769
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,435
A carton? Are you completely
out of your mind, kid?

770
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,709
<i>There"s 200 in a carton!!</i>

771
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,356
<i>Yeah, I'm spending
the entire weekend with her -</i>

772
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,199
<i>- and she's a lush one so...</i>

773
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,038
<i>Alrighty then, give me two.</i>

774
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,073
- Two cartons?
- No, just two.

775
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,077
<i>I can always
flip them over and reuse.</i>

776
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,192
- Four-fifty.
- Keep the change.

777
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,756
<i>You wouldn't happen to have
a dressing room out back, -</i>

778
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,439
- just so I can
try them on for size?

779
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,153
Get out!

780
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,275
<i>I can't believe my brother's
actually gonna get some.</i>

781
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,232
<i>It'll make great footage.</i>

782
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,910
<i>It's gotta be possible to paint
the rain coats with luminous paint.</i>

783
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,190
So we can see the action in details.

784
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,029
<i>Not necessary, my man, this baby's
got night vision!</i>

785
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,030
<i>Nice. Not sure how well the film will
sell with a "happy ending" though.</i>

786
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,755
<i>Yeah. Right now Victor's
the only one who'll get one.</i>

787
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,111
- We need more drama.
- Perhaps we can think of something.

788
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,952
Would you mind sharing
what you just said with the class?

789
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,355
Yeah, sure thing Mrs. T.

790
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,199
<i>It was about my gang bang with
three playmates last weekend...</i>

791
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,119
<i>Alright! That"s quite enough
sharing, Zack!</i>

792
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,118
Hey, you wanted to know. I also
showed the chicks my trapeze stunt...

793
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,709
<i>Principal's office! Both out you!
Now!</i>

794
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,754
<i>Yeah, we gotta bounce anyway.
Our bitches are waiting.</i>

795
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,231
We out.

796
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,592
Hello baby!! Your man is back!

797
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,833
What did you smoke today?

798
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,032
Oh, good evening Mr. Benton, Sir.

799
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,470
Call me Roger, Spider man.

800
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,472
<i>Did you bring us any other
dangerous animals this time?</i>

801
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,193
Not tonight, Mr. Benton.

802
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,719
Oooh!

803
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,716
Roger.

804
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,471
Too bad. Still no Hugo.

805
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,079
<i>Come on, I'll take you
up to Anya"s room.</i>

806
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,428
<i>You two are working on a science
project for school tonight?</i>

807
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,871
Yeah. Yeah. For... science class.

808
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,957
Okay.

809
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,754
Hi!

810
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,231
Hey.

811
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,430
<i>I'm almost done.</i>

812
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,829
<i>And... I'm done.</i>

813
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,434
<i>So, aren't your parents
gonna play cards tonight?</i>

814
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,993
<i>I don't think so.</i>

815
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,910
<i>They actually asked
if we could watch Brian tonight.</i>

816
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,519
<i>Hope that's
okay with you.</i>

817
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,352
<i>Sure. Sure, yeah,
that"s, that's fine.</i>

818
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,833
Gotcha! They leave in 10 minutes!

819
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,317
That is not even funny.

820
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,112
<i>No... Okay...</i>

821
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,433
Stop!

822
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,079
Hey, there.

823
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,713
<i>Just wanted to let you two know
that we're leaving.</i>

824
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,797
- Okay, see you.
- Bye.

825
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,675
<i>Get some work done.
We'll be back shortly.</i>

826
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,916
Have fun! Live free.

827
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,676
So...?

828
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,515
So...

829
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,157
<i>You want a glass of milk?
To break the ice?</i>

830
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,633
<i>Only if it's whole milk.</i>

831
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,798
<i>Now that we've got that
taken care of...</i>

832
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,919
...do you wanna go back to my room?

833
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,636
Can you turn off the lights?

834
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,678
<i>Maybe it's a little too dark.</i>

835
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,030
<i>No, it isn't, it's okay.</i>

836
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,672
Victor, what are you doing?

837
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,035
<i>- I'm touching you.
- No, no, no, you're not!</i>

838
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,110
<i>- I thought it felt a little funny.
- Thanks for the compliment.</i>

839
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,789
Are you ready
to get completely naked?

840
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,468
Victor, did you... bring something?

841
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,159
Of course.

842
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,028
One second.

843
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,353
Got it.

844
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,116
One second.

845
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,116
<i>I can't get this piece of crap open.
Come...</i>

846
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,792
Alright.

847
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,033
Is it on?

848
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,990
- Yeah, on my fingers.
- Relax.

849
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,395
<i>It's my first time too, remember?</i>

850
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,115
<i>Yeah...</i>

851
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,916
<i>It was a lot easier putting it
on Ernie's fingers in sex-ED.</i>

852
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,830
How in the... hell...?

853
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,559
<i>I have another one!</i>

854
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,749
Okay.

855
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,919
<i>Aren't we lucky, it has a manual.</i>

856
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,874
<i>"Roll slowly over erect penis".</i>

857
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,472
How poetic.

858
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,119
Let me try.

859
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,679
<i>"Erect penis"'.
That certainly isn't a problem.</i>

860
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,512
Abracadabra...

861
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,112
Voilá!

862
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,188
<i>- My parents! Already?
- What?</i>

863
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,188
<i>Victor, that"s my dress!</i>

864
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,314
The bed, the bed.
Help me, help me make the bed.

865
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,474
<i>I just don't think it's necessary!
She is 18 now, you know.</i>

866
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,749
<i>Hey kids. We're back.</i>

867
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,395
- Hello.
- Hey.

868
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,109
<i>So, have you two been, uh,
behaving yourselves?</i>

869
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,992
What do you think, dad?

870
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,078
<i>Well, your father seems to believe
that you are a responsible adult.</i>

871
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,795
Viictor, my man,
did you hit all the angles?

872
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,831
Okay, come on, Brian, time for bed.

873
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:57,797
<i>Hey. That's a nice science project
there, guys. What is it?</i>

874
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,709
<i>- It's a...
- Lexington Hussil.</i>

875
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,751
<i>Hussil. A Lexington Hussil.</i>

876
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,396
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

877
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,474
<i>Victor, could I have a little chat
with you for a minute?</i>

878
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,715
In the kitchen.

879
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,556
<i>For Christ sakes, dad, does it have
to be right now?</i>

880
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,350
<i>It's, it's fine. It's, it's fine.</i>

881
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,915
Viictor!

882
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,396
<i>- Where did the other one go?
- I didn"t have a chance to take it off!</i>

883
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:30,917
Cheers.

884
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,598
One has to be careful
not to sit down on Hugo.

885
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,073
<i>Still haven't found that little bugger.</i>

886
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,199
<i>You know, Victor,
it"s become clear to me that...</i>

887
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,791
<i>...my daughter likes you very much
and you like her, and...</i>

888
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:57,079
<i>Constance and I think that
you're just ah, well, you know...</i>

889
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,478
<i>In fact, you remind me very much of
myself when I was your age.</i>

890
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,875
Always going after the hot, older gal.

891
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,875
<i>So, I hope that the two of you,
you know, could be togetherfor...</i>

892
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,959
- At least some time.
- So do I, sir.

893
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,637
Yeah. So, I understand that the two of
you wanna have sex with each other.

894
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,873
<i>No. Hey, relax, -</i>

895
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,355
<i>- it's, you know it's completely
natural. Completely natural.</i>

896
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,917
<i>At your ages, you know. Even at
my age, I like to have it occasionally.</i>

897
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,350
Mostly with my wife.

898
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,113
<i>I'm in the cut-throat world
of advertising, alright?</i>

899
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,639
<i>It's kill or be killed.</i>

900
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,116
<i>We're working on a big campaign now,
spending millions of dollars in fact, -</i>

901
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,949
<i>- to get young people to understand
that protection can be "hip".</i>

902
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,799
<i>And that it"s important forthem
to have a condom on them -</i>

903
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,070
- every time
they leave their home.

904
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,669
<i>Well, I don"t mean on them,
of course...</i>

905
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,757
- No.
- But with them.

906
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,391
<i>You know, in their wallet,
or their pocket, -</i>

907
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,752
<i>- it doesn"t matter where, as
long as they have the darn thing.</i>

908
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,876
<i>So, can I ask you a personal question?</i>

909
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,632
Of course. Yeah.

910
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,150
How often
do you have a rubber on you?

911
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,754
<i>Well I, I, I just started having one...</i>

912
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,155
...on me, recently.

913
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,272
<i>...you know, everyone's so liberated
now that it"s important to have one...</i>

914
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,277
...on you, with you.

915
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,278
<i>Oh, I'm glad to hearthat, Victor.
You know, you're adults now, -</i>

916
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,710
<i>- and that comes
with some responsibilities.</i>

917
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,069
Of course.

918
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,833
<i>I'm glad you have such a good head
forthese things.</i>

919
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,072
<i>- Want another drink for the road?
- Yes, sir.</i>

920
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,552
<i>Well, I'm glad we had this talk son.</i>

921
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,992
Me too, sir.

922
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,396
Ow, alright.

923
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,235
<i>- That"s cool.
- Yeah.</i>

924
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,076
<i>- Sorry about my dad.
- It's all good.</i>

925
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,354
Your dad and I understand each other.

926
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,273
So, do you wanna do something after
school tomorrow?

927
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,236
<i>I actually have
to hang out with Marisa.</i>

928
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,156
Oh. Alright.

929
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,432
<i>- You should come.
- With Marissa?!</i>

930
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,030
<i>You'll grow on her. Like a cactus.</i>

931
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,149
Good night, Victor.

932
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,635
Sweet dreams...

933
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,352
<i>- Whatup?
- I think I have an idea for our ending.</i>

934
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,675
<i>Nice...</i>

935
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,634
<i>How the hell does
he forget to take it off?</i>

936
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,831
<i>I don"t know,
we both completely panicked.</i>

937
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,396
<i>You'll never get your cherry popped
if you keep hanging with that kid!</i>

938
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,434
<i>I don't know about that.
It was pretty damn close.</i>

939
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,392
<i>Besides I really like him.</i>

940
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,751
<i>I mean he"s, he's sweet, and sincere,
and...</i>

941
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,279
Viictor!

942
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,519
<i>Baby, Oh, I missed you so much.
Why haven"t you called me back?</i>

943
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,119
Are you still dating that old hag?

944
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,152
Victor, what the hell are you doing?!

945
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,153
<i>I... I don't, I don't know! Who are you?</i>

946
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,636
<i>Good one. I'll see you tomorrow, stud.</i>

947
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,195
<i>Anya, I don"t know what"s going on...</i>

948
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,231
Well, I do! What, you
just wanted to show off -

949
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,396
<i>- in front of your stupid
Freshmen friends, didn't you?</i>

950
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,478
- No, I, I would never...
- Was I some sort of bet or something?

951
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,157
Not at all!

952
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,828
<i>Since you didn"t "'get any" last night,
you're done with me, is that it?</i>

953
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,793
<i>- Would you listen to me?
- Don't touch me!</i>

954
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:27,957
Anya!

955
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,913
<i>- Leave me alone!
- You, bastard!</i>

956
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,714
But... I love you.

957
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,110
<i>- Oh, that looks great!
- Well, they travel, you know.</i>

958
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,153
<i>Look. He's a little fat, but you know,
for what this has...</i>

959
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,359
Victor, are you alright?

960
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,075
<i>- You look terrible.
- Honey, what's wrong?</i>

961
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,034
- Oh, is it Anya?
- Has she fallen for someone else?

962
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,912
Christian!!

963
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,116
<i>It doesn't matter. It"s no use.</i>

964
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,711
- Why are you so dumb?
- Me?

965
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,919
- No. Men!
- Oh, men. Yeah, I know, honey.

966
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,352
I guess we just sometimes
do the wrong thing, Anya.

967
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,312
I thought, I thought he loved me, Dad.

968
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,399
<i>Oh, baby, maybe he does,
but he's young.</i>

969
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,116
<i>He may not know how to express it,
that"s all.</i>

970
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,800
We all make mistakes, sweetheart.

971
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,829
Why did your mother have to go
to ballet tonight of all nights?

972
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,590
<i>Oh, baby, don't.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

973
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,988
<i>I put extra marshmallows in it, so
you could drown your sorrows.</i>

974
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,559
<i>I guess there might be a chance
I'd get lucky enough to choke and die.</i>

975
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,754
Now tell me what happened?

976
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,232
<i>Anya and I are done
and my life is totally over.</i>

977
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,677
<i>Nonsense. Of course
your life isn't over.</i>

978
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,792
<i>It is! Nothing else matters
in this world.</i>

979
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,356
<i>And she won"t even listen to me.</i>

980
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,638
<i>You just need to rest and you'll see.</i>

981
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,594
The world will look a lot brighter
in the morning, I promise.

982
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,031
Rise and shine, playboy.

983
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,310
<i>We got something you're gonna love.</i>

984
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,509
Go away!

985
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:12,633
<i>I know it isn't blue ray, but still,
I think you wanna see this.</i>

986
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,719
We shot a masterpiece,
a film about you and Anya.

987
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,797
<i>Why don"t we show you a clip,
so you can see for yourself.</i>

988
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,434
If you can afford it, of course.

989
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,238
<i>- I'll fast forward a bit.
- Shouldn't we call his bank first?</i>

990
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,798
Nice work bro, I personally never
thought you had it in you.

991
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,479
You little bastards!

992
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,830
<i>Hold your horses and watch this...</i>

993
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:38,950
Open it.

994
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,159
Oooooh!

995
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,914
You think that was bad?
Watch this!

996
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,189
<i>- Okay, but why would I do it?
- Lisa, you're my favorite cousin.</i>

997
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,709
<i>And... I'll pay you 100 dollars.</i>

998
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,152
<i>And a night out on the town
with my favorite cousin?</i>

999
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,751
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

1000
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,474
Wait. How did Peter even know where
we would be yesterday?

1001
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,997
<i>- Why didn"t you tell me right away?
- We are businessmen after all.</i>

1002
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,714
And we had to finish the cut first.

1003
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,639
<i>Atrue artist never shows
his work until it is finished.</i>

1004
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,637
So bro, what will you pay for it?

1005
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,834
We gotta start remembering to get
our blackmail money up front!

1006
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,557
Dude, all I got from him was a text
saying his life was finished.

1007
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,795
<i>And he spelled finished
wrong.</i>

1008
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,195
Ernie, buddy,
I need to borrow your Vespa!

1009
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,958
<i>- What's going on, Vic, you ok?
- There's no time to explain.</i>

1010
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,752
<i>It's a life or death
situation! Please!!</i>

1011
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,871
Well, alright, alright.
Take a chill pill.

1012
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,196
So look, the ah,
the blinkers are here and, -

1013
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,675
- this is a visorfor yourface,
gas.

1014
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,189
<i>Vic, most importantly, the brake.
- Okay, yeah, whatever.</i>

1015
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,958
But how do I start this damn thing?

1016
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,116
<i>Perhaps you're better off
having your dad mail you in, -</i>

1017
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,276
<i>- that way you'll get
there a little faster.</i>

1018
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,109
<i>- Ernie, start it up!!
- Damn! Someone's got their period!</i>

1019
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,838
Do it.

1020
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,718
<i>Hey, Vic, be careful, the brakes
aren't what they used to be!</i>

1021
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,311
Oh! Damn!

1022
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,073
Ahhh!

1023
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,677
<i>On the third day of high school I, -</i>

1024
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,111
<i>- Victor Knudsen,
was hit by an epidemic.</i>

1025
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,118
<i>And we"re not talking
chicken pox or the flu.</i>

1026
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,754
<i>Nope, we're talking a case of total, -</i>

1027
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,474
<i>- incurable "Anya- itis".</i>

1028
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:50,239
<i>And I Victor Knudsen, didn't live.</i>

1029
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,956
<i>Goodbye Anya, my love.</i>

1030
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,711
Anya?

1031
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,153
Is it really you?

1032
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,275
Hey, you.

1033
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,474
<i>I'm sorry I doubted you.</i>

1034
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,831
I was just so hurt
when I saw that girl kissing you.

1035
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,628
But, how did you know?

1036
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,432
I saw the film.

1037
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,388
You did?

1038
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,194
Zack and Brian had an extra copy.

1039
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,994
Actually, they have
quite a few copies.

1040
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,998
We may have to make
it worth their while, -

1041
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,918
<i>- so we don't end up on
YouTube...</i>

1042
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,636
<i>At least some of the footage
was used for something good.</i>

1043
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,034
Oh, my God!

1044
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,838
This is gonna be good!

1045
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,516
What the fuck...?!

1046
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,996
- Pervert Peter!
- Pervert!

1047
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,510
But, she was only my third cousin!!

1048
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,676
<i>Bye! Bye, Peter, we'll miss you.</i>

1049
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,598
I brought you a cactus.

1050
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,399
Oh! Thanks.

1051
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,757
Anya, if I make it...

1052
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,312
...do you think
I could come over again?

1053
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,794
On a Wednesday?

1054
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,549
<i>Seriously. I'm pretty sure
you're gonna make it.</i>

1055
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,149
And to hell with Wednesdays.
My parents are gone this weekend, -

1056
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,828
<i>- so we"ll have
the entire house to ourselves.</i>

1057
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,030
But, what would we do
all weekend long?

1058
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,236
<i>But, what about my leg?</i>

1059
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,276
<i>Victor, I'm pretty sure you don't
really need your leg to do it.</i>

1060
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,397
You really never give up, do you?

1061
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,276
<i>Oh, Victor will be so sorry
he didn't pay us for that footage.</i>

1062
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,597
And my sisterfound the stash
of DVDs and destroyed them all.

1063
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,234
Plus all the hidden cameras
in her room.

1064
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,552
<i>What"s that flashing red light?</i>

1065
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,591
<i>Don't tell me you didn't charge
the battery again!</i>

1066
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,597
<i>- It was your turn!
- Shiiiit!</i>

1067
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,519
- Gimme a break!
- No, no, no, no, no! Damn
