1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,658
Thank you.

2
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,451
Hello.

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,828
Hello.

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,792
I'll have the same.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,260
Ah, weddings!

6
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,754
Ah, weddings.

7
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,518
Natalie was after we split.

8
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,937
Minutes.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,029
But well done for trying.

10
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,365
I heard the new one legged it.

11
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,956
Michaela and I
have parted company, yes.

12
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,414
These young women, they just can't
make up their minds, can they?

13
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,624
No.

14
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,374
You get me, Kate, though.
Or you used to.

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,261
That's because
I'm a trained child psychologist.

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,922
So, how's life
for the nearly retired corporate sellout?

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,682
Marvellous. I'm playing some
of the best golf of my life.

18
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,637
What?

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,303
- You're going to be so bored.
- I will not be bored.

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,948
- Totally and utterly bored.
- Rubbish!

21
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,022
- Bored.
- Rubbish.

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,686
- You look great, by the way.
- Oh, shut up.

23
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,980
Damn it! Still handsome.

24
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,819
- OK, so he's here.
- Who?

25
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:47,982
- Ken.
- Oh!

26
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,277
Is that him?

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,572
- He's got a nice body.
- Ken?

28
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,115
Pen's tennis coach.

29
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,409
It's time Kate fought more aggressively.

30
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,667
Get out there.

31
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,826
I do get out there!

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,957
Taking your laptop out into the garden
is not getting out there.

33
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,214
Come on, you two!
Get back together.

34
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,757
- Come on, get back together.
- Not now, Jerry.

35
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,551
- Well, we live in hope. Just imagine.
- Oh!

36
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,345
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,639
You're Ken, aren't you?
Hello.

38
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,853
Oh! Wh... whoosh!

39
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,893
- Ah... flowers!
- Yeah, they're for you.

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,609
Oh, thank you.
They're... they're lovely.

41
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,196
- You're allergic.
- Only mildly.

42
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,198
Why is Kate holding ﬂowers
when she's allergic?

43
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,319
Only mildly.

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,121
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know...
- No, no, no, it's fine.

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,750
It's not all flowers. Really, I like them.
I want them. I actually want them.

46
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,957
Why has Kate got ﬂowers?
She's allergic.

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,214
- Only mildly.
- Don't!

48
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,501
Ah, Michaela!

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
I've come to take my car.

50
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,041
Move yours, it's blocking mine.
I want out.

51
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,006
- Uh-huh. Who's he?
- My new lover.

52
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,339
Bloody hell.

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,556
Can't you do that a bit louder, darling? I
don't think you've woken the whole street.

54
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,942
Come on, Mum.
You're supposed to be helping me.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,443
I'm coming, I'm coming.

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,653
"Hello, Kate.
My name is Jean-Baptiste Durain.

57
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,323
"I'm 57 years old, live in Paris
and would love to converse with you."

58
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,907
Durain!

59
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,709
Well, this is a first.

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,808
Hey-hey!

61
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,471
Prodigal daughter departing
for an establishment of higher learning.

62
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,356
Hurrah for said person!

63
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,983
- Where is it you're going, again?
- Edinburgh.

64
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,612
Edinburgh. Oh, brilliant!
Yeah, cor... Brilliant!

65
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,194
Say yes to everything.
Go on, och aye to it all.

66
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,698
- Well, not everything, Jerry.
- No, of course not.

67
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,989
- Jerry! Here you are.
- What? No, I don't want that darling.

68
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,532
- What?
- It's boiling. No, I'm all right, thanks.

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,084
Anyway, Sophie, have a ball.

70
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,421
See you at Christmas, darling.

71
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,206
- See you, Uncle Jerry.
- Ho-ho!

72
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,253
Now, you haven't forgotten
about tomorrow night.

73
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
Ken's definitely coming.

74
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,802
Despite what happened with the flowers,
he's still keen.

75
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,139
All right. Well, second time lucky.

76
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,643
Smashing! That's my girl.
Seven o'clock at ours.

77
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,977
- I think that's her serve.
- I hope not.

78
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,109
Oh, shot. Ding dong!

79
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:04,866
Hey, one more week, old son,
and you'll be doing this all day every day.

80
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,250
This is going to be our new office.

81
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,753
It's what we've worked
our whole lives for, isn't it?

82
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,663
- Eh?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,837
Yeah, I suppose you're right,
my friend.

84
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,007
Yep. Living the dream, old son.
Living the dream.

85
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,342
No more answering to the man.

86
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,432
We call and we... take the shots.

87
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,874
- Ah, that's not bad.
- Nice one.

88
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,143
- Whoo-hoo!
- Sure we won't be bored now?

89
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:34,358
Bored? Bored?
What, with all this? Bored!

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,736
As if.

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
- Oh!
- Oh, no. It's not gone again, has it?

92
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,202
- Oh, yeah. Shit!
- Anything I can do?

93
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,785
Yeah, just... just put your...
put your thumb right there, mate.

94
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,292
Oh, I'd better not stand there.
People will talk.

95
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,421
Now, don't forget:
always wash your jeans inside out,

96
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,547
if it looks swollen, it probably is, and...

97
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,427
and never put anything into your mouth
that hasn't been boiled first.

98
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,337
- Oh, it's Dad.
- Oh.

99
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,299
Hi, Dad.

100
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,056
Hello, my darling.
Have you left yet?

101
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,575
I'm just setting off.
I'm with Mum.

102
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,954
'Lucky girl, going to Edinburgh.'

103
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,521
Your Mum and I were quite the dynamic pair
on campus in our day.

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,353
Maybe I'll buy a flat near you
and relive my student days.

105
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,564
- Er... no, thanks, Dad. It's my turn.
- 'Yes, it is indeed.'

106
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,695
Don't know where Jerry's going.
No, Jerry's getting lost.

107
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,447
'So what are you gonna do
now you're retired?'

108
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,111
"Oh, I don't know.'

109
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,244
Maybe I'll finally buy that boat
and sail around the world, you know.

110
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,683
- You were gonna do that with Mum.
- 'That's true, I was.'

111
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,373
Dad, I have to go.
I've got a big drive ahead of me.

112
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,002
OK. Call me when you get in, now.
I love you, Sophie.

113
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,161
"Love you too, Dad.'

114
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,833
- He's threatening to relive his student days.
- Mmm.

115
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,878
- What were you two like at college?
- Naive, unrealistic, ill-prepared.

116
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,138
So, everything that I am right now.

117
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,593
Not you, not you, never you.

118
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,726
Not at all. Come on, off you go.

119
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,639
Don't forget to call me when you get there.
Always go out in groups.

120
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,355
If you get homesick, come home.
And try and find a good taxi service.

121
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,277
Because some of them
have women-only drivers.

122
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,405
Women-only drivers, got it.
Anything else?

123
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,031
Be yourself, you're lovely.

124
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,219
Oh!

125
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,650
Hi, honey, I'm home.

126
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,697
Hello, Rumps.
Come here.

127
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,618
Hello, darling.

128
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,949
What shall we do this afternoon, eh?

129
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,907
Let's get drunk.

130
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,879
Hi, honey, I'm home.

131
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,189
You can hide all you like.

132
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,322
I've spotted you and we should
get a start on your last week.

133
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,233
Yes, of course.
Good morning, Doreen.

134
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,869
It has always been our good fortune
to share the same train.

135
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,577
No rest for the wicked, Mr Jones.

136
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,117
Doreen, after all these years,
after everything we've been through,

137
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,963
are you still refusing to call me Richard?

138
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:41,089
Yes! Now, you have a ten o'clock meeting
with the new owners.

139
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,257
- Yeah.
- Any idea who they are?

140
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,416
Hmm...

141
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,966
Young is all I know, Doreen.

142
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,302
I took your advice
on their pension share offer.

143
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,433
- I took them up on it.
- What? The whole lot?

144
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,722
Yes, lots of us did.
Janice in Accounts, Marcus in Payroll.

145
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,024
Well, it's a solid offer.

146
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,732
Now, you have a prostate check
at 2:15 today.

147
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,946
I'm gonna miss these little chats, Doreen.

148
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,452
I thought my leaving party
was on Friday.

149
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,084
I don't think this is a party, Mr Jones.

150
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,042
- It's all gone, Richard. The lot!
- What?

151
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,716
Morning, everyone.

152
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,426
Richard, what's going on?

153
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,265
I don't know, Janice.
I have no idea.

154
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,270
- Did you know about this?
- No, of course not, Marcus.

155
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,029
- Is this legal? Can they just do this?
- Yes, of course they can.

156
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,900
Now, wait a minute.
We don't know that.

157
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,061
Just... just give me
some time here, please.

158
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,855
- Will we get paid this month?
- Yes, of course you will.

159
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,365
- Did you know this was coming?
- Of course he didn't!

160
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,777
Someone said the shares are worthless.
Is that true?

161
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,320
- No.
- Yes.

162
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,122
Jesus!

163
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,416
I suppose they'll let us in at some point.
To collect our things, I mean.

164
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,882
Doreen, I promise you,
I will sort this out.

165
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,352
Everyone, listen up! I promise you
I'll get to the bottom of this.

166
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,309
I will find out what's going on
but I just need some time, OK?

167
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,807
What are we supposed to do now?

168
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,772
- How?
- But, Richard, what can you do?

169
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,653
<i>I...</i> I don't know, but I promise you,

170
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,487
I will make sure that every one of you
gets what they're due.

171
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,870
I will not, will not, let you down.

172
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,966
OK, Jean-Baptiste, here I come.

173
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,597
I am interested in the, er...

174
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,760
...the arts and culture.

175
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:03,269
I love travel and adventure

176
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,981
and generally being...

177
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:12,445
...spon-tan-eous.

178
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,782
Whoosh!

179
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,953
Oh, God!

180
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,791
'Finally, after heavy bidding,
a diamond has been sold today at Sotheby's

181
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,747
'for a record 10.8 million.'

182
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,710
Blimey!

00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:33,174

OK.

193
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,906
Ken, I'm coming for you.

194
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,332
Oh, twice in one week.
What have I done to deserve this?

195
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,611
- Kate, we need to talk.
- Not now, Richard. I'm busy.

196
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,582
- Please, I just need to...
- Hello!

197
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,872
- Hello, Ken.
- Look, no flowers!

198
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,335
Well done!

199
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,669
- Oh, it's you again.
- Ken. Again, hi.

200
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,305
Kate, I need to speak to you.

201
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,760
- I'll see you...
- Yes...

202
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,848
OK, great.
Looking forward.

203
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,270
- Have you been drinking?
- No... Yes.

204
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,792
- Look, what difference does it make?
- A lot of difference.

205
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,733
You're prone to exaggeration
and wild statements of intent.

206
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,697
Look, there are big problems at the office.

207
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,201
Please, tell it to Anastasia or Michaela
or whoever the latest is...

208
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,487
Culco has gone into receivership.

209
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,623
The new owners have stripped us
of any value and run us into the ground.

210
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,781
The shares are worthless.

211
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,410
My pension, your pension,
was all tied up in those shares.

212
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,501
The mortgage payments on my place,
this place, the kids' university fees,

213
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,587
everything we'd saved up for
them afterwards, it's all gone.

214
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,508
Kate, I virtually had
the whole company on board.

215
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,799
Marcus, Janice,
I even got Doreen involved.

216
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,894
Come on.

217
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,334
What do we know
about these guys?

218
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,483
Lavco. They came in hard and fast
out of nowhere.

219
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,860
The holding company
traded by the name of Lexon.

220
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,614
We were persuaded
to integrate our pension fund into theirs.

221
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,151
Turns out Lexon was hollow, toxic.

222
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:23,072
So when they turned to dust,
so did our pension.

223
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,911
There's always someone bigger
behind these things,

224
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,123
someone who manages
to wipe their hands clean and move on.

225
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,417
- Still allergic to cat hair?
- Worse than ever.

226
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,756
Go on, Rumpy, sit on him.

227
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,134
- I see you got your PhD.
- Yeah.

228
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:44,517
- So, how's life as a lecturer?
- Under-paid.

229
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,470
- What are the students like?
- Under-motivated.

230
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,607
Could you just stop fidgeting
and sit down?

231
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,736
I'm on the site but I can't get
any real info. I'm being blocked.

232
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,067
We need a password.

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,449
- We need...
- Matt.

234
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,654
We need Matt.

235
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,615
'Mum, you do know hacking is illegal.'

236
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,297
'I know, Matt and I would never want you
to do anything illegal.

237
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,872
'But I wondered if you could just...
accidentally stumble into it.'

238
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,536
Accidentally stumble into it?

239
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,124
- 'Son, do <i>as</i> your mother asks.'
- Dad?

240
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
- What are you doing there?
- 'It's a long story, Matty boy.

241
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,963
'But right now it's payback time
on that misspent youth I funded.'

242
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,346
- 'We funded.'
- OK, hold on.

243
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,884
I'll have to use my other computer.
Wait here.

244
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,520
- Is that his roommate, Tyler?
- I think it is.

245
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,816
' Oh, Tyler!

246
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,106
- "Close the door.'
- 'Come on, son. Close it now.'

247
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,740
Mr and Mrs J?

248
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,401
'Yes, we're here on Skype.'

249
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,665
'OK, I've emailed you the password.
That will get you in.'

250
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,459
- 'Good man!'
- 'Well done, Matt.'

251
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,046
Oh, and guys...
it's really good to see you together again.

252
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,593
- Oh!
- Hey!

253
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,969
- We're in.
- Good.

254
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,257
I've always wanted to say that.

255
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,305
There we go. Lexon.

256
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,721
Owned by one Vincent Mathias Kruger,

257
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,107
international hedge fund manager,
born in Budapest,

258
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,896
currently resides in Paris, horribly young,
keen sportsman, patron of the arts.

259
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,688
Oh! Mentor to the young.

260
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,610
Could he look any more like a money
grabbing, cheating, immoral little shit?

261
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,240
But you're not gonna get away with
it, my friend, not on my watch.

262
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,244
- He can't hear you.
- I know he can't hear me.

263
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,408
But he's certainly gonna feel my wrath.

264
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,044
- OK, Guevara, what's your plan?
- I'm gonna go to Paris.

265
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,445
I'm gonna go to Paris
with what little money I have left

266
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,297
and bang on that man's door so loudly
he's gonna pay for me to go away.

267
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,098
I'm gonna get back
what's rightfully mine.

268
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,126
- Ours.
- Ours.

269
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,722
I didn't work for 25 years in that
God-forsaken job to have some little...

270
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,881
Prick?

271
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,638
...prick like him stroll in
and spirit away my, our, retirement.

272
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,478
I'm gonna do it for all the little people
who've done nothing but play by the rules.

273
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,565
For Marcus and Janice,
for Doreen, for you.

274
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,604
No, do not do it for me.

275
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,569
For the kids.

276
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,702
- How's your French?
- Rusty. Why?

277
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,237
<i>Non.</i>

278
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,952
<i>Non, non, non, non, non, non.
Absolutely not.</i> No <i>way!</i>

279
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,971
You missed it again!
I said the second exit.

280
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,184
I couldn't get across.

281
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,315
What do you mean,
you couldn't get across? Just indicate!

282
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,273
I am indicating, darling, but
they're not paying any bloody attention.

283
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,955
How can your driving
not have improved?

284
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,783
You've had years to practise.
Be assertive, man!

285
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,488
Be assertive? Right.

286
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,665
- This is very unlike her.
- She might have got a better offer.

287
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,007
- A better offer than Ken?
- Our dog's a better offer than Ken.

288
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,188
- Let's just get something straight, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

289
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,690
- We go, we sort this mess out.
- Uh-huh.

290
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,227
And then we go on
with the rest of our lives, separately.

291
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,191
Sounds good to me.

292
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,988
Come on then, Trotsky.
Let's get this over with.

293
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,050
<i>Merci.</i>

294
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,016
- Hmm... no dice.
- No.

295
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,142
Do you remember that time
at Soph's PTA meeting

296
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,264
when we couldn't
get in to see the headmaster?

297
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,021
- And you...?
- Yeah.

298
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,437
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.

299
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,244
Oh, sweetheart... Oh, damn!
Oh, dear, dear.

300
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,621
A glass of water, please.

301
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,750
- Which floor?
- Top ﬂoor.

302
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,506
- Not bad, Miss Jones. Not bad.
- You never lose skills like that.

303
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,950
- Can you still do that thing with your...
- No, Richard.

304
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,306
- Mr Kruger's office?
- Oui.

305
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,434
<i>- Trés bon.
- Quoi?</i>

306
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,106
Mr Kruger, I'm sorry...

307
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,529
It's OK. Can I help you?

308
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,527
You bought the company
I work for last week.

309
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,701
- Pardon?
- And ran it into the ground.

310
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,323
I Don't understand, sir.

311
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,280
Vous étes <i>un</i> money grabbing pig!

312
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,413
- Your company...
- Votre... votre company.

313
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,963
- ...bought my company...
- Hang on... acheté <i>ma...</i> company.

314
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,336
And ran it into the ground.

315
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,009
<i>Et le...</i>

316
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,839
Steady, Kate.

317
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,927
- Steady, Kate. Steady.
- Sorry.

318
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,306
I run a lot of companies into the ground.
Which one?

319
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,105
- Culco.
- Culco, er...

320
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,310
See, that was last week. I very much
live in the now, the maintenant.

321
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,148
Well, maybe this is maintenant enough for you.
You stole all our money and we want it back.

322
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,948
- And you are?
- This is my wife.

323
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,107
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife.

324
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,034
- Ex-wife?
- Yeah, we've established that now.

325
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,193
<i>- So</i> you're not denying it.
- No, I don't think so.

326
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,035
Listen, you,
there are people whose lives

327
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,957
depend on the pension
they were gonna receive.

328
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,626
You can't just throw them away like that.
It's just not fair.

329
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,462
OK, OK, you got me.

330
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,717
What I did was wrong,
reprehensible, evil even.

331
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,468
In a normal world, illegal. But that's
the beauty of it: it's completely legal.

332
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,515
Now, listen to me, you little sack of shit.

333
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,890
You are messing with people's lives.
Proper, good, hardworking people

334
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,391
who have done absolutely nothing

335
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,355
but play by the bloody rules
laid out in front of them.

336
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,236
Oh, she definitely wears the trousers, no?

337
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,439
I'm not even gonna rise to that.
Of course she does.

338
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,987
- We're the older generation. We're enlightened.
- We're divorced.

339
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,531
And we're done.

340
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,281
Put me down. Put me down!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

341
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,285
Put me down. Put my wife down!
Put my wife down!

342
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,741
- There you go.
- Ex-wife.

343
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,120
Ex-wife.

344
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,497
- Could have had 'em.
- Shit!

345
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,703
We are totally taking him down.
Totally!

346
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,585
Now what, huh?

347
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,139
Whoo!

348
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,938
Close your mouth.
Who do you think she belongs to?

349
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,146
If I were a betting man, I'd say...
Here you go.

350
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,187
Bingo!

351
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,534
- Quick, let's follow.
- Good idea.

352
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,578
- Let me drive. I'm the better driver.
- No way, José. You forgot your license.

353
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,785
- Come on, Richard. I'm a much better driver.
- You forgot your license.

354
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,286
You're not a better driver.
You just think you are.

355
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,366
You'll regret it.

356
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,002
- Remember Hammersmith bridge?
- That's unfair.

357
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,878
You forgot to put oil in the tank.
You forgot to put oil in it.

358
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,585
- Go fast. Go fast.
- I'm not gonna go fast.

359
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,716
Quickly, they're getting away.

360
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,846
- You've gotta keep up, Richard.
- It's called tailing, Kate.

361
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,291
If we get too close,
they'll know they're being followed.

362
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,768
Well, that was
the world's shortest car chase.

363
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,413
What? It's a red light!
You want me to start running reds now?

364
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,269
No, God forbid, Richard.

365
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,900
Well, that was intense.

366
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,983
Thank you. Could have killed a nun.

367
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,740
Many nuns, possibly.
A whole load of dead nuns.

368
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,515
- Oh, that's them, Richard!
- What?

369
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,450
I've just seen them, Richard!
Please, let me drive.

370
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,535
- Please! Please, let me drive.
- Fine.

371
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,627
OK, OK. It's been a while.

372
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,632
What did you have for lunch?

373
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,959
What?

374
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,759
Buckle up.

375
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,003
Which way are we going?
Kate, we're going backwards.

376
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,679
- Yep.
- Backwards, Kate!

377
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,727
Putting my seat belt on.
Putting my seat belt on right now.

378
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,773
Kate, no, no, no, no!
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

379
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,984
- Argh!
- Hold tight.

380
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,439
I'm holding tight!
We can't even afford the basic insurance.

381
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,820
Oh, fuck the insurance.

382
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,325
Whoo-hoo!

383
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,282
Ha! We did it!
There they are.

384
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,208
- All right, now stick it on.
- What?

385
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,041
Track 3, "All Right Now".
It helps me drive.

386
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,633
Where did you learn
to drive like this?

387
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,835
- School run.
- What? With the children in the car?

388
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,309
Sorry. Sorry.

389
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,702
Mother and child.
Mother and child!

390
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,870
We're gonna run into the baby!

391
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,031
- For God's sake, get over.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

392
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,874
- Don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

393
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,037
- Yes, you're panicking. I can feel it.
- I'm not. I'm not panicking.

394
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,388
God, I love Free!

395
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:32,476
Oh, fuck! That was really tight.
That was tight.

396
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,337
- Here we go.
- Stay on their tail.

397
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,237
- We're nearly there.
- Yeah.

398
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,116
Grit?

399
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,948
OK, we're being shot at.

400
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,201
Stop, stop, stop.
Leave the car.

401
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:54,377
Really? Just leave it?
Just leave it here?

402
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,671
- OK. Just walk away. Act natural.
- We can't just leave it here!

403
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,965
- Yeah? OK, all right.
- No, no, no, no, no!

404
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,883
No, you're right.
When you're right, you're right.

405
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,127
Get back in.

406
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,805
- Jesus Christ, Are you mad?
- Sorry, I just panicked there.

407
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,727
I understand but we've just got
to... Let's have a cup of tea.

408
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,100
No, it's all right.
Stop talking about tea. We're in France.

409
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,867
- You kept your bag.
- Yeah. So did you.

410
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,789
- Yeah, they've lasted quite well, actually.
- Better than us.

411
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,619
Yeah, well, they came with a guarantee.

412
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,121
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

413
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,003
- We'd like two rooms.
- Passports, please.

414
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,469
Here.

415
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,921
- There you go.
- Thank you.

416
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,758
Mrs Jones.

417
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,228
- Well, Ms.
- And Mr Jones.

418
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,556
- Yes.
- And you want two rooms?

419
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:57,936
- Yes.
- Yes.

420
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,608
You are brother and sister?

421
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,559
- No.
- No.

422
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,145
A suite, perhaps?

423
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,070
- No.
- Next to each other?

424
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,694
Not necessary, really.
We're divorced. I kept his name.

425
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,260
- Ah, but you kept his name.
- Yes.

426
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,482
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

427
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,071
Yes, because it's been mine for some time.
And my kids have it. It's no biggy.

428
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,332
And you are holidaying together
to see if perhaps the ﬂame still burns?

429
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,209
- Yeah, why not? I mean...
- No, so not. The flame is out.

430
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,419
- Oh, no.
- Snuffed, gone.

431
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:27,128
We are in Paris. You never know...

432
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,054
We do know.

433
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:35,011
Ah, I'm afraid the only two rooms
I have left are adjoining.

434
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,223
- What about those?
- Oh, no, they are all taken.

435
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,852
We are very, very busy.

436
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,861
- Really?
- We'll take them. Thank you. Bonsoir.

437
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,155
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

438
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,784
Bloody hell. What floor?

439
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,328
- Haven't a clue.
- Christ!

440
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,500
You don't fancy rubbing some Deep Heat
into my coccyx, do you?

441
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,954
- No.
- Just a thought.

442
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,423
Ooh!

443
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:22,438
You'll never guess
where I find myself.

444
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,369
<i>Pourquoi pas?</i>

445
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,583
There's two bowls down for Rumpus
and the kitchen light is on.

446
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,961
Sophie, darling!
Hey, got your leg over yet?

447
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,793
Hello. Sophie, darling?

448
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,212
You haven't heard from you mother,
have you?

449
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,470
No, it's nothing to worry about. It's just
we were supposed to see her yesterday.

450
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,281
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns,
in all the world, she walks into mine."

451
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,789
What are the chances, eh?

452
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,801
Steak-frites.
That's what you'll have.

453
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,844
Nope. Turned veggie two years ago.

454
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,718
But you love meat.

455
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,846
People change, Richard.
But you're gonna have the cheese souffle.

456
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,473
- Nope.
- But you love cheese.

457
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,681
- Cholesterol levels change, Kate.
- How's your prostate?

458
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,889
Fully functioning, thank you.
How are your bunions?

459
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,610
Oh, how sweet of you to remember.
Actually, they're awful.

460
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,689
High heels are no longer an option. See?

461
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,400
Here's to our aging, ailing bodies.

462
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,572
- May I?
- Yes, go on.

463
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,371
Ooh, ooh!

464
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,290
Hey! Hey, sweetie!

465
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,460
How's it going?

466
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,421
Oh, I'm so glad.

467
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,256
And you like the people in your halls?

468
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,225
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

469
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,977
All right, yes, you've got to go.
Of course you've got to go.

470
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:31,358
Call me... call me later.
Yes, I love you... Bye... bye.

471
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:36,818
- Rich, what could I say to her?
- It's all right. It's fine.

472
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,404
Oh!

473
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,790
He)', honey, how's it going?

474
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,161
Yeah? For every party write an essay.

475
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,328
All right, for every three
parties write an essay.

476
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:56,261
No. No, no, no.
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

477
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,259
Is that what Mum said?

478
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,216
Ah, well, great minds and all that.

479
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,599
Listen, do me a favour, next time
you speak to your Mum, tell her...

480
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,227
Tell her I miss her.

481
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,558
OK.

482
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,977
I love you.

483
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,987
Bye, darling.

484
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,565
- What's got into you?
- I don't know.

485
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,778
Paris, retirement,
spending time with you,

486
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,829
having our money stolen.

487
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,953
That'll do it.

488
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,250
This is nice, right?

489
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,793
Yeah.

490
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,754
Michaela, er...

491
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,969
Just a sec... just one second.

492
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,428
Listen, Michaela, I can't talk right now.
Please understand.

493
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,109
It's OK, I'm just tired.
I'm gonna eat in my room.

494
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,311
Shit.

495
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,289
Guess who's getting married?

496
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,842
Ah! "Vincent Kruger
and fiancée Manon Fontaine.

497
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,216
"Spotted off the coast of Cannes
as they prepare for their big day.

498
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,422
"The upcoming nuptials
are rumoured to be taking place...

499
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,515
<i>...“at the Krugers' 19th-century chateau</i>

500
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,061
"located within the exclusive enclave
of Cap d'Antibes."

501
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,979
We've got to get ourselves
invited to that wedding.

502
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,683
Why? We hate weddings.
It's the only thing we agree on.

503
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,143
Look at her neck.

504
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,021
- Pretty.
- Mm-hmm. What's round it?

505
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,950
- Nice.
- Mmm, nice in the region of 10 million.

506
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,151
Oh, very nice.

507
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,203
I'm pretty sure... in fact, I'm positive

508
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,906
that's the Eye of the Rainbow.

509
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,788
- I thought I recognised it on her yesterday.
- Ah, the Eye of the Rainbow.

510
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,586
Yes, that sold at Sotheby's recently,
fetching a record price for a single stone.

511
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,710
When did you become
such a diamond aficionado?

512
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,584
Since the kids left home.
Daytime TV.

513
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,136
It's a mine of useless information.

514
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,715
- And, in this case, life-changing information.
- Indeed.

515
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,848
I bet she's gonna be wearing that rock
at the wedding.

516
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:14,274
That rock is our pension.
That rock is Doreen's pension.

517
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,485
We should nick it.

518
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,154
What?

519
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,874
It's just taking back
what he's taken from us and all the others.

520
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:31,913
You want to steal a diamond?

521
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,369
Richard, he's not gonna
give us our money back.

522
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,250
Well, that doesn't mean
we suddenly become the Pink Panther.

523
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,503
Why not?
Richard, we are screwed.

524
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,334
We have nothing, literally nothing.

525
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,715
Nothing to give the kids.
It's time to take back what's ours.

526
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,676
I'm sick of these fat, greedy, fucker billionaires
taking all our money, just ruining this country.

527
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,434
Well, not this country, actually, because
France has got great social services

528
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,059
and, my word, do they run a good protest.

529
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,858
It's a stupid idea, Kate.

530
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,186
- Crazy, daft...
- All right, all right.

531
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,442
...stupid but brilliant.

532
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,609
- Brilliant idea.
- Yeah?

533
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,741
Why the hell not?
If not now, when? What have we got to lose?

534
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,618
- Apart from our dignity and our freedom.
- Exactly.

535
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,750
- Either way, it's worth investigating.
- Definitely. Let's investigate.

536
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,195
Well, it looks like we're heading
to the south of France.

537
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,836
Ah, together!
What a good idea.

538
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,881
Delightful.
Isn't she beautiful?

539
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,888
- She is.
- Shut up.

540
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,571
Yes, yes.
Yes, I understand.

541
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,574
What do you mean, they won't take it?

542
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,488
Cut it up?

543
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,832
Well, that's end of the credit cards.
Gone, kaput.

544
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,590
- Who are you texting? You're like a teenager.
- No one.

545
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,544
- She's gorgeous.
- Not my type.

546
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,097
Oh, right, yeah. Legs up to the ceiling
and arse as tight as a plum.

547
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,469
Of course she isn't.

548
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:16,807
Once maybe, but not anymore.
I like things a bit more... homely.

549
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,359
If that was an attempt to ﬂatter me,
you can piss right off.

550
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,276
Look, the legs aren't nearly
as good in real life.

551
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,359
They've clearly been airbrushed.

552
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,240
- Steady. Handbrake off.
- I've got it.

553
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,444
It's off.

554
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,657
You've got it now. OK.
Where's she going?

555
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,491
Just try and look like a tourist.

556
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,602
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

557
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,193
Blimey!

558
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,362
You should go in there.

559
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,197
- Go and check the place out.
- I can't go in there.

560
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,577
Go on, go on.

561
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,023
Julie.

562
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,155
Laura.

563
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,793
And who are you?

564
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,121
Oh, <i>moi?</i>
Er... me, I'm Miriam from... Weymouth.

565
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,791
I'm your cousin...
well, second cousin,

566
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,337
twice removed,
on your husband's side, future husband.

567
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,006
All right. You're with them.

568
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,057
Oh! Brilliant!

569
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,735
Ow!

570
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,942
Oh, I'm so sorry.

571
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,471
Yeah.

572
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,646
Ah, it's going to be
the best wedding ever.

573
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,859
Ah, the champion!

574
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,572
Could I have a Martini, please?
A really big one. Thank you.

575
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,651
No, I don't know.
I think I'm making a terrible mistake.

576
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,452
- No!
- You're not, sweetie.

577
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,031
He's only using our wedding
as a business meeting.

578
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,160
He's got two Texans and their wives coming.

579
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,209
We've never met them before
and he wants me to make sure they are OK.

580
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,835
Well, that's not right.

581
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,962
And he's putting them up at The Carlton.

582
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,044
Lovely! The Carlton!

583
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,050
Hey, what do you think?

584
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,973
You're old.
You must have been married once.

585
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,762
<i>Er... yes. Merci.</i>

586
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,727
Old, old me.
Er... what do I think?

587
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,779
Er...

588
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:58,907
I think that liking them is much more
important than loving them, actually.

589
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,783
Love is easy to fall into.
Liking is much harder.

590
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,410
Think of your wedding as a driving test.

591
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,464
You take it, you pass, and then you
really start to learn how to drive.

592
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,054
Or you crash.

593
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,391
What about that diamond he bought you?
You like that.

594
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,265
- Yeah!
- Are you going to wear it at the wedding?

595
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,729
Not for the ceremony.

596
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,440
I'll change halfway
through the party and put it on then.

597
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,319
Hey, come on, girls, let's para!

598
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,287
I like you. You're honest.
I don't have girlfriends like that.

599
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,123
Good.

600
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,172
<i>So</i> come on, come with me.
This is so much fun!

601
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,378
I'm gonna kill you, Richard!

602
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,682
So shoot me. I nodded off.
It happens at my age.

603
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,520
And you were snoring.

604
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,271
Another unfortunate effect of age.

605
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,956
Look, can we just stop niggling
and tell me what you found out?

606
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,648
I found out that I chafe very easily.

607
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,076
- Oh, my poor girl. I'm so sorry.
- Get off.

608
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,699
And the wedding's obviously invite only.

609
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,903
But she is definitely
gonna be wearing the diamond.

610
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,158
She's gonna change
halfway through the evening.

611
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,993
That sounds good.
Anything else?

612
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,920
Not really, just that she's
pissed off with the evil one

613
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,465
for inviting a couple of Texan businessmen
they've never met before.

614
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,713
Of course she's pissed off.
She'll end up looking after their wives.

615
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,544
And she's right, it's bang out of order.

616
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,722
She didn't happen to mention
where they might be staying?

617
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,845
'So what are we stumbling into today?'

618
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,636
The Carlton Hotel, Cannes.
Their guest list.

619
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,022
We're looking for four guests
with home addresses in Texas.

620
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,227
"Dad, that is so illegal.'

621
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,735
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, son.
I wouldn't ask unless it was really...

622
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,693
'Dad, I'm only kidding.
We do that sort of shit all the time,

623
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,692
'messing with people's reservations,
putting people in the same room.'

624
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,701
- Not good, Matt.
- No, no.

625
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,328
"Hold on.'

626
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:10,580
- Do you think his eyes looked a bit red-rimmed?
- Just a little.

627
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,800
- Oh, he's not, is he?
- Yep.

628
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,669
- Tyler!
- Tyler! Oi!

629
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,838
Tyler! Tyler! Hello!

630
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,222
- <i>'Hello.'
- 'Hello.'</i>

631
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,305
You've got to be kidding me!
You guys, again.

632
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,846
Nice to see you, Tyler.

633
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,230
'OK, we've got one Mr and Mrs Hicks
of Houston, Texas.

634
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,144
"They're assigned to the Monet suite.

635
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,448
"And one Mr and Mrs Baxter.
They're across the hall in the Manet suite.

636
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,077
'Anyway, guys, I've got to go.
But the south of France?

637
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,329
'I am loving my new glam parents.

638
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,614
'See you later.'

639
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,045
- OK, so let me just get this straight.
- Hmm.

640
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,462
We are going to kidnap four Texans,
pretend to be them,

641
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,422
<i>go to a wedding in a chateau,</i>

642
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,633
somehow swap out the necklace,
and make our escape?

643
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,015
I know, it sounds absurd.

644
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:11,974
- Absurd, yes. Crazy, daft, stupid.
- All right, all right.

645
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,559
But brilliant.

646
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,190
- Yeah?
- One small problem.

647
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,977
There are four Texans
and we are but two.

648
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,611
Ah.

649
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,310
- This is it.
- That's not ours.

650
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,319
- It is ours.
- It's not ours.

651
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,903
- Look, it is.
- Oh, shit, it is.

652
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,152
- Mind your back.
- It's all right, I've got it. Ow!

653
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,944
- There, there, there!
- Hey-hey-hey-hey!

654
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,619
- Hello, old son!
- Welcome, welcome.

655
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,461
- Good to see you, mate!
- Good to see you.

656
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,836
I cannot tell you how happy we are
to see you back together.

657
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,715
- Well, Pen...
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

658
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,128
And I don't mind telling you,
it's been an absolute nightmare for us,

659
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,508
having to choose between you.

660
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,189
Damn shame,
the whole bloody business.

661
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,758
Anyway, thrilled to be here, glad to help.
What are we doing?

662
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,172
Well...

663
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,770
- Kidnap? Stealing a diamond?
- Gatecrashing a wedding?

664
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,190
- Can we have... a moment?
- It's a lot to take in.

665
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,322
Talk about it. Go ahead.
I've got your bag.

666
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,030
What do you think?

667
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,574
- He's in. She's not.
- Probably.

668
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,583
Well... all right, we're in.

669
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,416
- Spot of lunch first?
- Yes!

670
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,640
Right. Everyone clear on the plan?

671
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,939
I tell you, I haven't been this pumped
since Shanghai.

672
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:20,898
Shanghai?

673
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,642
Yeah, you know,
when I was in the Merchant Navy?

674
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,727
- Merchant Navy?
- Woman in every port, eh, Jerry?

675
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:28,273
That sort of thing, yeah.
It's only a bit of boys' banter, Pen.

676
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,195
Pen, are you sure
these are gonna work?

677
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,026
Yes, three of those
and they'll be out like a baby.

678
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,913
- Five minutes tops.
- I can vouch for that.

679
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,739
- Who prescribes them for you?
- That lovely young Dr Jenkins.

680
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,374
Oh, yes. I've heard he's lovely.

681
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,707
Yes, terribly helpful.
And the warmest hands.

682
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,496
Excuse me?

683
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,381
How will we know who they are?

684
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,963
Well, I think we'll know.

685
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,844
Let's do this.

686
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,862
- Sorry, I'm dying for a pee.
- Of course.

687
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,455
Actually, I might go as well.

688
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,000
You know what?
I need one too, actually.

689
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,537
Well, it's never good to ignore it.

690
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,093
<i>Bienvenus.</i>

691
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,780
- That was incredible!
- We were incredible!

692
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:35,112
Oh, God, I hope we didn't
tie their hands too tightly.

693
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,530
Oh, do you think?

694
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:41,038
That was insane. I haven't had
this much fun since I was in Guam.

695
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:41,993
Guam?

696
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,158
I was stationed there
during my military service.

697
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,123
Oh, God!

698
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,587
Jerry! That's stealing!

699
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,919
Pen, Pen, Pen.
This is real. This is happening.

700
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,256
We either step up or we get crushed.

701
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,675
- Silly man. Stop showing off.
- Right.

702
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,387
Let's pick up the replica necklace,
back to the hotel, cocktails and supper.

703
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,348
Yee-ha!
Ride 'em, cowboy.

704
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,936
Jerry, how on earth did you know
where to find someone

705
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,897
who could make a replica necklace?

706
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,232
Well, you know...
I have my contacts.

707
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,523
Contacts? No, Jerry we don't.

708
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,990
Well, if you must know, I once
had a brief, er... affair of the heart

709
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,619
with a young jewellery designer.

710
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,658
Affair of the heart
with a young jewellery designer!

711
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,121
Calm down, Pen.
It's all right.

712
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,965
Yeah, don't worry, Pen.
It's all in the past, all forgotten.

713
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,706
This is the basic layout of the chéteau.

714
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,874
Do you know
where all the guards might be?

715
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,423
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely, yes.

716
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,553
- No Jerry?
- No.

717
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,193
Rushed off while I was having a bath.

718
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,144
Said he had to meet a man about something.
Very odd, the whole thing.

719
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,475
Anyway, don't let him spoil this.

720
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,186
This is lovely, seeing the two of you
being back together.

721
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,561
Sorry, everyone. Got held up.
Quick little mission.

722
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,690
I was just saying this is lovely and it's
lovely to see our friends back together.

723
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,530
- <i>Pen, can we get</i> back <i>to the plan?
- Absolument. Pardon.</i>

724
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,320
Now, this is where
the guests will be making their entrance.

725
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,566
And we will be required
to show our invitations here.

726
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,166
Now, you are going to be the Baxters
and we will be the Hicks.

727
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:10,124
- And actually, Matt... Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

728
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,334
Matt has done some research
into each couple.

729
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,006
- Hey! Your Matt?
- Our Matt.

730
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,088
- Such a bright boy.
- Thank you.

731
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,968
Not like our Tim, is he?

732
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,925
- That's disloyal, Jerry.
- Well, I was just being honest.

733
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,057
He's an academic disaster zone, isn't he?
Police tape all around him.

734
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,341
Jerry!

735
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,599
Now, we know that the bride will retire to
her bedroom at some point during the night

736
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,356
to change her frock and the new frock
will be accompanied by the diamond.

737
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,734
Now, hopefully, Richard and I
will have gained access through here.

738
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:37,318
We'll attempt to swap out the diamond,
delivering the real one into your arms, Jerry.

739
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,320
Now, you two will leave the party early
and if anything happens to us,

740
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,483
if we get caught,
we're just a disgruntled employee

741
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,740
and his pushy ex-wife

742
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,861
who've had their pensions stolen
and won't go away.

743
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,455
They'll find nothing on us
and they'll let us go.

744
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,164
- Right.
- Or they'll kill us.

745
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,954
Chop us up
and throw us in the Med.

746
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,709
- Oh, God.
- Richard!

747
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,716
It's out there. It's a possibility.

748
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,965
Jerry, why do you keep winking at Richard
and patting your pocket?

749
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,509
What? What are you talking about?
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

750
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,094
I know when you're lying.

751
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,421
Get off me, woman. Whey-hey!
What are you doing, woman?

752
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,065
- Hey! Ho-ho!
- God, he's got a gun!

753
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,058
What?

754
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,232
Don't advertise it
to the whole flipping restaurant!

755
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,614
Why have you got a gun
and why have you brought it to dinner?

756
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,319
<i>'</i> Are you crazy?
- Crazy? Me?

757
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,328
- Kate, Richard, talk to him.
- Jerry, actually, why have you got a gun?

758
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,366
It's a replica. Calm down. We just
thought it was a good idea, that's all.

759
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,284
It's a real one, actually.
They didn't have any replicas left.

760
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,583
- Bloody hell.
- We? So you're behind this brilliant plan?

761
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,793
Richard, have you led Jerry astray?

762
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:39,880
- What? No! It was his idea.
- Led me astray? I'm not a flipping child.

763
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,336
They were my contacts.

764
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,676
Jerry, where did you get this?
I demand to know!

765
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,935
Well, it's someone I knew a long time ago.

766
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,767
I was passing through France
on my way to Guam.

767
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,728
How come I don't know anything about this?
I've been married to you for <i>35</i> years, Jerry.

768
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,188
- You've completely spoiled the whole evening.
- All right, love.

769
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,351
- Have some more wine.
- Just have a bit more wine.

770
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,573
Let's at least see it, then.

771
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,449
- Yeah, let's have a look.
- See what?

772
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,077
- The gun, Jerry.
- What? You want to see it?

773
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,534
- I do, actually.
- Let's have a look. Come on.

774
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,540
- Come on, then.
- All right.

775
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,543
- All right.
- Nobody's watching.

776
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,662
Hey-hey! Have a look at that.
All right, all right. One at a time!

777
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,630
Whoops, sorry.

778
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,837
Oh!

779
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,644
Freeze, you melon farmers.

780
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,475
- Steady, Pen.
- Oh, sorry.

781
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,637
Put it down.

782
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,806
Jesus Christ!

783
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,228
All right, er...

784
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,271
- Out the door. Shall we?
- Yeah. Drink up.

785
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,906
The bill, please.

786
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,862
Well, that was something, wasn't it?

787
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,993
- Do you'll think we'll get arrested?
- No.

788
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,620
Oi, chaps, chaps.
Good news.

789
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,657
I've just been talking to the owner.
Turns out we were in the Legion together.

790
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,246
He says if we, er... pay for the wine,
everything's OK.

791
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,286
- Fantastic.
- Oh, fabulous.

792
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:01,424
- I feel a bit giddy, Jerry.
- Oh, I say! You all right there, Pen?

793
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,710
- Bedtime for us all.
- Right-o.

794
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,253
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

795
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,809
- What are you doing?
- Well... they seem so happy.

796
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,811
You know, with the idea of us.

797
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,473
I don't want to spoil it
for them, that's all.

798
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,894
<i>Just... oh... just...</i>

799
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,528
Just...

800
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,527
Oh... Oh!

801
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,737
Oh, that feels good.

802
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,909
Do you think we're doing the right thing?

803
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:38,078
You know, diamond stealing and kidnapping.

804
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,793
Without a shadow of a doubt.

805
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,008
Sit down for a minute.

806
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,394
I said sit.

807
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,567
Lying down is fine too.

808
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,234
Pen and I had a gin, doubles.

809
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,650
I just can't take it. I can't take
my booze anymore. That's the thing.

810
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,662
Well... it just whips my arse.

811
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,914
You're much more likeable
these days, you know?

812
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,542
That's nice. Thanks.

813
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,042
So are you.

814
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,046
We were much too young when we met.

815
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,926
We should have met now instead.

816
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,556
I don't think it works like that.

817
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,481
Why not?

818
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:49,444
Why did the latest one leave you?

819
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,238
She didn't, actually.

820
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,873
I left her.

821
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,254
Hmm.

822
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,710
- How's your back?
- Terrible.

823
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,004
How's your bunions?

824
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,882
Oh, excruciating.

825
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,052
Sweet dreams.

826
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,892
Night-night.

827
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,067
Oh.

828
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,360
- Oh, God! We didn't, did we?
- No.

829
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,321
Oh! Thank God.

830
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,202
You don't have to sound
so relieved about it.

831
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,994
Oh.

832
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,999
I haven't had sex for two years.
I'd like to have remembered it.

833
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,136
Jerry, try this.
Please, cos it's so juicy. Go on.

834
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,266
See what I mean?
Gorgeous.

835
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,223
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Here he is.

836
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,433
- Hello.
- The stallion.

837
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,018
Didn't get much sleep last night,
old son, did you?

838
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,060
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, the old bed did shake, eh?

839
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,854
- Only my snoring, Jerry. That's all it was.
- Right you are.

840
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,899
Looks like we've got a bit of a problem.
Matt did some digging around last night.

841
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,443
Apparently there are going to be
fingerprint sensors

842
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,727
at the entrance to the party.

843
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,155
Everyone's going to be scanned
before they're allowed in.

844
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,699
- It's worse than Fort Knox.
- Mm-hmm.

845
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,252
We could shave off their fingertips
and stick them onto ours.

846
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,630
The Texans, I mean.
I saw it in a film once.

847
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,712
- Pen...
- Oh, sorry.

848
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,385
- I do get carried away.
- Good to think outside the box.

849
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,546
We should go with something
a bit more mainstream, though.

850
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,215
- Can everyone swim?
- Yes.

851
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,558
- How about climbing?
- Have you ever climbed, Jerry?

852
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,934
- He has not.
- Yeah, I have.

853
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,436
- I have.
- Jerry! When?

854
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,939
- When?
- I was in the Australian Parachute Regiment.

855
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,442
7:28.

856
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,151
- 7:32.
- 7:32.

857
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,361
6:30.

858
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,993
- Jerry, you're still on English time.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

859
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,075
OK, let's do this.

860
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,797
Jerry! Jerry!

861
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,385
You're going the wrong way.

862
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,468
Right you are.

863
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,260
- Pen!
- Jerry!

864
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,590
- Ow!
- Ow!

865
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,050
What on earth are you doing?

866
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,474
- Jerry!
- It's OK.

867
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,162
- All right?
- Yeah.

868
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:11,210
Oh... Oh, Jesus.

869
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,996
You're scared of heights.
How could I forget? Are you all right?

870
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:16,966
I'm fine, thank you.

871
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,252
- Pen, you're squashing my head!
- Ssh, ssh!

872
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,216
I'm sorry, darling.

873
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,808
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!
- I've got you. I'm here.

874
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,727
Well done, Jerry.

875
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,362
Right.

876
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:41,653
- Have you got the gun?
- No, sorry, Richard.

877
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,193
I put my foot down.
I just decided it was too dangerous.

878
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,532
- Quite right.
- I simply don't trust myself around it.

879
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:49,073
But I made sandwiches, egg mayo.
Anyone hungry?

880
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,662
- Oh, great, I'm starving.
- Pen, I think we should get on.

881
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,623
Yeah, come on, this way.

882
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,412
Stay close to me, Jerry.

883
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,609
You look fine in that hat.

884
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,949
Mr and Mrs Chambord, from Qatar.

885
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,370
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

886
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,577
Mr Chabert, from Bordeaux.

887
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,669
Mr and Mrs Ossman, from Hanoi.

888
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,239
- Congratulations.
- Merci.

889
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,964
Thanks for coming.

890
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,253
Mr and Mrs Hicks and Mr and Mrs Baxter
from Houston, Texas.

891
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,513
- Ah, that's us!
- Hey! Bonsoir.

892
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,050
<i>- So</i> glad you made it. Long way to come.
- Howdy partner!

893
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,186
- Real great to be here.
- We'll find time to talk later. Welcome.

894
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,472
Of course, this is not really a wedding.

895
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,640
- It's a chance to do some business.
- Sweetheart.

896
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,887
Well, you're not to bore us with all that
oil talk. I'm here to have some fun.

897
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:03,485
Oh, we like fun, don't we?
Come along, missy.

898
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,446
Thank you.
It's a mighty fine chéteau.

899
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,987
Mr and Mrs Beltrami, from Rome.

900
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,545
- I think that went quite well.
- For now.

901
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,460
Let's blend in.

902
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:25,002
Darling, I need to powder my nose.
Would you be so kind as to accompany me?

903
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,136
- It would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

904
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,093
- Ey-up.
- Jerry!

905
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:33,352
Merci. Well, Kate said
to blend in, didn't she?

906
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,854
- Here's to us.
- Yeah.

907
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,233
- Which floor?
- Second floor.

908
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,863
Right.

909
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,241
Right.

910
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,826
Back in a tick.

911
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:25,980
That's it, that's her room.
OK, Jerry. 30 seconds.

912
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,196
Howdy, partner!
How ya doin' there?

913
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,362
- Come on.
- I'm looking for the old John Wayne.

914
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:39,160
The, er... pissoir, the, er... bog crapper?
Any idea?

915
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,795
Sorry, sir, downstairs.
This ﬂoor is private.

916
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,797
Her window's open
and there's a ledge running to it.

917
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,389
A ledge? Ledge?

918
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,346
More like a balcony.
Hold those.

919
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,442
- Slow, slow, slow.
- I am going slow.

920
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,574
- Don't look down.
- I'm not bloody looking down.

921
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,785
Oh... Oh!

922
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,288
Turn around, turn around.

923
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:26,332
See? Turn around. There you go.
That's it. You're all right now.

924
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:29,593
This is good. I got it.

925
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,714
Well done. Well done.

926
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,350
You're being very brave.
You're being very, very brave.

927
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,391
- Oh!
- Oh!

928
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,143
Oh, fuck!

929
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,353
Wait, wait, wait.

930
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,564
I've got you. I've got you.

931
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

932
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,259
- Cats.
- And flowers.

933
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,653
The 19th century.

934
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,404
I'm gonna get changed.

935
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,943
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

936
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,448
Go with her.

937
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,437
Ssh...

938
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,369
I'm coming.

939
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,507
Come in! Entrez!

940
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,855
What?

941
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,399
- You want to watch me get dressed now?
- Eh?

942
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,533
Get out! Get out!

943
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,247
She just... OK.

944
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,253
Ssh!

945
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,884
Oh, sorry. You're probably wondering
what I am doing.

946
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,099
- It's not...
- I'm so glad you're here.

947
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,434
Oh, there, there.

948
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:33,477
Now, just sit down
and tell Auntie... Miriam all your worries.

949
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,153
What's the matter?

950
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,316
I've made a terrible mistake.

951
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,076
He does not love me.
He never has and he never will.

952
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,738
I've sold myself to the devil.

953
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:49,000
- I'm a whore. I'm a devil's whore.
- No, no, you're not.

954
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,003
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

955
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,506
No, no, no, you're not.
Of course you're not.

956
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:59,753
Yes, I am.
I'm a terrible, horrible, shallow person.

957
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,342
I am a fake. I am a fake.

958
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,801
I am a fake. I am a fake.

959
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,370
No, don't say that about yourself.

960
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:13,017
From what I can tell, you're a highly original,
slightly highly strung, bright, imaginative girl.

961
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,480
- Really?
- Yes.

962
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,940
- You really think so?
- I do. I do. Really.

963
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:20,198
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

964
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:24,487
Oh, no! Oh, thank you.
Thank you, you're so nice.

965
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,132
No, I'm not, really.

966
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:35,873
Please excuse me.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

967
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,962
There, there, Manon.

968
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:40,878
Why are you crying?

969
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:44,890
- Me? Oh, it's the flowers. I'm, er... allergic.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

970
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,925
- It's all right.
- Oh.

971
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,220
No, no, no, Manon.
It's fine, really.

972
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:54,517
- No, don't do that.
- Bloody things! I don't like them anyway.

973
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,202
- What would you do?
- Me?

974
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,585
Yes. You're clearly a woman of the world.
What do you think of him?

975
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,253
- Your husband?
- Yes.

976
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,838
- Well, I mean, he's fine. He's...
- Fine?

977
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,544
Actually, I think he's a bit callous.

978
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,055
I'm sorry, I think you could do better.

979
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,841
I think he probably...

980
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,432
I think he probably treats you
like a piece of jewellery.

981
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,100
I think he probably treats you badly.

982
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,067
That's not to say he can't change.
I mean, they can change. People do change.

983
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:42,573
But it's easy to say I love you while
you're rolling around on expensive sheets.

984
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,200
It's so much harder
when they need washing.

985
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:54,410
Look, I'm not who you think I am.
I'm sorry, I'm not Miriam from Weymouth.

986
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,913
I'm not even Katie from Texas.
I'm just Kate from Surrey.

987
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,800
And my ex-husband is lying on the floor
next to your bed, I'm afraid.

988
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,547
- He is?
- Yep.

989
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,212
Oh! Hello.

990
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,468
- Hi.
- And why are you crying?

991
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,142
The cats.
But don't throw them out the window.

992
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:16,979
- Oh, he's really handsome.
- I know. It's irritating.

993
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,689
- Not sure about the moustache.
- I agree.

994
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,570
The thing is, you see,
your husband stole something from us

995
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,330
and from a lot
of other very good people.

996
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:27,568
Something very valuable to us:
our future.

997
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:34,208
And so we came here tonight to take back
what we feel is rightfully ours.

998
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,208
Oh. The diamond.

999
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,712
<i>- It's not very imaginative,</i> I <i>grant you.
- Sorry, my back was killing me.</i>

1000
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:45,715
- Manon, open up. It's Vincent.
- Take it. I don't like it anyway.

1001
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,346
Great. Here's the fake.

1002
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,221
Manon!

1003
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,304
What?

1004
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,647
Why are you throwing ﬂowers
out the window?

1005
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,609
I'm allergic.
Don't you know anything about me?

1006
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:12,367
You must take good care of this.
It's not a toy, it's very valuable.

1007
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,202
More valuable than me?

1008
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:21,418
Darling, there is nothing on earth that is
more valuable to me than me... than you!

1009
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,540
You should know that.

1010
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:32,307
And will you still love me
even when we are washing the sheets?

1011
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,808
Ssh!

1012
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,859
What are you doing?

1013
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,815
I don't know.
I thought you were about to sneeze.

1014
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:51,826
- Causing a distraction's supposed to stop it.
- That's hiccups.

1015
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,450
<i>Ah...</i> yes.

1016
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,041
I might sneeze again.

1017
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,874
What are we doing?
We've got to get out of here.

1018
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,792
Oh, OK.

1019
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,836
- What, back the way we came?
- Yes!

1020
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,909
- Oh! Sorry, old partner.
- Sorry, sorry.

1021
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,152
Yeah, howdy.

1022
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,422
Although not on the official schedule,
my new wife would like to say a few words.

1023
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:54,014
A wise woman once told me
that you can love your husband

1024
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,300
but you must also like him.

1025
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,021
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1026
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,901
And I finally realised that...

1027
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:12,654
...I don't love Vincent or even like him.

1028
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:18,538
<i>So Vincent, darling...</i>

1029
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,916
...I want a divorce.

1030
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:37,391
Stop! Stop!
There's been a travesty of justice.

1031
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,390
Catch them!

1032
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,552
Catch them!

1033
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,643
<i>Hey! Vive la révolution!</i>

1034
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,277
<i>Vive la révolution!</i>

1035
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,689
Oh!

1036
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,243
- Oh, my God, no!
- No, no.

1037
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,872
- Sorry, sorry-
- Sorry.

1038
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,923
Ooh! Ow!

1039
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,169
I knew there was something familiar
about you.

1040
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,303
Ooh!

1041
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,634
Ow!

1042
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,174
Oh, no! They're real.

1043
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:25,439
OK, let's make this simple.
Where is the real diamond?

1044
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,268
Bloody hell.

1045
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,116
- Oh!
- Oh, that's a whole other level of pain.

1046
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:45,079
Look, we're just a disgruntled employee and
his pushy wife who want back what's theirs.

1047
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,209
- You didn't say ex-wife.
- No, I didn't, did I?

1048
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,086
- Mmm...
- We should focus.

1049
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,498
- Right.
- Have you ever heard of karma?

1050
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,461
Perhaps you're being punished
for all the bad things

1051
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,379
that you might have done in your life.

1052
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,134
It's just a thought.

1053
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,685
Oh, no! That's just mean!
You're just being a bully now!

1054
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,770
Be grateful, I don't hit women.

1055
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:14,650
Now, tell me where my diamond is!

1056
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,588
I swallowed it.

1057
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,713
I sold the diamond.

1058
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,047
What?

1059
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,884
I swapped it and sold the real one.

1060
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:45,810
Gave the money to charity,
an orphanage in Calcutta.

1061
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,470
What? Why?

1062
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,186
A test, to see if you really loved me.

1063
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,101
You're crazy.
I'll deal with you later.

1064
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,520
Get rid of them.

1065
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,271
Oh, no.

1066
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,782
<i>OK, er...</i>

1067
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,319
If I'd known,
I'd have worn better underwear.

1068
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,950
I don't think it's your underwear
you should be worrying about, Pen.

1069
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,910
- These things reveal everything.
- What do you mean?

1070
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,701
- Yeah, every nook and cranny.
- Oh, God!

1071
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,000
What are you looking at?

1072
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,255
Damn cheek!

1073
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,644
Oh, yes, that's, er... Saigon,

1074
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:32,148
Vietnam, 1964.

1075
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,729
Took a bit of shrapnel, yeah.

1076
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,196
Bloody hell, they left some forceps
in there. Look, the clamp's in there.

1077
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,421
- I didn't know that.
- You can go.

1078
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,565
Bloody Vietnam.

1079
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,784
- Take them to the cliff.
- Huh? The cliff?

1080
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,495
Whisky? A last drink?

1081
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,001
Not my tipple.

1082
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,510
- I do hope they'll be all right, Jerry.
- I'm sure they'll be fine, love.

1083
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,045
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

1084
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,567
Stop whistling, Richard.

1085
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,696
- Please, stop whistling. It drives me mad.
- Helps me relax, Kate.

1086
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,403
Well, it doesn't help me relax.
It's driving me bloody mad.

1087
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,442
OK, I'll stop.
I've stopped whistling now, OK?

1088
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,051
We've stopped.

1089
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,631
Yes.

1090
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,349
- We're moving.
- Yes.

1091
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,565
- Kate.
- What?

1092
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,575
- I just wanted to say...
- What?

1093
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,828
I just wanted to say, Kate,
that whatever happens...

1094
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:13,121
- You're not trying to do a final speech, are you?
- No, not at all. Well, maybe a little.

1095
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,625
It's just that...

1096
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,256
- Shut up!
- All right, I will.

1097
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,921
Oh!

1098
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,549
- Oh!
- Oh!

1099
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,804
Don't... move.

1100
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,901
- Oh.
- Ohh!

1101
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,268
- What's going on?
- We're going back. We're going back!

1102
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,871
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

1103
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,991
No, no, no, no.

1104
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,999
I just wanted to say I'm sorry, Kate.

1105
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,378
What for?

1106
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,882
For not being a good husband.

1107
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,919
I'm sorry too, then.

1108
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,928
For what?

1109
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,722
For not letting you be one.

1110
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,507
What do you mean?

1111
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,347
- We were too young.
- Uh-huh.

1112
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,764
It takes two, you know, to totally
ruin a marriage, and I played my part.

1113
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,564
Oh, God!

1114
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,151
Anyway, what does it matter now?
We're...

1115
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,813
We're going to die!

1116
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:33,367
- Richard!
- It's OK. I've got you. Hold on.

1117
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,958
Kate, I think we should try again.

1118
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,962
- Try what again?
- Me and you.

1119
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,044
What are you talking about, Richard?

1120
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,584
I think we should finally sail round the
world, like we've always talked about.

1121
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,753
I've had such a great time
these past few days.

1122
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:52,303
Could you just concentrate?
Concentrate on holding on!

1123
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:55,264
- Well, don't you feel anything, Kate?
- Yes, fear!

1124
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,474
All right. OK.
Well, just think about it.

1125
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,687
I like you, I really like you.

1126
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,274
Come on, you fucker!

1127
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,156
Come on!

1128
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:24,963
- Are you OK?
- Manon!

1129
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:28,927
- Manon!
- Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you!

1130
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:32,840
Oh, no, it is I who should be thanking you
for making me see things clearly.

1131
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,257
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

1132
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,015
We must go. Help me.

1133
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,809
Here we go.

1134
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,249
- Nice girl, passionate.
- Oh, I do hope she'll be all right.

1135
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,580
Oh, a headstrong girl like her,
she'll be fine.

1136
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,712
We're gonna have to swim out of here.
You know that?

1137
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:08,257
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Yeah, well, do you have a better idea?

1138
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,758
I know a man with a boat.

1139
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:10,917
<i>- You do'?
- Yeah.</i>

1140
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,807
- Online?
- Yes, Richard, online.

1141
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:26,272
You chat, you get to know each other, and you
agree to meet up, if you like each other.

1142
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,561
- But you've never met him?
- No, not yet.

1143
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,407
So you don't even know if you'll like him.

1144
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,030
Well, he's 57. He lives in Paris

1145
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,401
and has house and a boat
in the south of France. What's not to like?

1146
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,491
Good heavens, Kate!
How shallow you've become.

1147
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,250
That must be the captain.

1148
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,750
Bonjour, Kate.
It's me, Jean-Baptiste.

1149
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,634
Bloody hell!

1150
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,850
You know, I'm twice your age.

1151
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,937
What can I say? I like older women.

1152
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,397
Why lie on your profile?

1153
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,441
I want women to see me <i>as</i> a mature man.
Otherwise, I feel like a total cliche, you know?

1154
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:20,080
Young, rich, handsome, with a speedboat...
So terribly predictable.

1155
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,163
He's your lover?

1156
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,044
Ex-lover.

1157
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,171
But you still have some feelings for him?

1158
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,053
I don't know.

1159
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,965
It's not good to look back.

1160
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,642
No, you're right.

1161
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,019
- It can make you feel a bit sick.
- Oh.

1162
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,685
Shall we head back?

1163
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:53,320
- Well, actually...
- We are going out.

1164
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:56,153
- Oh, really? Out?
- Yes, on a date.

1165
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,864
- Well, not a date. Not...
- Yes, a date.

1166
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:01,370
But what about the, er...

1167
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,996
...diamond?

1168
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,998
You can handle that, can't you?

1169
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,870
Are you telling me
you don't want to see this through now?

1170
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:13,257
No, I... Well, I think so.
I mean, can't you deal with it on your own?

1171
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,213
I'll meet you at the rendezvous in Paris.

1172
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,129
Right.

1173
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,677
<i>Right,</i> I <i>see. Well...</i>

1174
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,719
I suppose I did start all this for a reason
and the reason was for the...

1175
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,263
...for the people, for...
for Doreen, for...

1176
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,484
Right, I'll be off, then.

1177
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,362
- You take good care of her.
- I will.

1178
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:47,124
So, first of all,
we have some champagne at my villa.

1179
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,287
OK. It's a bit early, isn't it,
for champagne?

1180
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,464
It's never too early for champagne.
It's always too late.

1181
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,794
Ah!

1182
01:19:58,002 --> 01:20:00,596
Oh, thank goodness. You made it.

1183
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,846
Where's Kate?

1184
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,429
Ah, she's not here.

1185
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,968
Where is she?

1186
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,432
- She's with a Frenchman.
- Oh!

1187
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:11,849
- What Frenchman?
- Jean-Baptiste.

1188
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,609
You knew about him?

1189
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,945
Oh! Oh, right. Jean-Baptiste, yeah.

1190
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,276
Did everybody know about the Frenchman
apart from me?

1191
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,908
But why is she meeting him?
You're back together now.

1192
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,244
No, Pen, we're not back together.

1193
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,121
You seemed so happy
so we just went along with it.

1194
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,411
I suppose it was a bit
of a long shot anyway.

1195
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:31,748
Probably wouldn't have worked
second time around.

1196
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,833
Exactly.

1197
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,500
Anyway, the diamond.
Where is it?

1198
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,885
- Ah, yeah.
- There's been a slight delay.

1199
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:43,139
Yeah, but... Pen's got me
on the old prune juice.

1200
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,682
Should get the bomb doors open.

1201
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,808
Maybe? No, false alarm.

1202
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,632
- Where are you going?
- Ah, good morning.

1203
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,259
There is a robe on the chair.

1204
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:30,929
- I'm so sorry about last night.
- Oh, Jean-Baptiste, it was lovely.

1205
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,349
- Yeah, but I drunk too much and...
- It happens. You're young.

1206
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,852
You've got much more experience than me.
That thing that you did...

1207
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,191
Oh, thank you.

1208
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,231
So, what would you like to do today?

1209
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,404
We can have some breakfast outside or...

1210
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,407
We can take my boat somewhere.
You can practise your French.

1211
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,576
Ooh.

1212
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,584
- You like this song?
- I love this song.

1213
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,416
- Who is it?
- Free. You know...

1214
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,754
No, I don't know this band.

1215
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,754
No... of course you don't.

1216
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:13,103
It was the linseeds that ultimately did it,
such a smooth transition.

1217
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,639
- Well done, Jerry.
- Darling.

1218
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,979
Amazing. Look at it.
It's beautiful. Touch it.

1219
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,894
No, I think I'll pass, Jerry.

1220
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,154
Thank you.

1221
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,612
Where is this man, Diamond Dave?

1222
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,902
Patience, my dear, patience.

1223
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,037
- I'm sure she's coming, Richard.
- Mmm.

1224
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,039
I don't think so, Pen.

1225
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,751
Thanks, anyway.

1226
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,665
I don't understand.
What is the Eye of the Rainbow?

1227
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:43,459
It's a diamond that we stole.

1228
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:49,049
But first we had to kidnap the Texans, scuba
to the chateau and break into a wedding.

1229
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,763
- You stole a diamond?
- Yes.

1230
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,430
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Yes, you will.

1231
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,407
It's Diamond Dave.
He hasn't changed a bit.

1232
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,493
- Don't take less than ten.
- Right you are.

1233
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,507
- I just don't get it.
- What, my love?

1234
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,759
How you know all these people?

1235
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,345
- Who?
- Well, Diamond bloody Dave.

1236
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,182
- Oh, you know, way back.
- No, I don't know, Jerry.

1237
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,769
I don't know about Saigon
or Guam or the Foreign Legion.

1238
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,435
- Or even Diamond bloody Dave. I really don't.
- It's all right. Calm down.

1239
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,525
No, I won't calm down.
Who are these people, Jerry?

1240
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:50,158
These contacts? All that metal
in your body? This past life?

1241
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,661
I thought I knew you.
I thought we were the same.

1242
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,913
Oh, Pen.

1243
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,912
I'm more than the sum of my parts.

1244
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:05,966
- What does that mean?
- I've got no idea.

1245
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,550
But what I do know
is that I love you.

1246
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:15,388
Always have, always will. OK?

1247
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,271
- OK.
- Yeah!

1248
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:22,399
- Got 15.
- Bloody hell.

1249
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,158
You can literally go anywhere
from here, can't you?

1250
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,790
Well, we've got a briefcase full of cash.

1251
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,705
Penelope!

1252
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,916
There's one back to London
in 50 minutes.

1253
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:49,172
No, I don't think we should get that one.

1254
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,132
- Kate!
- Hey-hey!

1255
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,799
Listen, what do you think about...

1256
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:59,345
I don't know, maybe doing a bit of
travelling before we head home?

1257
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:01,762
Travelling?

1258
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,689
- Well...
- Stupid idea, right?

1259
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,320
Yes.

1260
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:14,410
A crazy... daft... stupid...

1261
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,864
but brilliant idea.

1262
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,532
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why the hell not?

1263
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,417
- What have we got to lose?
- Apart from our dignity?

1264
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,544
Either way, it's worth investigating.

1265
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,957
Definitely. Let's investigate.

1266
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,635
Would you see
that the relevant people get this?

1267
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:32,919
It would be an honour, my friend.

1268
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,094
I've, er... taken a bit out.
You can stash the rest under the mattress.

1269
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,556
Don't worry, old pal. We've got a
safe house built under the stairs.

1270
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,096
- We do?
- Yeah.

1271
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,979
Bon <i>voyage,</i> my old friends.

1272
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,773
- I'll feed the cat.
- Oh, thank you.

1273
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,296
- Look after yourselves.
- We will.

1274
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:51,484
Thank you.

1275
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,116
- Come along, Jerry.
- Be very, very naughty.

1276
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,777
- It's is very heavy, Jerry.
- Hey-hey!

1277
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,864
- Come on, my love.
- I say...

1278
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:02,992
Oh... yes.

1279
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,919
<i>Merci.</i>

1280
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,462
Come on.

1281
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:11,921
Come on!

1282
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,935
Oh, yew!

1283
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,520
<i>Right. Yaw!</i>

1284
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,026
Hey-hey-hey!

1285
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:58,718
So, what next? Hmm?

1286
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,848
A wander around the Marais?

1287
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,385
Hmm, that would be nice.

1288
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:09,392
But... I was thinking of something
a little more adventurous.

1289
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:13,279
Adventurous? Marvellous.
When are we leaving?

1290
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,607
What about right now?

1291
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,318
OK?

1292
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,905
<i>You</i> see, <i>I...</i>

1293
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:26,701
I know a man.
I know a man with a boat.

1294
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,414
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yes.

1295
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,625
Yes? What?

1296
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:34,215
Where? No! This?

1297
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,172
Oh, my God!
She's beautiful.

1298
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,302
- Kate, you did it. You did it!
- I did it!

1299
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,339
- You bought us a boat!
- I did it!

1300
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,348
Don't fall in.
Don't fall in the Seine.

1301
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,226
Oh, my God, she's gorgeous!

1302
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:47,808
She is gorgeous.
You are gorgeous!

1303
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:49,765
I love you!
