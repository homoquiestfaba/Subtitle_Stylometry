TOO MUCH.

163
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,781
THEN HE TOOK IT OUT ON ME
AND THE KIDS. COULD YOU
HOLD MAX FOR A SECOND ?

164
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:37,117
SURE. HE'S NOT, UH,
STILL BOTHERING YOU,
IS HE ?

165

NO. NO. THANK GOD.

166

NOT--
NOT SINCE THE FIRE.

167
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,724
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE BURNED YOUR HOUSE DOWN
AND GOT AWAY WITH IT.

168
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,060
IT'S LEGAL TO BURN
YOUR OWN HOUSE DOWN,
IF YOU WANT TO.

169
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,629
NOT MANY PEOPLE
ARE AWARE OF THAT.
OH.

170
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,664
THAT'S HANDY TO KNOW.

171
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,133

SO IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS
TRYING TO HURT ANYONE.

AT THE TRAIN STATION
IN THE MORNING ?

175

PUBLISHERS' MEETINGS
IN THE CITY.

176
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,311

GOING DOWN THERE
TO LAY ON THE TRACKS ANYWAY.

MAYBE IT'S
A GOOD THING.

179
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,352
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
ANOTHER ONE OF MY ATTEMPTS
AT SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS...

180
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,055
WAS DASHED AGAINST
THE JAGGED COASTLINE
OF HARSH REALITY ?

181
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,758
NO, MAYBE IT'S A SIGN
OR SOMETHING THAT IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE, YOU KNOW ?

182
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,093
I MEAN, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE 35 YEARS OLD, DANNY.

183
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,263
I'M GETTING VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE DIRECTION THIS
CONVERSATION IS TAKING.

184
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,766
AND SOMETIMES THE UNIVERSE
GIVES US SIGNALS,

185
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,135
AND WE HAVE TO BE
OPEN TO NEW THINGS.

186
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,637
OH, NO. THIS IS TROUBLE.

187
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,672
DANNY, WE NEED TO TALK--

188
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,273
AND THERE THEY ARE--
THE FOUR MOST DREADED WORDS
IN THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY.

189
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,709
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

190
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,310
I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD.

191
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,346
[ DJ ] AND NOW,
OUR NEXT HAPPY COUPLE !

192
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,350
BELIEVE ME. IT CAME
AS MUCH A SURPRISE TO ME
AS IT'S COMING TO YOU, BUT I--

193
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,386
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT, AND--
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN.

194
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,155
I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE
WOMEN. YOU KNOW THAT.

195
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,124
BUT I JUST FELT LIKE WHAT
HAPPENED THIS MORNING WAS...

196
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,327
THIS ANCIENT, UH,
INSTINCTUAL MOTHER
IN ME...

197
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,797
JUST BROKE THROUGH
MY MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS.

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,932
AND I WANTED TO--
I WANTED TO MOTHER.

199
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:02,002
I WANTED TO SUCKLE THE WORLD,
AND I WANT TO NURTURE.

200
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,805
I WANT TO BE A MOM.

201
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,408
OKAY, UH, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK ? LET ME
TELL YOU WHAT I THINK.

202
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,911
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
JUST NERVOUS ABOUT
YOUR BOOK, THAT'S ALL.

203
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,113
YOU'RE PUTTING YEARS
OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS
OUT THERE...

204
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,049
AND EXPOSING YOURSELF
TO REJECTION FROM ANY NUMBER
OF IDIOTIC PUBLISHERS.

205
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,151
I WANT TO HAVE
A CHILD. YEAH.
A CHILD ?

206
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,287
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT ?
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AWARE OF THE FACT...

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,089
THAT CHILDREN
ARE EXTREMELY
DANGEROUS PEOPLE.

208
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,924
IT'S NORMAL
TO BE AFRAID.

209
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,326
I'M NOT AFRAID, GRACE.
OH.

210
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,396
MAYBE I SHOULD GO
TO ONE OF THOSE SPERM
BANKS OR SOMETHING.

211
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,999
SPERM BANK ? YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

212
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,101
HAVE THE FATHER OF YOUR CHILD
BE SOMEBODY WHO'S REDUCED
TO JERKING OFF FOR A LIVING.

213
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,969
OH, DANNY.

214
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,070
NO, NO. THAT'S GREAT.
"AND WHAT DOES
THE FATHER DO ?"

215
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,239
"HE'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL,
PROFESSIONAL MASTURBATOR."

216
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,177
PLEASE, HONEY,
FORGET THAT MANIAC.

TALKIN' DIRECTLY TO ME,
