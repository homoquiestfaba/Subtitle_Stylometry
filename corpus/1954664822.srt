LIKE OLD-FASHIONED.

350
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:51,974
-EDWARD?
-YES?

351
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,242
NOT HELPING.

352
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,544
RIGHT.

353
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,813
[MAYA]: MAYBE SAM
GOT THE DATE WRONG.

354
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,552
MAYBE HE THOUGHT
THE PARTY WAS TOMORROW.

355
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,507
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET IT
GO

356
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,876
AND WE SHOULD GET OUT OF
HERE
AND GO TO DINNER.

357
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,915
PLUS, EVEN IF
I WERE INTERESTED IN HIM--

358
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,490
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
I AM NOT--

359
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,488
HE WOULD NEVER GO
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.

360
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,990
-WHY?
-FIRST OF ALL--

361
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,292
...HE'S A LAWYER,

362
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,093
WHICH MEANS
THAT HE IS ALL LEFT-BRAIN--

363
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,955
ANALYTICAL, LOGICAL...

364
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,904
WHILE I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
AM ALL RIGHT-BRAIN.

365
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,470
OH! THAT'S WHY YOU WEAR
OPEN-TOED SANDALS IN THE
RAIN,

366
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,100
BECAUSE YOU'RE ILLOGICAL!

367
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,365
NO.

368
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,273
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT'S THE ONLY SHOE

369
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,175
THAT WORKS FOR THE OUTFIT.

370
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,437
AND SECOND OF ALL,
I'M NOT HIS TYPE.

371
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,275
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

372
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,081
I-I DON'T KNOW,
I CAN JUST TELL.

373
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,122
HE PROBABLY DATES WOMEN
WHO ARE THOROUGHBREDS,

374
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,118
WHERE I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
AM A MIXED-BREED RESCUE.

375
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,387
LOOKS LIKE I'M A LITTLE
LATE.

376
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,056
[MAYA]: NOT AT ALL.
HOW ABOUT A DRINK?

377
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,162
NO, THANKS,
BUT HOW WAS THE PARTY?

378
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,425
GREAT!

379
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,303
BUT ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST GETTING READY

380
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,002
TO TAKE MAYA OUT TO DINNER
TO CELEBRATE.

381
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,174
[MAYA]: UH...
IF SAM DOESN'T HAVE ANY
PLANS,

382
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,013
THEN MAYBE HE CAN JOIN YOU
FOR DINNER.

383
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,777
WELL, YOU KNOW,

384
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,410
AS SOMEONE
WHO'S LIVED HERE FOREVER,

385
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:12,875
IT IS MY CIVIC DUTY
TO WELCOME A NEWCOMER TO
TOWN.

386
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,419
OKAY.

387
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,062
IN AN ATTEMPT TO BECOME
INVOLVED
IN MY COMMUNITY,

388
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:22,128
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD
ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT.

389
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,728
GREAT! BYE, GUYS.

390
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,201
GOODNIGHT.

391
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,799
[MAYA WALKS OUT]

392
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,071
I KNOW A GREAT RIB PLACE
THAT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM
HERE.

393
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,270
I'M A VEGETARIAN.

394
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,771
HOW ABOUT ITALIAN?

395
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,142
GINO'S HAS
THE BEST FETTUCCINE ALFREDO

396
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,111
THIS SIDE OF ROME.

397
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,579
I'M OFF GLUTEN AT THE
MOMENT.

398
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,637
HOW ABOUT YOU CHOOSE?

399
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,176
WELL, WE COULD STAY HERE.

400
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,651
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD
DALAI LAMA MOMOS.

401
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,721
WHAT ARE THESE
CALLED AGAIN?

402
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,619
DALAI LAMA MOMOS.

403
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,090
THEY'RE TIBETAN.

404
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,988
WITH A NAME LIKE THAT,
THEY-- THEY'D HAVE TO BE.

405
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,190
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN?

406
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,521
NO. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GO.

407
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,656
OH. TRY
ONE OF THESE.

408
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,097
MM! IT'S GOOD!

409
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,571
ALSO TIBETAN?

410
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,899
NOPE. IT'S A SAMBUSA.

411
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,504
IT'S A TRADITIONAL
ETHIOPIAN APPETIZER.

412
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,906
WOW. THIS IS QUITE
THE INTERNATIONAL MEAL.

413
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,579
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

414
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,938
IT'S DELICIOUS.

415
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:13,976
<i> MINIM AYDEL.</i>

416
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,750
THAT'S "YOU'RE WELCOME"
IN ETHIOPIAN.

417
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,049
I CAN'T SAY I'VE EVER MET
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ETHIOPIAN.

418
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,451
OH, I DON'T.

419
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,052
I JUST LEARNED IT ON
ONE OF THOSE COMPUTER
SCREENS

420
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,154
IN AN ELEVATOR.

421
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:23,916
BUT YOU'D LIKE TO GO ONE
DAY?

422
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,624
<i> OUI.</i>

423
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,525
THAT'S "YES" IN FRENCH.

424
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,827
WOW.

425
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,858
WHO KNEW VEGETARIAN FOOD
COULD BE THAT GOOD?

426
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,404
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

427
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,999
NEXT TIME WE'LL ACTUALLY
GO TO THE TIBETAN PLACE.

428
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,841
NOT THAT THERE IS
GONNA BE A NEXT TIME.

429
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,867
I'D LOVE TO TRY
THE TIBETAN PLACE.

430
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,714
OH. THAT'S
A GORGEOUS CAR.

431
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,610
[SAM, SURPRISED]:
YOU LIKE IT?

432
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,682
IT'S ACTUALLY MINE.

433
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:48,811
YEAH, RIGHT.

434
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,945
NO, IT IS.

435
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,821
REALLY? HUH!

436
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,919
WHAT'S "HUH"?

437
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,391
I DON'T KNOW...

438
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,489
YOU JUST DIDN'T
STRIKE ME

439
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,790
AS A "VINTAGE"
KIND OF GUY.

440
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,432
HA, WELL,
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,

441
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,787
BUT IT'S NOT VINTAGE,
IT'S CLASSIC.

442
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,455
WHICH IS ANOTHER WORD
FOR VINTAGE.

443
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,733
NOT EXACTLY.

444
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,761
WHEN I THINK "VINTAGE,"
I THINK OLD AND DUSTY,

445
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,396
PAST ITS PRIME--

446
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,901
YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.

447
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:10,973
I HAPPEN
TO LOVE VINTAGE.

448
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,901
IT'S KIND OF
MY WHOLE THING.

449
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,866
OH. CAN WE
CHANGE THE TOPIC

450
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:15,914
SO I DON'T PUT MY FOOT

451
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,409
EVEN FARTHER
INTO MY MOUTH?

452
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,440
YES. YES.

453
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,575
HEY, DID YOU KNOW

454
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,679
THAT YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO TOUCH

455
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,310
THE TOP OF
A TIBETAN PERSON'S HEAD?

456
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,975
THAT IT'S CONSIDERED
A SACRED PART OF THEIR BODY?

457
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,345
IS THAT EVEN MORE
ELEVATOR TRIVIA?

458
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,523
NO. I SAW IT
IN A DOCUMENTARY.

459
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,591
I WATCH A LOT OF THEM.

460
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,689
NOT THAT I, LIKE,

461
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,420
STAY HOME EVERY NIGHT
WATCHING THEM.

462
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,655
I TOTALLY HAVE
A SOCIAL LIFE.

463
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,730
I JUST...
I REALLY ENJOY THEM.

464
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,359
SO. I'M SORRY.

465
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,804
WERE YOU
SAYING SOMETHING?

466
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,668
UH, RIGHT, YEAH, WHAT
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY--

467
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,967
DO YOU SEE THAT?

468
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,268
THAT IS THE ROOT
OF CRASH-DIETING

469
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,270
AND UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS
ABOUT ROMANCE.

470
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,542
OH, I DON'T THINK
I'D GO THAT FAR.

471
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,270
THE OWNER CAME
BY THE STORE TODAY,

472
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,475
FOR THE PARTY.

473
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,537
TALK ABOUT FROSTY.

474
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,176
WHEN I SUGGESTED
THAT WE GET TOGETHER,

475
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,251
SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE'D RATHER GET A ROOT
CANAL.

476
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,980
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

477
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,685
WHO TAKES A WHILE
TO WARM UP.

478
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,447
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
AN ICEBERG TO MELT?

479
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,586
I'M SORRY.
I GET CARRIED AWAY.

480
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,492
I REALLY AM-- AND I
COMPLETELY
INTERRUPTED YOU.

481
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,894
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

482
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,425
YOU KNOW WHAT?

483
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,660
I ALREADY FORGOT.

484
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,929
[♪♪♪]

485
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,338
MORNING, MOM.

486
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,171
DARLING. I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN AGES.

487
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:29,606
WELL, I WAS HERE
FOR TEA ON TUESDAY.

488
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,146
BEFORE WE EAT,

489
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,421
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

490
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,519
AND I CAN'T
WAIT TO HEAR IT.

491
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,050
BUT BEFORE YOU BEGIN,

492
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,456
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING

493
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,657
ABOUT THIS NEW BRIDAL SALON
THAT'S OPENED?

494
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,789
WELL, IF YOU CAN
CALL IT THAT.

495
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,725
"SO YOU SAID SOMETHING."

496
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,160
ACTUALLY, THAT'S--

497
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,096
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT
THE OWNER IS TRYING TO DO.

498
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,631
IT'S ALL VINTAGE!

499
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,266
[LAUGHS]

500
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,141
I MEAN, WHAT BRIDE IS GOING
TO
WANT TO WEAR SHOES

501
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,210
THAT HAVE BEEN ON
SOMEBODY ELSE'S FEET?

502
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,179
WELL, IF THEY'VE ONLY
BEEN WORN ONCE,

503
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,308
I DON'T SEE--

504
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,552
I SWEAR, SHE TREATS
THE WHOLE PROCESS

505
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,707
OF GETTING MARRIED

506
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,454
LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BE FUN OR SOMETHING.

507
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,821
IMAGINE THAT.

508
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,119
SHE MUST BE
FROM THE CITY.

509
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,550
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT HER.

510
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,485
SO, WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?

511
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,991
[STAMMERS]

512
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,262
ACTUALLY, I THINK IT CAN
WAIT.

513
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,063
YOUR DATE?
[STAMMERS]

514
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,365
OH, IT ISN'T A DATE.
IT'S AN OUTING.

515
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,497
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS

516
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,172
A "DATE"
HERE ON PLANET EARTH.

517
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,210
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING
ON YOUR "OUTING"?

518
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,467
HE SAID ME TO CHOOSE
SOMETHING I LIKED,

519
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,935
SO I'M TAKING HIM
ON MY THRIFT STORE RUN.

520
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,913
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

521
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,151
THAT'S LIKE THE LEAST
DATE-LIKE THING EVER.

522
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,977

00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,453
YOU'VE CHUCKED WHATEVER
SECURITY YOU HAD

1227
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:05,755
AND YOU WENT FOR IT.

1228
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:08,387

ALWAYS WORKED OUT FOR YOU.

01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:36,319
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR MOM AND ME.

1733
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,523
SHE AND I GOT ENGAGED,

1734
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,623
AND IT WAS TIME
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER,

1735
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:46,625
AND WE HAD THIS
BLUE-AND-ORANGE
PLAID ULTRASUEDE COUCH

1736
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,030
IN OUR FRATERNITY HOUSE.

1737
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:49,661
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

1738
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,196
YOUR MOTHER'S REACTION TO IT
AS WELL.

1739
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:54,172
IN FACT,
SHE HATED THE COUCH SO MUCH,

1740
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:55,241
THAT WHEN SHE REALIZED

1741
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,968
THAT I WAS PLANNING
ON MOVING IT IN

1742
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,513
TO THE NEW APARTMENT,

1743
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:02,908
WELL, WE, UH,
WE GOT INTO A BIG FIGHT.

1744
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:05,013
YOU NEVER WERE
MUCH OF A DECORATOR, DAD.

1745
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,145
WELL, THAT
MAY BE TRUE,

1746
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:09,819
BUT THIS COUCH
WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

1747
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:14,720
HOWEVER, YOUR MOTHER
COULDN'T
GET PAST HOW UGLY IT WAS.

1748
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:18,194
AT SOME POINT, THE FIGHT
STOPPED BEING ABOUT THE
COUCH

1749
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:20,255
AND BECAME
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

1750
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,003
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY SHE, UH...

1751
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:24,768
SHE LEFT THE CAP
OFF OF THE TOOTHPASTE,

1752
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,168
OR I PUT THE DISHES
IN THE DISHWASHER

1753
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,570
WITHOUT RINSING THEM FIRST.

1754
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:30,042
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO RINSE THEM,

1755
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,810
OTHERWISE THAT DRIED FOOD
NEVER COMES OFF.

1756
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,908
YEAH, I KNOW,
SHE SAID THAT.

1757
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,280
SO BEFORE LONG...

1758
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,809
WE DECIDED TO CALL THINGS
OFF.

1759
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:41,145
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS STORY.

1760
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,621
NO, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

1761
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,019
YOU WANT TO SHARE
AT AN ANNIVERSARY TOAST.

1762
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,550
ANYWAY, I HEADED
FOR THE DOOR,

1763
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,656
AND I TURNED TO HER
AND I ASKED HER,

1764
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:49,688
DID SHE REALLY KNOW

1765
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,363
WHY THE COUCH
WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ME?

1766
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,825
IT WAS BECAUSE

1767
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:58,131
THE VERY FIRST TIME
I LAID EYES ON HER,

1768
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:02,835
AND KNEW I WAS LOOKING AT
THE WOMAN I WAS GOING TO
MARRY,

1769
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,739
SHE WAS SITTING ON IT.

1770
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,141
OH, THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

1771
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,584
WELL, WE--
WE GOT RE-ENGAGED,

1772
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,309
SHE LET ME KEEP THE COUCH,

1773
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:16,384
AND WE RECOVERED IT WITH
A NICE NEUTRAL TAUPE
SLIPCOVER.

1774
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,046
[GASPS] OH!
I REMEMBER THAT COUCH.

1775
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,364
YEAH?
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:23,727

1785
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:51,589

ALL THIS WEDDING STUFF,

DOESN'T COME ALONG OFTEN,

01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:05,902
SO BEFORE YOU LET IT GO...

01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,842
WHY NOT GIVE HIM-- AND HER--
ANOTHER CHANCE?

1792

1800

WITH BUSINESS,

DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT

GIVING YOU MY TWO CENTS
ABOUT SAM AND ANNABELLE,

1805

ON A LIMB HERE

1806
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:53,821
AND SAY THAT, CLAIRE,
YOU ARE WRONG.

1807
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,847
DID I JUST SAY THAT OUT
LOUD?

1808
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,653
YOU DID.

1809
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:01,285
OKAY. ANYWAY.

1810
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:03,931

1812

THAT ANNABELLE HAS.

1813
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:10,671
AND EVEN IF
SHE WASN'T SO FANTASTIC,

1814
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:11,827
SHE STILL LOVES YOUR SON,

1815
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:14,965
JUST LIKE
YOU LOVED YOUR HUSBAND.

1816
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,411

DOWN THE AISLE WITH
WILDFLOWERS

1817
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:20,068
INSTEAD OF ROSES.
