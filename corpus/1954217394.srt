1
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,767
The Oracle's words stand as a warning

2
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,534
a prophecy

3
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,358
Sparta will fall

4
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,993
all of Greece will fall

5
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,172
and Persian fire will reduce Athens to cinder

6
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,820
for Athens is a pile of stone

7
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:20,942
and wood and cloth and dust

8
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:25,319
and as dust will vanish into the wind

9
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,442
only the Athenians themselves exist

10
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:31,631
and the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable

11
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:41,561
only the Athenians exist

12
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,605
and only stout wooden ships can save them

13
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,014
wooden ships

14
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:52,305
and a tidal wave of heroes' blood

15
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,001
Leonidas, my husband

16
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,462
Leonidas, your king

17
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:10,134
Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead

18
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:14,207
The free men and women of Greece are

19
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:16,413
not bound by a beautiful Spartan death

20
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,641
war is not their love

21
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:21,436
yet he laid down his life for them

22
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,646
for the promise Greece holds

23
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,943
It is our enemies who forged our freedom
in the fires of war

24
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:34,158
It was king Darius who came to take our land

25
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,537
10 years ago when you still burned in our eyes

26
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,792
before this bitter war forced our children to become men

27
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,627
10 years ago this war began

28
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:53,050
as all wars begin, with a grievance

29
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,003
Marathon

30
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:04,228
the Persian king Darius annoyed by the notion of Greek freedom

31
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,257
has come to Greece to bring us to heel

32
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:12,484
he makes land full at the field of Marathon with an

33
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,117
invading force which outnumbers Greek defenders 3 to 1

34
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:20,202
so it dawned the hopeless Athenians do the unthinkable

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,163
they attacked

36
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:28,380
they attacked the weary Persians as they disembarked their ships on shakey legs after a month at sea

37
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:33,594
they attacked before they can establish their war camp and supply their soldiers

38
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,470
and who is the architect of this mad strategy?

39
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,435
a little known Athenian soldier

40
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:46,436
his men called him Themistocles

41
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:51,985
he gives the Persians a taste of Athenian shock combat

42
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:15,670
All thoughts of glory are gone

43
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,504
1000s dead, 100s of them their own

44
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:25,428
all for an idea, a free Greece

45
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,058
an Athenian experiment called democracy

46
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,937
could this idea be worth it?

47
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,814
worth all this sacrifice?

48
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,612
Themistocles would let the good king Darius decide

49
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,703
for through the chaos a moment appeared

50
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:55,374
and Themistocles would seize it

51
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:08,178
a moment that would ring across the centuries

52
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:15,479
a moment that would raise him from simple soldier
to the height of Athenian political power

53
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:22,864
a moment that would make Themistocles a legend

54
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:45,137
yet even as the prays and glory were heaped upon him

55
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,721
Themistocles knew in his heart he'd made a mistake

56
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,392
it was Darius' son Xerxes, his eyes had the sting of destiny about them

57
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,147
Themistocles knew he should have killed that boy

58
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,697
that glorious mistake would forever haunt him

59
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,584
so it was Themistocles himself who sent a ripple across Persian empire

60
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,647
and set into motion forces that would bring fire to the heart of Greece

61
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:29,554
for as the good king laid eye, all his greatest generals and advisors were summoned to his bedside

62
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,266
none greater than his finest naval commander, Artemisia

63
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,227
her ferocity only bested by her beauty

64
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,944
her beauty only matched by her devotion to her king

65
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:53,205
Darius favored Artemisia among his generals for she had brought him victory in the battlefield

66
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,375
in her he had the perfect warrior protege that his son Xerxes would never be

67
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,623
so sweet, my child

68
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:13,699
my sweet child

69
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,109
father

70
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,569
Xerxes, do not repeat your father's mistake

71
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:34,826
leave the noble Greeks to the ways

72
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:41,003
only the Gods can defeat them

73
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,477
for 7 days Xerxes mourned, paralyzed by grief

74
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:05,190
on the 8th day, Artemisia whispered the seed of madness that would consume him

75
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,570
your father's words were not a warning

76
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,403
but a challenge

77
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,036
only the Gods can defeat the Greeks?

78
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:23,918
you will be the God King

79
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:31,840
Artemisia gathered the priests, wizards and mystiques from every corner of the empire

80
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:37,599
they wrapped the young king in Sumerian .. dipped in ancient potions

81
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,526
and set him to wander the dessert

82
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:46,525
to in a delirium of heat and thirst, he stumbled upon a hermit's cave

83
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,017
Xerxes passed the vacant eyes and empty souls of the hollow creatures

84
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:59,579
that dwell in the dark corners of all men's

85
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:06,252
and in that darkness he surrendered himself completely

86
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,795
to power so evil and perverse

87
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:19,554
but as he emerged no part of a human man that was Xerxes survived

88
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,445
his eyes blazed like scarlet coals

89
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:38,411
he was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth

90
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,203
Xerxes was reborn a God

91
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,837
Artemisia trusted noone

92
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:56,763
so in the cover of night, the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies

93
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:02,308
all those he trusted

94
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,065
all those who'd raised him

95
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,946
all those he'd once looked to for counsel

96
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,367
were quickly introduced to her wrath

97
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:50,272
and as the God King stood before his people

98
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:54,902
Artemisia watched her flawless manipulation take shape

99
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,443
for glory's sake

100
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,324
for vengeance's sake

101
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,828
War!

102
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,213
War is coming to Greece

103
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:14,506
in the visage of monster army over a milion strong

104
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,717
It should be a little more than a formality for Themistocles

105
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,183
the hero of Marathon to finish what he began

106
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,769
Please, we must appeal to Xerxes' reason

107
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,271
coward! Athens is a city of cowards

108
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,108
-shut your cockhole  -shut your own

109
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,525
-I kill you  -fuck the Spartans

110
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,487
Silence!

111
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,281
This is a democracy, not a street fight

112
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,329
a Persian attack will come from both the north and the south

113
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,418
the city states should negotiate a truce

114
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:54,668
yes yes we must negotiate

115
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,213
negotiate with tyranny?

116
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:02,551
give me one example of when that has ever profited a nation

117
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,556
my fellow countrymen

118
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:10,353
we can only judge the future from what we've suffered in the past

119
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:14,774
now many of you here stood with me at Marathon

120
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,612
and for those of you who served and faced the cut and thrust of battle

121
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:22,696
you know how true peace is forged

122
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,827
do not be deceived

123
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,433
Xerxes, the son of Darius, is a wolf at our door

124
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,001
right here right now we must choose

125
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,092
do we stand and fight for Greece or not?

126
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:44,927
Argos, Corinth, Megara, Athens

127
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,473
not even Sparta can match the Persians alone

128
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,890
we must persevere as one nation

129
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,603
or we will perish clean onto our self interests

130
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,774
send us the ships that we need to defend Greece

131
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,278
Themistocles will need more than our city's ships

132
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,658
he will need our children to join the fight

133
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:08,954
and what of Sparta?

134
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:12,873
you send every ship that we have to the northern coast of Ubea

135
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:19,002
I will go and seek the help of the great Spartans

136
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,738
Still no word from the messenger you sent to Sparta

137
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,365
King Leonidas may have been insulted by your generous offer

138
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:52,035
perhaps I need to march into the Sparta myself and burn it to the ground

139
00:15:54,705 --> 00:16:01,211
remember, when a king is loved as I am, much can be accomplished

140
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,346
it would be false to resist my divine power

141
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,052
Athens is attempting to assemble a coalition

142
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,642
it will be nothing more than a patchwork of ships

143
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,687
was these waters have been diverse so I only lead my forces across the land?

144
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:23,903
I will remind the cowards of Greece that we have not forgotten that insolence

145
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,662
rest and water the horses

146
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:37,956
it's best that I go alone

147
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:41,461
Spartans don't get along well with others

148
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,265
Themistocles, you old snake

149
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:39,350
what brings you this far side

150
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,440
I've come to see Leonidas to warn him of the Persians on the march

151
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,358
well you're too late

152
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,451
the Persian messenger already presented his terms to Leonidas

153
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,156
symbolic offering of earth and water

154
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,541
Spartans! know this, and know it well

155
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,585
that any Spartan's finest moment

156
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,883
the greatest fulfillment of all he holds dear

157
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:11,720
is that moment

158
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:16,767
when he has poured his heart out for the preservation of Sparta

159
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,146
and lies dead on the battlefield victorious

160
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:28,822
now, who is willing to die at our king's side?

161
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,075
Themistocles,

162
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:40,289
you've come a long way to stroke your cock watching real men train

163
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:45,376
Queen Gorgo, shouldn't you be training them to live at their king's side?

164
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:49,173
a new age is dawning, Gorgo

165
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,062
won't be long before men rise up and shed the yolk of mysticism in tyranny

166
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,386
that sounds like a threat

167
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:01,142
no, an opportunity to join the rest of free Greece in stand against the true tyrant

168
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:05,441
unless of course you and Leonidas have already made a deal with Xerxes

169
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:07,568
no terms were reached

170
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,780
Xerxes' messenger was rude, and lacked respect

171
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:17,660
he didn't understand the same threats made in Thebes and Athens would not work here

172
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,288
this is the birthplace of world's greatest warriors

173
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:26,903
men whose king would stand and fight and die for any one of them

174
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,299
Xerxes' messenger did not understand this is no typical Greek city state

175
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,303
this is Sparta

176
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,100
so it was clear to the messenger there would be no Spartan submission

177
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,812
it was clear

178
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,478
even now Leonidas is in counsel with the oracle over his battle plan

179
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,815
the festival of the Carnea is all that stands in our way

180
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,417
surely the oracle will see we must fight

181
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,110
well then the timing is perfect

182
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm commanding a fleet of ships that will represent a united Greece

183
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:00,659
I need Sparta to join me

184
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,536
give me your ships, Gorgo

185
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,874
I'll make sure Xerxes wishes he never crossed the Aegean

186
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,752
you will receive no Spartan ships, we're not interested in united Greece

187
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,211
that is your dream, Themistocles, not ours

188
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,761
all I'm concerned with is the preservation of Sparta

189
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,927
my guards will see you out

190
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:26,188
it's funny that you mock freedom here in your selfish isolation

191
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:31,941
which freedom in her wisdom has chosen you to defend her?

192
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:36,656
my queen

193
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,228
did Sparta join our fight?

194
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:46,009
apparently the Persians have offered the Spartans something they cannot refuse

195
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,538
what is that?

196
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:50,208
a beautiful death

197
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:11,479
they say you're the bravest of our captives

198
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,445
they say you're a whore from the eastern seas

199
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,701
you're not the smartest

200
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,166
your commander is a Greek, just like me

201
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:32,963
you Persian men take your orders from a Greek woman

202
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,087
yes my brother I am Greek by birth

203
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:40,239
and I have Greek blood running through my veins

204
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:48,559
but my heart is Persian

205
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,955
within hours, Greek fleet will be shattered

206
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,390
what of our master and the much feared Spartans?

207
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:34,814
it's nothing to fear. only king Leonidas and his personal guard of 300

208
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:38,613
they'll collapse instantly

209
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,197
you?

210
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:51,166
do you agree?

211
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,419
many will perish

212
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:59,880
your confidence leaves me with a strong impression

213
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:05,927
it's a curious thing for a simple ship guard to look lower his eyes when questioned by me

214
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,641
it could have been just a lack of discipline

215
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:13,392
a man's hands do not lie

216
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:18,861
they can reveal every imperfection and flaw in his character

217
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:24,366
you see, your hands are not rough enough to work the rigging of this ship

218
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:28,572
I know every single man beneath my lash

219
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,623
can you explain to me how I don't know you?

220
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:36,707
forgive me commander

221
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:42,094
let me introduce myself

222
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,207
seize the spy

223
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:05,487
coward

224
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,367
the storm is upon us

225
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,537
it's just some mad Greek weather

226
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:27,721
Themistocles?

227
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:29,469
come

228
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,471
Calisto

229
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,230
what's spoken here must not be repeated

230
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,439
anywhere

231
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:44,150
my son has not earned the right to sit at the table of combat veterans

232
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:46,572
but you can trust him

233
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:49,697
very well. tell me.

234
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,079
a Greek woman commands all of Xerxes' ships to the south

235
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,707
Artemisia

236
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:58,080
I know of her

237
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:03,757
Artemisia is murderous by trade with true skill on the sea and she has thirst for vengeance

238
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,590
her entire family was murdered by a squad of Greek hoplites

239
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,722
I have heard all the stories

240
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,681
and the hoplites spared noone on that day

241
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,799
the story goes they raped and murdered her entire family

242
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,262
then they turned their attention towards her

243
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:17,872
after years of being kept in the bowels of Greek slave ship

244
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,900
she was discarded and left for dead

245
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:25,549
where she was found near death by a Persian emissary

246
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,995
Artemisia vowed that day to return to Greece

247
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,346
only when she could watch it burn

248
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:07,714
she was fed, clothed and trained by the finest warriors of the Persian empire

249
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,261
until no match could be found for her skills and gift with the sword

250
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:45,081
the great king Darius was impressed by her commitment

251
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,378
and she quickly rose to command at his side

252
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,968
she has sold her soul to death himself

253
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,724
well some could say I've sold mine to Greece

254
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,813
what do you think?

255
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,019
-me?  -yes

256
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,189
you are the future of this country

257
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:11,278
I'm ready to fight

258
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,449
I like him, reminds me of you

259
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,451
we will need every last man

260
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:20,785
he's still just a boy

261
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,993
much younger have defended our country, father

262
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:24,625
enough

263
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:27,627
you are a dreamer and we'll speak of this no more

264
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:36,595
Themistocles, I set your plan in motion and my land force will be assembled by in the second day

265
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,177
you will be needed, I can assure you of that

266
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:44,937
there's bad news

267
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,978
Leonidas has marched north to the hot gates

268
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:54,525
bad news? Spartans at the hot gates, our victory is assured

269
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,904
if the army were with him

270
00:28:56,906 --> 00:29:01,825
now between the oracle and the Carnea, Leonidas has marched to Thermopylae with just 300 men

271
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:12,504
so the only thing standing between Athens and total annihilation is Leonidas and 300 Spartans

272
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,338
I'll go search the veterans among them, establish an order among the volunteers

273
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,435
good. little time to teach these farmers strategy.

274
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:30,524
just keep them well fed, and sober.

275
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:32,980
anything else?

276
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,819
wouldn't hurt if they could swing a sword

277
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:40,115
I'll be damned

278
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,245
your father know you're here?

279
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,203
no sir

280
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:47,956
and this shield and sword?

281
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:49,707
my grandfather's.

282
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,168
my mother entrusted them to me this morning

283
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:54,840
and she gave you her blessing?

284
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:56,795
yes sir

285
00:29:57,468 --> 00:29:58,797
but a sharp blade, no less

286
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,220
your father is preparing the surprise raid tomorrow

287
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,727
I choose to fight here, now

288
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,566
come aboard my ship. that is where you will fight.

289
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,736
we're just over 50 ships

290
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,284
Persian forces reported in number of thousands

291
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:25,201
those ships appear hardly seaworthy

292
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,992
they're nothing like the monstrous ships of the Persian fleet

293
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,787
then we have the advantage

294
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,166
speed and manuverability

295
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,961
rest of the city states to send anyone from a handful to a single ship

296
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:35,713
of course Athens supply the balance

297
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,675
we have report that a small advance force of Persian ships are taking refuge from storm just across the strait

298
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,345
so weather breaks we could hit them at dawn

299
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:48,597
an early Greek victory

300
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:52,314
Gods have given us an opportunity to wound the Persians and strengthen Greek morale

301
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:55,904
a tempting distraction

302
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,403
we'll stick to the battle plan

303
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:01,489
today at sun down we will sail out to meet the main Persian fleet

304
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:04,675
we'll attack them in the open water with no short an arrow in the battle

305
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,288
to attack a force of over 1000 ships with our meager force is suicide

306
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,620
such is my plan

307
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,128
look at their excuse for a navy

308
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,839
their ships are little threat

309
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,803
I need a second in command, Arthapernes

310
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,868
and whoever proves their excellence will earn a place beside me

311
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,146
general Bandari has offered to lead the first attack

312
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:38,982
commander

313
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:41,654
I'll let you lead our first offensive

314
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:44,407
what guarantee do I have that you'll bring me a quick victory?

315
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,030
my word, and my life

316
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,704
good

317
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:50,242
my rules of engagement

318
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:54,293
humiliate the Greeks, and lay waste to their tiny ships

319
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,003
they'll be dead to last man

320
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,639
my brothers, steady your heart

321
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,688
look deep into your souls

322
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,363
for your metal is to be tested this day

323
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:33,702
deep in the heat of battle, you need a reason to fight on

324
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:40,336
an idea which you will give up all that you will ever have

325
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:44,755
you need only to look at man who fights at your side

326
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,970
this is the why of battle

327
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,721
this is the brotherhood of men at arms

328
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:57,487
an unbreakable bond made stronger by the crucible of combat

329
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,898
you'll never be closer than with those who you shed your blood with

330
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:10,785
for there's no nobler cause than to fight for those who'll lay down their life for you

331
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,038
so you fight strong today

332
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,460
you fight for your brothers

333
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,253
you fight for your families

334
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,132
most of all, you fight for Greece

335
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:33,637
there's only one thing to make sure of when the fighting starts

336
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:34,976
what's that?

337
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:37,936
don't get killed on the first day

338
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:40,771
that goes for the rest of you

339
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,768
Persian ships are strong at the front, but they're weak in the middle

340
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:19,811
we attack them there

341
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:32,907
now

342
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,136
attack

343
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,576
go through them

344
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,341
the enemy's tactics are creative

345
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,803
the defensive circle leaves no front to assault

346
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:01,264
we're losing

347
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,098
no you are losing

348
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,736
pull back. let them have this day.

349
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:16,944
I'm bored with your failures, Bandari

350
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,704
I'll not let this wound slow me

351
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,583
somehow I believe you

352
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:28,830
my blade will be sharp and ready by the morning

353
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:32,167
good, tomorrow you'll fight alongside your father

354
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:36,841
not bad for a bunch of farmers

355
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,871
and poets, and sculptors

356
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:44,388
who would have known a group of untrained men would do so well against such a considerable adversary

357
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,225
we're going to need all of our strength for tomorrow's fight

358
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,354
how long do you think we could hold them?

359
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,530
if my plan is to work,

360
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,364
long enough for the Spartans to unite Greece

361
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,375
Men! who will share their wine with me?

362
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,845
report

363
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,140
we're still tallying the losses

364
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,559
but you must understand

365
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:30,979
it's extremely difficult given the sea and the darkness

366
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:44,193
report

367
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:50,999
75 ships lost, 30 damaged beyond repair, 20 could return with a few weeks' work in a safe harbor

368
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:58,463
the commander of the Greek force is named Themistocles?

369
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:00,492
yes he's an Athenian general

370
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,528
he's rumored to have loose the arrow that fell the great king Darius himself

371
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:39,297
this Themistocles has shown himself to be quite brilliant in battle

372
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,091
which is more than I can say for any of you

373
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,346
do you gentlemen find my command unreasonable?

374
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,185
is it too much to ask for victory?

375
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:53,934
your disappointment in yesterday's losses is warranted

376
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:59,067
my disappointment

377
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:06,698
my disappointment is not with my losses, a meager number of damaged ships and dead slaves mean nothing to me, no

378
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,081
my disappointment is in these men

379
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:20,172
although I stand among 10000 I am alone

380
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:27,263
I long for a soul who would stand by my side, I could trust

381
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:38,436
tell me general Kashani, are you that man?

382
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,904
you will taste your victory by the day's end

383
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:45,489
I will make certain of it

384
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,115
I hope so

385
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,668
advance

386
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:33,218
now

387
00:42:57,288 --> 00:43:00,023
got any sights of them?

388
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,430
the Greeks are retreating

389
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,056
he's got him right where he wants him

390
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:18,806
Kashani is a fine tactician

391
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,519
I was speaking of Themistocles

392
00:43:33,198 --> 00:43:34,991
rocks

393
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:39,246
stop

394
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:42,787
brace yourselves

395
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:29,707
what are you doing here?

396
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:33,251
a commander's responsibility is to protect his family and his nation

397
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:35,630
who told you this?

398
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:36,794
my father

399
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,156
you see how Themistocles employs deception with such grace?

400
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,197
why is it so much to ask for victory?

401
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,853
-how can I make amendments?   -silence

402
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,791
you will carry a message for me

403
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,378
now they will fear us, now they will fear the Greek men at arms

404
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:05,299
he's right. fear the Greek fighting men.

405
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:07,927
fear his sword, his shield

406
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:10,809
fear his love for mother Greece

407
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,435
most of all, fear his freedom

408
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:22,567
don't be angry with the boy

409
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,313
I took him under my command

410
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:27,739
anger is something I reserve for my enemies

411
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,541
Themistocles

412
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,481
Artemisia's ship is being anchored in neutral waters

413
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:04,150
she'd like to meet with Themistocles

414
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,990
how can you guarantee his safe return

415
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:10,156
 well boy, the only honor for her now

416
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,789
will be when she watches your crushed and broken fleet sinking to the bottom of the Aegean

417
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:20,836
and is able to recognize you nailed to the mast of your ship with her sword

418
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,712
as you descend to a watery grave

419
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,345
why didn't you just say that to begin with?

420
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:01,544
welcome to my humble barge

421
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:03,756
we are honored by your presence

422
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:10,844
your barge and you are quite impressive

423
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:17,936
kind words.

424
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:23,191
now come Themistocles, we have much to discuss

425
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:26,860
do you believe the Greeks are descended from the Gods?

426
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,195
I've heard some say that

427
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:30,780
what of you?

428
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,821
is there a God in your lineage?

429
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,909
my men says so based on past 2 days' battle

430
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:40,455
I say this is spoke of the divine in you

431
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,709
now who is using kind words

432
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,973
my men also say that it was you who slayed good king Darius at Marathon

433
00:50:56,482 --> 00:50:58,100
many heroic deeds occured on that say

434
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:00,197
it was 10 years ago

435
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:03,144
the facts of the battle are often embellished

436
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:04,890
this deed you would remember

437
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:09,540
I do what I must, to defend Greece

438
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,154
and I do what I must to defeat her

439
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,951
for every one Greek killed, you must kill 1000 Persians

440
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:24,498
for every ship I sink, you must sink 100

441
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:29,882
staying to losses for weeks, months, if need be

442
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,134
my numbers will defeat you

443
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:35,593
and I will take your precious boats with my sword

444
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,266
I will take your Greek freedom

445
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,311
you're asking me to negotiate a surrender

446
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:46,187
no, I offer you a chance to avoid such misery and join me

447
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,358
I'm in need of a commander such as you

448
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,447
look at the defense you've mounted

449
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,408
a handful of ... Leonidas with 300 Spartans

450
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:05,415
it's insulting frankly the mightiest empire the world has ever seen is made by this

451
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,299
I don't blame you Themistocles,

452
00:52:11,324 --> 00:52:15,972
you fought as if the blood of Poseidon himself was through your veins

453
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,098
no I blame Greece

454
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:24,980
the squabbling bureaucrats protecting their political hinds by sending you here, to die

455
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,476
and yet you still fight

456
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,284
so there must be, what?

457
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,788
a family back home in Athens, then, compels you to

458
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:46,247
battle with such passion

459
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,923
truth is I've had no time for family

460
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:55,215
I've spent my entire adult life with my one true love

461
00:52:57,593 --> 00:52:58,555
the Greek fleet

462
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,860
and my one passion, readying it for you

463
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,857
now that brings me pleasure the thought of you pining away for me

464
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:19,199
forsaking family and love for the promise of a deeper ecstasy

465
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,002
the ecstasy of steel and flesh

466
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,423
death and life

467
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:40,637
of rage and sweated muscle

468
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:46,639
of pure joy and deepest sorrow

469
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,436
die with me each night and reborn again with me each morning

470
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,816
as you plant your sword into the hearts of our enemies

471
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:01,823
you fight for freedom

472
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:05,537
I offer freedom without consequence or responsibility

473
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:11,376
join me

474
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:18,882
at my side breathe each breath with me as if it were your last

475
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,871
join me

476
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,125
no

477
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,348
you're no God, you're just a man.

478
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:47,573
be quick with your sword

479
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:55,290
you'll not have your death tonight. guards!

480
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:59,086
remove this filth from my ship

481
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:28,933
well? what have you learned?

482
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,334
can Artemisia be beaten?

483
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:44,799
the next time we face her, she's gonna bring all of her wrath with her

484
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,533
send in my personal guard

485
00:59:22,981 --> 00:59:24,066
pull back

486
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:27,774
retreat

487
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,655
Themistocles, in the water

488
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:36,953
archers! on deck now!

489
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,622
step aside. fire at will

490
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:03,201
fight on boy, fight on

491
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,100
aim for the man on board

492
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:27,650
up there

493
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:40,595
abandon ship

494
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:29,953
the dead have no guilt

495
01:04:30,664 --> 01:04:32,457
no responsibility

496
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:39,138
Themistocles watches the bodies of his men turn the Aegean red with blood

497
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:42,675
were they sacrified for his ego?

498
01:04:44,475 --> 01:04:47,637
or to relieve the guilt of the long ago mistake Marathon

499
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:56,548
how many men would have been saved if Themistocles had killed that boy

500
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:00,817
not even his own soul can be sure

501
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:06,825
my friend, we faced the odds

502
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,452
together

503
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:15,247
listen to me, Themistocles,

504
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:23,466
you'll have to fight with twice as much strength in the morning

505
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:26,633
we'll fight shoulder to shoulder

506
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:32,429
no my son. you carry on for both of us.

507
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,949
what did he say?

508
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:38,662
I will tell you in time boy

509
01:06:40,919 --> 01:06:42,458
quiet now

510
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,257
Go on be with your father's spirit

511
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,226
how many times you think we will repeat such a tragedy?

512
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:01,104
as many times as we must

513
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:03,356
we're turning young men into memories

514
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:08,611
do you think I enjoy this?

515
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,989
witnessing my friend's fine over it?

516
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:19,204
every widow that is made by my decision

517
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:23,709
every child who will grow without a father

518
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,947
they are my choices

519
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,011
this is the burden of my command

520
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:00,205
how easy it is to silence the strong self-disciplined

521
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,877
let my army witness the great warriors of Sparta

522
01:08:07,122 --> 01:08:09,886
march them past these corpses

523
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:13,632
let them see the cost of daring to challenge the God king

524
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:23,143
king Leonidas and his brave 300 were the finest the Greece has to offer

525
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:27,316
there will be no saviours to rise up and vanquish us

526
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:31,613
nothing will stop the march of my empire

527
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,658
your majesty

528
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:40,825
you! take this dead king sword to Athens

529
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:44,580
let them know I'm coming next for them

530
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:55,675
let them know Athens, the prize jewel of a city, will disappear from the history

531
01:09:01,556 --> 01:09:05,768
Themosticles, I bring word from Thermopylae

532
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,725
Leonidas was betrayed by a hunchback

533
01:09:08,396 --> 01:09:09,356
the Spartans had been slaughtered

534
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,180
the hot gates are fallen

535
01:09:14,405 --> 01:09:15,781
such a sacrifice

536
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:22,316
now Greece has a martyr

537
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:27,372
Daxos, take that message from the hot gates

538
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:33,173
to every city, to every village, to every countrymen, hear your words

539
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:35,133
but they're dead, all of them

540
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,969
Sparta's sacrifice will be what unites us

541
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:40,428
now go

542
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:45,142
move all of our ships and men back to the safety of Salamis

543
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:46,853
and you?

544
01:09:47,147 --> 01:09:50,053
I'll take Daxos' message to Athens

545
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,404
I was told a hunchback was accountable for the fall of the hot gates

546
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,360
that he sold out his country

547
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,573
pulled the crimson from his back

548
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:02,700
and replaced it with Persian gold

549
01:10:04,873 --> 01:10:07,999
what is your name, traitor?

550
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,878
Ephialtes of

551
01:10:23,346 --> 01:10:27,100
I shan't wet this noble blade with your blood

552
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:30,643
you will be right to do so

553
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,690
there's little beauty about me

554
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:37,984
there's little beauty in what I have done

555
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:45,076
say what you must

556
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:49,415
I beg of you, and all of Athens

557
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,294
the God king will burn this city to the ground

558
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:56,423
quiet yourselves

559
01:10:57,421 --> 01:11:01,010
Leonidas' and Sparta's great sacrifice was no defeat

560
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:06,598
it was a beautiful victory

561
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:15,341
this simple act of valor will allow us to rally each of our city states

562
01:11:16,025 --> 01:11:19,737
and unite Greece for one purpose

563
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,403
against one enemy

564
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:27,034
and you will take this message to your God king

565
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,288
we will take whatever ships we have left

566
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,772
and finish this in the bay of Salamis

567
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,794
but there will be death and destruction

568
01:11:37,587 --> 01:11:40,259
yes, there will be

569
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:49,642
Themistocles

570
01:11:51,893 --> 01:11:53,355
I'm here to speak to your queen

571
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:58,316
a warning Athenian, you may not receive a warm welcome

572
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,432
may I offer my deepest sympathies

573
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:32,641
I cannot change what has happened to Leonidas

574
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,229
but his sacrifice will not be forgotten

575
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:40,484
do not lecture me on sacrifice, and be quick with your words Athenian

576
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,822
 I request of you the entire Spartan navy

577
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:49,451
every man every ship that you can spare

578
01:12:49,868 --> 01:12:52,540
have I not given enough for your dream of a united Greece?

579
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:58,086
shall I put swords in the hands of my son, our children, would that please you?

580
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,174
have I not given enough for your ambitions Themistocles?

581
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:10,095
a king, husbands, fathers, brothers, Sparta will give no more

582
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:29,030
this belongs with you

583
01:13:38,404 --> 01:13:41,128
avenge him

584
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:00,634
the oracle's words stood as a warning

585
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,149
all of Greece will fall

586
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,697
as Persian fire reduces Athens to cinder

587
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:12,910
for Athens is a pile of stone and wood and cloth and dust

588
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,333
and as dust will vanish into the wind

589
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,837
only the Athenians themselves exist

590
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:26,672
and the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable

591
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,429
only the Athenians exist

592
01:14:31,053 --> 01:14:32,976
and only stout wooden ships can save them

593
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:35,707
wooden ships

594
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:40,357
and a tidal wave of heroes' blood

595
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,654
the Greeks were fools to stand against us

596
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:54,076
Leonidas and his pride were no match for the will of a God

597
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,288
Themistocles was a worthless coward

598
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,918
now there's pathetic navy

599
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:07,254
has badly wrought to our attention

600
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:11,384
if that worthless coward had stood at my side we would've laid world at your feet

601
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:18,599
my king, your humble servant

602
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,357
the Greek fleet are defenseless within the bay of Salamis

603
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:27,858
you need only finish them

604
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:30,029
who commands their forces

605
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:37,369
Themistocles, of Athens

606
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:39,164
Themistocles is dead

607
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,832
he is alive, I have seen him myself

608
01:15:56,643 --> 01:15:57,888
ready my troops and armor

609
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:00,308
we will attack at once

610
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,978
wisdom

611
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:07,234
would have sent a proper force to confirm it is not a trap

612
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:10,979
who would dare to advise me in matters of war?

613
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:13,949
I am the God king.

614
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:16,700
I am the one who triumphed over Leonidas

615
01:16:17,412 --> 01:16:20,497
I am the one who laid waste to this show piece of Athens

616
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,083
I am your king

617
01:16:23,623 --> 01:16:26,710
Killing Leonidas and his men only made them martyrs.

618
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:33,716
And when you raised Athens, you set fire to the only thing of value in this country

619
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:51,733
we will attack the Greeks with my entire navy

620
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:55,281
Artemisia

621
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:56,463
enough

622
01:16:57,829 --> 01:17:00,872
do not forget who put the crown on your childish head

623
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:03,579
my king

624
01:17:04,956 --> 01:17:09,294
now sit on your golden throne and watch this battle from the safety I provide you

625
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:17,013
they're in the distant

626
01:17:18,636 --> 01:17:20,930
we witness destruction of Athens

627
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,936
alone we will face the monster that cast a shadow across our land

628
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:35,069
I had prayed that the Spartans would come to lend a hand this morning

629
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:40,160
perhaps they feel they've given enough

630
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:43,285
you failed us all, this is your fault Themistocles

631
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:44,871
without Spartans we're just farm hands

632
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:47,290
we should have negotiated with the Persians when we had the chance

633
01:17:53,046 --> 01:17:54,701
you're all right

634
01:17:56,882 --> 01:17:59,804
yes, we're down to a handful of boats

635
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:04,805
yes, we're just farm hands

636
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:06,686
we're tradesmen

637
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:13,150
we're boys turned to men through the sacrifice and forge of combat

638
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,574
I played a dangerous game

639
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:20,573
and I lost

640
01:18:25,202 --> 01:18:30,626
if you choose to turn your back on me, on your country

641
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:36,049
I will not judge you

642
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:42,510
you're free to leave, you're still free men

643
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:07,163
very well

644
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:13,002
let us put our shoulders to work and free those ships from the bosom of Greece

645
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:18,456
there's a privilege to call our own

646
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,467
a story that will be told for 1000 years

647
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:28,976
let our final stand be recorded to the histories

648
01:19:29,809 --> 01:19:30,936
let it be shown

649
01:19:32,195 --> 01:19:37,066
that we chose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees

650
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,576
there's only one thing you need to know today

651
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:29,035
not to get killed

652
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:33,454
no, your father's last words

653
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:41,258
he told me you'd earned the right to sit at the table

654
01:20:58,105 --> 01:21:01,316
my brother, I have no more tactics or tricks

655
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,193
this will be the last battle that we share

656
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,285
we fought next to one another for as long as I can remember

657
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,661
nothing will please me more than to rest this soul

658
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:17,082
the preparations that I required?

659
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:19,876
they're low deck

660
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:21,464
good

661
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:23,424
are you sure that you want to commit everything?

662
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:25,635
yes

663
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,762
without Artemisia's command the Persian navy is nothing

664
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:33,882
we will never be able to reach her

665
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:36,185
I will reach her

666
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:38,647
and put an end to this

667
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:41,860
there will be no room for a retreat

668
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,112
I know

669
01:21:47,656 --> 01:21:50,157
today the last Greek ships will be destroyed

670
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:55,788
show them no mercy, give them no quarter

671
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,499
today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks

672
01:22:00,294 --> 01:22:02,293
today we deliver submission

673
01:22:04,505 --> 01:22:07,548
today I want to feel Themosticles' throat beneath my boots

674
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,628
men! brace yourselves

675
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:38,682
prepare for close quarters. attack!

676
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:46,564
your father watches you

677
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,777
hold nothing back

678
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:51,532
seize your glory

679
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,459
I'm not here as a witness

680
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:28,878
now, or let them send us all straight to hell

681
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:18,071
you offered freedom without consequence or responsibility

682
01:27:18,529 --> 01:27:20,154
are you accepting my offer?

683
01:27:20,695 --> 01:27:22,613
my answer is still no

684
01:27:50,726 --> 01:27:52,647
you fight much harder than you fuck

685
01:28:36,273 --> 01:28:37,607
surrender to me

686
01:28:38,107 --> 01:28:39,360
or meet your death

687
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:41,195
who would you fight if not for me?

688
01:28:42,569 --> 01:28:44,323
noone could challenge your skill

689
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:46,991
I'd rather die a free man than as a slave

690
01:28:49,076 --> 01:28:51,942
even if the chain was attached to you

691
01:29:01,132 --> 01:29:02,756
it begins as a whisper

692
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:04,965
a promise

693
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:12,120
a lightest of breezes dances through the rigging as it creeks above the death cries of 10000 men

694
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:16,981
it moves through her hair as gently as a lover's hand

695
01:29:18,482 --> 01:29:22,275
that breeze, that promise became wind

696
01:29:23,195 --> 01:29:28,780
a wind that's blown across Greece carrying a message told again and again of our lady freedom

697
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:33,788
and how wise she was to charge Leonidas to lay all at her feet

698
01:29:36,082 --> 01:29:38,122
a wind, my brothers, of sacrifice

699
01:29:40,671 --> 01:29:42,089
a wind of freedom

700
01:29:44,673 --> 01:29:46,256
a wind of justice

701
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,475
a wind of vengeance

702
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:41,937
you're being surrounded

703
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:44,691
all of Greece has united against you

704
01:30:46,777 --> 01:30:51,655
Delphi, Thebes, Olympia, Arcadia and Sparta.

705
01:31:06,589 --> 01:31:08,798
if death comes for me today I'm ready

706
01:31:10,906 --> 01:31:12,262
I could lower my sword

707
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,390
There is still time for you to ready a launch and escape.

708
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,022
It would be a poor choice to force my hand into action

709
01:31:24,066 --> 01:31:26,941
now order your ships to disengage and surrender to me

710
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:33,701
surrender?
