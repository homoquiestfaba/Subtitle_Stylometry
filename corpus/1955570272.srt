- Hi.

I'm actually looking for
the Salvatore boarding house.

Are you sure you wanna stay there?

Why not?

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,278
Because it's the creepiest place
in Mystic Falls.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,831
At least that's what everybody
that lives there and drinks here says.

13

14

about three months ago.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,877
The guy that owns it, Zach Salvatore,
just kicked everybody out.

17

It'll give me time to set up
a couple surprises for him.

It'll be the first thing that he sees.

35

Garlic.
It'll soak into his clothes, make him weak.

Holy water. Purifies everything.

37

I mean, how is he even out in the sun?

Shouldn't he be up in flames?
