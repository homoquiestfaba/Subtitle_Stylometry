00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:32,895
but his partners swindle
him, leaving him penniless.

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,269
He falls into the
abyss of poverty,

185
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:41,982
becomes a ditch digger
digging trenches for cables,

186
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,076
phone lines for Western Union.

187
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,438
After a humiliating year,
a sympathetic foreman

188
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:57,187
introduces him to Alfred S.
Brown and Charles F. Peck.

189
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:04,084
They key is the motor
rotates by virtue of induction

190
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,492
of rotating magnetic fields.

191
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:08,627
I've eliminated the
commutator which distributes

192
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,153
electricity to the rotor.

193
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:13,004
So you've eliminated the
need for the commutator

194
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:14,413
and brushes the sparks.

195
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,369
Amazing.

196
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:16,716
There are no sparks.

197
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:17,578
Is that so bad?

198
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,083
They're just unnecessary.

199
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,116
The magnetic field
redirects the current.

00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:26,033
The work you did for
Edison, what was it?

202
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:29,099
I redesigned 24
different dynamos,

203
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,684

204
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,688
replaced longer magnets
with short coils,

205
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,943
replaced older models.

206
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,697
I couldn't interest him
in alternating current,

207
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,446
but of course you know...

208
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,923
I know, I'm an electrician.

209
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:41,527

211
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,235
He understands...

212
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,545
This is more
than just a motor.

213
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,355
It is entire system

and utilizing power.

hires the best,

them pay for the privilege.

There's nobody else, really.

one who has the cash.

The cash and the guts.

George Westinghouse was 16

373

when he enlisted
in the Civil War.

374
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,362
Served in the Navy
on the northern side

375
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,630
and was promoted to Corporal.

376
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:21,368
When he was 21, he invented
the air break for trains

377
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:24,577
and made a fortune because
all the railroads needed it.

378
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:26,964
He was an inventor
and businessman,

379
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,209
a rare mix.

just five million results.

Brown, an associate.

common American name.

is he zaps the dog

Instead of hanging,
there's a move to electrocute

438

is going to testify

interesting questions.

Where are you from?

He's from a small village

547
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,988
in the Austrian Empire.

548
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,297
ROBERT: Humble beginnings.

549
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:11,857
Like Abraham Lincoln.

550
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,452
He has many fond memory.

551
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,307
Yes.

552
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:20,008
I remember

553
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,509
when I was 17, summertime,

554
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,478
I lived in the country.

555
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:26,881
There was a Cholera epidemic.

556
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:31,052
They burned trees in the streets
to ward away evil spirits

557
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:34,226
and drank infected
water, died like dogs.

558
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:45,529

Mr. Tesla and Mr.?

Szigeti.

560
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:46,959
EVELYN: Yes.

561
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:49,903
Just realized how late it
is and somebody's father

562
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:52,205
expects her home on the hour.

563

He doesn't care.

564
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,171
You know who my
father is of course?

565
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,433
Yes.

566
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,362
Do you consider my father a
malignant force in the world?

567
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,525
A person who amasses a
fortune like a pirate

568
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:12,638
or a gangster?

569
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,132
Who acquires power by exploiting
workers, and resources,

570
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:21,268
and rigging markets, and
manipulating economies,

571
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,031
and so forth?

572
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,804
Or is he a
captain of industry?

573
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,941
Are his actions positive?

574
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,945
Does he in fact expand
markets, and provide more jobs,

575
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,341
and give vast sums of money
to those less fortunate?

576
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:38,620
This young lady's in my care
and I must get her home.

578
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:47,930

Yes, we may see
you again soon.

583
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:23,919
daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan.

584
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,534
ANNE: My father preferred
to be called Pierpont.

585
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,337
Pierpont Morgan.

586
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:32,260
At that time and
for decades to come,

one of the wealthiest
men in the world.

588

He was born rich,

589
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:38,745
entered the family
banking business early on.

590
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,314
In 1861 when he was 24,

591
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,157
he married his first
wife, Amelia Sturges.

592
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,787
He took her to Europe
after they were married,

593
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,956
she was diagnosed with
Tuberculosis and died

594
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,624
four months later.

595
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:51,768
He was shattered.

596
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,226
He buried himself in
work, banking, finance,

597
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:59,033
buying and trading
companies and corporations.

598
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,284
I don't think he ever asked
who strokes the cat's back.

599
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:07,837
He married Frances Louisa
Tracy and had four children.

Electric Company.

00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,629
Watch out for his nose.

729
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:09,683
His what?

730
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:11,298
His nose.

731
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,778
You've heard about it, I assume?

732
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:17,827
The richest man in
the world and he has

733
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:19,461
a hideous skin disease.

734
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:23,695
Inflaming and
disfiguring his nose.

735
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,198
He dares you to pretend
you don't see it.

736
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,024
Maybe it will happen to me,

737
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:32,338
it's just a matter of time.

738
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:36,343
Maybe I'd be better
off without a nose,

739
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:38,393
like the sphinx.

740
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,251
When are you going to Chicago?

741
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,520
How did you know about that?

742

hundreds of dynamos.

With your friend?

748
00:43:58,194 --> 00:43:58,722
No.

He lost his compass.

750
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,835
He went to South America
to seek his fortune.

751
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:07,274
But wasn't he your

00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:08,424

Thinking, my father taught me,

760
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:39,139
is more interesting than knowing

761
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:41,909
but less interesting
than lucking.

That's one way to size
up the pavilion of light

at the World's Fair
in Chicago 1893,

764
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,935
where the new Tesla Westinghouse
machines provide power

765
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:54,224
and illumination.

766
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,232
The fair consumes three
times more electricity

767
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,226
than the whole city itself.

28 million visitors
from around the world

769
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:04,565
and they all see what
Edison has tried to deny,

770
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:08,045
alternating current
is beautiful and safe.

771
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:15,156
Ahh.

781
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:39,566
surrounded by 25 hundred
different types of Edison lamps.

782

Go ahead, it's fresh.

783
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,821

00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:44,938
Yes, yes, of course you are.

00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:45,703
Of course.

787
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:48,354
As I was saying, it's
really on display.

788
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,613

sewing machine motors,

The dolls?

792
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:58,655
They're very amusing.

Hmm, the talking dolls.

Tesla, it's plain as day.

799
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:18,361
This entire World's
Fair is lit and powered

800

machines, your design.

802
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:27,047
I was wrong about
alternating current.

803
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:29,511
I was wrong about you.

I still have investors.

00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,749

things together, huh?

never happened.

Edison and Tesla didn't
talk at the World Fair.

Edison never
admitted he was wrong

about alternating current.

There was no apology,
no reconciliation.

sharp and smart at his side,

to steer him through

wrong side of the street.

to go forward with the merger

864
00:50:19,093 --> 00:50:24,221

horsepower clause, is canceled.

somewhere a little less dusty?

through, you'll retain

through the earth.

1268

Hello, Anne.

1272
01:21:10,005 --> 01:21:11,259
I've just made tea.

1273
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:18,580
I understand your father
left for Cairo last week.

1274
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:21,150
His aides say he can't be
reached for another two weeks.

1275
01:21:21,196 --> 01:21:24,253
When this tower is complete,

1276
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:27,361
he will be able to be
reached in an instant.

1277
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:33,074
I'm not here to talk
for him or about him.

1278
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:36,089
Except to tell you

1279
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,400
that he knows you're in debt.

1280
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:39,509
ROBERT: Of
course he's in debt.

1281
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:41,149
He's revolutionizing at
least three fields of...

1282
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,414
ANNE: Deep debt.

1283
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:45,804
And when you send out
distress signals...

1284
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,271
ROBERT: Do you understand
the scale of what he's...

1285
01:21:47,305 --> 01:21:49,778
ANNE: It can only
alarm any other investors,

1286
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,616
if any are left to be alarmed.

1287
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:54,450
And all my father
asked for was a way

1288
01:21:54,483 --> 01:21:56,844
to send stock reports
across the Atlantic.

1289
01:21:58,743 --> 01:22:01,582
We don't have any
other investors.

you're giving interviews

1293

messages from Mars.

1294
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,718

signals,

1296
01:22:21,473 --> 01:22:24,603
distinct vibrations,
even, not random.

1297
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,377
I do believe it
pretends a message.

1298
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:30,785
Why would you go
on record with this?

1299
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:32,620
TESLA: I said it pretends...

1300
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:34,055
From Mars?

1301
01:22:34,089 --> 01:22:36,192
My father reads these things.

1302
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:38,127

life is actually...

is a statistical certainty.

What if you're picking
up Marconi's signals?

across the English Channel.

1308

Not Mars, but Marconi?

1309
01:23:02,218 --> 01:23:05,787
I believe that I may be

1310
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:08,141
the first person

1311
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:13,775

of one planet greeting another.

your system succeeds?

distribution of power?

1314
01:23:23,305 --> 01:23:24,825
Nobody controls it.

That's right.

that the way the world runs

1320

is determined by the
manipulation of all this?

01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:19,484
I finally met someone,
someone as strong and willful

1442
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:21,421
as my father,

1443
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,693
someone who wanted me.

1444

S. E. Marbury.

1445
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:33,347
I moved into her villa
in the French countryside

1446
01:34:33,466 --> 01:34:35,902
and we poured American
money into a relief fund

1447
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:38,872
during the war,
a health service,

1448
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:40,245
a camp for children.

Sarah Bernhardt, and my father

1452
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:57,791
and dies alone at
the Hotel New Yorker

1453
01:34:57,824 --> 01:35:00,629
on January 7th, 1943.

1454
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,258
He was 87 years old.

1455
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:06,114
Destitute but not forgotten.

1456
01:35:06,688 --> 01:35:09,254
Over 2,000 people
attend his funeral

1457
01:35:09,538 --> 01:35:11,678
at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine.

1458
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:17,138
He was always looking ahead,

1459
01:35:17,923 --> 01:35:20,046
projecting himself
into the future.

1460
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:24,476
Maybe he promised more
than he could deliver,

1461
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:26,750
maybe he overreached,

1462
01:35:28,006 --> 01:35:30,008
or maybe the world
that we are living in

1463
01:35:30,636 --> 01:35:33,660
is a dream that
Tesla dreamed first.
