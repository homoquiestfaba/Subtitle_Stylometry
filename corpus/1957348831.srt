- Another Instagram meal?

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,649
- Yeah, you know how many likes they get.

30
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,239
- I'm gonna lock up and head to bed.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,299
- Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,550
- Don't stay up too late.

33
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:18,283
Expecting one of your friends?

34
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,284
- No.

35
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:43,961
- Hello?

36
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,839
Must be those kids again.

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,909
I'll make sure the alarm is on.

38
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,239
Can you double check
that the back is locked?

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
- Yeah.

40
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,870
Brad!

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,813
- What,

42
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,646
what happened?

43
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,479
- I saw someone.

44
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,350
There's someone in the-

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,183
- Where was he?

46
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,020
- Um, he was in the window.

47
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,079
He looked right at me.

48
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,699
- I don't see anything.

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,533
- He was right there.

50
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:45,810
He was looking right at me.

51
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,443
- Stay here.

52
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:18,192
Fuck.

53
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:22,604
Call 911.

54
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:30,431
Who's there?

55
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,002
- 911, what's your emergency?

56
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,389
- And my boyfriend,
he's out there um,

57
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,339
I saw someone outside
the window of my house.

58
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,659
- Okay, ma'am,
I need you to remain calm.

59
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,799
Where are you located in the house?

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,899
- My boyfriend, he's out there, and I,

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,733
I can't see him.

62
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,969
I think someone is here.

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,219
I saw someone in the window.

64
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,409
- We need you both to stay put

65
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,949
until the officers arrive.

66
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,140
- Please get here.

67
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,959
Please hurry.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,893
I think I hear something.

69
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:07,343
- Can you call
him back into the room?

70
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,728
- Brad!

71
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,928
I have to do something.

72
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,814
- Ma'am, I
just need you to relax.

73
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,129
We have units on the way.

74
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,509
They will arrive in a few minutes.

75
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,789
- He's out by the door and I-

76
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,670
- Please calm down.

77
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,818
The officers are pulling up now.

78
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,652
- Please get here.

79
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,159
Please hurry.

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,189
- Stay where you are.

81
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,556
Do not leave the closet.

82
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,713
Let the officers handle the situation.

83
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,929
Ma'am?

84
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,303
Ma'am, are you still there?

85
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,329
Ma'am, please respond.

86
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,530
Please stay on the line.

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,071
Ma'am?

88
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,259
- So you heard a knock
on the front door there?

89
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,079
- Yeah, I answered, but nobody was there.

90
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,697
- And has this happened before?

91
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,639
- I mean, yeah, we live in a neighborhood

92
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,809
with a bunch of bored kids,

93
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,199
but never this late at night.

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,883
- So when you closed the
door, did you lock it?

95
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,389
- I could have sworn I did,

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,133
but it's possible that I forgot.

97
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,399
- If you left the door unlocked,

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,612
perhaps it set off the alarm.

99
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:39,613
So,

100
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,553
it's mighty windy out, it's possible.

101
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,926
- I guess that could have happened.

102
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,289
- But I saw someone at the back window

103
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,390
right after the knock.

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,003
- Okay, did you see someone as well?

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,793
- No, but I believe her.

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
- Okay well, you know, it's late at night.

107
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,249
There's a lot going on.

108
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,163
You look out the window.

109
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,929
I mean, we get calls all
the time from residents

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,548
spooked by shadows.

111
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:13,549
- It wasn't a shadow, I know what I saw.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,009
- Okay, so assuming it wasn't a shadow,

113
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,609
perhaps, do you know anyone
who might be messing with you?

114
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,653
A jealous ex, something of that nature?

115
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,809
- No, I mean, not really.

116
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,319
Sunny has a pretty big
following on social media.

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,949
Those guys can get pretty weird.

118
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,019
- Of course.

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,859
So what we'll do is we'll
patrol the neighborhood,

120
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,299
keep an eye on the house, and
make sure everything's okay.

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,929
- Thank you, we really appreciate it.

122
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,389
- You know, maybe you
should go see some relatives

123
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,089
or friends, if you're
still feeling uneasy.

124
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,740
- I mean, both of our parents
live on the west coast.

125
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,919
- Well, how about you take a vacation?

126
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,989
You know, just get out
there on the open road,

127
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,203
away from the city.

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,861
- Yeah, I mean, maybe it is time for that.

129
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,199
- Getting anything?

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,749
- Trying.

131
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,309
How is there not even one bar?

132
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,809
- I don't know, but we'd better
figure out something soon.

133
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,919
I have no clue where this damn cabin is.

134
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,543
- Come on, stupid thing.

135
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,393
What are you doing?

136
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,929
- Will you reach into
the glove compartment

137
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,930
and hand me the map?

138
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
- Yes.

139
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,031
- Thank you.

140
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,119
Okay.

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,039
So it looks like we make
a left in a few miles

142
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,039
and we'll run right into the cabin.

143
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
- You sure?

144
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,882
- No, but I guess we're gonna find out.

145
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,411
I mean, there's not many roads out here.

146
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,119
- And you told me you wanted
something off the grid.

147
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,953
- Yeah.

148
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:02,959
But something a little closer to the city

149
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,880
wouldn't have been terrible.

150
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,216
- I did my best for 24 hours of notice.

151
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,809
- I'm just giving you shit, Sunny.

152
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
All right.

153
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:50,054
Damn, good fucking work, Sunny.

154
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,249
This looks even better than the pictures.

155
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,333
- Yeah, it's perfect.

156
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,929
- Really?

157
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,419
We don't even have service out here.

158
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
- Say cheese!

159
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,146
- I thought the whole
reason we came out here

160
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:35,079
was to get away from that stuff.

161
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
- Oh, it's just a quick one.

162
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,563
- I mean, at least wait
until we're settled in.

163
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,359
- Hey guys, welcome back.

164
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,099
So I've got a huge surprise for you.

165
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,639
My wonderful boyfriend.

166
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Say, Hi.

167
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:54,789
- Yo.

168
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,599
- Has surprised me with a weekend get away

169
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,119
to this crazy cabin,

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,759
but there's a catch.

171
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,219
So there's no internet.

172
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,909
And my phone is completely out-of-service.

173
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,639
I mean, we barely got here.

174
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,099
This is gonna be our last post

175
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,769
before we return to civilization.

176
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,609
So just be sure to stick
around and subscribe.

177
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,610
Bye, guys.

178
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
How was that?

179
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:20,879
- Really? It's fine.

180
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,329
Come on. Help me with your bags.

181
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,579
- I just think I rushed it a little bit.

182
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,833
I'm gonna do one more.

183
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,713
Hey, guys.

184
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,217
You, go ahead.

185
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:41,995
Oh man, this place is pretty cool.

186
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,663
- Yeah, this place is sick.

187
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,303
I'll put the suitcases in the back.

188
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,583
- Okay, you want a drink?

189
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
- Yeah, I need one.

190
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,503
Fucking finally.

191
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,830
- Oh, shit man, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,649
I didn't hear you.

193
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,379
I didn't think you were
coming until later.

194
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,499
- It's fine, I just know
anybody else was in here.

195
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,119
- I'm Joe, I run the cabins in this area.

196
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,010
- I'm Brad.

197
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,739
- Pleasure to meet you, man.

198
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,139
Let me, let me show you around.

199
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
- Sure.

200
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,589
- Hey.

201
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,769
- Oh Sunny, this is Joe.

202
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,659
He manages the properties in the area.

203
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,969
- Hey Joe.

204
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,179
- You're the one who booked it.

205
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,629
- Yeah, that's me.

206
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,479
This place is beautiful.

207
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,539
We're excited to be here.

208
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,119
- Yeah, it's real popular among folks

209
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,609
who want to get away from the
city, or reality for a bit.

210
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,889
- Well, that's exactly
what we're looking for.

211
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,593
- Let me show you around and
then I'll get out of your hair.

212
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,893
This here's the living
room area, not much.

213
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,519
TV over there.

214
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,159
We don't get cable or satellite,

215
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,893
but we do have a DVD
player with some movies.

216
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,819
So the fridge got a few snacks, not a lot.

217
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,849
- It's fine, we brought
most of our own food.

218
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,809
- Good, 'cause the nearest gas station,

219
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,109
it's about 45 miles out.

220
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,249
- Can you come out here
much if we need anything?

221
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,220
- Yeah.

222
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,649
I make my rounds to
each of the properties.

223
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,209
You know, stuff breaks down all the time,

224
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,569
so it's just a matter of
time before I'm out here.

225
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,389
Oh, and as you probably
already know cell phone service

226
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,759
is like shit out here, comes and goes.

227
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,579
You need to make a call,

228
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,459
I'd say jump on the A1A
and drive for a little bit

229
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,273
and usually you'll get some service.

230
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,999
- And if we need to contact you, like,

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,809
let's say if there's an emergency?

232
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,689
- Oh yeah, your best bet, that landline.

233
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,659
I put my home number, my cell number,

234
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,209
but remember, my cell reception

235
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,149
is probably not gonna work.

236
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,303
And I put the local police
station just in case.

237
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,489
Anything else?

238
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,729
- No, I think that's good.

239
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,509
Thanks for the tour, Joe.

240
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,573
- I'm gonna get on down
to my other properties.

241
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,449
You guys should have a quiet night.

242
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,673
There's not going to be
anybody here to bother you.

243
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,319
- How many people are out here?

244
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,999
- It's just you two
right now, but there's,

245
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,689
there's more coming tomorrow.

246
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,189
Most of the cabins are vacant right now.

247
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,239
They all belong to this one owner.

248
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,179
He's one of those prepper guys.

249
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,499
Hey, I just manage the place,

250
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,253
and he cuts me a check each month.

251
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,546
I haven't seen the guy in over two years.

252
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,380
- Prepper like?

253
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,079
- One of those crazy apocalypse guys.

254
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,309
- Oh.

255
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,479
- I don't know how crazy they are

256
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,109
with how things are going in the world.

257
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,479
- Yeah, I guess you have a point.

258
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,939
- Anyways, he rents out these cabins.

259
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,769
They're his bug-out spots.

260
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,289
- Like if the world ends?

261
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,679
- Yup, pretty much.

262
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,779
All the walls are
fortified and reinforced,

263
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
and check this out.

264
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,729
Bulletproof windows.

265
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,563
You guys don't have to worry

266
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:15,699
about any bears getting in here.

267
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,909
- Well, that's good to know.

268
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,319
- I'll be back to make
some repairs and oh,

269
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,839
if you guys want a suggestion,

270
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,469
I'd go ahead and take a hot now

271
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,672
before you settle in,

272
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:28,029
because the temperature is
quite nice as the sun sets.

273
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,209
- Thanks, yeah, we might try that.

274
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,729
- All right.

275
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,730
- Thank you.

276
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,949
- Finally, that guy can talk for hours.

277
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,839
- You want to start dinner?

278
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,699
- Actually, I was kind of thinking

279
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,799
we could take that hike we talked about.

280
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,849
- I'm kind of just ready to hang out.

281
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,059
- Come on.

282
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,139
It's so beautiful out.

283
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,239
I bet you can get some really
good content for your Insta.

284
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,399
- Think so?

285
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,449
- Yeah, come on.

286
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,100

- Come on. Sunny.

300
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,049
You have enough content for weeks.

301
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,359
- Come on, please?

302
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,319
The lighting's perfect, please?

303
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,384
- All right, give me the phone.

304
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:21,349
- Okay, thank you.

305
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,823
- Does this look okay?

306
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,403
- It looks so good, you
might not even need a filter.

307
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,470
We're rolling.

308
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,889
- Hey guys, welcome back.

309
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,369
So I've got a quick update for you.

310
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,309
We've been out here like all day,

311
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,598
trying to find some waterfalls.

312
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,039
We were a little delayed,

313
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,969
but I promise we're going
to head back out tomorrow

314
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,429
and get you some really great footage.

315
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,283
So just stick around for more, bye guys.

316
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,069
How's that?

317
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,179
- You know, we've been hiking
for like 15 minutes, right?

318
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,449
- Yeah, but they don't know that.

319
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,719
Plus if we were hiking all day,

320
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,939
I'd get really gross and really sweaty.

321
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,659
And no one wants that.

322
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,539
Cool, it should work.

323
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,373
Wanna head back?

324
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm getting kind of hungry.

325
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,269
- Actually, I was thinking
maybe you could head back.

326
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,789
I kind of want to hike a little
bit further down the trail.

327
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,069
- It's getting pretty late, I don't know.

328
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,429
- Come on, it's
like a 10 minute hike back.

329
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,469
I'll be in right behind you, I promise.

330
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,189
- Okay, but if I scream,
you better come rescue me.

331
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,273
- All right, deal.

332
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:48,965
- What the fuck?

333
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:14,663
Why the fuck are you following me, dude?

334
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:46,593
What a weirdo.

335
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,462
What the fuck was that?

336
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:02,463
It's okay.

337
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,223
You're okay, just a fucking redneck.

338
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,219
- You good?

339
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,869
You look like you just saw a ghost.

340
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,870
- No, yeah.

341
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,790
I'm good.

342
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,409
I heard a noise out there,
probably was an animal,

343
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,949
but wasn't sticking around to find out.

344
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,749
- I've had a pretty
long day, wanna head in?

345
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,349
Yeah.

346
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,568
Sounds good.

347
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,853
Let's go.

348
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,669
Another bottle?

349
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,899
- It's vacation, don't judge me.

350
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,653
- Hey, this is a judgment-free zone, okay?

351
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,209
So I got you a surprise.

352
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,574
- Oh yeah?

353
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,099
- Yeah, I was going to
wait until your birthday,

354
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,223
but I figured you could use it.

355
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,529
Come on.

356
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,773
- Slow down.

357
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,129
- You stay right here, and I'll be back.

358
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,130
Okay?

359
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,909
Okay, close your eyes.

360
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,069
Close them.

361
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,070
- Okay.

362
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,510
- Okay, open them up.

363
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,069
- You didn't?

364
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,149
- I just figured you'd get

365
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,659
some good use out of it this weekend.

366
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,089
- Holy shit, how did you even afford this?

367
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,949
This thing is like super expensive.

368
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,883
- Just remember me when
you're Instagram famous, okay?

369
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,260
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

370
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,094
I love you.

371
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,439
- I love you too.

372
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,453
- But I do need one more thing.

373
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,999
- Here we go.

374
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,229
- Do you think you
could help me set it up?

375
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,643
- Oh yeah, I think I can manage that.

376
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,933
- Fuckin' creepy-ass woods.

377
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,249
- I'm so excited to shoot tomorrow.

378
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,219
It's gonna look so good.

379
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,713
- Yeah, it shoots in 4K.

380
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,289
What trail do you want to hike tomorrow?

381
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,390
- What are my options?

382
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,469
- Option A is five miles
and it's pretty easy.

383
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,579
Option B is nine miles, but
it's got the nicer views.

384
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,349
- Oh well, yeah probably the
one with the better view,

385
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,350
I would think.

386
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,263
- When's the last time you
hiked nine miles, ever?

387
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,193
- I'll be fine.

388
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,079
All right, well don't
say I didn't warn you.

389
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,499
- Seriously, I mean,

390
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,373
you came back from that walk
earlier covered in sweat.

391
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,609
Brad, did you see anyone
else out there on the trails?

392
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,133
- No, it's just you and me.

393
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,883
- Come here, look at this.

394
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,893
There, you see it?

395
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,859
- I don't see anything, Sunny.

396
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,379
- It's right there.

397
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,659
What is that?

398
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,949
- I mean, it's kind of
blurry, like a glitch.

399
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,003
If two images merged or something.

400
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,343
- No, look, it's in the other ones, too.

401
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:54,801
What the fuck?

402
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,883
You didn't see anyone else out there?

403
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,713
- Not at that time, it was just us.

404
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,253
It's probably just some
bored redneck kids, you know,

405
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,089
I wouldn't worry too much.

406
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,589
- This was 15 minutes later.

407
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,073
He had to be following us.

408
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,959
- I'm telling you,

409
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,599
I used to play in the woods
all the time when I was a kid.

410
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,179
It's nothing.

411
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,273
- And would you wear creepy
masks and follow people around?

412
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,993
- I mean, no.

413
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,083
- It makes no sense.

414
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:32,890
I mean, there shouldn't be
anyone else out here for miles.

415
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,263
- I wouldn't worry too much about it.

416
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,559
You know, I mean we're safe in here.

417
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,810
Come on, let's go to bed.

418
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
- You don't,

419
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,163
you don't think this has
to do with the other night?

420
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,119
- No, no, I don't.

421
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,459
That was 150 miles away.

422
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,613
Nobody even knows we're out here.

423
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,959
I think we're both
overworked and overstressed,

424
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,923
so let's not bring that stress
here and ruin our weekend.

425
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
- Okay.

426
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,863
- I promise, it's just a coincidence.

427
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,529
And if it's not, well,

428
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,669
I'll beat the shit out of him

429
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,620
and bury him in those hills over there.

430
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,400
There won't be any witnesses

431
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,100
as long as you don't snitch on me.

432
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:04,059
- Come on, I'm ready for bed.

433
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,549
- Yeah?

434
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,350
You know, I'm not really that tired.

435
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,390
Let me see this.

436
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:19,749
You know what we could do?

437
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,069
- Put that thing away right now.

438
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,789
- Come on, we gotta test it out.

439
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,143
- In your dreams.

440
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,389
- I mean, we could create
some killer content

441
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,589
that I know your fans will love.

442
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,809
- Yeah, the neck beards.

443
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,609
- I mean, this is a whole untapped market,

444
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,269
just waiting to be monetized.

445
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,159
- And only at the expense of my family.

446
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,569
- Is that such a bad thing?

447
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,303
- You are such an asshole.

448
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,400
If you don't put that away,

449
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:48,269
I'm gonna make you sleep
outside with the bears.

450
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,299
- All I'm saying,

451
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,500
how many followers does
Kim Kardashian have?

452
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,599
- Millions.

453
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,783
- I rest my case.

454
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
- Who's that?

455
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,139
- I don't know.

456
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,429
- It's pretty late.

457
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,089
- It's probably just Joe.

458
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,943
Probably left some tools or something.

459
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,570
- Who's there?

460
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,153
- There isn't anyone there.

461
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Hello?

462
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,117
Who's out there?

463
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,332
Joe, is that you?

464
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:20,245
Hello?

465
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,270
Anyone?

466
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,039
- You heard it too though, right?

467
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,699
It wasn't just me?

468
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,293
- Yeah, no, I heard it too.

469
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,113
- I don't like this.

470
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,039
Look, I know it's weird,
but we're safe in here.

471
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,899
Everything's locked up.

472
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
We're fine.

473
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,313
What the fuck?

474
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,410
- Wait.

475
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,083
- God damn it.

476
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,580
Okay, who the fuck is out here?

477
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,133
This is private property
and you're trespassing.

478
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,989
This wasn't funny earlier
and it's not funny now.

479
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,023
You need to leave.

480
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,515
- What do you mean, earlier?

481
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,413
- When I was out there alone.

482
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,793
After you'd left,

483
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
saw that guy,

484
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,690
from the photos on your computer.

485
00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,149
- And?

486
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,969
- And nothing, I yelled at him.

487
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,089
- Well, did they attack you?

488
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,923
Did they hurt you?

489
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:04,756
What happened?

490
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:05,610
- No, no.

491
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,119
He, he creeped me out.

492
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,113
That's all, and I told him to fuck off.

493
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,230
- Why didn't you tell me?

494
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,433
- I didn't want to freak you out.

495
00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:20,195
- I want to go home.

496
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,023
- Sunny, we can't leave.

497
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,291
I mean,

498
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,779
we've both been drinking
and I really don't feel like

499
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,513
driving four hours drunk,
with no cell service.

500
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,933
If we still feel unsettled
tomorrow, we can go back home.

501
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,397
- You promise?

502
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:44,398
- I promise.

503
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,359
Besides.

504
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,483
We're safe in here.

505
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,839
Fuck, even Joe said this place

506
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,803
was built to survive the apocalypse.

507
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,953
There's probably nobody
even out there right now.

508
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:02,533
Motherfuckers.

509
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,293
Listen here you motherfuck-

510
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,996
- Who are they?
- What the fuck?

511
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,609
- Brad get inside.
- What do you want?

512
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,550
- Get inside.

513
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,900
- I'm fucking talking to
you, what do you want?

514
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,780
- Just come in.

515
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,373
- Sunny, get inside, now.

516
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,623
I'm fucking talking to you.

517
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,219
This is private property and
you're fucking trespassing.

518
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,453
I will call the cops.

519
00:37:48,328 --> 00:37:49,161
- Come on.

520
00:37:49,162 --> 00:37:50,393
- I fucking warned you.

521
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:06,111
Get your fucking phone,
we're calling the cops.

522
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:07,112
- Okay.

523
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,310
Nothing.

524
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,530
- Fuck, where's my phone?

525
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,843
Fucking redneck forest,
fucking reception, fuck!

526
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:30,698
- The landline.

527
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,370
No dial tone.

528
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
- Let me see.

529
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,063
Son of a bitch.

530
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,644
- What are we gonna do?

531
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:55,864
- I don't know.

532
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:57,967
I don't know.

533
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:26,089
What the fuck are they doing?

534
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,683
- We've got to do something.

535
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,999
You think they were at
the house the other night?

536
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,723
Do you think they've been watching?

537
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,249
- Must want something, maybe money.

538
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,559
Maybe if I give them cash,
they'll just leave us alone.

539
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,523
- You're not going back out there.

540
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:42,939
- They're not gonna do anything.

541
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,740
I mean, they're just standing there.

542
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,109
If I have to fucking pay them

543
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,509
to leave us the fuck alone, then I will!

544
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,679
I'm not having them
watch us sleep all night.

545
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
- Brad.

546
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,290
No.

547
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:02,676
- The cops are on their fucking way,

548
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:04,703
so you better get the
fuck out of here, now.

549
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,969
Wanna go to jail?

550
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,520
Fine, just fucking stand there.

551
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,046
Look, just tell me what you want,

552
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,633
so you'll leave us the fuck alone.

553
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,150
We're trying to enjoy our
vacation for Christ's sake.

554
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:23,329
You want money?

555
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,249
Your fuckin' PayPal, Venmo cash app.

556
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,279
You want fucking cash?

557
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,709
Just fucking tell me.

558
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,060
Go buy yourself some
fucking camo or some shit.

559
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,073
You want me to fuck you up?

560
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,073
Your last fucking warning.

561
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,208
- Can he get in here?

562
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,041
- I don't know.

563
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,900
We need to lock all the
windows and doors now.

564
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:37,027
Did you get 'em all?

565
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,249
- I don't know.

566
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,083
- You have to be sure,

567
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:42,750
they're moving around
the side of the cabin.

568
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:34,249
- I told you, I told
you not to go out there.

569
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,383
You pissed them off and now look at us.

570
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,479
- It's okay.

571
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,529
We're.

572
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,689
- Fucking okay?

573
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,009
These aren't kids, Brad, these are adults.

574
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,923
These are fucking adults.

575
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,313
- Look, they can't get in here, okay?

576
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,730
Even Joe said this place

577
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,833
is like a prepper fortress or some shit.

578
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,399
In the morning,

579
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,039
they'll either get bored,

580
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,129
or Joe will come and
he'll fix all of this.

581
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,679
- They came at us with knives.

582
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,149
- They didn't attack us though.

583
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,800
- Then they tried to get in here.

584
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,329
- All I'm saying is that
we're safe in here, okay?

585
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,133
We have everything we need.

586
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,479
They can't get in here
and we can wait 'em out.

587
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,799
Okay?

588
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
We're okay.

589
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,086
They cut the power.

590
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:31,087
- No, no.

591
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,110
No no no no.

592
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,433
- Read lights, get the candles.

593
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:17,134
It's okay.

594
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,543
We're okay.

595
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,959
We didn't even need power.

596
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,289
We'll get through this, all right?

597
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,990
We just have to wait it out, okay?

598
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,963
How did they even know we were here?

599
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:46,619
You didn't, you didn't
tell me you made a post.

600
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,709
- It was just one,

601
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,149
I know he said not to, but I just, I,

602
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,803
I thought that it'd be
fine, I just, I'm sorry.

603
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,559
- It's okay, all right?

604
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,869
It's fine, we're still safe in here.

605
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,153
I mean, they can't get in, all right?

606
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,399
- What the fuck do you want?

607
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,100
It's not like you can get in here.

608
00:45:37,788 --> 00:45:39,579
If you don't want money, then what?

609
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,130
Just tell us what you want
and I'll give it to you.

610
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,573
Yes, tell me.

611
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,323
I'll give you anything,
just leave us alone.

612
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:20,951
Anything but that.

613
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:23,119
Anything but fucking that.

614
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:30,888
It's okay, I won't let them get you, okay?

615
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,911
I won't let them.

616
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:32,745
- What are they doing?

617
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:33,829
- I don't know, Sunny.

618
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,969
None of this makes any sense.

619
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,079
- We should have never come out here.

620
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,699
I should have just, I should
have chose somewhere else.

621
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,179
- Don't worry, it's not your fault.

622
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,163
Okay? It's not your fault.

623
00:46:45,818 --> 00:46:47,733
- I just want to go home.

624
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:49,870
- Me too.

625
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:27,943
- It's Joe.

626
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:28,776
- Oh thank fucking God.

627
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:29,809
- He can help us.

628
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,900
- Wait, no no, Sunny, Sunny,
they're still out there.

629
00:47:32,901 --> 00:47:33,951
Wait, just stay here.

630
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,255
Joe?

631
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,753
- He can't fucking hear us.

632
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,587
- He can't fucking hear us.

633
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,937
- I don't know what to do.

634
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:05,958
- Why can't he hear us?

635
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,644
- Should we try and just open up?

636
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,380
- No no, we can't
go out there, we can't.

637
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,699
- Where's he going?

638
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,083
- He's going back,
he's going back to the truck.

639
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,030
- I don't see him.

640
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,430
- I fucking lost him.

641
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,029
- You don't think?

642
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,280
- Do see the guys?

643
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,219
- He's not at his truck.

644
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,620
- He's not over here either.

645
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,246
It's okay, all right?

646
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:14,220
It's gonna be all right.

647
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,079
I'm sure that Joe's getting
them all three out of here.

648
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,429
- This is our only way out, Brad.

649
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,839
- I know but,

650
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,989
we're safe in here.

651
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,009
They can't get in, okay?

652
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,970
- Okay.

653
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:24,570
- I'm sure that Joe's out front.

654
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:27,034
Look, look.

655
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,208
- They fucking killed him.

656
00:51:33,209 --> 00:51:35,042
They're gonna kill us.

657
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,238
They want to kill us.

658
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:39,367
They want to get in here

659
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:41,939
and they want to chop us the fuck up.

660
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,773
- It's okay.

661
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:44,208
It's okay.

662
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:45,042
We need to get this out.

663
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:46,110
I won't let them get you.

664
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,020
We're gonna be all right, okay?

665
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:53,619
I just need some time
to think this through.

666
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,620
Okay?

667
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,213
We need to go, okay?

668
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,953
We need to go, come on.

669
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:30,889
Okay.

670
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,199
We're still safe in here, all right?

671
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,869
They're outside and we're inside.

672
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:36,703
- For how long?

673
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:38,639
We don't have, we don't have any food.

674
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,839
We have no water.

675
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,959
No one's looking for us.

676
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,739
- Someone will come, okay?

677
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,449
Someone has to come, eventually.

678
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,099
- Who?

679
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,069
Hell, the closest police
station is like an hour away.

680
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,919
- When the new renters arrive.

681
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,363
And Joe doesn't show up,

682
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,829
they'll go get the police,
and they'll come find us.

683
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:57,830
I mean,

684
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,409
we fight.

685
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,249
I promise we can get through this.

686
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,250
All right?

687
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,550
We can wait this out.

688
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,883
We can wait them out.

689
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Wait here.

690
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,222
You don't need to do this.

691
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,363
Look, I know you guys were
just trying to scare us.

692
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,683
Maybe it went too far.

693
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,930
I get you.

694
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,863
I understand.

695
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,053
You don't need to do this.

696
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,373
You're not murderers, or killers.

697
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:56,853
You just made a mistake.

698
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,883
Look, just let us sneak out the back,

699
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,549
go through the woods,

700
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,593
into our car.

701
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,470
Just drive.

702
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,233
We won't even go to the police.

703
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,843
Like this never even happened.

704
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,773
There's still time.

705
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,329
You can get out.

706
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,739
Okay?

707
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,963
You haven't done anything wrong, not yet.

708
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,823
Even if we went to the police,
I haven't seen your face.

709
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,220
It's not like we could identify you.

710
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,316
No, no don't please.

711
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:12,863
What are you gonna fucking do?

712
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,620
- Five minutes until what?

713
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
- Till nothing.

714
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:37,243
I'm not gonna do anything,
it's another fucking bluff.

715
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:32,139
- They're gonna burn down the cabin.

716
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,690
They're going to burn us alive.

717
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:35,719
- Sunny, Sunny.

718
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,680
Hey, look at me.

719
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:38,229
Look at me, I have a plan.

720
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,319
Okay?

721
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,489
- There's no way, there's no way.

722
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,523
- Look, we can get out of here.

723
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,863
You can get out of here.

724
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
- I can get out?

725
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,983
What about you, what do you mean?

726
01:00:04,927 --> 01:00:07,669
- I need you to listen,
listen very carefully

727
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,909
to everything I'm about to tell you, okay?

728
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,999
- Brad, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no way, no way.

729
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,609
- Listen, all three masked
men are out front, okay?

730
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,209
I'm gonna distract them.

731
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,409
While I have their attention,

732
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,633
I need you to sneak out the back door.

733
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:26,959
They aren't gonna be expecting it.

734
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,543
- I don't want to, I can't.

735
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,009
We can come up with something else.

736
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:36,010
- No no, it's only 50 yards
from the back door to the car.

737
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,569
You turn and you run into the woods.

738
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,403
Once you get in the car,

739
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,760
you lock the doors and
you floor it to the cops.

740
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,099
This'll work, Sunny.

741
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,839
Okay, this has to work

742
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,810
- I'm not fast enough.

743
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:47,919
- Yes, you are.

744
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,313
You just need to run as
fast as you can, okay?

745
01:00:52,867 --> 01:00:54,689
- I don't know if I can.

746
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:57,163
- No, look, I know you can do this.

747
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,629
I'm sure of it, all right.

748
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,763
You can do this, okay?

749
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,823
This is it, this is our last chance.

750
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,779
- What about, what about you?

751
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,613
What are you gonna do?

752
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:09,249
I can't leave you here.

753
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,083
I'm not leaving you.

754
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,573
- They want you.

755
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:13,453
For some reason they want you, Sunny.

756
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:16,457
So, if you can get away, well then,

757
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:19,909
they'll just let me go.

758
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,079
And if they don't, I can get out.

759
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,999
I can run into the woods and
I can hide and wait for you

760
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,350
to come back with the cops.

761
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,019
I promise, all right?

762
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,909
This will work, all right, but I need you,

763
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:36,009
I need you to run as fast
as you can, all right?

764
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,824
And don't look back.

765
01:01:37,825 --> 01:01:38,996
Promise me.

766
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:39,997
- I promise.

767
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,526
I love you.

768
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:44,777
- I love you, too.

769
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:02,889
You gotta move quickly.

770
01:02:12,669 --> 01:02:15,119
We need to move quickly,
we don't have much time.

771
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,139
Wait until I have all three
of them out front, okay?

772
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,840
Wait until I have their attention,

773
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,170
then you make your move.

774
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,713
Okay, ready?

775
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:35,116
All right you fucking
pussies, I'm coming out.

776
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,010
I want to make a deal.

777
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:46,879
You take me and you let Sunny go.

778
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,213
You let the girl go.

779
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,930
Come and get me, you pussies.

780
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,670
- Sunny, get the knife, the knife.

781
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,800
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

782
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:30,349
- Are you hurt, did they hurt you?

783
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,029
- No, I'm okay, I'm fine.

784
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,279
I think, I'm sorry.

785
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,723
I tried, he was too fast.

786
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,773
I screwed it up, that was our only chance.

787
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,813
- We need a weapon.

788
01:04:55,814 --> 01:04:57,140
We need, we need something.

789
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:21,741
We need something.

790
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,629
Sunny.

791
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:38,630
Get back.

792
01:05:45,026 --> 01:05:46,026
Sunny, run.

793
01:05:48,037 --> 01:05:49,037
Go, now.

794
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,973
East shit, smooth brain.

795
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,017
Get the fuck off me!

796
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,396
No please, no.

797
01:06:27,173 --> 01:06:28,173
God damn it!

798
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,500
- I need help, I need, I
need someone to send help.

799
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,369
There are three masked men

800
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,879
in the cabin we've been staying at.

801
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,069
I just ran into the woods
and I, I don't know where,

802
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,469
where Brad is or I don't know.

803
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:39,893
I don't know if he's okay.

804
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,449
I ran out into the woods
and I'm hiding now.

805
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,049
And I don't know if
they're in here with me,

806
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:53,783
but if you see this
please, please send help.

807
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,391
I don't know if I'm gonna make it out.

808
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,633
So mom, mom and dad.

809
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,960
I love you.

810
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,530
I love you.

811
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,743
- Hey guys, I just wanted to-

812
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,649
Hey guys,

813
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:37,289
I just wanted to make a quick
video and catch up with you.

814
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:39,999
As you can see, I am out of the hospital.

815
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yay.

816
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:44,119
These last few weeks
have been pretty crazy

817
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,979
and I really appreciate your
support and your patience,

818
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,229
but the worst is over

819
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,780
and I'm ready to head back
on the road to recovery.

820
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:56,089
I really can't thank you
enough for sharing my story.

821
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,709
We had over 4 million subscribers,

822
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,513
which is insane and more than
I could ever, ever imagine.

823
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,619
Everything's been going so
fast, I can hardly keep up.

824
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:12,303
I've got interviews with 60
minutes and CNN and Oprah.

825
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:18,479
Anyway, I think I'm going to take a break

826
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,313
from social media for a bit.

827
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,349
I don't know when I'll be back,

828
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,910
but I'm sure you'll seeing more of me.

829
01:17:27,383 --> 01:17:28,633
Thank you guys.

830
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:30,859
Bye.
