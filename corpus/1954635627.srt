1
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,355
Nice!

2
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,855
Looks just like
your mom.

3
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,189
Hmm.

4
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,989
I was thinking more along the
lines of your brother Mike.

5
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,066
Or, it could be you

6
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,492
before your morning coffee.

7
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,327
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

8
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,375
Well, speaking of which,
you want a refill?

9
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,039
Sure, thank you.

10
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,749
What's up, Dad?
Hey.

11
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,455
I'm going to Art's for
a four-on-four hoop sesh.

12
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,085
Mind if I take the car?

13
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,292
No, go ahead.
Yes! Thanks.

14
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,461
Bye, hon.

15
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,091
Oh, hey, Grandma's coming!

16
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,513
Hey, and...

17
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,886
Fill up the tank this time.

18
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,092
Please!

19
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,354
Hey, where's Max?

20
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,558
I thought he was all into
this Halloweeny stuff.

21
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,565
He is. But tonight's his
turn to walk Buster.

22
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh.

23
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,369
Good.

24
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,326
You're such a good dog.

25
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,748
Come on.

26
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,210
Oh, come on, Buster.
You do this every time!

27
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,593
There's nothing to be afraid
of in an old cemetery.

28
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,552
All right.

29
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,056
Maybe it is a little scary.

30
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,810
But look, nothing's
gonna hurt us.

31
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,732
I'm still wearing
the magic ring.

32
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,935
This baby is like
kryptonite to ghouls.

33
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,817
Even Phears, if he
even still exists,

34
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,815
is afraid of this bad boy.

35
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,985
Now, can we get out of here and go home?

36
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,798
That brat, Max Doyle!

37
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:57,006
Still hiding Nicky
and Tara Roland from me.

38
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,136
Well, it won't be for long!

39
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,354
Emma Twitchel,

40
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,816
star of The Moscow Circus.

41
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,989
Come forward!

42
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,289
Forward!

43
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,367
I command it!

44
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,761
Ah!

45
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,440
Emma!

46
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,366
It's nice to see you,

47
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,693
kind of.

48
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,825
Your father and I used to
play together as children.

49
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,121
Ah! Memories.

50
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,994
I have called you,
the great Emma Twitchel,

51
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,625
the biggest star of The
Moscow Circus... Yes.

52
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,081
Back from your sleep...
Yes.

53
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,211
To perform a sacred duty.

54
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,009
Ooh! All right.

55
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,245
You can never find good help.

56
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,421
Now, pay attention.

57
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,381
I am Phears,

58
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,514
the most powerful,
dark spirit in existence.

59
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,724
I command all the spirits laid
to rest in this cemetery.

60
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,058
Even you.

61
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,358
You understand?

62
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,560
Yes!

63
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:37,193
Yes, I very much understand!

64
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,525
Of course you do.
Now, listen carefully.

65
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,700
Several years ago,

66
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,871
a research parapsychologist
by the name of Michael Roland

67
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,698
came across an urn of ashes

68
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,785
which contained the
remnants of, well, me.

69
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,706
<i>It was left there for
him in his laboratory.</i>

70
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:58,043
<i>Thinking that it might be just
another artifact for his collection,</i>

71
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:04,680
<i>he decided he would examine it more
closely later and placed it on a shelf.</i>

72
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,845
<i>He, of course, had no
idea at all of the power</i>

73
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,893
<i>he held in his
two little hands.</i>

74
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:16,650
<i>And through his own carelessness, he
released me back into this world.</i>

75
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,778
<i>It gave me an opportunity
to achieve my ultimate goal,</i>

76
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,451
<i>create an army of the dead.</i>

77
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,745
<i>An army that would do my bidding...</i>

78
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,164
<i>And possess the bodies
of the living</i>

79
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,412
<i>so that I would
ultimately become</i>

80
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,587
<i>the most powerful
force on Earth.</i>

81
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,167
<i>Even among the living.</i>

82
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,840
This plan is no good.

83
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,675
What?

84
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,299
Souls, when they die, they
want to go to afterlife.

85
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,055
They want to see their
parents, their relatives.

86
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,135
They don't want
to linger with you!

87
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,391
What fun is that?

88
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,596
Fun?

89
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,227
We're not talking about fun!

90
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,183
We're talking about
the power to create

91
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,234
a new breed of
ghost among the living.

92
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,150
It's a completely different...
No!

93
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,448
This plan is...
How you say...

94
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,695
Bonkers!

95
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,493
Well, it's not up to you to
prove I'm bonkers, so...

96
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,323
I mean, you have
no choice but to obey me!

97
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,331
And that's what I thought about
Michael and Michelle Roland.

98
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,962
<i>But they discovered my plans.</i>

99
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,167
<i>So, Roland created a ring
and a magic spell</i>

100
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,222
<i>that could fight off my ghosts and
keep me trapped here in this cemetery.</i>

101
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,680
<i>Ugh.</i>

102
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,019
<i>So, I decided to
make them more like us,</i>

103
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,433
<i>ghosts.</i>

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,437
<i>That way, they could never
interfere with my plans again.</i>

105
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,789
<i>The two little Rolands got away
and as long as they were free,</i>

106
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,717
<i>I couldn't get the parents to
tell me where they hid the ring!</i>

107
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,136
<i>When Max Doyle's family
moved into the Roland house</i>

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,012
<i>my cat Mauler was stuck there,
lost without me, his master.</i>

109
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,183
<i>And to top it off,</i>

110
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,933
<i>that snotty little
Max recovered the ring</i>

111
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,765
<i>and now uses it to
protect those kids!</i>

112
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,317
That brat, Max,
foiled my plans before,

113
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,065
but this time
I know his secret.

114
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,567
It's that ring he
wears on his right hand.

115
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,694
I've got to get that
ring off his finger

116
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,367
so I can snatch those kids!

117
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,536
Otherwise, my plan is useless.

118
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,454
What this have to do with Emma?

119
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,247
Oh, don't you get it?

120
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,325
Max Doyle is
keeping your spirit

121
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,752
from moving on to
see your loved ones.

122
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,123
How dare he?

123
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,383
That evil boy!
Exactly.

124
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,508
So, I'm going to give
Max a little present.

125
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,716
Something that will make
him all warm and cuddly.

126
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,925
Ah!

127
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,351
A sweater!

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,552
No, not a sweater.

129
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,808
You!

130
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,437
You're going to climb inside
Max as a berserker ghoul.

131
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,153
Oh, the very sound of it
makes me all tingly.

132
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,196
You're going to
inhabit his body.

133
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,275
Get him into trouble with his
school and with his parents.

134
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,952
And then get that
ring off his finger!

135
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,279
Once he is powerless,

136
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,083
I can snatch the two Roland
brats and we'll both be free!

137
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,458
It's a good plan.

138
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,794
This goes
in the first room.

139
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,794
Aw!
Look how cute he is.

140
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,173
Why, Cammy, I didn't
know you felt that way.

141
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,008
Oh! Oh, uh...

142
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,810
I was talking about the dog.

143
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,600
I knew that!

144
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,807
Hey, Cammy.

145
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,732
I was thinking maybe we could work
on our science midterm together?

146
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,773
Oh...

147
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,233
Yeah, I don't know, Max.

148
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,283
It's just that
I'm so busy with,

149
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,906
you know, the haunted
house and stuff.

150
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,115
But it's on Halloween,
so you should come by.

151
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,665
Um, it will be really scary.

152
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
I'm not scared of anything.

153
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,460
My best friends are ghosts.

154
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,464
I mean, my best friends
are totally into ghosts.

155
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,011
Movies and video
games and stuff.

156
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,679
If it's got ghosts,
they love it.

157
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,006
Me too.

158
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,512
Yeah. So, like I said,
you should come by.

159
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,844
Urn...

160
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,303
I'll show you around.

161
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,263
It's a date.

162
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,266
Just an expression!

163
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,642
Figure of speech!

164
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,272
Nailed it.

165
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,751
Max, where have you been?

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,208
I was just talking to a girl.

167
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,626
Who?

168
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,131
Cammy Cahill.

169
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,633
Whoa! Nice!

170
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,180
Guys, we don't
have time for this.

171
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,215
It's been almost a year
since we lost Mom and Dad.

172
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,311
I think I have a shot with her if
she could just see the real me.

173
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,746
I just want her to
think I'm normal

174
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,890
so I can be her
date for Halloween.

175
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,475
Max, you don't have time to make
people think you're normal.

176
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,853
You need to be helping us
find our parents. Yeah.

177
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,483
I have a life, you know.

178
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,367
Okay, that was rude.
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,737
We'll see you upstairs.

180
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,870
That never gets old.

181
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,167
Come on.

182
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,167
Mom! Dad!

183
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,423
I'm home!

184
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,013
Grandma!

185
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,886
So good to see you. Look
how big you've gotten...

186
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,974
When you walked in I thought you were
an adult in a Max Halloween costume.

187
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,104
Hi, cousin Shelly.

188
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,393
Hey.
Oh...

189
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,978
We can only stay
just a little bit,

190
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,662
but I have enough
time to go like this...

191
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,733
Grandma!
I'm too old for that.

192
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,036
"Never too old to be
pinched" is a Grandma law!

193
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,454
So, how's school?

194
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,448
It's weird.

195
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,158
What do you mean, "weird"?

196
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,038
You seeing anybody?

197
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,044
Seeing?

198
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,793
You mean, like ghosts?

199
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,082
Like a girl.

200
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,417
Like a girl!

201
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,720
Just getting in
the Halloween spirit.

202
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,094
Oh, and, um,
speaking of school,

203
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:22,928
Chester called and apparently the
PE test is on again for tomorrow.

204
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,804
Oh, great!

205
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,561
And I thought Friday would
be an easy day at school.

206
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,735
Oh, come on, Max.
It's no big deal!

207
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,403
Hey, P E is fun.

208
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,448
It helps with your coordination,
your concentration...

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,276
Besides, it builds your
body up for the babes.

210
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,575
Yeah, but it's
the stupid rope-climb test.

211
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,406
I can't even get
started on that thing.

212
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,911
I always fail.

213
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,459
Oh, and gym is graded!

214
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,411
It will totally
dunk my whole GPA.

215
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,506
Well, it will if you go
in with that attitude.

216
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,083
Hey, come on, Son.

217
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,258
You got to think like a winner.

218
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,007
You got to feel like a winner.

219
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,929
You know what? Get in there, stand
at the bottom of that rope,

220
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,131
stare up and say...

221
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,430
When I get to the top I just
hope nobody looks up my shorts.

222
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,264
I was very good-looking
when I was younger.

223
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,691
Things change, darling.
You'll learn.

224
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,104
Look, your brother, Colin,
is really good at that.

225
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,281
So, go ask him
for some pointers.

226
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,608
Colin?

227
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,409
The only pointers he has are the
ones popping up on his forehead.

228
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,828
Max!

229
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,615
He's definitely from
my side of the family.

230
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,667
Okay, why don't you go ask
your brother for some pointers.

231
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,456
Okay, I will.

232
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,082
Bye, Grandma.
Goodbye, sweetie.

233
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,379
- Bye, cuz.
- Yeah.

234
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,460
Happy Halloween.
Try to meet a nice ghoul.

235
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,886
You could bring her home
to your mother.

236
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,634
You know, you would be so
much better <i>as</i> a blonde.

237
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,138
Have you ever
thought about that?

238
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,265
What's up, booger boy?

239
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,521
Wait.

240
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,019
Do you hear that?

241
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,480
Hear what?

242
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,654
That...

243
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,482
That cat meowing.

244
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,317
It sounds like it's coming
from right here in the house.

245
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,247
Ha! You wish. Mom and Dad
would never let you get one.

246
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,449
So, you don't hear anything?

247
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,041
No.

248
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,289
Just this...

249
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,662
Hey! Get off!

250
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,962
Ugh! I have to
wear this.

251
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,086
Listen, here's the situation.

252
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,463
Tomorrow is senior
photo day and I figure

253
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,511
since all the girls in my
class will be in one place,

254
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,759
this is the perfect opportunity

255
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,008
for me to score
some points, you know.

256
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,343
Put on a little show.

257
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,767
Oh. So, you want
to do a magic act?

258
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,598
No, not a whole act,
you doofus.

259
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,433
Just a trick, something big.

260
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,527
Something that will impress Jessica
Rogers and her whole posse.

261
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,842
And you're gonna show it to me.

262
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,980
Right now.

263
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,440
Right now?
Right now.

264
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,029
Uh...

265
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,451
You want me to
show you a trick?

266
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,160
Yeah, I don't know. I'm
kind of rusty right now.

267
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,329
Maybe I better think about it.

268
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,669
Well, you better think fast.

269
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,621
'Cause I'm not leaving
until I see a good one.

270
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,214
Ow! Ow!

271
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,716
Well, you said you wanted
to see something good.

272
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
Is this good enough?

273
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,723
Yeah, this is...
This is great.

274
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,924
How do you do this?

275
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,360
Well, you just stand in front
of your shoes and chant...

276
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,392
Got it.

277
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,602
Works every time.

278
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,021
Cool. Thanks, man.

279
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,367
Oh, hey, hey. Um, I have that rope
climb test tomorrow. Any pointers?

280
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,949
Yeah, urn...
Don't fall.

281
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,331
Okay, come here.

282
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,574
Good news.

283
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,872
I found a solid clue
about your parents.

284
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,875
I went on the town's historical
website and found this...

285
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,426
You know, I hate that they
put "ghost hunter" in quotes.

286
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,136
He was a ghost hunter,
obviously,

287
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,221
or none of this
would be happening.

288
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,174
Okay, so...

289
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,305
Three years ago,

290
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,854
it says your dad was doing research
at the old county courthouse.

291
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,810
Doesn't mention your mom.

292
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,392
Well, that was just
two days before

293
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,149
both Mom and Dad
disappeared for good.

294
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,980
And then we...

295
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,191
Ended up like this.

296
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,659
You know, like, that
courthouse is the last place

297
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,611
Dad was before he disappeared.

298
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,116
We need to search there.

299
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,288
Tonight.
Tonight.

300
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,165
Why tonight?

301
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,493
Well, Halloween is coming

302
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,419
and Phears will have the power to
free his ghost army on that night,

303
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,838
if we don't stop him.

304
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,041
We need to
go there. Now.

305
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,088
I liked Halloween a lot better

306
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
when I thought the ghosts
were make-believe.

307
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,674
Let's go.

308
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,229
Maybe we should forget it. What?

309
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,981
You're not scared, are you?

310
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,156
Why wouldn't I be?

311
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,449
'Cause you're not
a little tiny baby.

312
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,651
What did you say?

313
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,077
I'm gonna open
the little tiny window.

314
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,324
Mmm-hmm.

315
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,215
Okay?
Yeah.

316
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,265
on!

317
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,180
Max!

318
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,891
I'm good.
He's good!

319
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,393
He's good.

320
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,984
Whoa!

321
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
This place is pretty cool.

322
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,033
Cammy did this
with her friends.

323
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,156
She's so talented.

324
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,575
Of course she is.

325
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,744
Not now!

326
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,351
Okay, I'm a ghost and
this is some scary stuff.

327
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,060
if I didn't have my
ring to protect me,

328
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,316
I don't think I would
be able to do this.

329
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,740
Seems Cammy has a thing for
freaks and weirdoes, Max.

330
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,783
Maybe you do stand a chance!

331
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,320
Very funny.

332
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,522
Guys, let's start over there.

333
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,542
Of course.

334
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,961
Start in the scariest place.

335
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,333
Makes perfect sense.

336
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,593
Guys?

337
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,340
Note to self, not a ghost.

338
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,018
How did people get anything
done before computers?

339
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,192
If I could just use a search function,
this would take two seconds.

340
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,236
We're wasting time, we should
be looking somewhere else.

341
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,064
Tara, it's okay. We're
doing the best we can.

342
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,364
Don't beat yourself up.

343
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,987
We'll find something.

344
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,785
What if we don't?

345
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,659
Uh, Max?
A little help, please.

346
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,864
Go.

347
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,044
 Nick?

348
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,589
Oh, yes, that's it! It probably has
everything we need to know about Dad.

349
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,790
Get it down!

350
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,340
I got it.

351
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,106
Let's get out of here and check
this stuff out at my house.

352
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,178
Yes!

353
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,353
Hey, Max.

354
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,103
Cammy?

355
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,029
What
are you doing here?

356
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,610
I was just...

357
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,193
I wanted to check out
your haunted house.

358
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,904
But you couldn't
wait till it was open?

359
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,956
It's scarier this way.

360
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,499
I love a good scare.

361
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,209
So, what's in the box?

362
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,545
Oh, just some stuff for
a project I'm working on.

363
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,047
What are you doing here?

364
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,550
Oh, I just came back
because I left my phone.

365
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,973
You know, it's pretty
weird that you're here.

366
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,892
Most people would be really
scared here alone at night.

367
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,265
Not me.

368
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,470
Nothing scares me.

369
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,566
Except for wood rot.

370
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,816
Which those cross-beams
are full of.

371
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,869
With their dampness
and moisture.

372
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,069
You're, uh...

373
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,497
You're a pretty
interesting guy there, Max.

374
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,117
Can I take that
as a compliment?

375
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,043
If you want.

376
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,666
I'll see you tomorrow.

377
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,008
Let's see.

378
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,556
Okay, this was
everything he was working on.

379
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,135
There's so much I don't
even know where to start.

380
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,846
You'll have to
start without me.

381
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,978
I'm exhausted.
I have to get some sleep.

382
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,897
I have that stupid rope-climbing
test tomorrow in PE.

383
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,570
If I flunk this, I'll have
after-school PE for a month!

384
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,481
Wait, I have an idea.

385
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,865
What if Nicky and I show up in gym class
tomorrow and help you up the rope?

386
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,111
What?

387
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,741
All you have to do is make it look like
you're climbing and we'll fly you up.

388
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,952
I mean, it's the least
we could do for you.

389
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,749
You know,

390
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,876
that would work.

391
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,122
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,010
And not only will I pass, but Cammy
Cahill will be totally stoked.

393
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,838
Oh, no, maybe this
was a bad idea.

394
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,515
Anything for a friend, Max.

395
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,974
Whoo!
Whoo!

396
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,523
Hey, Cammy.

397
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,474
Great seeing you last night.

398
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,197
Oh, um...

399
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,074
Yeah, that...

400
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,198
That was pretty random, huh'?

401
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,164
Uh...
Just wondering if...

402
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,583
Maybe you wanna
come over tonight

403
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,127
and maybe do some extra
credit for science class?

404
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,874
Um...

405
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,043
Urn...

406
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,759
You love him.

407
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,635
I...

408
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,722
The thing is tonight, Max,
I'm just so busy, um...

409
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,641
Plus my science grades
are pretty good.

410
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,889
Oh.

411
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,140
Okay.

412
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,196
Can't wait for our
haunted house date.

413
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,313
Hmm?

414
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,481
Hey, Max!

415
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,729
Look what we got!

416
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,481
<i>The Nocturnal
and Dawn of Angels.</i>

417
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,320
Is that awesome?
Yeah, it is!

418
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,984
And you're the first
guy we want to play with.

419
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,152
Yeah, you are!

420
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,323
Uh, guys?

421
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,571
It's full HD.

422
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,742
1080p.
Guys?

423
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,320
Multi-player
with connectivity!

424
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,163
Up to <i>32</i> outside
challenge games!

425
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,333
With our dedicated T3
line, we'll be flying tonight.

426
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,580
Yeah, baby!
Guys! No...

427
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,081
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
You guys have fun tonight.

428
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,754
No. No. No, wait!
Please, wait.

429
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,172
Or maybe we can do it tomorrow?

430
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We know,

431
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,669
you want to be the first guy to
open the box and unlock the cheats.

432
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,129
Okay. Go ahead.

433
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,176
Go ahead. Go ahead! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go ahead!

434
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,428
Come on, man! Thirty-two
outside challenge games?

435
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,707
Why didn't you tell me before?

436
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,770
Okay, meet me at my house tonight.
We are gonna beat this game!

437
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:54,575
Bam! All right see you boys after school.
Okay? We'll see you later, dude.

438
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,022
It's gonna be awesome!

439
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,982
<i>Fall in!</i>

440
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,110
All right, listen up!

441
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,529
If any of you deadbeats
expects to <i>pass</i> my class,

442
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,206
you're gonna have
to get past Lester.

443
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,200
Uh, Lester?

444
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,375
Yeah, Lester.

445
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,207
The rope.

446
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,375
I'm on a first-name basis
with all of my apparati.

447
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,131
Side horse is Jimmy.

448
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,212
Medicine ball is Eric.

449
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,385
And the high bar is Tiffany.

450
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:26,723
Good times.

451
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,891
Why?

452
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,227
Why do you name all
your gym equipment?

453
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,639
I have my reasons.

454
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,199
All right,
the men are up first.

455
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,646
Atherton! Stevens!

456
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,068
Doyle!

457
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,485
Brinkman, Freeman,
Hardy, Willis!

458
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,986
Move it. Move it. Move it!
Move it. Move it!

459
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,660
Are you waiting for a printed
invitation, Atherton?

460
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,987
Move it!

461
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,923
Could've been better.

462
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,170
Pass!

463
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,266
Stevens, come on.
Let's go.

464
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,103
Ring my bell, Stevens.
Ring my bell.

465
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,360
You make it look easy,
my friend.

466
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,565
<i>Pass.</i>

467
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,785
Doyle.

468
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,451
All right, Doyle.
Show me what you got.

469
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,795
Glad you're here.

470
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,293
I'm so glad I'm here too!

471
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,291
To watch you fail!

472
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,134
So, how do you want to do this?

473
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,490
Hand over hand! What do you
mean, "How you want to do it?"

474
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,715
Nicky, you grab him
under his arms.

475
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,049
Oh, uh...

476
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,634
No way, I'm ticklish!

477
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,311
What's being ticklish got to
do with climbing a rope'?

478
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,146
Maybe I should grab
him by his gym shorts.

479
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,473
What are you trying to do?

480
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,808
Give me a wedgie?

481
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,484
First of all,
that's disgusting.

482
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,199
Second, I don't want
to give you a wedgie.

483
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,485
I grab his arms and
you push his butt.

484
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,907
No girl is pushing my butt.

485
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,326
Have you lost what is
left of your tiny mind?

486
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,493
Get up the rope!

487
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,602
Doyle!

488
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,520
I have other students waiting!

489
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,617
Doyle, get down here!

490
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,362
Okay, Max, let's go down now.

491
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,114
Oh, no, wait,
just a little bit longer.

492
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,540
Cammy's digging it.

493
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,343
Okay, Max, this is
just getting ridiculous.

494
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,370
You're trying to
impress her with a lie.

495
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,626
"Work with what you've
got," I always say.

496
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,958
You know what? I'm not
gonna be a part of this.

497
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,543
Tara! Tara!
Tara!

498
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,963
Oh!

499
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,602
Get off me.

500
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,559
Get off me!

501
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,980
- Get off me.
- Max.

502
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,478
It's just my neck.
You okay?

503
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,607
That was so cool,
but are you okay, Max?

504
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,445
Is Max okay? Oh...

505
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,949
He just dropped from the ceiling
and used me like an airbag

506
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,784
and you want to
know if Max is okay?

507
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,871
I just had to get up
the rope to <i>pass,</i> right?

508
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,285
Yeah. So?

509
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,787
Then I'm way more than okay.

510
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,384
Once this class picture

511
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,756
goes into the yearbook,

512
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,439
it's gonna haunt you
forever, all right?

513
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,424
So, let's see some big
smiles on those faces.

514
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,098
Hey, dweeb.

515
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,604
I can't deal with this anymore!
This is ridiculous.

516
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,775
I've had it! I've had
it with you people!

517
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,943
This is too good.

518
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,738
Hey, Doyle, your brother's almost
as big a loser <i>as</i> you are.

519
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,160
Up top!

520
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,825
Oh, yeah'?
Yeah.

521
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,163
Excuse me...

522
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,954
Mr. Doyle,
please sit down.

523
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,166
Well, check this out.

524
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,645
Not you, Mr. Doyle.
You...

525
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,169
Mr. Doyles!

526
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,384
Oh, man.

527
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,148
"Oh, what a dweeb I am."

528
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,314
"Oh, what a dweeb I am."

529
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,362
Wow!

530
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,272
You're a dweeb, all right.

531
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,700
A much bigger one
than your brother.

532
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,984
Boom!

533
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,032
Max!

534
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,614
Mr. Doyle!

535
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,791
Max!
Mr. doyle!

536
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,243
Mr. Doyle!

537
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,545
Okay, um...
I think we're done here.

538
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,372
We are not done yet!

539
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,131
So, Max, how'd you do
on the dreaded rope test?

540
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,053
Uh...

541
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,802
Well, guess you could say
it ended with a big bang.

542
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,011
<i>But</i> I <i>passed.</i>

543
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,226
There you go;
Atta boy!

544
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,724
Proud of you!

545
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,743
Aren't you proud of
your brother, Colin?

546
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,027
I don't know if
I'd say "proud."

547
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,488
And Colin, how was
the photo shoot?

548
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,985
Did everyone enjoy it?

549
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,157
Yeah.

550
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,530
A little too much.

551
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,621
Well, guess it was a memorable
day for both you boys, huh?

552
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,938
Well, the day is not over yet is it, Dad?

553
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,669
Is that a cat?

554
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,254
Wait.

555
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,425
You can hear that?

556
00:29:57,574 --> 00:29:58,814
Well, of course we can hear it.

557
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,887
It sounds like it's coming
from one of your rooms.

558
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,844
Oh, come on, you guys didn't bring
a cat in the house, did you?

559
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,645
I don't know
anything about a cat.

560
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,098
Uh, me neither.

561
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,852
Boys!

562
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,983
You know how allergic I am.

563
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,066
Whoa, whoa, Mom, don't look at me, okay?
I hate cats, you know that.

564
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,568
It's probably, monkey-face
Max, who loves cats.

565
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,114
You know, just a couple
of days ago, Max said

566
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,616
that he thought he heard
a cat in his bedroom.

567
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,878
Well, I better not find a cat
when I go up there, Max!

568
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,548
Or you're gonna be grounded
and that includes Halloween.

569
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,257
Mom, trust me, there is
no cat in the house.

570
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,389
Max, how could you?

571
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,974
Mom, please,
lemme help you.

572
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,483
Max!

573
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,815
Little warning, please?

574
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,532
Sorry, man,
we're just so excited.

575
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,777
Look at this. We found a
book of spells. Yeah.

576
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,246
Can any of them make an
older brother disappear?

577
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,120
As an older brother
I certainly hope not.

578
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,453
Uh, speaking of which,
where is your family?

579
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,796
They all went upstairs. They think
there's a cat in the house.

580
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,381
There is a cat in the house.

581
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,504
Yeah.
It's Mauler.

582
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,922
- Mauler?
- Yeah.

583
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,298
Yes, Phears' cat.

584
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,640
I mean, he got stuck here when you
condemned Phears back to the cemetery.

585
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,109
Man, he'll do anything for that cat.
It's his pride and joy.

586
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,351
Yeah.

587
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,142
Great. A ghost cat.

588
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,017
Next I'll be haunted by the spirit of
the goldfish I flushed when I was four.

589
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,064
Max. Now!

590
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,402
Coming.

591
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,198
Anyway, if everyone can hear him,
I don't think that's Mauler.

592
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,411
Let's go.

593
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,662
I'm warning you, Max. You'd
better be telling us the truth.

594
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,041
Dad, I told you. I don't
have a real cat up here.

595
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,006
Whoa!
Put that...

596
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,628
Geez.

597
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,129
Guys, it's just Charlie
from next door.

598
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:04,181
Keep it away from me, because I'm gonna
have hives for a week.

599
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,725
See, Dad, told you nerdy
boy had a cat up here.

600
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,219
I had nothing to do with it.

601
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,517
Oh, right. Max, then how did
he get into the dresser then?

602
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,224
It was Colin.

603
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,147
He walked in, went straight to
the dresser... Oh, stop it!

604
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,111
Because he knew the cat was in there.
Max, stop, stop it!

605
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,780
How obvious could he get?
Hey!

606
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,942
You wanna disobey us?
Fine, you're grounded.

607
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,368
Congratulations.

608
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,863
That means you come straight home
from school right into this room.

609
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,244
And that includes Halloween.
Let's go, honey.

610
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,749
And no computer.

611
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,463
And that's what you get for trying to
make me look stupid in front of my class.

612
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,926
Trying?

613
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,286
I've already told you
where the Doyles' house is.

614
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,078
Max's room is upstairs.
First door on the right.

615
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,789
Emma, Emma.

616
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,000
I can%leave the
graveyard in this form.

617
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,916
So it's very important that you
get this all correct. All right'?

618
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,592
Now when you find the brat,

619
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,921
you'll take him over
and control his every move.

620
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,098
Make his life
a living nightmare

621
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,767
until he has no choice
but to give up that ring.

622
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,312
Then he'll be powerless
to protect Tara and Nicky.

623
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,773
And I can capture
them and use them

624
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,567
to force their father
to give me what I need

625
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:43,773
to complete my plan to rule the
realm of the living and the dead.

626
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,695
Okay, that's right.
I do this.

627
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,493
But only for a little while.
I get sleepy.

628
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,621
Emma, you can nap yourself
silly, when this is over.

629
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,624
But now our little plan is about to begin.
So wake up.

630
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,459
Go ahead.

631
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,381
Oh, and...
Emma! Emma!

632
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,968
Don't forget my cat, please.

633
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,670
Morn, Dad, about that cat.

634
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,844
Hey, I'm surprised your mother
got any sleep at all last night,

635
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,040
after that stunt you pulled.

636
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,058
And by the way, she got to her
allergy medication just in time.

637
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,813
I'm sorry you had to go
through any of that, Mom.

638
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,729
But I didn't bring that cat in here.
Oh, just save it, Max.

639
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,935
You're so grounded, young man.

640
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,776
But Mom, Halloween's
the best night of the year.

641
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,698
You heard me.

642
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,577
Oh, and did you clean up the mess
that cat made in Colin's room?

643
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,573
Not only did I clean it,
Colin took my room

644
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,498
and made me sleep in his
because of the smell.

645
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,250
This behavior is not like you.

646
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:25,541
And for your information, your brother is
a great... Hey. Great role model for you.

647
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,719
He's disciplined.
He always applies himself.

648
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,758
And what is with the pajamas?

649
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,174
Have you been eating a lot
of cheese or something?

650
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,810
Here, have some breakfast.

651
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,765
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

652
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,563
What are you doing?

653
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,898
We don't play games
at the table.

654
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,396
Come on, here.

655
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,160
- Colin!
- Colin!

656
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,629
Whoa!

657
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,886
Oh!
Oh! Oh!

658
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,851
No, not on my couch.
Get off my couch.

659
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,026
Colin!

660
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,447
This isn't funny, Colin.
What are you doing?

661
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No!

662
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,574
WOW!

663
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,573
Whoa, but that was
really good though.

664
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,761
Oh!
Whoa! Whoa!

665
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,774
Aah!

666
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,828
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

667
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,020
- Do what?
- I don't know!

668
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,795
Get something. Get...

669
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,008
Call 9-1-1?

670
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,299
And say what?

671
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,598
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends.

672
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,563
Should they return?
That all depends.

673
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,077
Son?

674
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,332
Colin, honey.

675
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,664
What's wrong with you?

676
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,762
It's like Cirque
<i>du</i> Sole-i! in here.

677
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,709
What are you talking about?

678
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,387
What are we talking about?
Take a look at the house.

679
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,426
Is that syrup?

680
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,355
Can I have some pancakes?

681
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,582
Ah! There you are.

682
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,830
Did you get my cat?

683
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,128
It's exhausting being berserk.

684
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,374
I dead tired.

685
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,667
Pardon pun... Pardon pun...
It's a fine pun.

686
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,471
So did it work? Did you get the
ring off that brat's finger?

687
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,846
I go inside brat.
I get him to go crazy.

688
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,598
Good. Then I make him
tear up kitchen.

689
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,604
Cause his parents much much worry.
Good, good.

690
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,857
Then other boy use ring, say
chant and scare me away.

691
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,105
What? What other boy?

692
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,234
There's only one boy who has the ring and
knows that chant and that's Max Doyle.

693
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:24,037
Well, this boy is
stupid-looking with red hair.

694
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,955
It's not Max.

695
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,493
It's his worthless,
goof brother Colin.

696
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,748
You weren't even
in the right victim.

697
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,953
Hey. hey. hey, hey!

698
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,128
What do you want from me?

699
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,251
I... No.
I don't know...

700
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,338
I go into first bedroom
on the right for you.

701
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,627
You tell me to haunt that goof.

702
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,464
Get your goof room straight.

703
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,180
Well, you'll have to try again.

704
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,224
Today at that brat's school.

705
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,229
I need to get that ring off his finger.
Halloween is coming.

706
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,437
My army of ghosts awaits
my command to arise

707
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,066
and take over
the bodies of the living.

708
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,614
There's no time to lose.

709
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:03,239
No, it's time to snooze.

710
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,739
I always thought dying
would make things easier.

711
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,792
But that's not how it works.

712
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:18,383
So why, then, almost four centuries
after it was hypothesized,

713
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,131
is Newton's law of
gravity disproven?

714
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,755
Miss Cahill.

715
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,647
Because Newton's theory
only applied to the

716
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:29,203
gravitational force field
up to 97,000 feet.

717
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,851
Past that point, when gravity
is incrementally disbursed,

718
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,394
the old law doesn't stand up.

719
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,941
Correct.

720
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,236
And who can tell me why
that's important to NASA?

721
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,483
Mr. Doyle.

722
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,657
Because as gravity decreases,
inertia increases,

723
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,986
affecting weight disbursement,
fuel efficiency and speed

724
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,537
and thrust guidelines.

725
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,828
Excellent. Both of you should
put in for extra credit.

726
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,620
Now moving on to water
oxidation <i>as</i> energy...

727
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,132
Hey, maybe since the midterm
assignment is a team

728
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,925
we could partner up?

729
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,842
I'd be extremely
okay with that.

730
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,824
Is present, there will be an
electrical spark that happens.

731
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,116
Hydrogen will appear at the...

732
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,073
Ah!
And oxygen will...

733
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,120
This is the right goof.

734
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,166
Okay, I go now.

735
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:41,049
Then the electrode will begin to spark
and cause a chemical reaction...

736
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,847
Mr. Doyle!

737
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,054
What are you doing?

738
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,983
Mr. Doyle, that will
be quite enough.

739
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,039
Mr. Doyle!

740
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,583
Now I use
water oxidation as energy.

741
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,515
Excuse you.

742
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,858
Mr. Doyle, what do
you think you're doing?

743
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,186
That is a great abuse
of school property.

744
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,402
Mr. Doyle, please,
just stop...

745
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,784
<i>Yea-haw.!</i>

746
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,830
Get down from there.

747
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:05,543
Mr. Willis, Mr. Freeman, please,
restrain Mr. Doyle immediately.

748
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:08,920
Excuse you!

749
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,133
Did you not take
your medication today?

750
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,361
Oh, and now you're
asleep, that's great.

751
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,723
Max, are you okay?

752
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,476
I don't know what that little
stunt was supposed to prove,

753
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,231
but you can get straight
to the Principal's office

754
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,779
where I'm going to recommend
detention for a month.

755
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,824
But I don't even
know what I did.

756
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,542
Ms. Cahill,
get me a towel.

757
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,347
Oh, man, this is bad.

758
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,179
Really bad.

759
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,058
Max, we went looking
for you in class.

760
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,515
Look, you guys,
I'm in big trouble.

761
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,021
Phears sent
this spirit or ghost

762
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,943
or whatever it is
to possess me.

763
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,318
And it makes me act all crazy
and gets me in trouble.

764
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,448
I have no control over it.

765
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,785
You mean it's like
in you right now'?

766
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,533
I guess.

767
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,034
Lemme check it out.
Yeah.

768
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,373
Whoa!

769
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,717
Uh, yep, there is
someone inside you.

770
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,592
It's a woman.

771
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,515
And she's sleeping.

772
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,101
Great.

773
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,845
Maybe she's sleeping now,

774
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,853
but when she wakes up, I go berserk and
there's nothing I can do about it.

775
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,775
This is gonna get me expelled.

776
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,942
Worse, it's gonna make me
look crazy in front of Cammy.

777
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,528
Maybe Phears put her
into you to get to us.

778
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,780
How does that work?

779
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,278
How do I know?

780
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,904
But if this keeps up...

781
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,748
Sit down.

782
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,293
So, Mr. Doyle,

783
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,127
you're aware that your actions
today not only disrupted class,

784
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,755
but also caused considerable
monetary damage to this school.

785
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,803
Yes, ma'am.

786
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,056
And you do understand that you'll
have to pay the school back

787
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,388
with your own time and money.

788
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,724
Tell her it wasn't your fault.

789
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,978
I'm not doing that.

790
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,706
What do you mean
you're not doing it?

791
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,775
You'll do what you're told.

792
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,114
Man, she's got
bad breath.

793
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,904
Now, Mr. Doyle.

794
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,907
If it weren't for that fact
that you have a high GPA,

795
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,786
and your mother is head of the
PTA and a good friend of mine,

796
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,456
I'd put you on
permanent suspension.

797
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,957
As it is, I'll have to think
of a proper punishment.

798
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,178
Hmm.

799
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,521
What was that?

800
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,770
I didn't do anything.

801
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,941
I'm just sitting here.

802
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,521
So you think school is just
one big play yard, huh'?

803
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,822
You wanna play?
Oh, you're gonna play.

804
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,483
Max, how long are you
gonna be doing this?

805
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,034
We need to get back
to my father's journal.

806
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,405
Can't you tell that coach lady you have
more important things to be doing?

807
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,497
Oh. Sure, Tara.

808
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,076
I'll just tell her that I don't
have time for her punishment.

809
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,248
I'm sure she won't give me
more laps or push-ups

810
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,080
or mountain climbers
or anything.

811
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,421
Okay, great.

812
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,008
I guess sarcasm doesn't
exist in the afterlife.

813
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,216
You guys have done nothing
but get me in trouble.

814
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,933
Could you just go away?

815
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,764
Please, leave me alone.

816
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,955
Hey, Max, how are you?

817
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,582
Pretty crazy
in science class, huh?

818
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,256
Yeah. Don't know
what got into me.

819
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,917
No, it was interesting.

820
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,095
Interesting'? That's a
good thing, right'?

821
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,719
So you play soccer now?

822
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,303
Yeah, just gettin'
some laps in.

823
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,601
Keeping things interesting.

824
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,813
Doyle!

825
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,261
Doyle, nobody told you
you could slack off.

826
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,014
When you're on this field,
your butt is mine. Let's go.

827
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,981
Can't I just... Can't I just...
Take a two minute break?

828
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,938
The next time you
decide to goof off in class

829
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,021
or attack the Principal
or squash me like a bug,

830
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,030
it's gonna get even worse.

831
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,279
Carlyle!

832
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,036
Stand in front of him
and block the pass. Wake up!

833
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,577
All right, now get in there
and play some soccer.

834
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,208
Soccer? I am loving soccer.

835
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,833
You're a little freak,
is what you are.

836
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,056
Coach Freeley, is that Max out there?
Yeah.

837
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,149
Did you know about this?

838
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,851
No.

839
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:41,900
Whoa!

840
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,052
Max!

841
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,566
Okay, I'll sleep now.

842
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,857
- What happened?
- Here.

843
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,609
Hey, let's get him.
Help him up.

844
00:50:23,974 --> 00:50:25,414
Get some help over here.
Pick him up.

845
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,800
Grab him tight.
Get him, all right.

846
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,697
Yeah, stand up.
Come here.

847
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,615
Are you all right?

848
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,791
Max. Max. Why didn't you tell
me you were a soccer star?

849
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,284
Huh?

850
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,625
It's you, Max.

851
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,921
You can lead us to victory in
tomorrow's championship game.

852
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,084
You can finally
bring me... Us...

853
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,461
Can bring us that city-wide
championship trophy.

854
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,588
Max, you're my secret weapon.

855
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,475
Well, okay, I guess.

856
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,306
Okay, you guess.

857
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,597
Oh, my plum.

858
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,845
I just wanna pinch your
cheeks but you're so sweaty.

859
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,726
The rest of you, calisthenics!

860
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,275
Hey, Max, you dropped this.

861
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,953
My ring. Oh, thank God you found it or
there would have been serious trouble.

862
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:18,334
So, wow... I mean, that was really
something. I'm kind of surprised.

863
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,415
Not as much as I am.

864
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,502
Remember when you
asked me out on Halloween?

865
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,416
Well, I was thinking
maybe tonight you could

866
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,342
meet me at the courthouse
at 8:00.

867
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,676
For the big grand opening.

868
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:33,178
I could show you around and
give you a private tour. Cool?

869
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,013
Cooler than cool.

870
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,932
Okay.

871
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,377
Halloween.

872
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,967
All Hallows' Eve.

873
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:15,555
Tonight, my powers
finally return to me,

874
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,224
and I'll be stronger than ever.

875
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:26,398
Soon, in just a matter
of a few short hours,

876
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,316
I will be free

877
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:34,402
to unleash my undead army
from their terrible prison.

878
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,993
And nothing will stop me

879
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:42,077
from ruling
everything on Earth.

880
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,580
Dead or alive.

881
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,277
Amateurs.

882
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,440
- Thank you.
- Happy Halloween.

883
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,695
Happy Halloween.

884
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,617
Max, there you are.

885
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,453
Finally, I really need you on door duty.
Where've you been?

886
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,117
I was just playing
soccer after school.

887
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,449
Soccer?

888
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,788
Son, considering how much
trouble you're in,

889
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,791
don't lie to me about
suddenly liking sports, okay?

890
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,962
Don't get my hopes up.

891
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,210
But I was.
Oh, here they come.

892
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,383
Would you get upstairs,
get in costume okay?

893
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,210
Come down and work
the door? Please.

894
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,966
I love you, Dad.
Thank you!

895
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,964
Trick or treat?
Trick or treat?

896
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,140
Max, we got some
exciting news for you.

897
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,888
Wow.

898
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,691
This is turning out to
be the best day ever.

899
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,950
What've you got? We took a
look at that video you shot

900
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,229
of Colin's freak-out this morning.
Let me show you.

901
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,151
Watch.

902
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,240
Look at this guy.

903
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,571
All right, stop it.

904
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,998
All right, play that back.
Okay, listen.

905
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,999
Emma“

906
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,667
Twitchel?
Yes.

907
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,341
We think that's her name and we
think we can talk her out of you.

908
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,755
Seriously?
Yeah.

909
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,431
Oh, that would be awesome.
I was totally worried

910
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,975
that she would ruin my date
with Cammy tonight.

911
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,102
Date with Cammy.

912
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,771
Tara, relax.

913
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,598
Look, we talked about this.

914
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,935
Emma will most likely
respond to a female voice.

915
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,646
You have to do this.
Max, lay down.

916
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,361
Okay.

917
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,037
Okay,

918
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,160
Ready?
Yeah.

919
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,869
Emma, Emma.

920
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,125
Wake up, Emma.

921
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,880
Emma, wake up.

922
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,045
Come on, Emma.

923
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,797
Okay, it's okay.

924
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,048
Stay with us, Max.

925
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,219
Emma, listen to me.

926
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,387
We almost got it.

927
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,382
You can do it,
Emma, come on.

928
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,725
Come on, Emma, wake up.

929
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,683
Where am I?

930
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,147
Why am I not in goof boy?

931
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,233
Excuse me?

932
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,402
Because we set you free.

933
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,150
And that made you young again.

934
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,328
And we're setting Max free too.

935
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,993
Max is done with ghosts.

936
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,995
We're all gonna
leave him alone now.

937
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,496
Yeah, Max.

938
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,708
We know you're sick of us, so...
We're gonna go away,

939
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,710
forever.

940
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,584
What? Nicky, Tara...

941
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,590
Nicky? Tara?

942
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,425
I know these names.

943
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,256
I hear goof boy talk about you.

944
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,594
He says he will always help you,
because you are his friends.

945
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,099
No matter what.

946
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,269
You said that?
Of course.

947
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,942
It might get
frustrating at times,

948
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,111
but I'll never
give up on you guys.

949
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,772
You're my friends.

950
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,065
Oh, Max, thank you.

951
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,696
Aw, Max.

952
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,200
Okay. Okay, Nicky.

953
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,242
That's what I'm talking about.

954
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,452
You are good, goof boy.

955
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,541
Not evil.

956
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,872
Evil?

957
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,457
Why would you say that? Yeah.

958
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:17,875
Phears.

959
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,210
Phears tells me that goof...

960
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,970
I mean... That Max

961
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,092
was keeping me from moving
on to see my loved ones.

962
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,724
Max, I'm so sorry, I...

963
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,143
I should not have
trusted Phears.

964
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,808
He is a most wicked ghoul.

965
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,110
Yeah. I won't argue
with you on that one.

966
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,487
Max!

967
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,575
For the love of Pete, would you
suit up and get downstairs

968
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,821
and work the door?

969
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:48,327
Those kids, they're like a marauding
horde of candy-crazed goons.

970
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,125
They're relentless.

971
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,747
He has berserker in him too?

972
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,293
He was born that way.

973
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,928
So your family was
Russian circus acrobats?

974
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:14,857
Oh, yes. They were the most renowned
performers in all of the land.

975
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,273
We were on a tour of America
for our first time,

976
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:22,107
and our bus crashed outside
the town, many years ago.

977
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,816
We were all buried here.

978
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,697
Trick or treat?

979
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,132
Whoa! Cool trick.

980
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,880
How did you do that?

981
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,002
Oh, a good magician
never tells.

982
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,387
Thank you.
Happy Halloween.

983
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,676
Now, because of Phears' dark
magic, I cannot be with my family.

984
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,803
Just like us.

985
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,309
No.

986
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,233
No, you are not like me.

987
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,857
But we can't see our family
because of Phears either.

988
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,071
No, when I say that
you are not like me,

989
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,320
it's because you are not dead.

990
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,821
But we're ghosts.

991
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,326
Yeah.

992
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,158
Yeah.
Not real ones.

993
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,501
Phears made you like this.

994
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,919
And your parents too.

995
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,756
You're ghosts, but not dead.

996
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,251
Prisoners.

997
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,254
Your parents are still alive.

998
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,261
Nicky.

999
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,391
Wait, if our parents are prisoners,
do you know where they are?

1000
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,939
No, only Phears knows this.

1001
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,778
I do not know. I can only feel that
they are alive, like I feel you,

1002
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,859
but I do not know
where they are.

1003
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,908
Then do you know why Phears
wants Nicky and Tara so badly?

1004
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,452
Because they are Rolands,
Roland blood.

1005
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,780
He must capture all the Rolands

1006
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,123
and find the antidote
your father created

1007
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,293
before he can move
forward with his plan

1008
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,292
and unleash his undead army
into living bodies.

1009
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,632
Maybe you can find them.
Warn them.

1010
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,043
Tell them we're okay,
where we are...

1011
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,719
How we love them.
Please.

1012
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,468
I would love to,
but I do not know how.

1013
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,976
I think I found a spell
that could help.

1014
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,304
Right there.

1015
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,645
What will it do?
Well, it says,

1016
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,725
we have to go to the cemetery
and return you to your grave

1017
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,899
and say this spell.

1018
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,067
Well, we must go tonight.

1019
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,269
Go where?

1020
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,484
To the cemetery.
To the cemetery.

1021
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,990
Oh, no, no, this is
a really bad idea.

1022
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,407
It's Halloween and this is the night
where Phears will be at his strongest.

1023
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,081
Max, all magic is at its
strongest tonight, even yours.

1024
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,328
Yes.

1025
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,662
And if we go tonight maybe
I can be with my family again.

1026
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,502
Please Max, come on.
We have to help her.

1027
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,671
And if we have another
ghost by our side,

1028
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,840
we can probably find
Mom and Dad quicker.

1029
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,421
Come on, man.
You have to do it.

1030
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:52,757
Remember what you
said about friends.

1031
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,512
No matter what...

1032
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,844
Trick or treat?

1033
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,183
Urn...

1034
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,689
Just help yourself
to the candy.

1035
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,188
I'm still grounded, but
let me see what I can do.

1036
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,449
Ugh.

1037
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,119
Colin's back up to his
cat tricks again. Great.

1038
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,947
Hey, hey, hey,
what're you doing in here?

1039
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,533
No one is manning the candy bowl.
We're gonna get tricked.

1040
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,870
Mom, you look great.

1041
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,046
Flattery will get you nowhere.

1042
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,129
But thanks.

1043
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,382
Mauler.

1044
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,971
What did you call me?

1045
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,218
Mauler.

1046
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,514
Mauler?

1047
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,726
I like it.

1048
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,720
But flattery will
get you nowhere.

1049
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,226
I'm telling you,
that cat... Oh, no.

1050
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:49,067
What's up? Wow! Mom, you look amazing.
What's up, Dad?

1051
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,732
Max, shouldn't you be getting
to that special soccer practice

1052
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,738
that Coach Freeley
wants you at?

1053
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,740
What? What're you talking about?
He's not part of a team.

1054
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,158
Well, he is now.

1055
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,080
Max kicked butt
at practice today.

1056
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,328
He's their star player.

1057
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,830
Freeley was freaking out.
And get this.

1058
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,334
Tomorrow, he's starting at
the game against Dylan High.

1059
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,505
So, he's got to get going.

1060
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,334
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute!

1061
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,671
My son is a starter
in the city finals?

1062
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,882
It gets even better. Coach Freeley
called him their secret weapon.

1063
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,936
When were you planning
on telling us this?

1064
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,437
Well,

1065
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,107
I was gonna surprise you.

1066
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,563
Well, we're surprised.

1067
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,990
Wow, my son's a starter.
I told you you could do it.

1068
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,147
Didn't I say he could do it, honey?
Of course, dear.

1069
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,087
But we should get going, I
mean, we don't wanna be late

1070
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,433
and be kicked off
the team, right?

1071
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,539
Oh, no. Right, right, right. No.

1072
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,575
No son of mine is ever gonna
be late for practice.

1073
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,789
Go, fight.
Go.

1074
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,036
No, wait.

1075
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,122
What time is the game?

1076
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,045
Two o'clock.
Two o'clock?

1077
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,376
Yep.
Two o'clock.

1078
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,711
Two o'clock. Two o'clock.
Two o'clock.

1079
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,636
I'm gonna call Eddie, I'm
gonna cancel that golf game,

1080
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,472
and I am gonna be there.

1081
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,133
Yeah, you are.
I better call Joan.

1082
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,634
Yeah.
Go call Eddie.

1083
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,562
Look, Mom and Dad told me about
how I freaked out this morning.

1084
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,606
But you helped me,
calmed me down

1085
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,566
and kept me from
hurting myself.

1086
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:12,067
I don't even know what happened,
but you helped me, so,

1087
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,153
thank you.

1088
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,651
I owe you one.

1089
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,683
Do you know what
happened to me?

1090
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,662
You were possessed
by a berserker ghoul.

1091
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,413
Right, I said I owe you one.

1092
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,584
That doesn't mean I have
to believe your stories

1093
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,163
about ghosts and magic. You know
I don't believe that stuff.

1094
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,089
Well, maybe someday you will.

1095
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,667
Dude, just get out of here.
Go do your nerd stuff.

1096
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,006
Dad, I need the phone.

1097
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,509
Come on,
my grave, further ahead.

1098
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,931
Okay, now what do we do?

1099
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,107
Okay, Emma must
return to her grave

1100
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,605
and Max will say his chant
while holding the ring.

1101
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:54,359
That should break the spell
and you can be dead again.

1102
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,865
Okay, great, then all
I have to do is...

1103
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,030
My ring!

1104
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,282
I don't have it.

1105
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,661
I took it off and stuck it in my
pocket after soccer practice.

1106
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,707
You mean you came
out here, on Halloween,

1107
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,748
with no protection from Phears?

1108
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,832
Don't worry. I'll run
back and get it right now.

1109
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,718
Did I just hear someone say

1110
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,471
that they forgot to bring the
ring to our little party?

1111
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:24,847
How careless.

1112
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,139
Looks like you all fell
for my little plan.

1113
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,896
Even you, Emma. You look
lovely, by the way.

1114
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,483
You see, I knew you would be good
to get the ring off his finger

1115
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,657
but how would I capture
all of them together?

1116
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:42,702
Easy, you tell them
the story about your family.

1117
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,950
How you want so
badly to be reunited,

1118
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,907
just like Tara
and Nicky want to be

1119
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,118
with their parents, and presto!

1120
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,828
You all end up back
at your graveside.

1121
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,915
You see, I didn't just
pick you by accident.

1122
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,880
I knew nothing of this
plan, little ones.

1123
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,427
I swear it.

1124
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:01,463
Don't worry, Emma.
We believe you.

1125
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,428
Phears just used you.

1126
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:07,060
Oh. Oh, yes. Did I use you?
I'm so sorry.

1127
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,565
Finally, the end of the
Roland brats and Max Doyle.

1128
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,609
This is gonna be fun.

1129
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,686
No, leave Max out of it.

1130
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,649
He didn't do anything to you and he
has nothing to do with our parents.

1131
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,950
On the contrary,

1132
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,122
he's had plenty to do
with disrupting my plans.

1133
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:31,118
And now all of you
are going to pay for it.

1134
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,797
Max!

1135
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,549
Tara, run. Come on.

1136
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,301
Not so fast, tough guy.

1137
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,892
And as for you, missy...

1138
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,394
Max, run.

1139
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,017
Get the ring.

1140
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,057
Yes, Max.
I will help you.

1141
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,865
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

1142
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,649
Ah, yes, but of course.

1143
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,076
When in need, ask your
friends for help.

1144
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,331
Catch that boy and destroy him.

1145
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,099
Wow! Cool costume.

1146
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,355
I'm totally getting
one of those next year.

1147
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,383
Ghouls!

1148
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,855
Look out.

1149
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,312
Move.

1150
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,608
Ghoul chase!

1151
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,411
Hey, bro.
What's up'?

1152
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,375
Max?

1153
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,507
My bro.
My bro right there.

1154
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,798
Is that Max?

1155
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,927
Max, this is awesome.

1156
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,975
How are you doing all this?

1157
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,636
Well, my minor in college

1158
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,359
is gonna be in makeup
and special effects.

1159
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,519
Good. That's good.

1160
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,826
You fight
like a ghoul.

1161
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,547
Max!

1162
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,301
How cool was that?

1163
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,846
Max.

1164
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,553
Max.

1165
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,259
There are too many people here.

1166
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,853
These ghouls will
destroy them all.

1167
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:38,225
I'm sleepy-

1168
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,938
No, no, don't fall asleep now.
I need you.

1169
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,608
Yeah, you nerds go all
out for Halloween.

1170
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,988
What's up?

1171
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,193
Those aren't nerds and
they're not going anywhere,

1172
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,823
except after me.

1173
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,238
Dude, not cool.

1174
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,537
Dude!

1175
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,286
Not dudes. Ghouls.

1176
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,867
Oh, you wanna play, huh?

1177
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,582
Max, follow me.

1178
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,463
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1179
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,820
Do you believe me
about ghouls now?

1180
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,448
Yeah, I'm getting there.

1181
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,744
Stop it.
It's nothing.

1182
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:44,704
What's up?

1183
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,178
Ah!

1184
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,558
Come to papa.

1185
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,064
Mauler, of course.

1186
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,241
Bed.

1187
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,077
Oh.

1188
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,243
Here, kitty, kitty.

1189
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,410
What? Cat got your tongue?

1190
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,249
Emma. Emma,
Emma, you awake?

1191
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,547
Got any ideas what
to do with this cat?

1192
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,345
Just catch him, Max.
I'm too sleepy.

1193
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,637
Swell.

1194
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,467
Okay, Mauler.
Come on, boy.

1195
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,427
Take it easy.

1196
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,846
Okay, Max.

1197
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,102
I will help you.

1198
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,268
Okay, Mauler.
Maybe this will get you.

1199
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,977
Check this out.

1200
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,934
Oh, man! I hope
we're not too late.

1201
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,728
Me too.
'Cause I must go sleep now.

1202
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,398
No, I still need your help.

1203
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,316
Use the ring, Max.

1204
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,152
And mangy cat.

1205
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,821
That is all you need.

1206
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,113
Good night.

1207
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,737
Tara! Nicky!

1208
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,072
Where are you guys?

1209
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,372
Max!

1210
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,665
Over here. Phears locked us in this
creepy, old crypt with his dark magic.

1211
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,335
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

1212
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,881
From the light of Earth,
the dark descends.

1213
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,843
Should they return?
That all depends.

1214
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:07,309
When hands point up to moonlit
skies, on ten, three, one

1215
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,102
the darkness dies.

1216
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,366
Not the funnel!

1217
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,034
Oh! That bratty kid
and his ring again!

1218
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,288
Enough!

1219
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,834
Tough luck, you little dweeb.

1220
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,087
If I get dragged into that
funnel, she goes with me

1221
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,460
and you'll never see her again.

1222
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,089
Now cough up that ring.

1223
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,388
Yeah, well, let's see who
else gets dragged into this.

1224
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,555
One second.

1225
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,520
Not Mauler, my most
beautiful wicked cat!

1226
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,983
Bye, Mauler. Too bad no one
will ever see you again.

1227
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,355
Don't hurt him.

1228
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,153
Then let Tara go.

1229
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,357
You promise not to destroy
him if I release her?

1230
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,864
Don't listen to him, Max. Don't
trust Phears. It's a trick.

1231
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,491
I got a few of those
up my sleeve myself.

1232
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,618
Okay, I promise.

1233
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,079
Now let her go.

1234
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,506
What do we do now?

1235
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,926
Now we let the cat
out of the bag.

1236
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,175
He's got Mauler.

1237
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,678
My beautiful, evil kitty.

1238
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,102
You tricked me,
you two-faced brat!

1239
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:32,683
No! Mauler, don't be afraid.
Mauler, Daddy's coming. Be brave.

1240
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,235
Be brave for Daddy!
My God!

1241
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,940
He would do anything
for that cat.

1242
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,195
Okay, come on Tara,

1243
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:45,870
we promised to help Emma and help her
get her back to her resting place.

1244
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,581
Okay, you ready?

1245
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:52,501
Emma?

1246
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,045
Come on, Emma, wake up.

1247
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,877
You can do it, Emma,
can you hear me?

1248
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,716
Oh!

1249
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,211
Whoo! Emma?

1250
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,047
Oh, thank you.

1251
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,220
Thank you all so much.

1252
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,472
You're very, very kind.

1253
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,806
Now, I must go home.

1254
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,872
Oh, Emma, if you see our
parents, can you tell them that...

1255
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,989
Well, I'm happy for her.

1256
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,741
If she didn't have friends
in Plover before,

1257
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,497
she does now.
Yeah.

1258
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,170
Phears is gone for a while.

1259
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:40,175
Yeah, now if I can just convince
Cammy I'm not a total weirdo.

1260
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,384
Well, you never know.

1261
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,048
Stranger things have happened.

1262
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,009
Yeah.

1263
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,011
Let's go, Orange!

1264
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,363
Let's go, Orange!

1265
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,997
Don't let him have it.

1266
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,875
Take the ball!

1267
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:22,587
No! No! No!

1268
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,426
What are you, asleep?

1269
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,305
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1270
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,678
Come on, come on.

1271
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:45,990
All right, Freeley. Three minutes left.
Tie game. You got any more substitutes,

1272
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,282
put them in.

1273
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,110
Thomas, you're out!

1274
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:55,333
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

1275
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:58,833
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

1276
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,003
Max! Max!

1277
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,129
Max! Max! Max!

1278
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,629
Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

1279
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,172
Okay, Secret Weapon.

1280
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,631
You're up.

1281
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,426
Listen, it's all for you.

1282
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,479
Okay? Take forward. Go.

1283
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,771
Max!

1284
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:18,939
Come on, hustle up.

1285
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,027
Max. Come on.

1286
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,774
Let's do it.

1287
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,366
What's going on?
Ready?

1288
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:30,944
Come on.
Where's right forward?

1289
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:32,824
It's over here.

1290
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,414
Good hustle.

1291
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,083
You can do it! Here!
You'll be fine.

1292
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,585
Good.

1293
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:40,877
All right.
You got this, Max.

1294
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,205
Go.

1295
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,015
- Yes.
- Back away, loser.

1296
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,018
Max. What are you doing?

1297
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,020
Dude, that way.

1298
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,811
Max. I think this
will work better.

1299
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:06,729
All right.

1300
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,712
- Oh!
- Yeah!

1301
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,124
Do you think
that hurt his head?

1302
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:27,379
Hurt his head?
Mom?

1303
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:30,086
Honey, come on. When you're
making all-star plays like that,

1304
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,261
you just lay it out there.

1305
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:32,805
You don't worry
about getting hurt.

1306
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,383
Yeah!
That's my boy!

1307
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:36,763
Go Max!
Go Max!

1308
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,735
Oh, ref, come on!

1309
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,444
Nicky!

1310
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:50,739
Are you okay?

1311
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,114
I'll be all right. What about Max?
Are you sure?

1312
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,537
Stay down, stay down.
He's fine. He's over there.

1313
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,580
What are you guys doing?

1314
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,460
Max, you've got this!

1315
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,087
Just believe in yourself.

1316
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,256
Come on, Max, you can do it!

1317
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,578
We got the cup!
We got the cup!

1318
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,523
Never had a doubt.
Never had a doubt.

1319
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,185
Good job.

1320
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,155
I'm so proud of you!

1321
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,816
Boom, huh!

1322
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,154
So proud of you.

1323
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,495
Nice game there, Beckham.

1324
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,670
Thanks.

1325
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,090
That was, I mean, crazy.

1326
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,632
Thanks.

1327
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,797
Look, about last night...

1328
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,971
I really wish you
would have stayed.

1329
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:40,141
I just wanted to thank you for everything
you did for the haunted house.

1330
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,014
That was really cool.

1331
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,604
But I guess, you were just

1332
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,977
getting good and
rested up for the game.

1333
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,852
Yes. That's exactly
what it was.

1334
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,522
Well, the haunted house
is still there.

1335
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,943
I may not be as good with
effects and stuff as you are,

1336
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,450
but I can still give you a
really cool exclusive tour.

1337
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:02,947
Now?

1338
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,040
As good a time <i>as</i> any.

1339
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,203
Okay.

1340
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,793
<i>Hey-</i>

1341
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,177
Way to go, Bro.

1342
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,889
What's up?

1343
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,264
We should follow him.
No.

1344
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,935
Let him go.

1345
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,015
Okay.

1346
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,563
So, we totally blew away our
whole fund-raising goal and I am

1347
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:40,113
pretty sure it's because of the awesome
show you and your friends put on.

1348
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,069
So, thank you.

1349
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,161
Oh. Yeah, my pleasure.

1350
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,504
Are you okay?
You seem nervous.

1351
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,296
Oh.

1352
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,466
You know, haunted house.

1353
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,134
Scary stuff.

1354
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,880
Something tells me
you've seen scarier.

1355
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,344
What tells you that?

1356
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,311
I don't know, I mean,
it's a feeling I have.

1357
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,389
You seem mysterious.

1358
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,437
But in a totally good way.

1359
01:20:15,306 --> 01:20:17,746
What would you say if I told you
I was friends with two ghosts

1360
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,945
that were trying to find their parents
that were kidnapped by an evil spirit?

1361
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,111
I'd say...

1362
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,996
I... You better
call me next time.

1363
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,772
Hey, great game today, Max.

1364
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,316
Thanks, Mrs. Hepplewhite.

1365
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,185
So, how was it?

1366
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,394
Boring, right?

1367
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,604
Tara?

1368
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,984
Hey, there he is.

1369
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,614
Ha-ha!

1370
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:05,411
Son, I can't tell you how
proud I was of you today.

1371
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,995
But I can show you.

1372
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,697
Head upstairs to your room.

1373
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,749
I got a little surprise
waiting for you.

1374
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,997
Mr. Secret Weapon.

1375
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,170
Shall we go up?

1376
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,135
Oh!

1377
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,841
Computer's back.
Sweet!

1378
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,723
Now I can finally get back to
researching our dad's journal.

1379
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,842
We're closer than ever to
finding our morn and dad.

1380
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,303
But how will we know if

1381
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,558
Emma was able to find them?

1382
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,356
You gotta be patient, Tara.

1383
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,149
I mean, there's
no telling how vast

1384
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,523
or complex the afterlife
may be. It...

1385
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,863
"Nicky. Tara.

1386
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,490
"We cannot tell you
how relieved we are

1387
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,116
"to know that you're okay.

1388
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,290
"Emma tells us that
you're looking for us.

1389
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:54,039
"And I know that we will
all be together again soon.

1390
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,832
"Don't ever lose hope.

1391
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,333
"We'll get through this.

1392
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,665
"We're closer than ever,

1393
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,215
"Thanks to your friend Max.

1394
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,883
"We love you
more than anything.

1395
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:03,423
"Mom and Dad."

1396
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,354
Whoa!

1397
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,752
Max.

1398
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:47,670
Uh...

1399
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,718
You ran so fast.

1400
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,339
Why do I taste syrup?

1401
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,754
I'm sorry.

1402
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,215
That's a lot of syrup.

1403
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,263
through any of that, Mom.

1404
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,135
Sorry.
No. That was great.

1405
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,228
But that was great.

1406
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,518
I was going with it.

1407
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,447
This time I know his secret.
It's that ring...

1408
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,888
I can snatch the two Roland
brats and we'll both be free.

1409
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,020
Simple.

1410
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,392
Yeah.
Yeah.

1411
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,771
Yeah.

1412
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,224
I forgot my last line.

1413
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,060
I don't believe you have one.

1414
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,689
Well, that solves the problem.

1415
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,195
Echo, take one.

1416
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,282
Oh, I tore the other side.

1417
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,004
Do we keep looking?

1418
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:01,846
Right, Max!

1419
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:06,726
I totally forgot my line, Max.

1420
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,599
Oh, right, Max.

1421
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:11,777
Like, how did he get in the
dresser then?

1422
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,364
Bye, Mauler. Too bad no one...

1423
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:29,953
It's hard.

1424
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,921
I wanna do it more.

1425
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,554
Oh!
Oh, hey!

1426
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,270
Guys, it's just Charlie
from next door.

1427
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,936
Well, keep it away from me,
because I'll be in hives for a week.

1428
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,942
Come here, boy.
Come here, Charlie.

1429
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,691
Come here, Charlie.

1430
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,071
What are you doing here?

1431
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,823
You're supposed to be next...

1432
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,582
All right. Come here.

1433
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:10,119
Come here, Charlie.

1434
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,834
Just pick him up.

1435
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,666
Just pick him up.
Is he good?

1436
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:16,921
Yeah, yeah, just pick him up.

1437
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,422
Come here, Charlie.

1438
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:21,596
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be next door.

1439
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,090
See, Dad.

1440
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:24,299
I told you nerdy boy
had a cat up here.

1441
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:25,676
You're dead.

1442
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:47,455
What? How do you
wanna disappear?

1443
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,166
Oh, we're disappearing.

1444
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,493
Oh, sorry.

1445
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,792
How do you wanna do it?

1446
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:52,994
Um... High five.

1447
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,923
I don't know. That's all we have.
What do you want?
