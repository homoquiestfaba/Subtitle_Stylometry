1
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,557
Many stories
have been recorded...

2
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,465
of the ancient times.

3
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,129
Behind even
the greatest myths...

4
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,470
there is a history
now long forgotten.

5
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,170
ln the age of gods and spirits...

6
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:22,308
the known world was ruled
by a dark empire...

7
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,013
from their island palace of Minos.

8
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,885
They worshipped the bull...

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,881
the most powerful of all gods.

10
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,687
The tablets recount
that as the empire grew...

11
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:43,465
their hedonism and greed
knew no bounds.

12
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,600
The people longed for more
than stone deities.

13
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,737
They demanded a living god.

14
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,578
ln response,
sickened minds indulged...

15
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,481
in the forbidden arts...

16
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:01,511
and decreed the queen
should offer herself to the bull...

17
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,353
to create the perfect being...

18
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:09,829
a unification of god and man.

19
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:16,062
For 1 3 months the creature
grew inside her...

20
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,231
pure, precious.

21
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,366
Every care bestowed.

22
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,508
To ensure safe passage
into our world...

23
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,417
it was cut from the queen's belly.

24
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:41,721
Suckled on the blood
of its own mother...

25
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:47,098
the newborn was
presented to the people.

26
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,398
The palace hailed their creation...

27
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,338
and the power of the empire
strengthened.

28
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,969
But as the beast grew,
so did its hunger.

29
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,149
ln revenge for the murder
of a royal prince...

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,210
a grave tax was placed upon
my village, Thena...

31
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,984
in the northern territories.

32
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,982
Every three years,
eight youths would be taken...

33
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,757
to the palace by royal soldiers...

34
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,231
lowered into the labyrinth...

35
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,996
and sacrificed to the beast.

36
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,797
Help me! Help me!

37
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,915
The empire of the bull
seemed invincible...

38
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,225
as the fifth sacrifice drew near.

39
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,941
Go ahead.

40
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,332
The leper.

41
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,302
My father says she never comes
but with an omen.

42
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,937
lt means they're coming.

43
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,869
We saw her in the forest again----
the old woman.

44
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,077
Danu thinks she's a sign
that the horned soldiers will come.

45
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,883
He also says that the moon
slid across the ocean...

46
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,186
and fell off the earth.

47
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,363
l miss her, Father.

48
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,196
Why did Ffion have to be taken?

49
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,672
How many of us must die
for this one prince?

50
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,303
There are certain things that
you cannot understand yet, Theo.

51
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,368
Then l want to learn.

52
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,937
You will...in time.

53
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,541
While l am leader of this village...

54
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,519
let me worry about those things.

55
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,884
Theo, you must move on.

56
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,054
You will find love again.

57
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,012
Morna?

58
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,053
When the soldiers come...

59
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,029
if you're taken, Morna,
then my heart will die.

60
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,060
No, Morna, the mistletoe stick'll
keep you safe.

61
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,739
Say my name.

62
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,800
Just once.

63
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,476
No, don't sign it.

64
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,645
Say my name.

65
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,988
Tell us it will be different this time.

66
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,791
lt will not be different this time.

67
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,390
No, this time we fight.

68
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,899
lf we fight, they will destroy us.

69
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,097
The tax is eight youths.

70
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,368
We know our children
are sacrificed to a wild beast.

71
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,205
The death of their prince
is a terrible burden...

72
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,473
but we must endure it.

73
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,275
How can you know
about our pain...

74
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,941
when your precious son
cannot be taken?

75
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,450
Theo cannot be taken
because after me...

76
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,510
he will lead this village.

77
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,079
We agreed to keep him safe
until then.

78
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,585
-- Yes, we will.
-- No, we can't fight them.

79
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,397
Didi, what is it?

80
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,803
Your father said l should come.

81
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,642
He asked me to be with you, Theo.

82
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,610
l can't, Didi.

83
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,643
l still love Ffion.

84
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,825
Didi!

85
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,535
Run, shepherd.

86
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,480
The leper.

87
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,881
What broods for the boy?

88
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,448
The mark. The tree.

89
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,084
l know of it.

90
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,294
The other half belongs
to someone l love.

91
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,265
lt still does.

92
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,825
No, she was taken.

93
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:07,169
Taken, but not sacrificed.

94
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,811
She lives?

95
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,546
She lives far across the sea...

96
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,321
in the labyrinth
beneath the great palace.

97
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:31,797
There she waits for Theo.

98
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,429
Why do you play tricks
with me, old woman...

99
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,837
when you know nothing of her?

100
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:46,005
To save her, Theo must kill.

101
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,610
Curse their god...

102
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,279
and kill the beast!

103
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,451
The Minotaur?

104
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,747
She was taken.

105
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,884
But not sacrificed.

106
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,962
My heart never left you...never.

107
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,674
lt's time.

108
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,339
Take the village herd
when you leave.

109
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,543
Their soldiers will be here soon.

110
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,484
l went to see the leper.

111
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,215
She told me Ffion still lives.

112
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,318
She said l had to kill the beast.

113
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:11,420
You will not listen to an old woman
who fills your head with lies.

114
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:16,163
The Minotaur is a god.
lt cannot be slain by any man.

115
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:22,268
Son, one day
you will lead this village.

116
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,674
We must keep you safe until then.

117
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:28,738
l'm doing this
because l want you to live...

118
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,976
and give the world
your children.

119
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:35,545
But the one who would have
my children, Father, is gone.

120
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,823
Go into the hills.

121
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,057
Do as l say!

122
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,066
Theo! Theo!

123
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,299
Go, Danu.
Go and be with Morna.

124
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,829
The one who can't be taken.

125
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,035
l want no fight with you, Tyro.

126
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,601
You have no fight
with anyone, shepherd.

127
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,575
Come on!

128
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,990
lf Ffion were mine
she'd still be here, shepherd.

129
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,155
Tyro!

130
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,712
The ships!
The ships are coming!

131
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,768
We ask forgiveness for our sin.

132
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,261
Take the first eight youths you find.

133
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,504
And l want no more
from your dark spirit.

134
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,395
No, don't take them!

135
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,556
Don't take them!

136
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,031
No!

137
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,762
Morna! Morna!

138
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,464
Morna!

139
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,733
Curse their god
and kill the beast.

140
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,772
Don't touch my mother!

141
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,640
The stick! The stick!

142
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,441
No, Mother!

143
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,138
Mother!

144
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,175
Theo...

145
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,900
l'm taking your place. Go! Run!

146
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,581
Farewell.

147
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,514
ls that a way to greet a friend?

148
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,450
Who is it?

149
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,860
lt's Theo.

150
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,262
What's he doing here?

151
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,267
Stay close to Morna, Danu.

152
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,078
The bull.

153
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,050
l'm going to kill the bull.

154
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,484
The Minotaur?

155
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,614
Their god?

156
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,562
And you'll kill it with him?

157
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,532
Have you told him yet?

158
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,090
Tyro is afraid of the bull.

159
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,000
l fear no beast.

160
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,562
My mother once told me
that it is white.

161
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,406
White from the bile of all the children
sacrificed in the labyrinth.

162
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,934
She said when
the Minotaur was born...

163
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,312
the world cried tears
that filled the oceans.

164
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,807
Didi, your mother is a goose
who sings to her own shadow...

165
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,252
and her daughter is a fool.

166
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,182
She's mad!

167
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,920
Hit her for me.

168
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:29,263
The bull is divine.
Death is our path into the afterlife.

169
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,897
We should be honored
we are sacrificed.

170
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,272
The gods do not sleep.
You cannot kill a god.

171
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,770
He will take your spirit
and you will be his.

172
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,476
l fear no beast.

173
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,247
Not even a fool who dreams
he can kill a god.

174
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,017
That's what l intend to do.

175
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,616
To kill him while he sleeps.

176
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,925
Beneath the great palace...

177
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,057
she waits for Theo.

178
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,243
We're here.

179
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,684
The floor... how is it warm?

180
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,407
Kneel.

181
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,370
All this time...

182
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,502
old and ugly.

183
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:57,481
Does this sacrifice
please our princess?

184
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:09,354
You can smell, can't you?

185
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:14,161
Let us first season his meat.

186
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,357
There!

187
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,397
No!

188
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,407
Morna! No!

189
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,844
That one!

190
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,911
No!

191
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,060
-- Do something!
-- My lord!

192
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,860
Lord?

193
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,899
They will not please you, my lord.

194
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,304
And how will they
not please me, boy?

195
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,438
They are unknowing, my lord.

196
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,641
Unknowing...

197
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:10,111
Virgins please us.
They please us immensely.

198
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,817
We thank the boy for his concern.

199
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,691
Let him tell us his name.

200
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:21,492
Take those sweet eyes from me
before l pluck them out, boy.

201
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,292
My name is Shepherd, sir.

202
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,804
Well, Shepherd...

203
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:32,299
our princess will show you how
we prepare virgins for our god.

204
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,476
lnhale the sweetness.

205
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,724
The gas shall corrupt
their unknowing minds.

206
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,010
Make her stop, Theo.

207
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,027
Now. Now's the time.

208
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,051
No.

209
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,172
My god is ready for his meat.

210
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,438
Let us see the mouth of hell.

211
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,370
Open the gates.

212
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,498
Do not be afraid.

213
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,499
Your spirit will l warm
in the belly of the bull.

214
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:18,141
And your flesh will taste sweeter
now that it's aroused.

215
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,680
Come, powerful one!

216
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,052
Come see what l have brought you.

217
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,716
Come taste!

218
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,295
What?

219
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,628
You think that
you will displease our eyes.

220
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,396
Come quickly, powerful one...

221
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,099
before l taste
this precious flesh myself.

222
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,374
You are afraid to show yourself.

223
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,521
Take the girls.

224
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,230
Morna!

225
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,636
Take her!

226
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,442
Remove them! Prepare the pits!

227
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,546
They will all be sacrificed together!

228
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,227
Do not ever speak in here again.

229
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,178
-- What was it?
-- The bull.

230
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:00,451
Get away from me!

231
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,385
You are accursed!

232
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,717
Why don't you stop her?

233
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,723
Gods are from above.
They rule from the sky.

234
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,622
Why would they keep a god
under their feet?

235
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,820
The Minotaur
is from the under earth...

236
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,453
the great darkness.

237
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,191
A labyrinth of tunnels and caves.

238
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,530
lf it is a beast,
then it can be slain.

239
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,059
The Minotaur is a beast and a god.

240
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,039
And Theo should not talk so.

241
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,737
Bring me the shepherd boy.

242
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,771
The old leper said he would come.

243
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,477
Sedate him with the gas.

244
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:37,818
Then l will see if he will help me.

245
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,520
And, Rumella, make sure the king
does not see you.

246
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,010
You will come with us.

247
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,562
Theo.

248
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,333
Shepherd boy...

249
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,742
has our gas made you drowsy?

250
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,042
Such innocence.

251
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:43,043
Sweet Theo.

252
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,584
How do you know my name?

253
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,058
Love, young Theo.

254
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:52,358
lt tells me what l wish to hear.

255
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,729
l wish to hear why
l've been brought here.

256
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,534
l want to know of this beast
you keep feeding my people to.

257
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,041
You know nothing of the beast.

258
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,538
l am Raphaella.

259
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:17,316
She who will give birth
to the young shepherd's dreams.

260
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:28,729
What?

261
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,630
What do you want from me?

262
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,136
Quiet!

263
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:41,644
Help me.

264
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:46,574
Release me from the beast
and all my pleasures will be yours.

265
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,686
-- He hears.
-- Huh?

266
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:55,954
There was a girl
from the last sacrifice.

267
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,427
Ffion. Tell me.

268
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,794
Save me and l will help you.

269
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:01,820
Where is she?

270
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,858
The beast grows tired of Raphaella!

271
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,935
How dare you enter my chambers?

272
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:14,274
You would pleasure yourself
with this filth.

273
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,643
-- Please, Brother----
-- What?!

274
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,778
Do not ever question me.

275
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,445
-- Take him!
-- No!

276
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,174
Don't you ever turn away from me!

277
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,873
lf this is your pleasure,
then so be it.

278
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:55,750
l will corrupt you with
every soldier and slave in the palace!

279
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:58,653
l will cast you to the lepers...

280
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,681
and watch them
crawl inside of you!

281
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,717
Then when you beg for me...

282
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,424
then will come the bull.

283
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,327
But first you, young shepherd.

284
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,675
Fear.

285
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,916
l smell fear on the young shepherd.

286
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:38,257
You only know fear as a lamb
snatched from its mother.

287
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:41,389
l'm going to show you true fear.

288
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,833
Fear that will rip your heart
from your soul.

289
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:48,235
Fear that will make
your spirit shake!

290
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,968
Make you wish that your eyes
were born blind...

291
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,635
sealed shut!

292
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,735
lt is to him that you go.

293
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,012
Let darkness be his.

294
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,281
Where are you?

295
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:46,621
Didi!

296
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,533
Help! Morna! Theo!

297
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:10,680
Get me out of here!

298
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,833
Theo!

299
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,357
You do not ask of the sacrifice.

300
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:31,800
l ask that you do not hate me, my lord.

301
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,167
Hate you?

302
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,908
l forgive you.

303
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:44,812
The union between brother
and sister will be stronger.

304
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,012
l ask that you bear my seed.

305
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,393
l did not see that love
between us...

306
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,527
brother and sister...

307
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,504
could be so...

308
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:13,033
Only when l saw the pain l had
given you did my eyes open.

309
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,603
What about those in the palace?

310
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,811
The ones who make whispers
against me?

311
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:26,084
Follow me, Sister, to my chambers.

312
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:00,216
The gas.

313
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,660
Morna.

314
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,364
What?

315
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,412
Am l to understand...

316
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:58,778
you've seen...

317
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:00,077
Theo!

318
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,516
Danu.

319
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,951
Morna!

320
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,552
Help!

321
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:10,355
Someone!

322
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,695
Who's there?

323
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,315
No!

324
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:37,115
Stop! No! Don't! Shh!

325
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,451
Danu!

326
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,736
ls that any way to greet a friend?

327
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,968
The next time l call,
you answer me.

328
00:37:59,009 --> 00:37:59,668
OK.

329
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,068
Morna!

330
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,084
Did you find any of the others?

331
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,678
There's no one.
We should not look.

332
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,122
We should find our way from here.
The others are gone.

333
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,024
She says the others are here...

334
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,220
and she's not going home
without them.

335
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:19,956
Then let her stay!

336
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,761
The only ones here are dead!

337
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,134
We don't know that.

338
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,274
We have to find the way out.

339
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,408
We can look for them on the way.

340
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,162
Sister!

341
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,770
Sister...

342
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:05,900
come.

343
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,508
Come. Be by my side.

344
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,810
l would rather lay with
the slaves and the lepers...

345
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,909
than bear your child.

346
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,779
l would rather die with the beast.

347
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:30,597
No!

348
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,128
What?

349
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,060
The beast.

350
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,200
He's talking to the other gods.

351
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,682
Stay there.

352
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,300
l found it in a rock.

353
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,210
The Minotaur.

354
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,372
lt's bigger than any wolf.

355
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,386
l can kill him.

356
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,191
But someone must be the bait.

357
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,208
l'll make a pact with you.

358
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,506
From this night...

359
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,843
every drop of virgin blood
in my kingdom...

360
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,441
will sweeten your lips.

361
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:32,286
l will nourish you with the flesh
of every newborn child.

362
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,282
Just give her back to me.

363
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,922
Am l not a god...

364
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,694
with power over death?

365
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,524
Great Spirit, make me brave
that l may face the tyrant.

366
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,329
Great Spirit, make me brave
that l may face the tyrant.

367
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,023
-- Wait!
-- No! No!

368
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,667
My heart told me
you were not dead.

369
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,247
Why are you here?

370
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,347
l'm here to save you.

371
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,222
Like you saved the others?
You're a witch!

372
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:23,396
You... You would suck on her words
like your mother's tit.

373
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:27,632
She's cast her spell over him.
And he doesn't want it to be gone!

374
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,333
We could kill her before
she brings her magic.

375
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,703
Magic? l would cause to have
you all free of this place.

376
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,271
ls that what you want?

377
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,783
l know the way out.

378
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,718
My handmaiden waits.

379
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,778
lf you trust me,
l will take you there.

380
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,088
And you would trust that? Huh?

381
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,863
What choice do we have?

382
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:57,299
l would rather put my head
in a snake pit...

383
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,131
than follow this witch anywhere!

384
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,296
Then go and find yourself
a snake pit, Vena.

385
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,373
l will.

386
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,908
You must stop her.

387
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,906
Vena?

388
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,253
Be with her, Theo.

389
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,381
She'll kiss you like a snake.

390
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,415
l care for none of you or the village.

391
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,450
l feel shame l was born there.

392
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,157
And if you all die here, then good.

393
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,528
l hate----

394
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,502
Where does the gas come from?

395
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,637
The center of the labyrinth.

396
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,806
lt lights the fires in the palace.

397
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,979
There's something up ahead.

398
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,717
-- What is that?
-- l don't know.

399
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,224
-- She's alive.
-- lt's Didi.

400
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,042
l dreamt l was alone...

401
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,980
walking in a forest.

402
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,577
The forest was never
as dark as here.

403
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,318
You must have fainted
when they put you down here, Didi.

404
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,804
Hurry. lt's not far now.

405
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,781
My handmaiden will let us out.

406
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:54,167
You would release the nightmare
into our world?

407
00:46:56,146 --> 00:47:01,914
Am l infected by those
who make whispers against me?

408
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,111
How did you know this place?

409
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,983
Look into my eyes, young maid.

410
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:16,125
Tell me, do they show mercy?

411
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,369
What?

412
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:56,031
We should not be here.

413
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,768
This is where it sleeps.

414
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,639
We must hurry.

415
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,378
Rumella, open the door. lt's me.

416
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,175
This isn't right.

417
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,583
Where are you? Open the door!

418
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,146
Theo, she said she'd be here.

419
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,522
She'll be here.

420
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,254
Rumella, open the door!

421
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,762
She tricked us!
She brought us here to die!

422
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,560
No! No, it must open!

423
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:23,998
l thought you said
there was another way.

424
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,798
The far side of the labyrinth.
This has to be the way out.

425
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,973
Open the door!

426
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,645
Open the door! Open the door!

427
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:39,649
Open the door!

428
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:18,218
Minotaur!

429
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,794
The beast.

430
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,857
The beast.
How could a man kill that?

431
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,063
That's her god.
She led us to him.

432
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,635
Why did you trust her?
What has she done to you?

433
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,804
Danu.

434
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,909
You said my name.

435
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,453
The spirit has returned.

436
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:36,528
You must not fight.

437
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,943
l feel sick.

438
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,484
lt's clean. We can rest here.

439
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,230
l'm sorry...

440
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,597
that l was frightened
with the others.

441
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,432
lt's no shame to be afraid here.

442
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,223
Long time alone here.

443
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,497
Eating hope and rats.

444
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,518
How long have you been here?

445
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,386
He's happy you've come.

446
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,464
Come.

447
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,251
The labyrinth.

448
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,116
Do you know here?

449
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,127
ls bad place.

450
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,394
The only thing is hiding.

451
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,298
What's your name?

452
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:54,726
Turag.

453
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,137
Turag.

454
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,109
And does Turag know of
other survivors down here?

455
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,111
Hmm?

456
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,347
Tell me, what has Turag seen
the beast feed on...

457
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,715
when there's no children?

458
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,777
Rats.

459
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,685
A god eats rats?

460
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,954
No, but he's blessed.

461
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,292
Nobody's blessed here.
They're cursed.

462
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,597
Do you believe god is good?

463
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,227
He is mercy.

464
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:32,173
Coming here is what you know.

465
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,268
Here is different place.

466
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,979
And you've seen him?

467
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:43,912
Where?

468
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,012
Sleeping.

469
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,647
Sleeping?

470
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,487
The gods do not sleep.

471
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,924
Then he's not a god.

472
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,294
No. l did not see.
Are you coming?

473
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,628
Why did you come?

474
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,257
To kill the Minotaur.

475
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,269
This beast that sleeps.

476
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,942
Why do you hate Theo?

477
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:17,316
l do not hate him.

478
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,219
l don't trust him.

479
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,950
Because he took Ffion?

480
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,651
She wasn't his to take.

481
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,990
But then the soldiers came
and took her from both of you.

482
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,087
Yes. When they came,
l tried to stop them.

483
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,266
l always liked you, Tyro.

484
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,811
But you never looked at me.

485
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,238
l give the command!

486
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,875
l make the sacrifice!

487
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,784
You will not take her!

488
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,913
l'll snatch her back.

489
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,187
You will give her back!

490
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,091
She will not be yours!

491
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,357
Open it!

492
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,703
You should not hear Turag, Theo.

493
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,613
She's here.

494
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,546
Ffion.

495
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,817
And he knows where she is.

496
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,824
l know because l saw her.

497
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,088
You saw her spirit.

498
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,492
That's what lies here.

499
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,794
No. Her spirit wouldn't wander here.

500
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,460
She promised.

501
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:14,501
Ffion?

502
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,233
The leper.

503
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,366
l went to see her.

504
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,406
The leper?

505
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,615
You didn't come here for us.

506
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:31,553
You came for her, didn't you?

507
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:36,384
You came for her because
the leper has cast her magic.

508
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:40,419
That's why your princess is here.
'Cause they're the same witch!

509
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,896
Kill the god you said?

510
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,759
We followed you!
We trusted you!

511
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,269
You came for her!

512
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,237
Because l had no choice!

513
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,466
Theo!

514
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,167
Ffion's dead, Theo.

515
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,611
Why can't you believe that?

516
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:58,978
She's not dead.

517
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,109
You know where she is.

518
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,718
Where is she?

519
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,882
Where is she? Where is she?

520
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,585
Leave him, Theo.
He doesn't know anything!

521
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,615
Let him go!

522
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,969
Tell me where she is!

523
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,538
Where is she?

524
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,307
Theo!

525
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,084
Tell me!

526
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:45,850
Tell me where she is!

527
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,364
Sister!

528
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,003
Flee from this place!

529
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:15,789
Sister! Brother forgives you!

530
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:25,524
l do not see a brother anymore.

531
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,035
l see a beast.

532
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:41,915
Danu.

533
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,816
Danu?

534
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,286
Danu?

535
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,722
Danu?

536
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,956
Come! Come! Come!

537
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:30,595
Where? Where is she?!

538
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:31,691
Huh?

539
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,861
What's that? What----What's that?

540
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,807
lt's mine!

541
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,832
Give it to me!

542
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,108
lt's beasty gift.

543
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,672
Beasty give.

544
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,910
lt's mine.

545
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,085
Where is she?

546
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,937
Tyro, please, make it stop.

547
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:14,442
lt's OK. lt's OK.

548
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,944
Think of when
we're away from here.

549
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,275
Think of home.

550
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,508
You promise
you will take me there, Tyro?

551
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,538
Promise?

552
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,381
l will take us from here.

553
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,611
Then l will be with you.

554
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,334
We can do this.

555
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,062
Tyro, careful.

556
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:11,893
OK.

557
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,334
OK, Didi.

558
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,706
OK.

559
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,015
Can you see anyone?

560
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,785
-- Come on, Didi.
-- l'm trying.

561
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,622
Didi, take my hand. Come on.

Look at me. Take my hand.
Come on.

565
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,775
Come on! Reach up!

566
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,801
l can't reach you.

567
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,539
Please, Tyro. l can't reach you.

568
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,380
Didi, take my hand.
Take my hand!

569
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:03,908
-- Come on!

571
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,552
OK, Didi,
OK, don't look down.

572
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,579
Didi! Didi!

573
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,585
Look at me, Didi! Look at me!

574
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:17,690
-- Help me, please! Help!
-- Come on! You can do it!

575
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,725
Please don't let go of my hand!

576
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,103
-- Come on!
-- Help me, please! l don't want to die!

577
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,869
-- l'm slipping!
-- No!

578
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,843
You can do it! Come on!
Hold my hand!

579
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,970
-- No!
-- Help me!

580
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,723
Didi!

581
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,322
Ffion!

582
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,672
Ffion!

583
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,007
Theo...

584
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:09,250
Ffion?

585
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,809
Theo...

586
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,524
Ffion?

587
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,064
Ffion!

588
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,744
Feel the spirit, Theo.

589
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,041
Ffion.

590
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,424
l knew you would come.

591
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,161
lt can't be you.

592
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:01,601
lt is me.

593
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,367
Touch. See into my heart.

594
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,742
You waited for me.

595
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,847
My heart never left you.

596
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:17,342
Theo, the leper said
you would come.

597
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,184
We've been waiting for you.

598
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,352
What?

599
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,301
No!

600
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:13,174
Theo...

601
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,334
Theo?

602
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,135
Theo!

603
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,343
Danu!

604
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,276
Danu!

605
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,549
Danu!

606
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:31,623
Theo. Theo.

607
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,094
-- Danu!
-- Theo.

608
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,031
Go back to Turag.

609
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,897
-- l'll come back for you.
-- No.

610
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:42,693
lt'll keep you safe.

611
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:45,002
lt will take us home.

612
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,599
Say my name.

613
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,791
Spirit of the Tree, keep Theo safe
and l'll hold you in my heart.

614
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:08,593
Spirit of the Tree,
keep Theo safe.

615
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,394
Spirit of the Tree,
l will hold you in my heart...

616
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,025
keep Theo safe.

617
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,469
Spirit of the Tree, keep Theo safe.
l will hold you in my heart.

618
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,903
Danu!

619
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,504
Danu!

620
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,809
-- Theo.
-- Danu.

621
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,378
Morna's returned.

622
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,418
You cannot take my spirit.

623
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,390
l will not let you.

624
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,432
l don't believe in you!

625
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,869
-- Pray for me, Theo.
-- No!

626
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:53,738
No, it is not your time yet!

627
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:54,936
lf l close my eyes,
l can see the village.

628
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:58,140
-- Danu!
-- Take Morna! Take her home!

629
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,045
Danu!

630
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,380
-- Pray for me, Theo.
-- Danu!

631
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:03,407
Pray, Theo!

632
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,809
Pray!

633
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,289
Danu! No!

634
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,313
Pray!

635
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,122
l'm sorry!

636
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,125
l'm sorry!

637
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,295
l'm sorry, Danu!

638
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:09,212
What he does not smell...

639
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,084
he hears.

640
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:16,217
What he does not hear...

641
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,658
he feels.

642
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,825
What he does not feel...

643
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,494
he sees.

644
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,504
What he sees is already dead.

645
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,708
Behold, young shepherd...

646
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:36,472
behold your god.

647
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,538
His name...

648
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,516
is Minotaur.

649
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,399
Was she real?

650
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,443
Nothing here is real.

651
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,003
Then you must touch.

652
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,718
l cursed the love
that brought me here.

653
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,417
No, Theo, do not curse love.

654
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,425
Why am l here?

655
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,463
Because the people of my palace...

656
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,972
once believed
they could create a god...

657
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,238
a power that was
neither man nor beast...

658
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,541
that would protect them.

659
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,446
lnstead my mother, the queen...

660
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:49,349
gave birth to an evil...

661
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,183
that murdered their prince.

662
01:09:53,922 --> 01:09:55,514
To hide this shame...

663
01:09:55,557 --> 01:09:58,720
they imprisoned the Minotaur
in this labyrinth...

664
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:02,492
and they told the people...

665
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,329
that a man from
your village came...

666
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,594
and murdered
the heir to their throne.

667
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,339
And that is why they take us?

668
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,710
Yes.

669
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:22,342
To feed the monster they created.

670
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,650
Theo, l asked the leper
to find someone...

671
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,556
who could kill the beast.

672
01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:32,958
You know why
you came here, Theo.

673
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,925
lf the Minotaur is a god...

674
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:40,366
he would kill us all.

675
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:45,471
But if he isn't a god...

676
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,171
Then he will burn.

677
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,918
lt's strong here.

678
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,362
We're near the source.

679
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,964
The gas, it's behind here.

680
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,075
No!

681
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,550
Go, Theo, be from here.

682
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:47,692
Tyro.

683
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:50,796
Go, Theo, run! Run!

684
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:18,359
l have to help him!
You stay here!

685
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,424
You can't help him, Theo!

686
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,129
When you see it come,
stay under the water.

687
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,465
Hey!

688
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:03,843
Minotaur!

689
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,607
l'm here, Minotaur.

690
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,218
W--Where is it? l can't find it.

691
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,363
W--Where is it? Where is it?

692
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:40,630
Come here! Come here!

693
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,390
Come here. Come here!

694
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,091
Please...give it to me.

695
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,417
Come on, come on!

696
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,055
Did you kill it?

697
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,774
Thought you said there was
another way out.

698
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,575
The far side of the labyrinth.

699
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,599
Hurry!

700
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:21,408
Where are you going?

701
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,509
Morna?

702
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:30,891
Theo!

703
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,230
Watch your step!

704
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,135
Hurry! Quick!

705
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:26,968
The shepherd thinks
he's killed the god.

706
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:30,466
Young fool...

707
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:34,073
you cannot kill the Minotaur.

708
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:40,817
l was afraid l had lost you.

709
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:49,556
Brother...

710
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,392
be afraid.

711
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,868
The darkness awaits you.

712
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:11,072
You must love her always.

713
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,443
Without her,
you would never have come.

714
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:33,697
Take off your masks!

715
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,365
Remove your shame!

716
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,739
Take off your masks!

717
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,415
So the reign of the bull god
was over...

718
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:58,722
and the empire of a thousand years
faded into legend.

719
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,730
As a girl, l did not speak...

720
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,857
out of mourning for the village...

721
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,595
but now, at the end of my life...

722
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:10,263
the world has changed forever...

723
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:13,900
and my words will preserve
how that came to be.

724
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:21,740
The world would never forget
the shepherd who killed a god.
