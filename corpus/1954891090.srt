00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:53,717
What is it ?

2
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:55,502
Heather, she's in trouble.

3
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,503
You just had a nightmare.

4
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,998
I can feel that something is wrong.

5
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,490
Karen, you just talked to her yeaterday.

6
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm sure she's okay.

7
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,941
I know, but something's awful is gonna happen,
I can tell

8
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:15,209
You're just upset because she's moving away.

9
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:17,229
Babe, I'm sure she's fine.

10
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,361
It felt so real.
Roger, it felt so horrible.

11
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,719
I know, I know, baby.

12
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:26,081
Just try to get some sleep.

13
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:42,438
Hello.

14
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,058
Hello.

15
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,533
Are you there yet ?

16
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:50,706
No.

17
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:51,567
Not yet.

18
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:52,851
Four more miles.

19
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,485
Are you sure about this ?

20
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:56,354
Yes, I'm sure.

21
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:58,286
It's like you are moving
to the other side of the world

22
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:01,735
No, it's just at the other side of the valley.

23
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,107
I just think it's too soon.

24
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,643
You should be around your friends.
Around Roger and me.

25
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,302
I don't any friends who are friends with my ex.

26
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:14,738
You are the only friends I have,
and you are just a phone call away.

27
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,325
It's not the same.

28
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,680
I just don't think you should be running away.

29
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,004
Who's running ?
I'm driving.

30
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,720
Look, I just need a change of scenery.
I don't want to be reminded of him everywhere I go.

31
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:32,173
I know you're hurt, and, I'm, uh..
sorry about that.

32
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,714
Look, I'm losing you.
I'm gonna call when I get there, okay.

33
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,635
Dis you tell her about your dream ?

34
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,101
No, guess I'm too worried too much as it is.

35
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:45,419
You ? Worried too much ?

36
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,680
That is why I love you, baby.

37
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:20,831
Can I help you ?

38
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,244
No, but I can help you.

39
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,797
No, I'm not interested right now,
so if you're interested about my phone number..

40
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,865
Wait, I'm not lookig for a date.

41
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,835
What is that ?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

42
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:38,378
I didn't want to frighten you,
it'sjust that your brake lights are out.

43
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,157
I'm almost run into you back there.

44
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:44,412
Oh, God, I'm sorry..

45
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,176
Do you have far to go?

46
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,838
No, I just moved here,
I live a few miles up the road.

47
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,019
Well then you don't have to
drive much further than you have to.

48
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,689
You don't want to cause an accident or get a ticket.

49
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:58,447
No. I don't.

50
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,359
I'll get it looked at the first thing.

51
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,089
Well, if you like, I can follow you.

52
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,923
To get home safely.

53
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,576
Sure, thank you..

54
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,133
Marcus.

55
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,493
Marcus, I'm Heather.

56
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,149
Welcome to the Canyon, Heather.

57
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,461
Hello.

58
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:30,244
Who's there ?

59
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:32,889
You must be Heather.

60
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,402
I'm Mike, Mike Anderson.

61
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:38,546
Is everything alright?

62
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,623
Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't mean to stare,
I'm just, uh... thought you were gonna be a little older.

63
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,639
Oh, my father, he rented you this place.

64
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,672
We're both named Michael.

65
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:50,778
I'm sorry.

66
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,340
No, it's fine, we get that all the time.

67
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:55,859
He rents out the places,
and I take care of them.

68
00:09:56,981 --> 00:10:00,992
Speaking of which, your faucets, they fixed,
I added a few washers, presto, good to go.

69
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:06,241
And if I knew you were gonna be here earlier,
I'd finish it sooner, so, sorry about that.

70
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:10,367
No, it's okay, I just, need to
get out of the city.

71
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,155
I'm here once a week,
to fix the pool, clean up everything.

72
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,826
So, if you need anythig at all,
please feel free to call me.

73
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,966
Yes, I will, I mean,
I won't hesitate to call.

74
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,465
Okay.

75
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,076
Well, it's nice meeting you.

76
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:30,864
I guess there's other property to attend to,
so.. Enjoy your stay.

77
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,407
I will.
Thank you.

78
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:33,672
You're welcome.

79
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,522
Think I'm gonna like it here.

80
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:50,657
Hello.

81
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:51,943
I'm here.

82
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:53,788
Finally ?
I'm starting to get worried.

83
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:55,937
I'm sorry, I was delayed.

84
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,798
Delayed ?
Delayed by what ?

85
00:10:58,013 --> 00:11:00,562
It's not important.
What's important is that I'm here.

86
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,715
Well, how do you like it ?

87
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:03,841
I love it.

88
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:05,868
I can't wait to incite you to come for dinner.

89
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,117
And bring the kids, they're gonna
love the pool.

90
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,090
We can't wait to see the place.

91
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,534
You should see my landlord.

92
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,908
Pretty hot, huh ?

93
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:16,529
I'll say..

94
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:18,167
Who's hot?
Are you talking about me again?

95
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,093
Oh, please.

96
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,075
Is that Roger?

97
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:20,873
Yes.

98
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:23,432
We're busted.

99
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:26,123
Oh, don't go there, then I will
really be in trouble.

100
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:27,823
You got that right.

101
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,951
You know, it's good to hear you laugh again.

102
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:32,607
Yes.

103
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,206
Give Roger my love.

104
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,997
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.

105
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,797
Hello.

106
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,281
I'm Heather.

107
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, yes.
You must be the new tenant.

108
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,780
I thought you're arriving this evening.

109
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,668
Yeah, I'm early.

110
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm Marisa.

111
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,215
Michael let me use the pool
when no one is renting.

112
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,956
I'm sorry, you probably wanna get settled in,
I'll just grab my things.

113
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:23,445
No, that's okay. Stay.

114
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,976
I've got to get goind anyway.
My boyfriend's expecting me.

115
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,111
It was a pleasure meeting you.

116
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:25,005
Hello.

117
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,124
Marisa, right?

118
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:29,146
Yes.

119
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,266
You remembered.

120
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,622
This is Daniel.

121
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:32,880
Nice to meet you Daniel.

122
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:34,514
You all settled in?

123
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:35,806
Just about.

124
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:39,320
Well if you need anything, we're just atl 642.

125
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,583
Yes, anything at all.

126
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:45,140
In fact, if you don't have dinner plans tomorrow night,
maybe you'd like to join us.

127
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,976
We don't own a pool, but..

128
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,463
Then why don't we have dinner here ?

129
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,432
Please, I'll cook, I insist.

130
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:51,600
Are you sure?

131
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:55,116
Yes, I'm sure, bring along your swimsuits, we
can hang out by the pool.

132
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,975
Sounds good, we'll gonna have a party.

133
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:00,796
You know, we're alone here,
so we appreciated the company.

134
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:06,930
Well, yes, I'm excited. That's why I moved,
to get away from it all.

135
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:07,974
Right, Daniel.

136
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,644
- So, 6 sounds good ?
- 6 it is.

137
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,026
Great.

138
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,804
- Great.
- See you tomorrow.

139
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:19,751
- Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,920
Where is she ?

141
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:45,076
Feels great.

142
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,514
She's gorgeous, isn't she ?

143
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,768
I think I had one too many margaritas.

144
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,853
Or maybe, you need one more.

145
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,850
You kissed a woman before ?

146
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,146
Well, actually that was my first.

147
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,054
Not even in college ?

148
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:17,896
No.

149
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:22,849
You prove I'm right.

150
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,027
I'm not.

151
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:25,873
Yes you are.

152
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:26,762
Was not.

153
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,018
Well, you are not like Marisa.

154
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,125
She's exhibitionist.

155
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,417
Oh, really.

156
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:04,177
Are you happy?

157
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:05,376
Yes.

158
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,247
Can I have my bra back?

159
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,348
Here.

160
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,366
Well maybe I am.

161
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,712
Wasn't so bad, was it ?

162
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:47,494
What about Marisa?

163
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:50,764
What about her?

164
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,471
She's your girlfriend.

165
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:56,611
We have a very open relationship.

166
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,618
She's be out here any minute.

167
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:10,548
No, Marisa is probably inside,
passed out, right now.

168
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,552
Why do you like it here in Canyon?

169
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,324
You hiding out?

170
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,111
What makes you think I'm hidin out?

171
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,659
Well, that's why people moved here, right ?

172
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:42,750
To get away from everything.

173
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:46,406
Well, I just had to get away froom the city.

174
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:55,393
Oh, so you just woke up one day,
and said, "I'm gonna move to some secluded place all by myself?"

175
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,474
Yes.

176
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,594
I don't buy it.

177
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,593
What about you?

178
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:03,197
What about me?

179
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:05,603
Why are you here ?

180
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,237
Are you hiding from something?

181
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:10,715
The law?

182
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,462
No, Why ?
Why'd you hear?

183
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,292
Wanna know the truth?

184
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:20,473
Truth would be nice.

185
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,875
I.. hate people.

186
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:33,545
I.. moved here to get away from the city.
It's just... too many people.

187
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:35,643
Really.

188
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,778
Well, since you're being so honest.

189
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:46,132
I moved here to get away from my ex-husband.

190
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:48,197
Oh, the ex-husband.

191
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,406
Everywhere I went, he went.

192
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:54,737
Is he stalking you?

193
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,294
We're both writers.

194
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,243
We work in the same magazine,
the same editors.

195
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:04,968
We go to the same parties,
I just had to leave.

196
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,015
I see.

197
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,766
Well, I don't wanna bore you with my stories
about my exhusband.

198
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:15,988
I moved here so I won't think about 'em,
talk about 'em.

199
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,302
There you go, I'm rambling again,
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,920
It's okay, I love ramblings.

201
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,487
Would you uh, like another cup ?

202
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,896
No thanks, I'd be up all night.

203
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,088
Looks I gotta get myself home.

204
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,857
Yeah, you were right about her.

205
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,095
Thanks for tonight.

206
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,359
Bye.

207
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,833
Nice meeting you Daniel.

208
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:16,917
You all settled in?

209
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,891
Just about.

210
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:21,446
Well if you need anything, we're just at 642.

211
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:23,410
Yes, anything at all.

212
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:29,782
Well, then why don't we have dinner here?

213
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,495
Please, I insist.

214
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,471
Are you sure?

215
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:41,531
Yes, That's why we moved here, to get away from ..

216
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,124
Right Daniel?

217
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,875
So, is 6 okay ?

218
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,121
Well, see you tomorrow.

219
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,993
I think I had one too many margaritas.

220
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,160
Or maybe you need one more.

221
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,541
She's an exhibitionist.

222
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,657
Oh, really ?

223
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:25,844
Kissed a woman before?

224
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:53,383
What about Marisa?

225
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,848
Oh, good morning.

226
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,007
Oh, God.
You scared me.

227
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:50,243
I'm sorry.

228
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:52,309
Has it been a week already?

229
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,552
No, but Marisa called me way too early this morning, asked me to heat the pool.

230
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:58,571
She did?

231
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,003
I didn't think she'll be up til noon.

232
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,942
You guys got a hangover fro the party last night?

233
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:05,570
How did you know?

234
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,115
Well, looks like it's gonna be a hot one today.

235
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,669
It's noon now, so..

236
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,645
Did you say noon?

237
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:25,946
S*it, s*it, my editor's gonna be here any minute.

238
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:37,806
Nice place.

239
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,070
Thanks, I'm glad you like  it.

240
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:46,044
Yes, but the drive Heather, it's making me nauseous.

241
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,788
You get used to it after a while.
Besides, I don't drive to town that often.

242
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,630
I can tell you one thing about this place.

243
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:55,776
It's doing you some good.

244
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:57,613
You think so?

245
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:58,655
I know so.

246
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,030
The last articles you sent me were really good.

247
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:02,316
Thanks Collin.

248
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,791
Hearing that from you means a great deal.

249
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:06,917
And you look great.

250
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,431
Seriously, you really had me worried.

251
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,281
Everybody worry about me too  much.

252
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,783
But I guess that's what's friends are for, huh.

253
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:15,804
Yeah.

254
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:20,614
So, how are you doing, really?

255
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,230
Good, actually.

256
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,397
Good enough to go to a party in a few weeks?

257
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,898
'Cos I got a lot of clients who's really interested
in your manuscripts.

258
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:30,420
Sure.

259
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,497
You know who'd probably be there.

260
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:36,586
You mean Michael.

261
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,446
Are you ready for that?

262
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,399
Is she still with that ??

263
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,353
Yeah, I hear she's a writer now, but with a tabloid.

264
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,537
She's no writer.
She just knows how to spread those legs of hers.

265
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:15,390
I ran to both of them at the party.

266
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,037
Man, she was drunk.

267
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,340
She was all over anyone who was anyone.

268
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:22,310
I'm pretty sure Carl was embarrassed.

269
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,934
He should be.

270
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,056
I think he realises he's made a pretty big mistake.

271
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:31,762
He sure did, and now he has to
live with the consequences.

272
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:34,679
He's got nothing on you, Heather.

273
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,725
Thanks Collin, I needed that.

274
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:51,583
Hello.

275
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,499
Is this the beautiful lady with the lovely breast?

276
00:26:55,766 --> 00:27:00,490
Daniel, can I help you?
Or should I report this as a prank phone call?

277
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,103
Don't call the cops.

278
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:05,530
Listen, I heard it's supposed to be a nice day today.

279
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,840
Rather hot, actually.

280
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:09,618
So I've heard.

281
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:13,283
Well, a dip in the pool would be nice.

282
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:15,797
Are you inviting yourself over?

283
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:17,278
Of course, I'd love to.

284
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:19,193
See you in a few.

285
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:21,155
See you soon.

286
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,114
You're getting burnt.

287
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:48,153
No.

288
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,473
Manuscript you're working on, what's it all about ?

289
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:53,686
Well, it's about a woman,
who loses her husband to cancer.

290
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:57,349
And how she deals with her loneliness in
the years following.

291
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:01,460
Wow, how'd you get the idea?
Sounds depressing.

292
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:02,851
It was.

293
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:06,330
She was actually a friend of mine.

294
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,611
How's she doing now?

295
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:10,748
She's great.

296
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,318
She remarried.

297
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,597
Her story was so inspiring.

298
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,955
There is life, after the death of the loved one.

299
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:23,810
I'd love to read it some time.

300
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:25,957
When it's finished.

301
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,108
You'd be the first one.

302
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,300
Besides my editor.

303
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:32,325
I'd like that.

304
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:41,052
Why so serious, lighten up.

305
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:57,026
See you later.

306
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,830
When do you two meet?

307
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,180
Love at first sight?

308
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,612
Something like that.

309
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,135
She's very beautiful.

310
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:20,092
Yes, she is.

311
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,663
But it's not what attracted me to her.

312
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:25,629
Yeah, she's open-minded.

313
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:30,142
She doesn't try to change me,
she accepts me for who I am.

314
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,762
Who would wanna change you?

315
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,397
Most women are insecure.

316
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:36,979
I see.

317
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,194
Do you love her?

318
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,618
I care for her deeply.

319
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:50,120
But I'm not in love with her.

320
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:52,291
She's perfect.

321
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:57,231
I just don't see me spending the
rest of my live with her.

322
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,773
Does she know that?

323
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,875
Let's not talk about marisa.
Let's talk about you.

324
00:31:04,194 --> 00:31:05,431
What about me?

325
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:12,091
You're beautiful.
You're perfect.

326
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:17,180
You are.

327
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,340
And you're shy.

328
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:24,437
I'm just not being used to
being talked that way, that's all.

329
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,847
Get used to it.

330
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:13,078
Glad you came.

331
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,239
Thanks for having me.

332
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,326
Here's the lovely ladies in the Canyon.

333
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:21,657
Thank you.

334
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:28,765
This calls for some music.

335
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:38,264
I love the song.

336
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,767
- Hello.
-Where were you last night?

337
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:10,425
What ?

338
00:38:10,908 --> 00:38:13,109
I call you house several times,
I was worried.

339
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,609
I was out.

340
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:17,053
Out where?
With whom?

341
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,025
My friends were having dinner party.

342
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:21,018
It got kinda late.

343
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,277
I see.

344
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,767
So, did you anyone intsresting at this party?

345
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,957
No, just a party, my neighbours
Daniel and Marisa.

346
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:30,524
I told you about them.

347
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,379
Doesn't sound much like a party.

348
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,581
Oh, but it was.

349
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:44,084
Karen, I did something that I never dream
of when I was single.

350
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,675
What did you do?

351
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,893
I spent the night.

352
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,235
With Daniel?

353
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,774
With both of them.

354
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:59,200
I guess, if that's what they're calling it.

355
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,499
What was it like?

356
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,665
It was indescribable.

357
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:11,089
I think I'm falling for him.

358
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:12,250
Who?

359
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,686
Daniel.

360
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:15,975
What about his girlfriend?

361
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:19,389
That's why Roger and I never had a threesome.

362
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,545
I don't want some woman falling for my husband.

363
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,226
You don't have anything to worry about Roger.

364
00:39:24,473 --> 00:39:26,742
He would never astray, he loves you.

365
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:28,783
He better not.
I'd kill him.

366
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,763
It's not like Daniel's married or anything,
they were only living together for a few months.

367
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,144
But that's not a woman scorned.

368
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:37,620
But it's meant to be.

369
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,778
I never had this feelings in a long time.

370
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,943
I think he has the same feelings for me.

371
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:48,313
I think you better chalked it up as fantasy fulfilled
and let it go.

372
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:51,181
I know.

373
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,415
You are right, again.

374
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,727
I know I'm right.

375
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:57,769
You don't want some crazy b*tch
running after you for stealing her man.

376
00:39:59,348 --> 00:40:02,892
Besides, he sounds like he has
commitment issues.

377
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,150
Sounds like your ex.

378
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:26,849
He's nothing like Kyle.

379
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,090
I'm Heather, leave me a message.

380
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:06,971
Hey, it's Daniel.
Just trying to get a hold of you again.

381
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:09,675
Give me a call.

382
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:12,695
Bye.

383
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:34,468
You are calling her again.

384
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:37,703
Yes. I was.

385
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,095
Do you love her?

386
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:44,502
You're starting to get jealous, Marisa.

387
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,178
You have nothing to be jealous about.

388
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,845
Then why are you so obsessed with her?

389
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,565
I'm not obsessed with her

390
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:55,012
Am I not enough?

391
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:59,300
Babe, you know the answer to that.

392
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:01,931
Come here.

393
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,948
Come here.
I don't wanna fight.

394
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:25,045
Hello neighbour.

395
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:29,302
Oh, Marcus right.

396
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:31,400
Good memory.

397
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,607
Thanks again about those brake lights.

398
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:35,231
No problem.

399
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:39,210
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

400
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:41,797
I didn't know.

401
00:43:42,855 --> 00:43:43,661
It's okay.

402
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,711
It's nice to see you again,
but I gotta keep moving.

403
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:53,569
I'm sure we'll cross paths again.
Soon.

404
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:04,552
Oh, Hye Daniel.

405
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:07,708
Do you know that guy?

406
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,051
Nice to see you too.

407
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:11,752
Heather, do you know him?

408
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,606
Yeah, I met him before.

409
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:16,839
Well, stay away from him.
That guy is a creep.

410
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,481
What makes you say that?

411
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:23,205
I caught him following Marisa couple of times.

412
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:25,952
Until I scare him away.

413
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:27,588
You'rekidding.

414
00:44:28,313 --> 00:44:30,330
I never seen her in while, but..

415
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:35,880
Until about a week ago, he was driving by
my house a couple of time.

416
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:37,875
Just to let me know he was still there.

417
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:40,629
Oh, God.

418
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:42,973
He knows where I live.

419
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,967
Just keep your doors locked, all the time, okay?

420
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:50,566
I will.

421
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:54,061
Let's go.

422
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:14,560
Thanks for jogging with me home.

423
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:17,549
You know, I called you a few times.

424
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:25,084
Yeah, I know, I've been busy.
Deadlines.

425
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:31,216
About the other night,
Are you okay with that?

426
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:34,402
Yes, of course.

427
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:37,348
Then why you didn't return any of phone calls?

428
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:40,414
You want the truth ?

429
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,694
The truth would be nice.

430
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:51,417
The truth is I never dated anyone since my divorce.

431
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:55,588
And it's been a while since I had any fun.

432
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:59,185
I like the both of you.

433
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:03,261
- But..
- But ?

434
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,266
Daniel, I can't stop thinking about you.

435
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:13,918
I can't stop thinking about you either.

436
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:22,387
It's not fair to Marisa.
It's not fair to me.

437
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:25,579
What do you mean?

438
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:39,407
I mean, I'm sitting at home, alone.
Thinking of you, sleeping with her.

439
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:43,792
I just don't wanna get hurt right now, that's all.

440
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:50,676
I think I should stay away for a while
until my feelings subside.

441
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,913
I'm still emotionally confused right now.

442
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:57,732
That's what you feel?

443
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:00,549
Yeah.

444
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:03,279
Yeah.

445
00:47:04,265 --> 00:47:05,244
Are you sure?

446
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,962
Daniel, I gotta go.

447
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:45,288
Daniel, what are you doing here this late?

448
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,933
I want to sleep with you.

449
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,093
I don't know why are you doing this.

450
00:49:58,529 --> 00:49:59,374
She knows you.

451
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:05,998
I want you, Daniel.

452
00:50:08,663 --> 00:50:10,098
You don't know me.

453
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,001
I want to know you.

454
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,987
I have needs.
I have desires that most women-

455
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:27,672
I know, I'm fine with  that.

456
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:33,338
Do you realise what you're asking me to do?

457
00:50:35,886 --> 00:50:36,874
Yes.

458
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:39,486
Whatever you want.

459
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:43,919
I want you.

460
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,004
What's going on ?

461
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:03,824
I gotta talk to Marisa.

462
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:04,937
Right now ?

463
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:07,150
I've gotta let her know my feelings for you.

464
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,631
What are your feelings for me ?

465
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:19,680
I think you know.

466
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,709
I won't be able to see you for a few days.

467
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,259
You are so bad.

468
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:39,591
Don't, she knew I wasn't serious about her anyway.

469
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:43,215
Doesn't make me feel any better.

470
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:48,563
Listen, I'm not gonna let her stand in
ther way of me losing you.

471
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:18,699
I see you found my key.

472
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:21,991
It paractically had my name on it.

473
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:29,149
I miss you.

474
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,688
Daniel, I haven't of you in a week

475
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:36,358
No phone call, no anything.
I'm beginning to think you change your mind about us.

476
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:37,514
Never.

477
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:40,399
What took you so long?

478
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:46,533
- She's gone now.
- Where ?

479
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:49,976
It's not important.

480
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,473
What matters is that we're together now.

481
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,483
Daniel, I've gotta go.

482
00:53:57,772 --> 00:54:00,536
I have meetings with my editor,
and some important clients.

483
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:03,910
I can't be late, this is very important.

484
00:54:47,956 --> 00:54:49,452
Oh, Daniel.

485
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,789
You scared me.

486
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,930
You're home late.

487
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,914
What are you doing here sitting around in the dark?

488
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,358
take your blouse off.

489
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:02,431
What, now ?

490
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:15,418
Daniel.

491
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:47,075
How did you two celebrate ?

492
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:48,045
I don't know.

493
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,746
He's being so secretive.

494
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,759
he says he has a surprise for me.

495
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:55,724
Can you believe it,
we've been together six months.

496
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:57,730
You think it's a ring?

497
00:55:58,497 --> 00:55:59,322
Karen?

498
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:02,619
You think ?

499
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,990
No, it's too soon.

500
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:08,639
Wouldn't that be something, though ?

501
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:11,108
Yeah, you sound so happy.

502
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,176
I am.

503
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:15,014
I love him, Karen.

504
00:56:18,974 --> 00:56:20,058
What is it?

505
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:21,419
You'll see.

506
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:24,285
Would you give me a hint?

507
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:25,632
No.

508
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:27,115
But it'll get warmer.

509
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:35,390
Daniel, what is this?

510
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:43,572
You hire a prostitute on my birthday ?

511
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:45,088
Callgirl.

512
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,173
I thought you like her,
she's o beautiful.

513
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:50,061
You brought a whore in my house?

514
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:55,421
I'm leaving.

515
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:58,137
No, wait.
Please just stay.

516
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,516
Give me one minute.

517
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:14,822
Daniel, it's my birthday.

518
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:16,385
I know it's your  birthday.

519
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:18,835
And I thought you like the gift I got.

520
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,875
- Instead you've been acting like ungrateful..
- What ?

521
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,163
You heard me.

522
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:29,183
I thought we could use a little excitement around here.

523
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:31,570
Clebrate.

524
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,755
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.

525
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,663
This is a very special day.

526
00:57:36,715 --> 00:57:40,361
Well it's just the two of us.

527
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:49,143
Now look, I paid a lot of money for it.

528
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:52,256
So you either stay here and sulk,
or get back in and have a good time.

529
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:53,503
It's up to you.

530
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:51,298
Hey.

531
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,996
I forgot my suit.

532
01:00:56,415 --> 01:00:58,009
Would you go in and make out?

533
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,557
No, I think we've already covered that.

534
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:03,762
I'm on my way out anyway.

535
01:01:04,038 --> 01:01:05,666
But we should this again, some times.

536
01:01:05,952 --> 01:01:08,058
Yes, I will give you a great reference.

537
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:18,581
Happy birthday.

538
01:01:26,847 --> 01:01:30,608
I'm surprised you didn't ask her to move in.

539
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,958
What is wrong with you?

540
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,042
I just want you all to myself.

541
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:36,728
You have me all to yourself.
What more do you want?

542
01:01:37,884 --> 01:01:39,850
Are you starting to get jealous?

543
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:44,635
Look ,you have me hooked.

544
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,809
But I have needs.

545
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:48,953
I know.

546
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:52,859
But I thought you love me and not want anyone else.

547
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:54,860
I do love you.

548
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,168
But don't try to change me.

549
01:01:56,432 --> 01:01:58,374
You knew al this going into the relationship.

550
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,164
I know.

551
01:02:04,713 --> 01:02:05,654
I'm sorry.

552
01:02:08,413 --> 01:02:10,093
I said I was sorry.

553
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,346
Look, I'll only be going for a few days.

554
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,080
For what?

555
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:18,984
I have some business to take care of.

556
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:22,010
Some nuisance.

557
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:23,345
I'll be back before you know it.

558
01:02:44,016 --> 01:02:45,575
Oh, it's you.

559
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:47,287
What do you want?

560
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,432
I've come to talk to you about your neighbours.
Daniel and Marisa.

561
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:53,393
Daniel already told me about you.
He said you were some kind of pervert.

562
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:54,624
Goodbye.

563
01:02:54,624 --> 01:02:56,173
Is that what Daniel told you? 

564
01:02:56,958 --> 01:03:01,900
Did he also told you that I've been watching his every move since the disappereance of his last girlfriend?

565
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:05,832
You're lying.
Go away.

566
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,046
I'm gonna call the police.

567
01:03:07,046 --> 01:03:08,676
I am  the police.

568
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:13,126
I'll be back withink the hour with a warrant.

569
01:03:14,173 --> 01:03:16,814
It'll be much easier if you'll just let me in.

570
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,095
I'll just leave my card on your door..

571
01:03:21,376 --> 01:03:23,734
Anyone can make those up.

572
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:28,507
Look Heather, Marisa is dead.

573
01:03:29,786 --> 01:03:31,779
I believe Daniel was behind it.

574
01:03:51,438 --> 01:03:52,834
When did this happened ?

575
01:03:54,588 --> 01:03:57,538
Police found her body this morning at the Canyon.

576
01:03:58,132 --> 01:03:59,753
What happened to her ?

577
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:02,497
I'm not liberty to discuss details.

578
01:04:04,828 --> 01:04:06,314
But we know it was Daniel.

579
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:08,388
We just need to find him.

580
01:04:11,035 --> 01:04:12,235
Do you know where he is?

581
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:17,626
No, business out of town.

582
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,585
When will he be returning to LA ?

583
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,293
I don't know.

584
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:29,891
Did he and Marisa had a fight ?
Is there anything you can tell me about their relationship?

585
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:32,144
I really don't know.

586
01:04:35,566 --> 01:04:38,008
I know I can come on pretty strong some time.

587
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:40,680
But this is very serious.

588
01:04:40,928 --> 01:04:45,608
We know Daniel killed Marisa.
As well as his last girlfriend, Laura.

589
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,373
Oh, my God.

590
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:51,238
Are you and Daniel intimate ?

591
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,289
Look, that's really none of your business.

592
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,901
I'm just rying to do my job.

593
01:04:56,342 --> 01:04:58,629
I'd like to catch him before he kills again.

594
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:00,181
The why don't you just arrest him?

595
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,221
Believe me, I would if I could.

596
01:05:03,473 --> 01:05:05,203
We just don't have significant evidence.

597
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:09,383
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

598
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:11,146
Do you know where he is ?

599
01:05:12,736 --> 01:05:13,486
No.

600
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:17,695
It's obvious that you're ready to talk right now.

601
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:23,032
If you can think of anything,
give me a call.

602
01:05:27,055 --> 01:05:30,238
Oh and lock your doors.

603
01:06:58,426 --> 01:06:59,718
Heather, it's me.
Let me in.

604
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:03,168
I can't right now, I'm busy.

605
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:06,805
Baby, open up door.

606
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,528
Can you come back a little later,
I'm not feeling well.

607
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:15,062
No, Daniel.

608
01:07:16,892 --> 01:07:17,956
What's got into you?

609
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:20,305
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

610
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:25,514
Marisa is dead.

611
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,852
They found her body at the bottom of the Canyon.

612
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:31,729
Look , I don't know what you've heard,
but you are wrong.

613
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,846
The guy you told me to stay away from,
he's a cop, isn't he ?

614
01:07:35,923 --> 01:07:38,311
The guy's a liar, and I told you to stay away from her.

615
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:40,093
Tell me what happened to Marisa.

616
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:42,768
I don't know.

617
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,189
You're a liar.

618
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:48,226
No, let me go.

619
01:09:08,156 --> 01:09:09,379
You're saved.

620
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:26,801
What am I doing here ?

621
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:30,466
You took a nasty fall.

622
01:09:31,354 --> 01:09:32,867
Why am I not in a hospital?

623
01:09:41,848 --> 01:09:43,518
Daniel may come looking for you.

624
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:46,113
I'm keeping you safe.

625
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:53,930
Don't worry about him.
You have me to protect you now.

626
01:09:55,993 --> 01:10:00,351
And soon, we'll become lovers.

627
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:02,458
Just like you and Daniel once were.

628
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:08,432
Save your lungs, my dear.
No one can hear you.

629
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,742
Let me go, bastard.

630
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,183
It's not very nice.

631
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,893
I'll be back when you've learn some manners.

632
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:10,962
Hello neighbour.

633
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:14,664
Oh, Marcus right.

634
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:16,068
Good memory.

635
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:19,247
Hey, thanks again about those brake lights.

636
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:20,893
No problem.

637
01:11:21,397 --> 01:11:27,964
I'm sorry, I thought you were...
I didn't know.

638
01:11:28,548 --> 01:11:29,377
It's okay.

639
01:11:31,423 --> 01:11:33,948
Nice to see you again, but, um,
I gotta keep moving.

640
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,810
We'll cross paths, soon.

641
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:38,261
Soon.

642
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,500
Hello Daniel.

643
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:55,531
Do you know that guy ?

644
01:11:55,765 --> 01:11:56,881
Nice to see you too.

645
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:58,376
Heather, do you know that guy ?

646
01:11:58,637 --> 01:12:01,302
Yeah, I've met him before.
he lives around the Canyon.

647
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:04,496
Well stay away from him.
That guy is a creep.

648
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,939
What makes you say that?

649
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:09,784
I caught him following Marisa couple of times.

650
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:12,422
Until I scare him away.

651
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:14,516
You're kidding.

652
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:19,396
I never seen her in while, but..

653
01:12:20,425 --> 01:12:22,486
Until about a week ago, he was driving by
my house a couple of time.

654
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,602
Just to let me know he was still there.

655
01:12:28,146 --> 01:12:29,284
He knows where I live.

656
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:34,627
Just keep your doors locked, all the time, okay?

657
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:37,451
I will.

658
01:12:39,172 --> 01:12:40,711
Let's go.

659
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:55,189
Heather, it's me.
Let me in.

660
01:12:55,428 --> 01:12:58,079
Heather, it's me.
Let me in.

661
01:12:58,617 --> 01:12:59,603
I can't right now, I'm busy.

662
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,510
Baby, open up door.

663
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,234
Can you come back a little later,
I'm not feeling well.

664
01:13:09,004 --> 01:13:10,140
No, Daniel.

665
01:13:11,707 --> 01:13:12,646
What's got into you?

666
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:15,163
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

667
01:13:19,271 --> 01:13:20,373
Marisa esta muerta.

668
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,664
They found her body at the bottom of the Canyon.

669
01:13:24,382 --> 01:13:26,775
Look , I don't know what you've heard,
but you are wrong.

670
01:13:27,514 --> 01:13:29,786
The guy you told me to stay away from,
he's a cop, isn't he ?

671
01:13:30,817 --> 01:13:33,174
The guy's a liar, and I told you to stay away from her.

672
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,569
Tell me what happened to Marisa.

673
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:37,207
I don't know.

674
01:13:39,389 --> 01:13:40,324
You're a liar.

675
01:13:41,842 --> 01:13:42,769
No, let me go.

676
01:14:34,407 --> 01:14:35,658
Are we in a better mood today ?

677
01:14:39,151 --> 01:14:40,536
What do you want from me ?

678
01:14:43,044 --> 01:14:45,613
A little nicer.
Please.

679
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:51,828
What do you want from me ?

680
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:53,877
Simple.

681
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:56,690
Love me.

682
01:14:58,236 --> 01:14:59,486
What?

683
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:01,205
Love me.

684
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:03,993
And I will set you free.

685
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:07,120
Love you?

686
01:15:08,191 --> 01:15:10,218
Is that such an unreasonable request?

687
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,645
I will treat you better than anyone.

688
01:15:16,226 --> 01:15:17,536
Especially Daniel.

689
01:15:19,867 --> 01:15:21,478
I bet he was a kinky bastard.

690
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:22,741
Wasn't he ?

691
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:24,150
Was ?

692
01:15:26,294 --> 01:15:28,976
Where is he ?

693
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:31,740
Probably back with Marisa.

694
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,930
That's where he was, you know.

695
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,734
When he said he had to take care of business.

696
01:15:37,993 --> 01:15:39,145
She's not dead ?

697
01:15:39,938 --> 01:15:40,777
Muerto.

698
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,047
Dead ?

699
01:15:44,447 --> 01:15:46,084
But they might as well be.

700
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:48,897
They were cheating on you, you know.

701
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:50,262
How dare you.

702
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:51,975
I was doing you a favor.

703
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,656
You can never have Daniel all to yourself.

704
01:15:57,642 --> 01:16:01,859
He has his needs, and you couldn't
give that to him.

705
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:04,976
That's none of your business, you psycho.

706
01:16:06,686 --> 01:16:11,440
If you are gonna be nasty,
I'm going to leave you alone again.

707
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:14,423
Wait.

708
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,307
I need to use the bathroom.

709
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:27,646
And some water would be nice.

710
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,268
That's my girl.

711
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:25,794
Marcus.

712
01:18:27,796 --> 01:18:28,957
Yes.

713
01:18:31,185 --> 01:18:33,516
Did you think you can get these cuffs off me now ?

714
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:38,414
No. It's too soon.

715
01:18:41,308 --> 01:18:42,731
Haven't I change enough ?

716
01:18:47,713 --> 01:18:49,796
We haven't make love yet.

717
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:56,053
That's not what our relationship is based on.

718
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:58,676
No.

719
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:03,663
Proof to me your feelings for me.

720
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:08,118
I do care for you.

721
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:12,085
Sweet Heather.

722
01:19:14,224 --> 01:19:15,343
But it's not enough.

723
01:19:26,732 --> 01:19:28,072
I'm making duck tonight.

724
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:29,496
Hope you like it.

725
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:49,557
Marcus.
- Yes.

726
01:19:51,716 --> 01:19:53,309
I think I'm ready.

727
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:56,432
Ready for what ?

728
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,830
To make love.

729
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:04,496
Are you sure ?

730
01:20:05,419 --> 01:20:08,530
Because I won't force you.

731
01:20:09,567 --> 01:20:11,048
No, or course not.

732
01:20:12,844 --> 01:20:16,907
Wait, how about some wine ?

733
01:20:18,471 --> 01:20:21,015
Yes, that should loosen us a bit.

734
01:20:22,463 --> 01:20:23,469
I'll be right back.

735
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:43,053
Some music would be nice.

736
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:46,974
Yes.
Any request ?

737
01:20:47,995 --> 01:20:50,756
No, I'm sure whatever you have is fine.

738
01:21:05,552 --> 01:21:06,561
How's that?

739
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:08,604
It's lovely.

740
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:28,650
Propose a toast.

741
01:21:29,363 --> 01:21:30,348
To us.

742
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:33,039
To us.

743
01:21:59,223 --> 01:22:00,438
Wait.

744
01:22:04,214 --> 01:22:06,567
I wanna dance for you first.

745
01:22:09,121 --> 01:22:09,988
Foreplay.

746
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:16,068
Could you undo my cuffs ?

747
01:22:22,508 --> 01:22:23,649
Don't try to escape.

748
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:27,399
I'm faster, and stronger than you.

749
01:22:29,018 --> 01:22:30,140
Besides,

750
01:22:30,633 --> 01:22:31,762
You'll live to regret it.

751
01:22:34,476 --> 01:22:35,424
I know.

752
01:22:55,797 --> 01:22:58,873
Enjoy.

753
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:18,933
This wine...

754
01:24:52,723 --> 01:24:54,349
Sleep forever.

755
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,157
I appreciate you letting me this.

756
01:25:50,069 --> 01:25:52,743
You kidding me ?
You've been through enough already.

757
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:55,987
It's good that the psycho's walled up.

758
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:58,523
He wouldn't stalk anyone anymore.

759
01:26:01,692 --> 01:26:02,799
It's too bad you're leaving.

760
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:06,122
Would have been nice to have as a  friend.

761
01:26:06,722 --> 01:26:08,300
It's pretty lonely out here, you know.

762
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,132
Yeah.
So I've heard.

763
01:29:36,764 --> 01:29:38,118
Welcome to The Canyon.

764
01:29:40,262 --> 01:29:43,693
If you like, I could follow you,
to get home safely.

765
01:30:04,743 --> 01:30:06,303
You're saved.
