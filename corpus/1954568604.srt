00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:08,326
(FATHER): / hope, my dear,
you have ordered a good dinner today,

2
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:12,799
because I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

3
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,844
Mr Bingley!

4
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,636
Why, Jane, you sly thing,
you never dropped a word!

5
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:21,002
(MOTHER): And no fish to be got!

6
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:24,523
Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill!

7
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:31,201
It is not Mr Bingley. It is a person I never saw
in the whole course of my life.

8
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:34,278
- Colonel Forster!
- Captain Carter!

9
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:36,438
No, I know. Denny!

10
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:44,436
About a month ago, I received this letter.

11
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:50,079
About a fortnight ago, I answered it, for it was
a case of some delicacy, requiring early attention.

12
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:53,717
It is from my cousin, Mr Collins,

13
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:58,403
who, when I am dead, may turn you all
out of this house as soon as he pleases.

14
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:02,196
Oh, my dear, pray don't mention that odious man!

15
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:07,361
It is the hardest thing in the world, that your
estate should be entailed away from your children.

16
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:12,203
Indeed, my dear, nothing can clear Mr Collins
of the iniquitous crime of inheriting Longbourn,

17
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:16,883
but if you'll listen to his letter, you may be
softened by how he expresses himself.

18
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:24,557
''My dear sir, the disagreement subsisting
between yourself and my late honoured father''

19
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:30,404
''always gave me much uneasiness, and since
I have had the misfortune to lose him...''

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,159
(LYDIA SNORTS)

21
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:37,355
''..to lose him, I have frequently wished
to heal the breach.''

22
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:42,043
There, Mrs Bennet. ''My mind, however,
is now made up on the subject...''

23
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:47,201
(COLLINS): ..for, having received my ordination
at Easter, /'ve been fortunate to be distinguished

24
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,077
by the patronage of the Right Honourable
Lady Catherine de Bourgh,

25
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:59,157
whose bounty and beneficience has preferred
me to the valuable rectory at Hunsford,

26
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:05,436
where it's my endeavour to demean myself
with grateful respect towards her Ladyship.

27
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:10,604
As a clergyman, moreover, / feel it my duty
to promote and establish

28
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:15,204
the blessing of peace in all families
within the reach of my influence,

29
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:20,964
and on these grounds / flatter myself that my
overtures of goodwill are highly commendable,

30
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:25,643
and will not lead you to reject
the offered olive branch.

31
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:30,801
/ am, sir, keenly conscious of being the means
of injuring your amiable daughters,

32
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,358
and assure you of my readiness to
make them every possible amends.

33
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:40,840
/ propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family on Monday the 18th...

34
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,364
Have care, Dawkins!

35
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:48,157
..and shall probably trespass on your hospitality
till the Saturday sevenight following.

36
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:52,320
/ shall travel as far as the turnpike
in my own modest equipage,

37
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:56,082
where / hope to catch the Bromley Post
at 35 minutes past ten,

38
00:03:56,247 --> 00:04:01,526
and thence to Watford, from whence
/ shall engage a hired carriage to Longbourn.

39
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:07,000
Where, God willing, you may expect me
by four in the afternoon.

40
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,237
And here he comes.

41
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,037
He must be an oddity, don't you think?

42
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:17,201
If he's disposed to make our girls any amends,
I shan't be the person to discourage him.

43
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:21,326
- Can he be a sensible man, sir?
- I think not, my dear.

44
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:26,402
Indeed, I have great hopes of finding him
quite the reverse.

45
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,558
(FATHER): Mr Collins!

46
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:35,525
You are very welcome!

47
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:45,358
My dear Mr and Mrs Bennet!

48
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,761
(FATHER): You seem very...

49
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,884
..fortunate in your patroness, sir.

50
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,515
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

51
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:06,364
Indeed I am, sir. I have been treated
with such affability, such condescension,

52
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:09,758
as I would never have dared to hope for.

53
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:14,318
I have been invited twice to dine at Rosings Park.

54
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:19,078
That so? Amazing.

55
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,238
Does she live near you, sir?

56
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:27,996
The garden, in which stands my humble abode,
is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park.

57
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,206
Only a lane, eh? Fancy that, Lizzy.

58
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:39,366
I think you said she was a widow, sir?
Has she any family?

59
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:45,796
She has one daughter, ma'am. The heiress
of Rosings, and of very extensive property.

60
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,720
And has she been presented at court?

61
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:55,639
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution
which unhappily prevents her being in town.

62
00:05:55,807 --> 00:06:00,642
And by that means,
as I told Lady Catherine myself one day,

63
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:05,517
she has deprived the British Court
of its brightest ornament.

64
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:11,517
You may imagine, sir, how happy I am on every
occasion to offer those little delicate compliments,

65
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:14,201
which are always acceptable to ladies.

66
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:22,319
That is fortunate for you, that you possess such
an extraordinary talent for flattering with delicacy.

67
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:28,843
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions
proceed from the impulse of the moment,

68
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,443
or are they the result of previous study?

69
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:37,880
They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time, sir.

70
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:42,643
I do sometimes amuse myself by writing down
and arranging such little compliments

71
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:46,117
as may be adapted to ordinary occasions.

72
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:49,518
But I try to give them as unstudied an air
as possible.

73
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:52,042
Excellent.

74
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,198
(FATHER): Excellent.

75
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:13,762
(COLLINS): I must confess myself quite
overwhelmed with the charms of your daughters.

76
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:18,284
Oh, you're very kind, sir.
They are sweet girls, though I say it myself.

77
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:21,962
Perhaps especially the eldest Miss Bennet?

78
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,437
Ah, yes, Jane is admired wherever she goes.

79
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:31,239
But I think I should tell you, I think it
very likely she will be very soon engaged.

80
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:36,239
- Ah.
- As for my younger daughters, if any of them...

81
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:39,524
In their case I know of no prior attachment at all.

82
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,279
Ah.

83
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,517
We're going to Meryton
to see if Denny is returned from town!

84
00:07:56,687 --> 00:08:00,396
Perhaps you would care for a little exercise,
Mr Collins?

85
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:03,805
Indeed I would, Mrs Bennet.

86
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,478
Cousin Elizabeth!

87
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:12,723
Would you do me the great honour
of walking with me into town?

88
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,837
(COLLINS): You visit your Aunt Philips in Meryton
frequently, I understand?

89
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:30,000
(LIZZY): Yes, she is fond of company,
but you'll find her gatherings poor affairs

90
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,283
after the splendours of Rosings Park.

91
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:38,283
No, I think not. I believe I possess the happy
knack, much to be desired in a clergyman,

92
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:43,237
of adapting myself to every kind of society,
whether high or low.

93
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:48,037
- That is fortunate indeed.
- Yes, indeed, and though it is a gift of nature,

94
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:54,203
constant study has enabled me, I flatter myself,
to make a kind of art of it.

95
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:20,807
There! I'm sure that's new in since Friday.
Isn't it nice? Don't you think I'd look well in it?

96
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,686
- Not as well as me. Come on!
- No, I shan't.

97
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:27,442
Jane! Come here. Look at this!

98
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,441
Jane, I'm determined to have this bonnet!

99
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,404
Look, there's Denny!

100
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,275
- Where?
- There. Look!

101
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:38,203
- (KITTY): Who's with him?
- (LYDIA): Don't know.

102
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,404
- (KITTY): He's handsome!
- (LYDIA): He might be if he were in regimentals.

103
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:45,560
- A man looks nothing without regimentals!
- They're looking over.

104
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,400
Lizzy, isn't he mightily good-looking?

105
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,127
- Denny!
- Lydia!

106
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:57,640
We thought you were still in town!

107
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:02,722
There was nothing amusing enough to hold us
there. May I introduce my friend George Wickham?

108
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,277
Miss Bennet, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
Miss Mary Bennet,

109
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:10,042
Miss Catherine Bennet and Miss Lydia Bennet.

110
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:12,880
This is our cousin, Mr Collins.

111
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,561
Do you stay long in Meryton, Mr Wickham?

112
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:20,721
All winter, I'm happy to say. I've taken
a commission in Colonel Forster's regiment.

113
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,879
There, Lydia! He will be dressed in regimentals.

114
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:28,040
And lend them much distinction, I dare say.
Outswagger us all, eh, Wickham?

115
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,675
You misrepresent me to these young ladies.

116
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,920
- Shall you come with us to Aunt Philips tonight?
- (KITTY): Denny is coming!

117
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,647
(LYDIA): It's only supper and cards.

118
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:42,358
- I haven't been invited by Mr and Mrs Philips.
- (LYDIA): No one cares about that nowadays!

119
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:47,237
(WICKHAM): If Mrs Philips extended the invitation
to include me, I should be delighted.

120
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,878
(KITTY): Look, Jane. It's Mr Bingley!

121
00:10:56,847 --> 00:11:01,363
How very fortunate! We were on our way
to Longbourn to ask after your health.

122
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:05,521
(JANE): You're very kind, sir.
I'm quite recovered, as you see.

123
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,679
(BINGLEY): Yes. I'm very glad to know it.

124
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:31,359
- Look, there's Denny!
- And Chamberlayne.

125
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:35,156
(COLLINS): ..such a variety of social intercourse.

126
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:40,085
What a charming apartment you have here,
Mrs Philips.

127
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:45,680
Upon my word, it reminds me greatly
of the small summer breakfast room at Rosings!

128
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,756
Does it indeed, sir?
I'm much obliged to you, I'm sure.

129
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:53,363
I'm sure Mr Collins wishes to pay a compliment,
Aunt.

130
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:55,757
Does he? I see.

131
00:11:56,007 --> 00:12:01,001
Rosings Park, we must understand,
is very grand indeed.

132
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,158
Indeed it is!

133
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:06,717
My dear Madam, if you thought I intended
any slight

134
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:11,403
on your excellent and very comfortable
arrangements, I am mortified!

135
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:16,800
Rosings Park is the residence of my noble
patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

136
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,162
Oh, now I understand.

137
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,957
(COLLINS): The chimney piece in the second
drawing room alone cost 800 pounds!

138
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:27,403
(MRS PHILPS): Now I see,
there's no offence at all.

139
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:33,442
Will you oblige me and sit down
to a game of whist?

140
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:38,886
I must confess I know little of the game, madam,
but I shall be glad to improve myself.

141
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:42,642
If my fair cousin will consent to release me?

142
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,077
With all my heart, sir.

143
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:07,120
Oh, Mr Collins!

144
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,041
- What were trumps again?
- Hearts, Mr Collins! Hearts.

145
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,362
I must confess I thought I'd never escape
your younger sisters.

146
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:35,115
They can be very determined. Lydia especially.

147
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:40,997
But they're pleasant girls. I find that society
in Hertfordshire quite exceeds my expectations.

148
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,283
I don't see Mr Bingley and his friends here.

149
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:50,679
I think some of Mr Bingley's friends
would consider it beneath their dignity.

150
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,439
Really?

151
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:57,043
Have you known Mr Darcy long?

152
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,999
- About a month.
- I've known him all my life.

153
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:05,236
- We played together as children.
- But...

154
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:07,875
Yes, you're surprised.

155
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,925
Perhaps you noticed the cold manner
of our greeting?

156
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:13,838
I confess I did.

157
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,638
Do you...

158
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,959
Are you much acquainted with Mr Darcy?

159
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,439
As much as I ever wish to be.

160
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:31,125
I've spent three days in the same house with him,
and I find him very disagreeable.

161
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:36,437
I fear there are few who would share
that opinion... except myself.

162
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:43,205
But he's not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
Everybody is disgusted with his pride.

163
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,195
Do you know...

164
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:50,326
- Does he intend to stay long at Netherfield?
- I do not know.

165
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:54,480
I hope his being in the neighbourhood
will not affect your plans to stay.

166
00:14:54,647 --> 00:15:00,119
Thank you. But it is not for me to be driven away
by Mr Darcy.

167
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:03,199
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.

168
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:09,158
We're not on friendly terms, but I have no reason
to avoid him but one: he's done me great wrong.

169
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:17,165
His father, the late Mr Darcy, was my Godfather,
and one of the best men that ever breathed.

170
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,607
My father was his steward,

171
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:26,478
and when he died, old Mr Darcy cared for me,
provided for me, loved me, I believe,

172
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:31,801
as though I were his own son.
He intended me for the church.

173
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:36,765
And it was my dearest wish
to enter into that profession.

174
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:42,240
But after he died,
and the living he'd promised me fell vacant,

175
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:47,245
the son refused point blank
to honour his father's promises.

176
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:51,920
And so, you see,
I have to make my own way in the world.

177
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:56,444
This is quite shocking!
I had not thought Mr Darcy as bad as this.

178
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:00,725
To descend to such malicious revenge.
He deserves to be publicly disgraced!

179
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,806
Some day he will be, but not by me.

180
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:07,198
Till I can forget his father,
I can't defy or expose him.

00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:16,875
(LIZZY): I wonder at the pride of this man.
How abominable!

183
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:20,323
You're more temperate than I'd be
in your situation.

184
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:25,445
Well, I have not the resentful temper
that some men have.

185
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:30,601
And my situation, you know, is not so bad.
At present I have every cause for cheer!

186
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,680
I can't bear to be idle,

187
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,725
and my new profession gives me
active employment.

188
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,640
My fellow officers are excellent men.

189
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:43,800
And now I find myself in a society
as agreeable as any I've ever known.

I absolutely forbid you to feel sorry for me!

191

Lizzy? Lizzy, why should you feel sorry
for Mr Wickham?

192
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:54,281
Why? Because...

193
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,519
Because I've not had a dance
these three months together!

194
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:01,316
Poor Mr Wickham! Well, you shall have one now.

197
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:23,885
I cannot believe it!

198
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:29,644
Mr Darcy's respect for his father's wishes wouldn't
allow him to behave in such an unChristian way.

199
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:35,245
Lizzy, consider, how could his most intimate
friends be so deceived in him?

200
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,162
I could more easily imagine Mr Bingley
being imposed upon,

201
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,956
than to think that Mr Wickham
could invent such a history!

202
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,925
I believe you like Mr Wickham, Lizzy.

203
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:51,206
I confess I do like him.

204
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,479
I do not see how anyone could not like him.

205
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,796
There's something very open and artless
in his manner.

206
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,765
He feels deeply, I believe,

207
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:07,603
and yet has a natural merriment and energy,
despite all this.

208
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,725
Yes, Jane, I confess I like him very much.

209
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,997
But after so short an acquaintance,

210
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,204
do you think we should believe in him
so implicitly?

211
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:21,756
How could he be doubted?

212
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:26,200
He gave me all the circumstances, Jane.
Names, facts.

213
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:29,805
And everything without ceremony.

214
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:34,040
Let Mr Darcy contradict it!
Besides, there was truth in all his looks.

215
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,716
It is difficult, indeed.

216
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,885
It is distressing. One does not know what to think.

217
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:49,326
I beg your pardon,
one knows exactly what to think!

218
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:54,356
(MOTHER): 0h, girls! Girls, we have all been
invited to a ball at Netherfield!

219
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,518
- I love a ball!
- So do I!

220
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:59,963
This will be a compliment to you, Jane, you know.

221
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,122
The invitation includes you, Mr Collins.

222
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:11,796
But shall you accept, sir? Would it be
entirely proper? Would your bishop approve?

223
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,959
Your scruples do you credit, my dear cousin.

224
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:22,044
I am of the opinion that a ball of this kind, given
by a man of good character to respectable people,

225
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,641
can have no evil tendency.

226
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:28,322
And I am so far from objecting to dancing myself,

227
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:33,686
that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of
all my fair cousins during the evening!

228
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:40,526
And I take this opportunity of soliciting yours...

I dare say you'll be able to imagine the scope
of the whole, Mr Wickham,

233
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:05,604
when I tell you that the chimney piece alone,
in the second drawing room,

234
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:08,201
cost all of 800 pounds!

235
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,565
800 pounds, sir! I hazard a guess
it must be a very large one?

236
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,560
It is very large, indeed, sir.

237
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:19,276
- Her Ladyship is fond of a good blaze, then?
- Oh...

How fortunate! I must claim you
for my sister Mary.

240
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:29,035
She's found a passage in Fordyce's Sermons
that she can't make out.

241
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:33,758
- Well, I...
- I believe it is of great doctrinal import, sir.

242
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:37,525
- In that case...
- You're very kind, sir.

245

..wholesome.

246
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:54,882
And there is plenty to be had of it, I assure you!

247
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:01,722
- Have you made Mr Bingley's acquaintance yet?
- No.

248
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:07,325
But I'm disposed to approve of him. He has issued
a general invitation to the officers for his ball,

249
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,797
which has caused great joy
in more than one quarter.

250
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:14,676
- He must be a very amiable gentleman.
- Oh, yes.

251
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:20,080
He is eager to approve of everyone he meets, but
he's a sensible man, with taste and judgement.

252
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:26,083
I wonder very much how Mr Darcy could impose
upon him. He cannot know what Mr Darcy is.

253
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:31,407
Probably not. Mr Darcy can please what he
chooses, if he thinks it worth his while.

254
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,321
Among his equals in wealth and consequence,
he can be liberal-minded,

255
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:38,479
honourable, even agreeable.

256

I wish I could call her amiable.

259
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:57,956
As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing,
and fond of me.

260
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:04,999
I've devoted hours to her amusement, but she is
grown too much like her brother. Very... proud.

261
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:09,840
I never see her now. Since her father's death,
her home has been in London.

not. I have to dance the first two with Mr Collins.

00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,725
Think what you are doing. You'd be a simpleton

320
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:53,803
if you let your fancy for Wickham lead you
to slight a man of ten times his consequence.

321
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:55,559
I believe we must have some conversation,
Mr Darcy.

322
00:31:57,527 --> 00:32:00,087
A very little will suffice.

323
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:09,199
You should say something about the dance,
perhaps.

324
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,680
I might remark on the number of couples.

325
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:21,035
- Do you talk by rule when you're dancing?
- Sometimes it's best.

326
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,677
Then we may enjoy the advantage of saying
as little as possible.

327
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:36,643
Do you consult your own feelings in this case,
or seek to gratify mine?

328
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,002
Both, I imagine.

329
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:55,517
We are both unwilling to speak unless we expect
to say something that will amaze the whole room.

330
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:59,597
This is no striking resemblance of
your own character, I'm sure.

331
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:50,001
- Do you often walk into Meryton?
- Yes, quite often.

332
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:58,606
When you met us, we had just been forming
a new acquaintance.

333
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,684
Mr Wickham's happy manners
enable him to make friends.

334
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:13,204
Whether he is equally capable of keeping them,
is less certain.

335
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:21,917
He has been unlucky to lose your friendship
in a way he'll suffer from all his life.

336
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:28,884
Allow me to congratulate you, sir!
Such superior dancing is rarely to be seen.

337
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:32,756
I'm sure your fair partner is well worthy of you.

338
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:38,763
I hope this pleasure is repeated often. Especially
when a certain desirable event takes place.

339
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:40,918
Eh, Miss Lizzy?

340
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:44,723
- What congratulations will then flow in!
- Sir, I...

341
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:48,880
I understand! I'll not detain you longer
from your bewitching partner!

342
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,642
A great pleasure, sir. Capital! Capital!

343
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,803
I remember hearing you once say
that you hardly ever forgave.

344
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,356
That your resentment once created
was implacable.

345
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,998
You're careful, aren't you,
in allowing resentment to be created?

346
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,158
I am.

347
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:22,917
And never allow yourself to be blinded
by prejudice?

348
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,045
I hope not.

349
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,199
May I ask to what these questions tend?

350
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:32,360
Merely to the illustration of your character.
I'm trying to make it out.

351
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,917
- What is your success?
- I don't get on at all.

352
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:39,318
I hear such different accounts of you
as to puzzle me exceedingly.

353
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:10,323
I wish that you wouldn't attempt to sketch
my character at the present moment.

354
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:13,684
The performance should reflect no credit
on either of us.

355
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:17,681
If I don't take your likeness now,
I may never have another opportunity!

356
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:21,237
I would by no means suspend any pleasure
of yours.

357
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,724
(VOICES DROWNED IN PARTY SOUNDS)

358
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:50,040
Miss Eliza, I hear you're quite delighted
with George Wickham.

359
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:53,563
No doubt he forgot to tell you,
among his other communications,

360
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:58,642
that he was merely the son of old Wickham,
the late Mr Darcy's steward!

361
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:03,082
But, Eliza, as a friend,

362
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:06,876
let me recommend you not to give credit
to all his assertions.

363
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:12,758
- Wickham treated Darcy in an infamous manner.
- Has he? How?

364
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:19,002
I don't remember the particulars, but I do know
that Mr Darcy was not in the least to blame.

365
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:23,957
I pity you, Eliza,
for the discovery of your favourite's guilt,

366
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:28,120
but really, considering his descent,
one could not expect much better.

367
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,519
His guilt and his descent
appear by your account to be the same.

368
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:38,045
You accuse him only of being the son of Mr
Darcy's steward, which he informed me of himself.

369
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:40,565
I beg your pardon.

370
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:44,436
Excuse my interference. It was kindly meant.

371
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,958
- Insolent girl!
- Lizzy!

372
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:02,643
I see nothing in her paltry attack
but her own ignorance and the malice of Mr Darcy!

373
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,877
Yes, but Lizzy...

374
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:10,198
Mr Bingley said, that though he doesn't know
the whole history,

375
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:14,360
he fears that Mr Wickham is by no means
a respectable young man.

376
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:17,200
- Does he know Mr Wickham?
- No.

377
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:20,723
Well, then he just had his account from Mr Darcy.

378
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:25,519
I don't doubt Mr Bingley's sincerity.
Of course he would believe his friend.

379
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:30,522
As to the other two gentlemen, I shall venture
to think of them both as I did before.

380
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:34,680
Shall we not have some music?
I have a great desire for a song!

381
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:37,315
Caroline, can we persuade you?

382
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,037
Miss Mary Bennet.

383
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,758

389
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,683
Lizzy! Look.

390
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,720
But they haven't been introduced!

391
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:41,959
- Can we not prevent him?
- Too late.

392
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:49,478
Mr Darcy. I have made a remarkable...
I must say, an amazing discovery!

393
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:54,198
I understand that you are the nephew
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh of Rosings Park!

394
00:39:55,407 --> 00:40:02,438
Mr Darcy, I am happy to be able to inform you
that her Ladyship was in the best of health...

395
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,802
..eight days ago.

396
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,442
I'm glad to hear it.

397
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:16,401
- And what is your name, sir?
- My name is William Collins, Mr Darcy.

398
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:20,196
And I have a very great honour to...

399
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,446
Well. Well.

That'll do extremely well, child.
You've delighted us long enough.

408
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:22,486
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.

409
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,679
If I were so fortunate as to be able to sing,

410
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:37,159
I should have great pleasure in obliging
the company with an air.

411
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:42,879
Indeed I should, for I consider music
as a very innocent diversion,

412
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:47,245
and perfectly compatible with the profession
of a clergyman!

413
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:10,482
Mr Collins is such a sensible,
respectable young man.

414
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:16,165
He's taken quite a fancy to Lizzy,
and I don't think he could find a better wife.

415
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:23,403
He favoured Jane at first, but Bingley was there
before him. Now there will be a great marriage!

416
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:29,119
And, of course, that will throw the girls
into the path of other rich men!

417
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,239
(DENNY): Lydia!

418
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:33,681
(DENNY): Lydia!

419
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,005
Lydia!

420
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:45,597
Lord! Denny, fetch me a glass of wine.
I can scarce draw breath, I'm so fagged!

421
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:58,360
(KITTY): ...and Chamberlayne and Denny again!
Lydia only danced with him twice!

422
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:02,042
- I thought Mary sang very ill.
- Oh, yes. Poor Mary.

423
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:06,200
- But she is determined to do it.
- More fool her, I say.

424
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,121
- Mr Collins trod on my frock and tore it.
- (MOTHER): Lizzy!

425
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,962
Mr Collins, I'm sure there can be no objection!

426
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,520
Kitty, don't leave me.

427
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:20,043
- Lizzy, dear!
- (KITTY): Why? It's only Mr Collins.

428
00:43:20,207 --> 00:43:24,758
Come, Kitty. I want you upstairs.
Mr Collins has something to say to Lizzy!

429
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:31,283
Dear Mamma, don't go. Mr Collins can have
nothing to say that anyone could not hear.

430
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:37,841
Lizzy. I insist that you stay where you are
and hear Mr Collins!

431
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:41,839
Come, Kitty! Come along.

432
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,882
Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your
modesty adds to your other perfections.

433
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:03,484
But you can hardly doubt the object
of my discourse,

434
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:07,640
however your feminine delicacy
may lead you to dissemble.

435
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,959
For, as almost as soon as I entered the house,

436
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:17,520
I singled you out as the companion
of my future life!

437
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:22,686
But before I am run away by my feelings
on this subject,

438
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:28,923
perhaps it would be advisable for me
to state my reasons for marrying.

439
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:31,078
Mr Collins...

440
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,596
My reasons for marrying are:

441
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:45,479
First, I think it a right thing for every clergyman
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

442
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:50,437
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness.

443
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:55,078
And thirdly, which perhaps I should have
mentioned first,

444
00:44:55,767 --> 00:45:01,763
that it is the particular recommendation of my
noble patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh!

445
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:05,283
''Mr Collins,'' she said, ''you must marry.''

446
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:09,440
''Choose properly,'' she said.
''Choose a gentlewoman for my sake,''

447
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:16,285
''and for your own, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up too high.''

448
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:22,966
''Find such a woman as soon as you can,
bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her!''

449
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,162
And your wit and vivacity,

450
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,966
I think, must be acceptable to her,

451
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:35,076
when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.

452
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,800
Yes.

453
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:44,604
So much for my general intention in favour
of matrimony. Now, as to my particular choice:

454
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,078
My dear cousin,

455
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:52,241
being, as I am, to inherit all this estate
after the death of your father,

456
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:57,765
I could not satisfy myself without resolving
to choose a wife from among his daughters.

457
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:05,684
And now nothing remains,

458
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:12,397
but to assure you, in the most animated language,
of the violence of my affections!

459
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:17,038
- Mr Collins, please...
- To fortune I am perfectly indifferent.

460
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:23,077
I'm well aware that 1,000 pounds in the
four per cents is all that you may be entitled to,

461
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:28,162
but rest assured, I shall never reproach
on that score when we are married!

462
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:32,046
You are too hasty, sir!

463
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:39,043
You forget that I've made no answer. Let me
do so now. I thank you for your compliments.

464
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:43,200
I am very sensible of the honour
of your proposals, but...

465
00:46:43,807 --> 00:46:46,879
..it is impossible for me to accept them.

466
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:57,517
I am by no means discouraged. Indeed not.

467
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:03,956
I understand that young ladies often reject
the addresses of the man they mean to accept,

468
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:09,804
when he first applies for their favour,
and therefore I shall hope, my dear cousin,

469
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,845
to lead you to the altar before long.

470
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:17,956
Upon my word, your hope is an extraordinary one
in view of my declaration.

471
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,881
I was perfectly serious in my refusal.

472
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:26,599
You could not make me happy, and I am
the last woman who could make you so.

473
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,042
My dear Miss Elizabeth,

474
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:33,917
my situation in life, my connection
with the noble family of de Bourgh,

475
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:37,796
are circumstances highly in my favour.

476
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:44,483
Consider that it is by no means certain that
another offer of marriage may be made to you.

477
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:48,242
You cannot be serious in your rejection.

478
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:53,319
I must attribute it to your wish of increasing
my love by suspense,

479
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:56,957
in the usual manner of elegant females.

480
00:47:58,127 --> 00:47:59,480
I assure you, sir,

481
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:05,643
that I have no pretensions to the kind of elegance
which consists in tormenting a respectable man.

482
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:10,801
I thank you for the honour of your proposals,
but to accept them is absolutely impossible.

483
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:14,404
My feelings forbid it in every respect.

484
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:19,522
- Can I speak plainer?
- You are uniformly charming!

485
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:27,077
And I am persuaded that when sanctioned
by your excellent parents...

486
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:34,998
..my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.

487
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:44,086
Oh, Mr Bennet! You are wanted immediately.

488
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:46,715
We are all in uproar!

489
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:51,278
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins.
She vows she won't have him,

490
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:55,998
and if you don't make haste, Mr Collins
will change his mind and won't have her!

491
00:48:56,167 --> 00:49:00,285
I have not the pleasure of understanding you.
Of what are you talking?

492
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:04,396
Of Mr Collins and Lizzy!

493
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:10,325
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr Collins, and
Mr Collins begins to say he will not have Lizzy!

494
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:15,405
What am I to do on the occasion?
It seems a hopeless business.

495
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:20,960
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself!
Tell her you insist upon her marrying him!

496
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:25,723
Let her come in.

497
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:30,319
Lizzy! Lizzy!

498
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:33,160
Your father wishes to speak to you.

499
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:39,795
Come here, my child.

500
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,680
I...

501
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:50,639
I understand Mr Collins has made you
an offer of marriage.

502
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,915
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.

503
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:58,963
Very well. And this offer of marriage
you have refused?

504
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,841
- I have.
- (FATHER): I see.

505
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:08,238
Right, we now come to the point.
Your mother insists on your accepting it.

506
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:15,038
- Is it not so, Mrs Bennet?
- Yes, or I will never see her again!

507
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:18,199
An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.

508
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:22,121
From this day you must be a stranger
to one of your parents.

509
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:27,077
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins.

510
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,279
And...

511
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:33,281
..I will never see you again if you do.

512
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:37,726
Oh, Mr Bennet!

513
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:51,482
(MOTHER): Sit down, Miss Lizzy!
/ insist upon you marrying Mr Collins!

514
00:50:51,647 --> 00:50:56,357
- Why, Charlotte, what do you do here?
- I am come to see Elizabeth.

515
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:03,077
Mr Collins has made Lizzy an offer,
and what do you think? She won't have him!

516
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:07,081
Then I am very sorry for him,
though I couldn't say I'm surprised.

517
00:51:07,247 --> 00:51:10,319
(MOTHER): /f you don't,
/ will never speak to you again!

518
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:15,638
- I won't discuss the matter any longer.
- Mr Collins!

519
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:19,764
Mamma's beside herself.
He says he won't stay another night.

520
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:27,040
- I wonder, should I invite him to dine with us?
- Aye, do! Do! Take him away and feed him.

521
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:30,279
For he's been in high dudgeon all morning!

522
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:43,319
- Oh, Mr Collins!
- I am resigned.

523
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:46,995
Resignation is never so perfect,

524
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:52,161
as when the blessing denied begins to lose
somewhat of its value in our estimation.

525
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,801
Until tomorrow then, madam.

526
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,437
I take my leave.

527
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:07,726
Oh, Mr Collins!

528
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:18,726
