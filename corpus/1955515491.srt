00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,953
This is Dr Miranda North, Quarantine Officer
aboard the International Space Station

6
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:08,222
Today the Pilgrim Council
with it's valuable Mars Soil samples...

7
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:11,555
completes it's 8 month return from Mars

8
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,514
Preparing to receive these samples...

9
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,074
has been the purpose of our mission
these last few months

10
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:21,174
But the pilgrim capsule is damaged

11
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,076
At 0630 UTC...

12
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:27,446
Pilgrim was struck by debrief
and we had off course

13
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,015
Rory Adam whose space walk..

14
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:32,084
established visual contact
with the incoming space capsule.

15
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,185
he'll grab it with the remote arm

16
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:39,317
We have been waiting a long time
for this sample

17
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:43,373
and Rory is placing himself
at great risk to secure it.

18
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,269
- Over and out. UME
- 4.7 psi, pure O2.

19
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,455
So how you gonna do it?
I wouldn't do it that way.

20
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,913
- Dr. Jordan, that's your best defence?
- Faster!

21
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,177
Nitrogen is zero.

22
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,757
- Dr. North?
- In airlock.

23
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,999
Rory, slow to go fast.

24
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,742
- Or fast to go fast.
- Deliberate. We're here to get fast.

25
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:03,226
- Remember, 8 billion people.
- Rory, if you can't get it back...

26
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,835
Spoiler alert They'll fucking save me.

27
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:08,918
If you can't, just push the capsule
into deep space. ok? Do you hear me?

28
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,083
Can you give me remove TOC, sorry. CDC,
sorry I am afraid?

29
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,280
I got a big operation.
I need to concentrate.

30
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,000
- I just wanted...
- I can't hear you.

31
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,353
I love you too.

32
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:20,139
- EMU at 4.7 psi.
- Where is the remote?

33
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,376
Here's. The arm is yours.
Full Manual.

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,193
Let's go... careful
Sorry, you know.

35
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,371
- No more sorries.
- Miranda to the please.

36
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,986
- David, are you on the way?
- I'm on my way.

37
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,290
- Slow, Sho.
- Excuse me.

38
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,941
How do you say "breathe" in Japanese?

39
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:09,128
This was supposed to be a routine.

40
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:13,034
Air lock is sealed.
I'm... walking.

41
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:18,087
04:35 UTC.

42
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:20,828
After striking to, no response.

43
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,362
Inbound on a collision course with the ISS

44
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,036
Initiate emergency course correction
and manual retrieval.

45
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:30,989
Arm online.
Transferring control to wireless

46
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,740
Station to control
Initiating sequence.

47
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,643
- So the committee...?
- You Let me worry about the committee.

48
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:39,403
Where's Rory?

49
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:43,565
- He is at risk out there
- Easy folks, mics online.

50
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:45,945
Ready.
Sho?

51
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,394
Thrusters up.

52
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,407
Hold in your position.

53
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,374
I have control of the arm

54
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,380
You wanna die so soon?

55
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,694
No, I get paid by flying

56
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:41,297
I have a good feeling about this.

57
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:42,554
Yeah?

58
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:45,715
Rory is gonna deal with that sample.

59
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,368
Right to your lab.

60
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,245
Prepare for course correction.

00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,895
.O52905 .076

62
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,526
You never trained for this.

63
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,772
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

64
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,893
New capsule to dip 3, negative 0.50.

65
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,367
Proximity alert.

66
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,572
Ignore the proximity alert.

67
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:24,748
New Station trajectory: Negative 0.32.

68
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:27,491
The capsule is gonna miss us, just.

69
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,987
- Rory?
- I'm still gonna reach it.

70
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,074
It's coming in shallow.

71
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,643
Any moment now.
8, maybe 9 clock.

72
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:38,942
I'm having fun.
You guys having fun?

73
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,173
Rory...

74
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:42,155
- if you miss...
- Yeah, ya, ya, ya.

75
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,515
And...

76
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,889
Just gonna skip off the atmosphere
like a flat stone on water.

77
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:51,285
Just fly off it to nowhere
and then we are done.

78
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,675
Okay.

79
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,478
There!

80
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,191
- There.
- I see it.

81
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,697
Here we go This is fun.

82
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,075
Rory, you have to
move, it's gonna hit you.

83
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:03,898
That's bad.

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,791
Please Rory, move.

85
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,151
Station to control. Visual
confirmation of Mars Capsule Pilgrim

86
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,327
I used to play catcher,
but only in...

87
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,426
- Rory?
- Not now.

88
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,897
Not now. Come here.
Come on, come on come on!

89
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,396
Rory?

90
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,323
Rory?

91
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,047
he caught it!

92
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,260
Yo!

93
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,506
Que Instagram!

94
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,223
I do wanna do it.

95
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,760
- Point and shoot, motherfucker!
- It's okay.

96
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,144
Mars capsule in lock position.

97
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:08,298
I'm coming home.

98
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,981
This is mission Commander,
Ekaterina Golovkina.

99
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,313
Tell the committee, Pilgrim's landed
on Plymouth rock.

100
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,951
The Mars samples are safe & sound.

101
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,281
Copy that, Commander.
Congratulations.

102
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:36,802
<i>ISS
PILGRIM 7</i>

103
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:05,637
Ready?

104
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:10,558
We are recording.
06:40 UTC.

105
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:16,437
Pilgrim was not just
seeing things on the Mars soil.

106
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,332
We are looking at a large single cell...
Inert.

107
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,730
Un-unmistakably biological.

108
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:27,134
And like organisms on Earth,
it has what appears to be a nucleus

109
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,927
cytoplasm.

110
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,607
The cell wall is thick.

111
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:37,842
These hairs look like cilia longer than
we used to see on Earth.

112
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,832
More like a flagella.

113
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:45,823
- What's the temperature?
- -110.

114
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:47,791
Stop, bring that up.

115
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:49,774
Minus 82.

116
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,209
Even quicker.

117
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,963
Minus 55.

118
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:01,587
This is some Re-Animator shit.

119
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,621
That's very obscure reference.

120
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,719
- Oh, For a nerd, no.
- Not if you're a nerd.

121
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,054
Minus 17.

122
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:10,619
Zero degrees.

123
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,330
Oh come on.

124
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:14,122
18...

125
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,090
19...

126
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:18,703
20 degrees Celsius.

127
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,690
Nothing.

128
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,050
Update?

129
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,888
I'm gonna try different atmosphere.

130
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:39,272
Closer to Proterozoic Earth
than today's Mars.

131
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,591
Less oxygen...

132
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,045
more carbon dioxide.

133
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,905
And then when Sho's ready...

134
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:49,264
a growth medium.

135
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,406
In this case, glucose.

136
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,262
Come on, dance.

137
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,375
Did it just move?

138
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,195
Hugh?

139
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,295
My God.

140
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,065
It worked.
You woke it.

141
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:48,202
We are looking at the first
incontrovertible proof of life beyond Earth.

142
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,921
Oh, it's beautiful.

143
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:15,146
Our first question is from Allen.
He is 9 years old.

144
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:17,917
And Allen, what is your question
for Commander Golovkina?

145
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,632
Is it green?

146
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,548
It's not visible at all actually,
it is microscopic. A single cell.

147
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,871
To put in the perspective,
your body is made up of trillions.

148
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,664
There is an alien inside of me?

149
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,341
I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.

150
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:34,998
We have another question
from 8 year old Marrie,

151
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,566
Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?

152
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:40,420
No, we are gonna keep it up here.
We're gonna study it where it's safe.

153
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Commander?

154
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,158
The ISS is the most expensive
house ever built.

155
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:51,246
200 billion American dollars and counting
because we keep adding rooms.

156
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:55,001
It flies around Earth 16 times a day.

157
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,746
In 30 years, over one hundred people
have lived here...

158
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,201
thanks to generous countries like Russia
the USA and China.

159
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,663
We call this Tranquility node.

160
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,114
Dr. Jordan here is about to break
the record for consecutive days on space.

161
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,774
473 straight.

162
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,430
Your mommy must miss you.

163
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:19,653
She does, but I have family here.

164
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,841
Yes, it kind of teases him
because his mommy misses him.

165
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:26,233
She is one of our newest crew members,
Miranda North...

166
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:29,403
From the Centers for Disease Control.
She is a doctor too.

167
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:31,703
You guys are witnessing a space triathlon.

168
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,502
Yeah I'm winning.

169
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,159
We have another question
from from 7 year old Layla.

170
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,795
We think, This question
is a little personal.

171
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:39,341
Go Ahead.

172
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:41,838
How do you go to the bathroom?

173
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,892
Funnel.

174
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,329
Tube.

175
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,771
And a little suction.

176
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:54,117
Everything we do on the ISS
is like everything you do on earth

177
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,266
- Except difference. You like peas?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,480
And your name yet?

179
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,821
For that we gonna go down live...

180
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:13,005
Just out side our studio in Times Square
one very brave class mate.

181
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,740
Hi, Dominique.

182
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,006
Hi.

183
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,952
Calvin Coolidge Elementary School...

184
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:23,058
Was chosen among 11,000 schools...

185
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,082
for this honor.

186
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:28,019
Will you name the Martian...

187
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,894
after our school.

188
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,278
"Calvin".

189
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,973
Control? Control?

190
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,404
If you are listening, probably are
cause it's creepy that way...

191
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,664
Can I rant for a second
about the micromanagement?

192
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,723
We are not blood filled human puppets.

193
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:54,179
I came from a long lived plumbers.
I can fix a shower.

194
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,672
I can't.
Hell, Hugh doesn't shower anyway.

195
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,438
It's British.

196
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,226
First international incident.

197
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:04,282
Don't be an ugly American.

198
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,611
Wow, who is ugly now?

199
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:09,565
I nailed Step 17.
I am a very good looking American

200
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,282
All I see, it's right there.

201
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,721
Control, sorry about him.

202
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:13,707
Control can't hear you.

203
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:15,141
I do not know where rage
like that comes from.

204
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,722
Can you please just fix the shower?

205
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,611
I can do this myself.

206
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,009
Yeah, I know.
Just haven't.

207
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,394
Doctors always so bad at
looking after themselves. Aren't they?

208
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,837
You've spent too much time up here.

209
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,546
The atrophy has accelerated.

210
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:40,554
And you're close to the limit.

211
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:45,233
Gleaming in the gap?

212
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,894
I like it up here.

213
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,592
When I was in the military, we go to Syria.

214
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:01,164
You know.

215
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,338
We set up a hospital.

216
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:08,050
Treat all the casualties, and then...

217
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:12,654
we come back a week or two later, and...

218
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,282
whole village would just be bombed out.

219
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,929
That earth isn't all Syria though, is it?

220
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,315
Can't stand the way we do
to each other down there.

221
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:35,236
But it's home, and it's beautiful.

222
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,592
Don't you miss anything?

223
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:41,980
What you missed? Fresh water or birds...

224
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,273
the trees?

225
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,349
I like the hum up here.

226
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,956
And the air.

227
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:20,000
What you've achieved
with Golov is remarkable, Hugh.

228
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,465
I haven't had a chance to say that.

229
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:28,904
Thank you. I think these are proofs
to be greatest days of my life.

230
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,702
I wish I had a time machine
so I could visit the 10 year old me.

231
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,319
Did you want to be an astronaut?

232
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,370
He wanted to get out of the wheelchair.

233
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,873
And how does he feel now?

234
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,463
Like a bird.

235
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,399
Don't get me wrong.

236
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:59,076
I don't hate the chair.

237
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:00,557
I love it.

238
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:04,038
For the sake of the anonymous genius
who invented it.

239
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:09,528
You're one of a kind, Hugh.

240
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:12,791
Goodnight.

- Hold on to your helmets.

243
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,455
The glucose intake is very rapid.

244
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:45,540
The specimen cells have began
to mutate on mass as a unit.

245
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:48,465
And they also share electrical activity,

246
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,798
in what resembles a growing neural network.

247
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:53,986
Notice I didn't say "brain".

248
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:56,506
Dr. North speaking.

249
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,958
It's our educated opinion
that this new species,

250
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,176
it is not a colonial flux
divided single cell organisms...

251
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:05,748
but one larger solitary
organism composed of,

252
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:08,867
trillion of identical cooperative cells.

253
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,450
Here's what's fascinating,

254
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,738
I made it so fascinating, isn't it?

255
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,198
Unlike most multi-setup organism,

256
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,879
Every set of Calvin's can perform
every somatic functions on its own.

257
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:24,729
Every single cell is simultaneously,

258
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:28,002
a muscle cell and a nerve cell...

259
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,827
and a photo-receptive cell.

260
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,159
So the creature as a whole...

261
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,949
Is a very very different..
all muscle

262
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:38,950
no brain, no eye.

263
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,462
As such, Calvin now possess the means
to interact with its environment,

264
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:48,681
including the use of what
appear to be proto-appendages.

265
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,842
I will demonstrate.

266
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:14,442
I notice how it's approaching
and not retreating.

267
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:17,732
Its curiosity outweigh its fear.

268
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,878
That's beautiful.

269
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:58,967

00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:03,187

271
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,766
You're going to be a daddy.

272
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,723
It's gonna be a big custody
battle over this one.

273
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,358
You can, Kazumi.
You can do this, Kazumi.

274
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,763
I do what I can.
I'm doing my best.

275
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,288

Any moment now, okay, push

277

Obviously not.

It's the lab.

308
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,213
Miranda, check the O2 in the lab.

309
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,441
Level is on 21.
We're okay for contamination.

310
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:39,891
We're okay.
Calvin is safe.

311
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:43,526
I don't understand how this happened.
Nothing in that laboratory can malfunction.

312
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,949
The clamp. It fell.
It's on me.

313
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:49,573
No shit it's on you.
A 5 year old could've spotted that.

314
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:53,011
Protecting this firewall, yes.
That's my job but I can't do it alone.

315
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:56,190
Kibo was not designed for strict firewall
lockdown and neither was the station.

316
00:25:56,532 --> 00:25:58,283
There is zero precedent for any of these.

317
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,084
But you do not come out of that lab
without triple checking everything.

318
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:04,665
Do not go in that lab without a proper rest.

319
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,709
For all I know. We are carrying
Anthrax on board.

320
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,495
You can't compare Calvin to Anthrax.

321
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,453
I know these five guys back home
that can do my job.

322
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,642
Nobody can do yours except you.

323
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:18,117
I don't want to be around that thing.
I am not qualified to be around that thing.

324
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,609
I understand. I'm just saying you
can't compare Calvin to Anthrax.

325
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,355
Stop. Stop calling him fucking Calvin!
We don't know what that thing is.

326
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,556
You went in and play it around
like it's your buddy.

327
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:31,730
I'm your buddy.
You're drunk on this. Wake up.

This isn't and will never be
a controlled experiment.

00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,528

first and last mistake.

Dr. Miranda North,
quarantine officer, 23:20 UTC.

332
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:56,654
After weeks of stunning growth and activity,
Calvin is completely inactive.

333
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:00,120
We believe that is likely
due to the clamp failure in the lab.

334
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:03,468
Which caused the temperature
change in Calvin's box.

335
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,934
Our working theory is that
this hibernation may be a defense mechanism.

336
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:09,660
Everyone here is on edge.

337
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,883
Hugh of course has been beating himself up,
but honestly I'm relieved.

338
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:17,329
Calvin was growing very fast...

339
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:21,142
and this is now giving me time to reinforce
firewalls precautions with the crew.

340
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:25,279
The box must stay sealed
the lab must stay sealed.

341
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,650
No matter the risk to Calvin.

342
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,153
It is just floating.

343
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:35,523
Because of my mistake...
in the lab.

344
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:38,322
And it was going so well.

345
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:40,781
What?

346
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,161
Something my dad used to say.

347
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:45,979
"It was all going so well."

348
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:52,001
I'm toying with the idea of stimulate
it electrically. What you think?

349
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,596
- That's not my call.
- What if it were?

350
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:56,715
I don't know.

351
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,567
My job is lines of defense.

352
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,278
Imagine the worst thing that could happen...

353
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:05,099
and then the worse after that
and worse after that, and then I...

354
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,779
I planned for all of them.

355
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:10,018
I understand that.
But risks are taken for a reason.

356
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,924
Because of Calvin,
we can learn so much about life.

357
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,360
Its origin, its nature,
perhaps even its meaning.

358
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:17,802
I know.

359
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:21,094
You're a doctor.
Stem cell research.

360
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:24,234
What if Calvin can make stem cell obsolete?

361
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,405
Help cure the incurable?

362
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:30,141
Reverse the irreversible?

363
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,501
I have to fix this.

364
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,345
Good.
You ready?

365
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:36,162
- Stretch.
- Okay.

366
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:41,616
And... relax.

367
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:48,991
Ready.

368
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:51,410
You sure it won't hurt it?

369
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,677
It is a very very low voltage.

370
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,801
We only stimulate it.

371
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,837
What exactly are you hoping for?

372
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:00,301
I'm hoping to wake him up.

373
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:05,777
We'll see under what conditions
will it reengage with its environment.

374
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,388
C'mon in.

375
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,454
Shocking the monkey.

376
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,587
Trying another spot.

377
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,453
Nothing.

378
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,184
Even at the cellular level.

379
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:33,903
Are you sure it's not beca...

380
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,164
Dead?

381
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,171
It is alive, just in a deep sleep.

382
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:39,663
Oh, cmon, Calvin.

383
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,196
Wake up.

384
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Shit!

385
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:53,059
- What's wrong?
- It broke the wand.

386
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,978
I'm gonna try to pull my hand out.

387
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:04,822
You can do that but
make sure to protect the glove.

388
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,219
- Shit.
- She gripping the glass. Okay. Okay.

389
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:15,730
Motherfucker.

390
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,594
How hard is he holding on to you?

391
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,559
Like a firm handshake.

392
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,054
Funny it doesn't hurt,
but it is very strong.

393
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:24,404
- What is the problem?
- He's got Hugh's hand.

394
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,952
His heart rate is 165.

395
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,347
Sho. Can we
trust the glove?

396
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,316
It's very tight.

397
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:32,954
The glove is not going anywhere.
It's fine

398
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:34,779
- Shit.
- Okay, but...

399
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:37,044
Just relax.
Tell him to relax.

400
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,575
Derry? Look at me.
Relax.

401
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,778
Just relax your hand.

402
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:45,124
It's between my fingers.

403
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,315
Can I make a suggestion?
Can I go in there and take it out?

404
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,787
No, you're not going to go in there.

405
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:53,874
No. Of course you're not.
Because I've to maintained quarantine.

406
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,796
I can. I can do it.

407
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,917
- Can you try and distract it.
- Yes.

408
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,870
I'll see if I can interest it with the bar.

409
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:04,709
Go on, my favorite little muffin.

410
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:11,144
Cmon. Cmon.

411
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,701
He lost interest.

412
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,806
He's got my hand.

413
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,399
Hugh?

414
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:42,091
Hugh?

415
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,560
Hey, Hugh!

416
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,318
- What the hell is going on?
- No one is going in!

417
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,930
- Cmon wait!
- Who's going in?

418
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,463
Waiting for what?

419
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,104
Don't do this!

420
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,147
I don't give a shit about
your fucking quarantine!

421
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,837
Who gave you this jurisdiction?
Just open the door!

422
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:23,314
Wait, wait, wait!

423
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:38,584
He's out.

424
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:40,579
He's out.

425
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,848
Guys, look at him.

426
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,403
Oh God.
Jesus.

427
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,924
What are his vitals?

428
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:58,739
126 and dropping.

429
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:00,828
What's it doing?

430
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,325
Holy, shit.

431
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,084
Jesus Christ.

432
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:45,973
Okay.
You guys got eyes on it anywhere?

433
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,434
Hey, there.

434
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,644
There.

435
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,235
Guys?

436
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:39,404
- Fuck this!
- No!

437
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,392
- Let him go.
- Hey buddy.

438
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:49,416
Watch his hand.

439
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:53,698
Get him! Adams!

440
00:34:58,736 --> 00:34:59,447
Yes.

441
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,493
David, I need you here.

442
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:05,104
Rory...

443
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,060
I can not let you out.

444
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,721
Oh... shit.

445
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:13,981
- Hugh, Hugh?
- That's.

446
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,240
- Look at me.
- Let me see, yes?

447
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,458
Guys?

448
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,424
Suggestions?

449
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,157
Get the oxygen candle! Burn it off!

450
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:24,294
Yes Yes.

451
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:45,687
Fuck.

452
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,520
Okay. Alright.
What now?

453
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,353
How do we get him out?

454
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:56,758
We need to get Calvin
back behind firewall 1.

455
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,796
Once he's ok, we pull Rory out.

456
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:02,201
Fuck this. Permission..
to fucking kill that thing.

457
00:36:04,543 --> 00:36:05,820
Commander?

458
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,161
Kill it.

459
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,986
Sho? Any suggestions?

460
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:13,847
What about the incinerator?

461
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,144
I like that.
Alright. Genuis.

462
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,611
Close the red valve.
Disengage the clamp.

463
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:22,372
Disconnect the hose.

464
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,287
- Be careful, Rory.
- Fuck!

465
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:26,195
There is limited fuel.

466
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,108
- Manual override.
- Thank you.

467
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:34,600
Okay.

468
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:44,833
Rory, yo...

469
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Yes.

470
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,810
Fuck!

471
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,644
You're wasting too much fuel.

472
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:28,831
Rory!

473
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:34,469
Rory? Hey!

474
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,532
Rory, Stop, stop!

475
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:46,872
Rory?

476
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:48,814
You have no fuel.

477
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:13,327
It's behind you!

478
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:33,915
Jesus!

479
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:35,209
Fuck!

480
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:38,847
Somebody open up the fucking door!
And pull him out!

481
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,389
Just open up the door!
The thing is strangling Rory.

482
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,269
What is he saying? Rory, Rory?

483
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:45,667
Kat! We gotta open the door!

484
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,482
Do not! It is the protocol!

485
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,309
Fucking protocol! Just open the door!

486
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:54,165
There's a man dying in there!

487
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,444
Guys?

488
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:27,751
Guys.

489
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:36,911
Sho...

490
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,861
It's so much bigger.

491
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,423
Jesus!

492
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,619
- Guys?
- Sho.

493
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:17,627
Guys.
It's trying to get out.

494
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:19,411
The CPU overrules us.

495
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:21,012
It's searching for a way out.

496
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,830
- The system won't give me access to it.
- Go manual.

497
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,853
Shut them down.
Okay?

498
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,392
How smart is this thing?

499
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,404
It feels the air flow.

500
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:36,178
- I can not control them all at once.
- Then shut them one by one.

501
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:42,405
Seal the lab!

502
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,011
- Shut it down. Shut it down now!
- We're on it.

503
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:11,930
He's just gone.

504
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,055
- It got out.
- Where did it go?

505
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,652
Can be anywhere now.

506
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:20,974
Firewall 2 has failed.

507
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:34,350
Kat...

508
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:37,343
We need to re-establish quarantine.

509
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,547
I will get a distress call out.

510
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:45,125
Control this is Station.
Station to control.

511
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:47,271
The specimen's location is unknown.

512
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,513
It is to be considered hostile and deadly.

513
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:54,253
Our attempt is to isolate and destroy
In compliance with protocol.

514
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:58,126
We will continue set course of us
unless otherwise instructed

515
00:42:58,347 --> 00:42:59,970
Please acknowledge and advice.

516
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:01,833
Kat, we lost.

517
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:05,924
- How was it?
- Some... I think.

518
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:10,472
There is no way to be sure.
Communications just failed.

519
00:43:10,664 --> 00:43:12,240
Can we talk to each other?

520
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
David?

521
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,709
It's Kat.

522
00:43:16,058 --> 00:43:17,278
Do you copy?

523
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:20,071
Call for David.

524
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,424
Still, we've lost
contact with the Earth.

525
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:23,538
I dont think...

526
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:24,659
Wait.

527
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:27,437
Yes, outside communications are down.

528
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:29,730
Do the sprinklers affect comms?

529
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,807
No. They are
independent systems.

530
00:43:32,984 --> 00:43:34,565
Can we run a diagnostic from here?

531
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:40,395
The transmitter has failed.

532
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,879
But, we have to go outside to access it
and get Earth back online.

533
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:47,259
Then I have to walk.

534
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,155
Let me.

535
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:55,447
After Rory, I'm best qualified
to go up and repair.

536
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:05,055
This is not protocol.
It's way too risky if you go up there...

537
00:44:05,353 --> 00:44:06,633
to fix the comms.

538
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:08,716
We don't know where Calvin is.

539
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:12,532
Haven't had your Nitrogen detoxified.
Your health is my responsibility.

540
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,182
- I'll be fine
- Yup.

541
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:16,256
Is it you say?

542
00:44:18,295 --> 00:44:20,033
"Slow is fast", right?

543
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,352
Yeah. "Slow to go fast."

544
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:24,988
Well, that's how to end up.

545
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,604
We can escape in our lifeboats.

546
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:30,274
Earth is the responsibility.
Nothing goes down to the planet.

547
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:33,435
It was stipulated in writing.

548
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:36,174
What are you talking about?
What was stipulated in writing?

549
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:40,777
What was stipulated?

550
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,650
First things first.

551
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:50,551
When we're back in touch with control,
we'll turn our with Calvin.

552
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:54,592
Don't worry.

553
00:45:00,837 --> 00:45:05,397
Rate: 61 beats per minute.
Pressure: 97/53

554
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:08,249
Perhaps you're relaxed.

555
00:45:08,377 --> 00:45:10,806
But she is relaxed.
Aren't you, Kat?

556
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:13,105
Suit's running warm.

557
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:16,120
Like Siberia in summer.

558
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:24,518
I'm at the transmitter.

559
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,317
Commencing on site diagnostics.

560
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:33,176
It overheated.

561
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:34,560
I can tell.

562
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:36,318
How?

563
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:38,067
It's scorchy.

564
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:42,003
I will pitch up the coolant levels.

565
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,489
Is it possible Calvin could've
gotten into coolant?

566
00:45:44,643 --> 00:45:45,643
Possible.

567
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,804
We have to know.

568
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,235
There is the issue.

569
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,436
Commander?

570
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,840
It's about dry.

571
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:00,760
Calvin is a carbon-based organism.

572
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,062
It needs food, water,
and oxygen. Just like us.

573
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:06,286
We have to consider the
possibility it consumed the coolant.

574
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:11,646
Could you list all the water
sources abroad. Pure or otherwise.

575
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,033
There is plenty of drinking water.

576
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:18,189
Coolant from the communications,
Coolant from the CPU...

577
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:21,519
and there is coolant form the...

578
00:46:22,742 --> 00:46:23,883
Commander?

579
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:28,657
Calvin just came out,
then poured up to my suit.

580
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:35,550
It's bigger.

581
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,583
It's trying to get in.

582
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,251
Trust your suit.

583
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:44,342
- Can it breathe out there?
- No.

584
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:46,741
But it might be able to store oxygen
for a period of time.

585
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,263
I am closing the valve.

586
00:46:53,693 --> 00:46:55,514
It's squeezing.

587
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:57,153
Kat, Kat.
Are you okay?

588
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:59,763
Yes. The suit
is thick enough.

589
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,613
It's twisting up your leg.
Go, Go to the airlock now.

590
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:06,866
Fuck this. I'm headed to the airlock.
I'm going to walk her off.

591
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:11,046
Kat. Focus on meeting David.
We will worry about the comms later.

592
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:13,675
Sho?

593
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:22,847
There is liquid in the helmet.
Calvin must have broken the cooling tool.

594
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:25,029
Kat, there is enough coolant...

595
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,532
Yes I know.

596
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:27,968
I know.

597
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:29,833
David...

598
00:47:30,067 --> 00:47:33,068
- Meet me at the airlock
- What? Yeah. Go, go!

599
00:47:33,302 --> 00:47:34,544
It's is squeezing harder.

600
00:47:34,844 --> 00:47:36,882
Calvin cracked the cooling system
in her suit.

601
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:39,468
Commander.
Calvin knows exactly what he is doing.

602
00:47:39,802 --> 00:47:41,664
It's getting smarter.

603
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:43,941
The liquid is blocking my visual

604
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:49,625
I don't have time.
I have got to jump.

605
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:51,592
Kat, the tether won't reach

606
00:47:51,832 --> 00:47:52,832
I'm unclipping.

607
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:58,357
Kat?

608
00:47:58,538 --> 00:48:01,211
No comments.
I have got to jump.

609
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,713
Tether is getting out of the channel.

610
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:38,108
She is not gonna tell you, that's her heart
is beating out of her chest

611
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:39,389
She is choking.

612
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:42,227
Copy that.

613
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:44,976
Sho, I got no time for EVA.
Using the launch suit.

614
00:48:45,284 --> 00:48:47,779
It's not designed for this.
It is not enough protection.

615
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,694
- I know, don't worry
- Kat has less than a minute.

616
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:51,600
- Check the airlock!
- What about decompression?

617
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:52,624
- Do it!
- It's gonna hurt.

618
00:48:52,754 --> 00:48:54,790
- Do it!
- Your helmet sealed?

619
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:08,564
Guys, we're running out of time.

620
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:17,449
Kat, Kat...

621
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:20,685
Don't swallow.
It is toxic. okay?

622
00:49:22,353 --> 00:49:24,640
I need you to help me open the valve.

623
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:28,109
We'll do it together, okay?

624
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:31,444
Pull down.

625
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:34,096
And you're gonna go clockwise to your side.

626
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:37,810
Okay?

627
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:39,561
There you go.

628
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:40,932
Good, good good.

629
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:50,721
Do not worry about Calvin.
We are gonna get you inside and get it off.

630
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,719
Kat?

631
00:50:00,427 --> 00:50:02,687
No, clockwise from your side!

632
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:04,949
clockwise from your side!

633
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:06,615
Kat, come on!

634
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:07,955
- Miranda?
- Yeah, I'm here.

635
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,801
She's fighting me!
She's turned the lever the wrong way!

636
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:12,037
Hold...

637
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:18,211
Kat, you're fighting me! Kat, Come on!

638
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,935
Kat, we do it together now! Come on!

639
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:23,170
Kat, Come on, Please!

640
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:26,984
- Look at me! Kat!
- Just pull on the Lever, okay?

641
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:28,811
Kat, come on!

642
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:31,227
Come on! Just pull down on the lever!

643
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,687
Kat! Come on, You can do this!

644
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,359
David, she's doing it deliberately.

645
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:41,695
Come on!

646
00:50:42,362 --> 00:50:43,718
Kat!

647
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:47,384
- Kat!
- David, stop.

648
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:49,669
Stop.

649
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:56,265
She is not letting Calvin back in here.

650
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,240
Kat..

651
00:51:03,972 --> 00:51:05,406
Commander..

652
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,864
Kat.

653
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:45,661
What's going on?

654
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:50,815
What's going on?

655
00:52:24,748 --> 00:52:26,712
Guys, guys, can you copy?

656
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,618
Yeah, yeah I copy.

657
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,153
We keep it together.

658
00:52:39,184 --> 00:52:42,064
We may have an opportunity here.

659
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:48,129
Calvin's ability to survive in that
vacuum and temperature is astonishing.

660
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,640
But it can not live much longer out there.

661
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,365
Sho?

662
00:52:56,648 --> 00:52:59,671
Are you sure that we lost
all communication with the Earth?

663
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,701
I am sure.

664
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:04,100
You are right then
We have to keep him out there.

665
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:05,991
We have a new firewall.

666
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,977
David. Can
you see it?

667
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:13,374
I'm seeing, um.. Sho?

668
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:15,912
- Yes.
- Can you re-flood the airlock?

669
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:20,675
You tell me when.

670
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:37,776
Did she close that valve?

671
00:53:37,975 --> 00:53:39,745
Yeah, she closed it.

672
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:43,759
What are ways he can get in?

673
00:53:44,883 --> 00:53:46,316
The thrusters.

674
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,676
Manifolds in the thruster nozzles.

675
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:51,223
If it tries one, we could clash it off.

676
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:53,280
But we have to know which.

677
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:55,986
It's too dark.
I can't see anything.

678
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:58,026
There must be some way.

679
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,349
Thruster sensors.

680
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:04,426
If it climbs in the nozzle,
the temperature should move.

681
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,750
Should.

682
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:06,962
Alright.

683
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,399
- There!
- Thruster 2. Fire it.

684
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,055
Miranda, Can you reach Tranquility?

685
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,726
We missed! Cut it!

686
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,556
Guys, heading toward your way..
No! It's heading towards the lab!

687
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:28,237
I'm sorry, guys, I can't see.

688
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:29,798
It's okay if we want to.

689
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,661
- Kibo.
- Thrusters 3 firing.

690
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,761
Come on!

691
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:50,510
Please!

692
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,278
Thruster's five!
David, can you see it?

693
00:54:53,678 --> 00:54:55,219
Thruster Five

694
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,291
Sho?

695
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,369
<i>CRITICALLY LOW FUEL</i>

696
00:55:07,576 --> 00:55:08,818
What was that?

697
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:10,587
We've burnt through too much fuel.

698
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:12,495
We already low after the pilgrim.

699
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,793
Doc, listen.
All these thrusting...

700
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,282
We've placed ourselves in to decaying orbit.

701
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:22,775
We'll reach atmosphere soon
if I don't get us back to stable

702
00:55:22,972 --> 00:55:26,379
And I need the rest of the fuel to do it,
if we even have that much.

703
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:27,646
No. David?

704
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:30,951
We can not risk Calvin
riding us down into the atmosphere

705
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,979
I do not know if...
could it survive there?

706
00:55:33,244 --> 00:55:35,119
We don't know.
It has already gone more beyond

707
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:37,370
what any living organism
should be able to survive

708
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,844
If it's between and here
we are letting it down there..

709
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:48,772
We let it in here.

710
00:55:49,624 --> 00:55:51,104
Where are you?

711
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,263
We just let it back in here.

712
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,610
Moving us back into stable orbit.

713
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:34,452
These creatures could have dominated Mars
a hundreds of millions of years.

714
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:38,373
But now we know that they hibernate
for the loss of atmosphere

715
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:43,208
If we deprive it of air, retreat to
Tranquility and seal ourselves off

716
00:56:43,808 --> 00:56:46,396
And vent the rest of the station...

717
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:48,402
Exactly.

718
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,417
Without life support,
there is no life.

719
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:51,760
Right.

720
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:56,090
Ok, Hugh and I will sweep from quest east

721
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:57,554
And...

722
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:01,266
You and Sho scan the poles and
lock off each compartment

723
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:05,430
This will take about..

724
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:09,095
- 4 hours to vent all Oxygen
- What do we do till then?

725
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:10,423
We wait.

726
00:58:14,498 --> 00:58:15,798
You okay?

727
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:19,335
Derry, Hey.

728
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:21,274
You're okay?

729
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:23,299
I'm fine.

730
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:39,160
I remember the day
the Challenger blew up.

731
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:43,763
They took us out of school early...
I remember that day.

732
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,186
It's hard to watch people die.

733
00:59:00,297 --> 00:59:01,517
Like...

734
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,736
Fireworks.

735
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:10,241
Up up...

736
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:15,868
And long, delirious, burning blue.

737
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:21,000
I topped the windswept heights
with ease and grace

738
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,099
Best elegy ever

739
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,544
Rory says:

740
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:33,386
"Don't give me an elegy"

741
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:36,962
"Give me a parachute. "

742
00:59:45,898 --> 00:59:47,418
He was my buddy.

743
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:53,655
It's my fault.

744
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:56,405
It's all my fault.

745
00:59:56,641 --> 00:59:59,665
Maybe it was your fault,
maybe it was my fault. Maybe...

746
00:59:59,886 --> 01:00:01,801
It doesn't matter, does it?

747
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:07,024
Getting that thing onboard was a risk
and I knew it from beginning.

748
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:10,474
We took it.

749
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:13,072
It's just surviving.

750
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:18,385
Life's very existence requires destruction.

751
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:22,876
Calvin does not hate us.

752
01:00:26,074 --> 01:00:27,901
But he has to kill us.

753
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,122
in order to survive.

754
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:40,497
Hugh.

755
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,427
- Hugh
- Wait.

756
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:46,639
Quiet.

757
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,591
hey, Hugh.

758
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:51,937
That's fine.

759
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:57,000
Sorry because all the...

760
01:00:58,191 --> 01:00:59,191
Hugh?

761
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:05,822
There is no output.

762
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:07,823
Give me the defib.

763
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,046
- Help him right.
- Okay.

764
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:15,157
- Held it down.
- I'll stroke him in.

765
01:01:15,682 --> 01:01:16,772
- You got the sling to take off?
- Yeah

766
01:01:18,737 --> 01:01:20,837
Sho, get me ACLS kit and defibrillator.

767
01:01:21,327 --> 01:01:22,327
Hugh.

768
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:26,356
Here.

769
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:28,749
Prep the defibrillator, get the shocks now.

770
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,055
- 360 joules.
- Copy 360 joules.

771
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,454
Charging.

772
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:33,698
Clear.

773
01:01:36,582 --> 01:01:37,742
- Charging.
- Still defibrillator in.

774
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:39,841
Just set the shocks
to the highest. Go, 360.

775
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:41,009
Clear!

776
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:45,873
- Nothing.
- Go Again. 360.

777
01:01:45,974 --> 01:01:47,402
- Go Again, hit him.
- Clear.

778
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,457
Alright, alright

779
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:53,194
Okay, output.
Yeah.

780
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:57,404
Ok, sinus rate: 98 beats pm

781
01:01:57,606 --> 01:01:59,705
You just scared me there buddy.

782
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:01,734
David?

783
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:04,885
David?

784
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:09,771
What is this?

785
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:11,512
Stabilizing.

786
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,219
Get the plasma cutter.

787
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,913
Calvin's feeding on his leg.

788
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:33,577
Go. Get out of here.

789
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,539
- Let's go
- Come on

790
01:02:40,342 --> 01:02:41,391
Miranda, let's go!

791
01:02:41,593 --> 01:02:43,072
Go away from Hugh, Sho!

792
01:02:43,173 --> 01:02:45,481
- We'll get him!
- Miranda, let's go!

793
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,383
Sho!

794
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:53,531
No!

795
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,070
Sho!

796
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:00,754
No!

797
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,856
Guys?

798
01:04:46,248 --> 01:04:47,623
Calvin?

799
01:04:47,824 --> 01:04:49,314
We don't know where he is.

800
01:04:58,971 --> 01:05:01,499
- Where is Sho?
- He'll be fine.

801
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,190
Restart over oxygen at the end Station.

802
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,107
Let me up.

803
01:05:26,928 --> 01:05:28,014
Oh..Miranda.

804
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:37,581
Up up.

805
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:07,777
I'm coming home, Mei.

806
01:06:42,524 --> 01:06:46,207
You know what I feel is not scientific.
It's not rational.

807
01:06:48,636 --> 01:06:50,163
I feel hate.

808
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,273
I feel pure...

809
01:06:53,974 --> 01:06:55,303
Fucking...

810
01:06:56,003 --> 01:06:57,920
hate for that thing.

811
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:10,794
Calvin.

812
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,370
How is that moving like that?

813
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:21,585
He has to swallow the Derry's leg.

814
01:07:21,686 --> 01:07:22,686
Yes.

815
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:27,224
We can track it.

816
01:09:07,732 --> 01:09:08,966
Let's kill this thing.

817
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:10,467
Lifting Zarya now.

818
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:23,918
It is suffocating.

819
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:25,942
How long do you think
that's gonna take?

820
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:27,044
I don't know.

821
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:30,689
Proximity alert.

822
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:39,601
They're coming. Kat's distress
call must have reached to earth.

823
01:09:39,702 --> 01:09:41,662
Like where they docking?

824
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:44,643
Shit.
Seems like Zarya.

825
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:46,823
Shit, that's where Calvin is.
Is it?

826
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:50,377
Station to Soyuz.

827
01:09:50,578 --> 01:09:52,650
Station to Soyuz, do you copy?

828
01:09:54,716 --> 01:09:56,142
Station to Soyuz, do you copy?

829
01:09:57,104 --> 01:09:58,487
- Station to Soyuz, do you copy?
- Try the flashlight.

830
01:10:02,654 --> 01:10:04,181
Look at one!

831
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:07,624
Can't see this.

832
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,429
It's too reflective

833
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,246
Shit.

834
01:10:23,497 --> 01:10:25,105
What the fuck are they doing?

835
01:10:25,307 --> 01:10:26,107
David.

836
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:27,607
David!

837
01:10:27,908 --> 01:10:30,025
They are not coming to rescue us.

838
01:10:31,539 --> 01:10:32,879
It is firewall 3.

839
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,981
What?

840
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:38,032
Firewall 1 was the box.

841
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:40,432
The firewall 2 was the lab.

842
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:44,671
The firewall 3 is the station.

843
01:10:46,513 --> 01:10:47,713
We have a new firewall.

844
01:10:47,835 --> 01:10:50,059
They don't know that.

845
01:10:50,248 --> 01:10:53,808
And if firewall 1 or 2 fail,
they have two choices.

846
01:10:54,608 --> 01:10:56,204
They can Contain...

847
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:57,804
or expel..

848
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:04,303
They are pushing us out to deep space.

849
01:11:06,574 --> 01:11:09,292
They can not risk Calvin reach Earth.

850
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:11,597
It was my protocol.

851
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:15,706
I insisted from the beginning,
and the committee agreed.

852
01:11:17,026 --> 01:11:19,345
They all put their names on it.

853
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:21,340
The list is as long as your arm.

854
01:11:23,044 --> 01:11:25,256
Look, protecting firewall is my job.

855
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,902
And if we would have succeeded,
we could have gone home.

856
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:31,550
And if we fail...

857
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:40,780
Wait for me, Mei

858
01:11:51,952 --> 01:11:54,351
Sho. He thinks
it's a rescue.

859
01:11:54,753 --> 01:11:57,402
He is heading towards Calvin.

860
01:12:10,985 --> 01:12:12,141
Sho!

861
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:14,008
Sho, can you hear us?

862
01:12:53,284 --> 01:12:54,285
Sho!

863
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:38,313
Sho!

864
01:13:48,692 --> 01:13:50,146
Take my hand!

865
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,966
Don't let go, Sho!

866
01:14:13,754 --> 01:14:15,494
No, don't let go!

867
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,471
Let go!

868
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:27,724
No! Sho!

869
01:14:58,195 --> 01:14:59,195
Miranda!

870
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:06,948
Miranda!

871
01:16:01,134 --> 01:16:03,367
The CPU is still up.
It's a miracle.

872
01:16:04,411 --> 01:16:05,786
We are...

873
01:16:06,087 --> 01:16:07,566
We're losing life support.

874
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:09,568
The temperature is dropping rapidly.

875
01:16:09,769 --> 01:16:13,283
Atmosphere denting from everywhere,
I don't know how to stop it.

876
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,367
How much time do we have?

877
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:16,767
In here?

878
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,186
Two hours, maybe an hour and 45.

879
01:16:20,388 --> 01:16:21,388
I need a...

880
01:16:22,584 --> 01:16:23,881
- What?
- Fuck.

881
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:25,781
- Fuck.
- What is it?

882
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:28,438
- What?
- We're...

883
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:31,891
We are not moving into space.
The opposite

884
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:34,683
All that fucked up thrusting,
we are decaying again.

885
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,180
What?

886
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:40,657
Sho has a subroutine here.

887
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,053
Can't correct any course, which
we gonna need fuel...

888
01:16:50,641 --> 01:16:52,833
We'll get to the atmosphere in a...

889
01:16:55,593 --> 01:16:57,104
39 minutes.

890
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:11,544
We're not gonna survive re-entry.

891
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,759
Calvin could.

892
01:18:06,616 --> 01:18:08,474
It's so cold.

893
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:28,867
<i><b>GOOD NIGHT MOON</b></i>

894
01:18:33,144 --> 01:18:36,146
My father used to read this
to me as a child.

895
01:18:42,046 --> 01:18:43,727
<i>Goodnight room.</i>

896
01:18:46,782 --> 01:18:48,328
<i>Goodnight Moon.</i>

897
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:52,596
<i>Good night, cow jumping over the moon.</i>

898
01:18:57,081 --> 01:18:58,644
<i>Good night, light...</i>

899
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:00,821
<i>and the red balloon.</i>

900
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:10,109
<i>Goodnight nobody.</i>

901
01:19:36,943 --> 01:19:40,200
You know when I saw my
first picture of Earth.

902
01:19:42,297 --> 01:19:45,062
And I asked my father where are those...

903
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,953
all those lines.

904
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:50,662
Borders.

905
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:57,468
I will miss him.

906
01:20:18,053 --> 01:20:19,710
<i>"Good night Moon"</i>

907
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:23,625
<i>"Good night, stars"</i>

908
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:26,929
<i>"Good night air"</i>

909
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,934
<i>"Good night air"</i>

910
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,051
Eight.

911
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:42,436
Calvin needs oxygen to survive.

912
01:20:42,592 --> 01:20:46,387
With the O2 level sub low in the rest of
the ship, it will targeting oxygen candles

913
01:20:46,589 --> 01:20:48,249
We can use them as bait

914
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:51,247
There are two lifeboats, A and B.

915
01:20:52,262 --> 01:20:54,698
Both set to default entry trajectory.

916
01:20:55,579 --> 01:20:58,989
You press the button,
the AutoPilot then helps to surface

917
01:20:59,774 --> 01:21:04,124
Unless somebody..
somebody overrides that from the inside.

918
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:08,768
I'll use the Oxygen candles
to lure Calvin to boat A.

919
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:12,800
I close the hatch, You press the button
to give me full manual control.

920
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:16,222
If I can hold the stick
I can override the flight path.

921
01:21:16,424 --> 01:21:20,294
And I hold it long enough,
It will avoid re-entry.

922
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,376
We fly it into deep space.

923
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:26,267
With.. With Calvin.
Yes.

924
01:21:26,669 --> 01:21:30,179
Meanwhile, you get into the boat B.
You press the button.

925
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,292
If there are no complications,
Then it takes you back home.

926
01:21:33,396 --> 01:21:35,371
We should not in together.

927
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:37,231
Come on Miranda.

928
01:21:37,432 --> 01:21:40,073
- It doesn't make any sense
- Why?

929
01:21:40,274 --> 01:21:42,831
The lifeboats are made for one person.

930
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:46,154
And this has been your plan from all along.

931
01:21:47,044 --> 01:21:49,787
So make sure that creature
doesn't get to Earth.

932
01:21:50,728 --> 01:21:53,972
- Then I should be Plan A.
- No, I'm the pilot.

933
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:56,422
You're the Plan B.

934
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,897
Listen, listen.

935
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:01,725
I belong up here.

936
01:22:06,857 --> 01:22:11,367
I do not want back down there living with
those motherfuckers.

937
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:17,753
I just want you to say you trust me.

938
01:22:19,718 --> 01:22:20,718
Yeah?

939
01:22:28,408 --> 01:22:29,713
I do.

940
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:33,092
I trust you.

941
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:39,859
Wait here.
I'll signal you

942
01:23:42,349 --> 01:23:44,799
<i><b>LOW OXYGEN</b></i>

943
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,255
Shit!

944
01:25:37,075 --> 01:25:38,315
Fuck.

945
01:26:57,816 --> 01:27:01,501
This is mission specialist Dr. David Jordan,
commanding Soyuz lifeboat A.

946
01:27:01,601 --> 01:27:04,177
22:33 UTC.

947
01:27:04,378 --> 01:27:08,002
The ISS has entered
catastrophic orbital decay.

948
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:11,584
Initiating emergency sequences 5...

949
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,765
4... 3...

950
01:27:14,266 --> 01:27:16,787
2... 1.

951
01:27:55,233 --> 01:27:57,181
Come on, Miranda, get going.

952
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:15,164
Initiating manual override

953
01:28:44,415 --> 01:28:48,472
This is Dr. Miranda North, Black box
recording, in case of death upon re entry.

954
01:28:49,573 --> 01:28:52,648
The creature killed four of
six ISS astronauts

955
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:57,802
With fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumably
dead, carrying it out into deep space.

956
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,764
My five colleagues, all sacrificed
themselves to maintain the firewalls.

957
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:07,400
Please..honor them for giving
everything to this cause.

958
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:11,122
Mars life forms should be
considered hostile.

959
01:29:11,222 --> 01:29:14,936
Do not underestimate their intelligence
and there adaptive capabilities.

960
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:19,120
Now we do not learn
how to restrain or eliminate it...

961
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,464
And if this creature ever reaches Earth...

962
01:29:21,665 --> 01:29:24,654
use every available resources to destroy...

963
01:29:24,856 --> 01:29:27,221
or you'll risk all human life.

964
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,357
No no no! Do not!

965
01:33:37,656 --> 01:33:39,544
<i>SYSTEM FAILURE</i>

966
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,813
No no!

967
01:33:50,615 --> 01:33:51,615
No!

968
01:33:52,329 --> 01:33:53,329
No no no!
Oye...

969
01:33:53,813 --> 01:33:55,198
Wait, Wait, no, no, no!
