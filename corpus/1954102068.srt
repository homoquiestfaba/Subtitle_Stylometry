1
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:13,251
Karl!

2
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:30,895
Hello.

3
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,310
Hi.

4
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:37,546
Back!

5
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,424
Oh, what's the matter Karl?

6
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,790
Forget your umbrella?

7
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:45,932
Karl, Karl, Karl.

8
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:47,069
I told you

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,930
to stop coming by here.
This is our street.

10
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,299
Yeah! This is our street.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,543
I live here too.

12
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:54,722
Hey Karl,

13
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,973
what does breast milk
taste like when you are 16?

14
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,881
Karl, is that you?

15
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:05,685
Karl!

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,390
Hey Mom.

17
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,477
Karl, I told you
to avoid those kids

18
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:11,867
now you're just gonna have to find
another way to go home.

19
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:12,938
They're just kids

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,499
'Mom'.
I can handle it.

21
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:15,948
Don't worry.

22
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:17,625
Come here.

23
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:19,767
Mom.

24
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:20,938
Come here!

25
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,207
You still going out tonight?

26
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:36,858
Yep.

27
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,539
It's a, little itchy, but

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,440
I don't mind.

29
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,805
Yes I suppose it is
hard to maintain, but

30
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:27,706
well,

31
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,801
you tell me if it's worth it.

32
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,839
Hello, this is
Karl Mulberry, reporting live

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,465
for the weather service.

34
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,115
My moustache?

35
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,383
Oh yes it is real.

36
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:39,115
It's hilarious.

37
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,806
Thank you so much.

38
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:42,518
You know you really
didn't have to do this.

39
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,924
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

40
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:46,668
Oh, Karl!

41
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,223
I didn't realize you were home.

42
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:51,279
Frank, this is Karl.
Karl, this is Frank Salt.

43
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,139
Colonel, Frank Salt.

44
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,040
Oh,

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,220
right.

46
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,876
You know son
when a man extends his hand

47
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,303
it's usually considered
polite to shake it.

48
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:04,036
Now if you were to pull a stunt
like that in the army

49
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:05,849
you might lose your own hand.

50
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,825
Tactical blade,

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,750
nice and neat.

52
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,575
He seemed nice, didn't he?

53
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,447
Hey,

54
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:14,848
did dad

55
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,687
have a moustache
when you first met him?

56
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,391
Yeah.

57
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,436
Yeah your father had
a moustache as long I knew him.

58
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,078
Mom,

59
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,492
how do I look?

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,685
All right, very handsome.

61
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:57,290
Let it rain!

62
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:06,634
He was standing there staring

63
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,464
and then she looked him
right in the eye and said:

64
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,118
Mister!

65
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,259
You put that right back
where you found it!

66
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,550
Oh Frank, she didn't say that.

67
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,981
She did too.

68
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,389
Karl.

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,425
Hey Karl,
what happened to you?

70
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,420
Oh, some,

71
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,521
some neighborhood bullies
have been picking on Karl.

72
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:23,051
Mom!

73
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,188
But if he would just avoid them

74
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,974
then this wouldn't be a problem.

75
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,966
Bullies?

76
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:27,933
Are they still out there?

77
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,730
'cause I know a little
something about warfare.

78
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:30,641
If you want to

79
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:33,636
we can get us a barrel of oil
and grab some matches!

80
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:35,667
What are you even doing here?

81
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,081
Oh, well your mom left

82
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:39,593
one of her earrings
at the store and I just...

83
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:40,494
Yeah.

84
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:42,058
I just brought it back to her.

85
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:45,114
And I invited Frank
to stay for dinner.

86
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,995
So Karl, your mom tells me to 
you're a...

87
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,491
heck of a rollerblader.

88
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,708
You have any other hobbies?

89
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,619
Nope.

90
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,753
When I was in the army,
I...got me an accordion.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,610
Not much to look at,
but a great sound.

92
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:02,341
Has my mom
told you about my dad?

93
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,352
Oh, ah.

94
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,265
That’s the man.

95
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,063
Oh yeah,

96
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,248
I can see where you
get your good looks.

97
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,386
What happened to him?

98
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,364
He was in the weather service.

99
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:23,431
No!

100
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:26,032
Gerald! This feels like
a Gerald to me.

101
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:27,898
Hold on

102
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:28,573
wait!

103
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:29,484
Hello!

104
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:33,807
It was his job
to name all the hurricanes.

105
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:34,936
Wow!

106
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,325
Well that is really cool Karl.

107
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,310
You think it...

108
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,419
it's really cool
that my dad died?

109
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,232
Karl!?

127
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:42,596
No.

110
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,963
That's, kind of
a rude thing to say.

111
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,182
No, I just meant,

112
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,947
you should be very proud Karl

113
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,833
of the work your father did.

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,649
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,107
No-no-no, it’s not you.

116
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,968
He's been a little
moody lately that’s all.

117
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,381
When I was in the army

118
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,802
I, got me an accordion.

119
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,298
I, got me an accordion.

120
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,817
I, got me an accordion.

121
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,175
No way!

122
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,141
Oh, hey!

123
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,092
Is that you Karl?

124
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:44,592
I thought that was
your mom's room!

125
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:49,364
Frank?

126
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:50,458
Is that you?

127
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,630
Karl?

128
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,527
Oh, hey mom.

129
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:58,475
Almost ready.

130
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,618
Karl, there's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

131
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,103
Mom, I already told you,

132
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,885
I thought he was a burglar.

133
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:06,991
Oh, well,

134
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,292
even so,
you should know who your

135
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,428
throwing rollerblades at
before you throw them.

136
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,185
Jeez mom, I was just trying
to protect the house!

137
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:15,208
What's the problem?

138
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,459
Karl, I don't want you
to feel threatened.

139
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,023
I hope you know that,

140
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,754
Frank is not here
to replace your father.

141
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,311
Yeah I know.

142
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,570
And there is 'no way'
he could ever replace you.

143
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,171
He is not nearly
as handsome as my son.

144
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:41,405
Is that,

145
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,901
perfume you're wearing?

146
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:49,355
All set?

147
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,664
All set for what?

148
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,539
Would you mind if Frank
takes me dancing tonight?

149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,319
But it's Friday.

150
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,241
Hey Karl, you're welcome
to come with us if you want too.

151
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,083
I don't want you to think
that I resent that whole

152
00:07:58,084 --> 00:07:59,739
rollerblade thing
you know, heck.

153
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,015
I've been shot
in the head before!

154
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,620
You have?
- Yes.

155
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,497
Well..., what,
what do you think Karl?

156
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:06,865
Do, you wanna join us?

157
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,661
Really, I don't mind sharing her!

158
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:12,024
I tell you what sweetie,

159
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:13,315
take this!

160
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,394
Okay? And you get
any kind of food you want.

161
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,347
And call me if you
need anything, all right?

162
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:18,637
I'll have her home before bedtime.

163
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,174
Okay.

164
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,075
Be good!

165
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:47,582
I don't know how you do it
in high heels though because,

167
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,023
my dogs are barking right now.

168
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:51,090
Well so are mine

169
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,782
because you were stepping
on them all evening.

170
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,217
Well that's because
I'm a work in progress.

171
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,323
Oh, okay.

172
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:56,507
Oh.

173
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:57,906
What?

174
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:58,817
Oh no.

175
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,281
Well now
what are we going to do?

176
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,640
Well I'm hoping
you know how to change a tire.

177
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:06,541
Me?

178
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,003
No, there's nothing to it.

179
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:12,096
You got to have the right tools.

180
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,551
Not much you can do
with the electrics

181
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,932
at least you can change
your tire when you need to.

182
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:23,562
What in the world!

183
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,105
Okay!

184
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,644
All right, that's funny.

185
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:38,774
Frank?

186
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,332
Oh, well, that is just a gag.

187
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,379
I mean, it's it, th..., this is.

188
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,395
what the... I don't even know.

189
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,170
What do you do
with something like that?

190
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:03,533
So what?

191
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:07,218
Mister Wonderful didn't want
to stay the night?

192
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:09,580
Well, I don't think we're
gonna be seeing

193
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,401
very much of Frank anymore.

194
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,452
How come?

195
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,432
Let's just say ...,

196
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,844
he wasn't the man
that I thought he was.

197
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,610
Oh,

198
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,272
I'm sorry mom.

199
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,673
It's okay.

200
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:34,343
I guess it's just
you and me, Karl.

201
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:37,905
As long we have each other
we're gonna be okay.

202
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,867
Hey, Karl.

203
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,422
I don't think my mom
wants to talk to you.

204
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,701
Oh that's... that's all right

205
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:56,836
I just want to drop something off.

206
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:57,737
She ...,

207
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,554
she might want to think
about getting a new

208
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:01,660
pair of earrings.

209
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,817
That one doesn't seem
to want to stay in.

210
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,813
All right I'll ... .

211
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,173
Well, it’s good to see you Karl.

212
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,254
Tell your mom I said 'hi'?

213
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,428
Frank wait!

214
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,403
You saw me.

215
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,781
Why didn't you say anything?

216
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,388
I don't know, I.

217
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:34,577
Guess I tried to put myself
in your skates and I,

218
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:40,183
I guess if I was you
I'd have done the same thing.

219
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,419
You would?

220
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,166
Oh sure.

221
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,767
You were just looking out
for the woman you love.

222
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,913
That's what
every man should do.

223
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:17,743
Karl, what's wrong?

224
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,419
I don’t know, I just, I

225
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,599
I put the stuff in Frank's car.

226
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,778
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:33,459
Why would you do
something like that?

228
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,744
I was just,

229
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,435
worried, that I lose you.

230
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:40,913
Oh, Karl.

231
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:42,770
Nice to see you again

232
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:43,547
Karl.

233
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,813
We are going to try
something new today.

234
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:48,126
Water was getting boring!

235
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,142
You wanna guess, what’s inside?

236
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,832
It's not lemonade!

237
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,254
It's human lemonade.

238
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:55,622
Any last words,

239
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:56,523
Karl?

240
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:58,617
Yes!

241
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:01,914
Now.

242
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,341
We got peed on!

243
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,447
Hi girls!

244
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,711
There he is!

245
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,159
Watch your flight, girl!
Watch your flight!

246
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,175
It's clear! It's clear!

247
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,156
Get away from me.

248
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,333
How does it feel girls?

249
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,804
You're a crazy old man!

250
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,752
What did we ever do to you?

251
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:33,479
Oh no! Throw it away!

252
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,557
Let’s be friends!

253
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,970
The End

254
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,970
