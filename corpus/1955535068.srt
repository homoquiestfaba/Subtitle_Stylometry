1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,280
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are on our final approach for Seattle.

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,034
The weather is fair,
with winds out of the east.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,352
The temperature on the ground, 68 degrees.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,955
On behalf of our cabin crew,
and us here on the flight deck,

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,794
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us tonight.

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,277
Life sucks when you can't sleep.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
Yeah, tell me about it.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,120
Sometimes it's good to talk.

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,874
Okay.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,794
This is gonna sound crazy,

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,590
but you ever hear about the videotape
that kills you after you watch it?

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,114
Well, I'm at this party,
and I meet this girl from Seattle.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,914
We totally hit it off.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,871
The next day she sends me this video
that says, "Watch me."

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,390
So, I find a VCR,

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,880
watch it,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,113
but the images on it...

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
The second it was over, my phone rings.

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,518
And this girl says
I'm gonna die in seven days.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,836
That was a week ago tonight.

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
Ever since, everything's been strange.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,835
All I got to do is make it
through the next five minutes.

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,309
- As a reminder...
- God. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,471
- Sir! Sir, please stay in your seat.
- Please remain in your seats

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,835
with your seat belts fastened.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,990
Sir!

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,910
What was that about?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,196
That cute guy sitting right next to us...

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,919
It turns out he's a total head case.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,676
And he was telling me about a movie
that's supposed to kill you.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,470
What movie?

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,596
Some video.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,990
A chick calls you on the phone
after you watch it

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,640
and says, "Seven days,"
which was, like, right now.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,630
Open up!

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
Did you make a copy of it?

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,675
Did you make a copy of the tape?

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,910
No! I...

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,037
- Miss, the seat belt light is on.
- Jesus.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,839
What is going on with you?
It's just a story.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,793
I've seen it!

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,953
Traffic control, this is Flight 77.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,032
We have some signal interference.

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,790
If you're not interested in buying,
I'd love to take a look.

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,191
Sure. I mean, who would want an old VCR?

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,834
Well, once upon a time,
this was a technological revolution.

47
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,549
Okay.

48
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
Just talking to the guy.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
It turns out that he got all this stuff from

50
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,312
a family whose son died
in a plane crash a couple of years back.

51
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,754
And now it's just a bunch
of outdated junk.

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,160
I prefer "vintage."

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,359
Come on, old man.

54
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,674
You still got some life in you.

55
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,270
Hey, Skye?

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,315
Guess what.

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
What?

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,080
Had a tape in it.

59
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,192
Care to see what's down the rabbit hole?

60
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,232
I'm gonna be late for class.

61
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,800
But then, maybe
you can tell me about it later.

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,870
Have fun, Professor.

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,631
Come on, work.

64
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,510
Hello?

65
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,517
Seven days.

66
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
What? Who is this?

67
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,949
Julia.

68
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,755
I keep thinking about this story.

69
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,678
It's, like, the most romantic story
in the history of stories.

70
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,078
Well, it's not how we met.

71
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,995
No. It's about this guy, Orpheus.

72
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,154
His girlfriend dies and he has to literally
go down into Hell to rescue her.

73
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,276
How come it's always the guy
rescuing the girl?

74
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
Just...

75
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,798
He tracks her down.
All right? He finds her.

76
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,396
And the Devil's gonna
let her go on one condition.

77
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,673
He has to start first, without her.

78
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,436
He has to walk away
without looking back at her.

79
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,439
- But...
- He looks back to glimpse her

80
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,751
and loses her forever. Ninth grade.

81
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,272
- English Lit.
- Okay. You know it.

82
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,239
So, what's your point?

83
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,117
I don't know. I just...

84
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,953
I relate to the guy.

85
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,400
I mean, I can't imagine
not looking back at you.

86
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,639
Actually, you got to go.

87
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,551
Because my boyfriend's leaving for
college, and I promised I'd help him pack.

88
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,835
- No!
- Come on, get up.

89
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Baby, baby, baby, he's a loser.
Come back to bed.

90
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,319
Come back to bed, now.

91
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,471
- You really need all this?
- Yeah.

92
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,238
Let's go. Come on, come on.

93
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,996
Come on, Holt!

94
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,594
Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.

95
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,194
Just give us a second, Dad.

96
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,034
You're doing the right thing.

97
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,673
Your mom, she really needs you right now.

98
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,478
I'm gonna miss your smell.

99
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,875
Really?

100
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,230
Yeah.

101
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,115
Okay.

102
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,799
I'll see you Columbus Day weekend.

103
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,715
And tell Tommy Lombardi
that I'm on to him.

104
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,916
What do you mean?

105
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,231
He gets a job where you work
the day I leave?

106
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
You're crazy!

107
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,749
Don't look back!

108
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,793
9:30, Skype, tonight!

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,190
- Where the hell is your shirt?
- Tonight!

110
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,397
- And every night!
- And every single night!

111
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,076
Unless I'm with Tommy Lombardi!

112
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,436
You did not just say that!

113
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,553
Baby, it's been six weeks. I can't take it.

114
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,836
Why are you so much nicer
now that we don't live in the same town?

115
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Sorry, what's your name again?

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,952
- Shut up.
- That's a weird name.

117
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
How are your classes?

118
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,196
Kind of uninspiring.

119
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,512
There's this one
Experimental Biology class, though.

120
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,795
The teacher's kind of a badass.

121
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,760
That sounds cool.

122
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,396
Yeah.

123
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,234
Not everything's cool, though.

124
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,710
It's still, like, a whole week
until I get to see you.

125
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,759
Well, you're seeing me now.

126
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,758
Yeah, I guess.

127
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,596
What about I start
by taking off my hairclip?

128
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,957
Yeah. Okay.

129
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,836
What's next?

130
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,992
"Take me, take me. I can't stand it!"

131
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,355
How did you even get in here?

132
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,113
These idiots just broke into my room.

133
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,234
Come on, Vision Quest.
Gabriel says you're up.

134
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,356
Let's go to the 7s.

135
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,318
- Shit. Tonight?
- Tonight.

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,710
Sorry, little lady,
but boyfriend's got plans tonight.

137
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,110
- You know, but we could talk.
- I think I'm good.

138
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,270
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

139
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,194
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- He'll talk to you...

140
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,199
Yeah, sure.

141
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,757
I told you I'd make it up to you.

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,395
Julia...

143
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,760
You owe me a good dream.

144
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,958
- Where is he?
- Who are you?

145
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,070
Where's Holt?

146
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,634
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him in days.

147
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,710
Don't lie to me!

148
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,950
I'm not lying to you!

149
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,434
What are you doing on his computer?

150
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,989
Tell him there's no hiding.
Tell the dead man he can't hide.

151
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,834
What... What are you talking about?
What's wrong with you?

152
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,114
She's coming.

153
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,919
There's no stopping her.

154
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,550
Tell Holt that...

155
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,715
Please pick up the phone.

156
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
This is Holt. You know what to...

157
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,519
This is Holt. You know what to do.

158
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,320
Holt, what's going on?

159
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,711
I just had the strangest conversation
in my life with that weird girl.

160
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,196
This is Holt. You know what to do.

161
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,954
Hello?

162
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,476
Science has told us that we are merely

163
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,510
the primal stirrings of
some carbon, some proteins.

164
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,319
We live a while, eat,

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,550
have sex, when we can.

166
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,477
And that's it, then we die.

167
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,596
Lewin, there's no need
to take notes on that part.

168
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,519
But wait, hold on,

169
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,196
because no one is denying
that we have consciousness.

170
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,949
Some inner life that's
not quite accounted for here.

171
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,796
Let's remember the infamous
double-slit experiment.

172
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,270
When no one is watching, the particles just
pass through both slits at the same time.

173
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,479
But with an observer,
they behave like bullets,

174
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,875
passing through one slit or the other.

175
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,438
This is big, guys.

176
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,277
The immaterial human consciousness

177
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
has reached out and touched the material.

178
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,638
There is a calculable transformation
in the real world,

179
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,520
and solely because

180
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,278
someone was there to watch it.

181
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,073
Which may account for the fact

182
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,999
that I have become significantly
sweatier once I've noticed

183
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,597
the mysterious stranger watching me
from the back of the room.

184
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,512
All right, that's it. Go get drunk.

185
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,793
Hey, I remember you guys from...

186
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,314
- Why'd you come here?
- Come on, dude.

187
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,192
Move it along. There you go. There you go.

188
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,750
How can I help you?

189
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,799
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

190
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,280
He's supposed to be in your class.

191
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,277
Okay. What's this guy's name?

192
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,794
Holt Anthony.

193
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,395
Yeah.

194
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,874
Not sure.

195
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,356
It always takes me until Thanksgiving
to start putting names to faces.

196
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,033
Really? 'Cause

197
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,595
he was supposed to do some sort of
extra credit thing for you.

198
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,310
Did he?

199
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,796
Maybe. I don't know.

200
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,875
I do know that I have 25 essays to grade.

201
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,160
Listen. Okay.

202
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,558
It's not uncommon for a new student
to find something or someone

203
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,355
that's more interesting
to them than class.

204
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,311
My advice to you? Move on.

205
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,716
- Calm down.
- I'm telling you, it's different.

206
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,634
Everyone says that.
It's okay. Where's your tail?

207
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,439
I don't have one anymore.

208
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
I told you not to call him.

209
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,912
That asshole hung up on me!

210
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
I wonder why.

211
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,676
Okay. We'll switch tails.
You talk to Holt?

212
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,879
No! I tried. He isn't answering his phone.

213
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,633
- Come on.
- Holt has his own problems.

214
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,240
You have to help me, Gabriel.

215
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,630
- It's your fault! You started this!
- Calm down.

216
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,230
Listen to me, Gabe!

217
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,471
The videos, the tails, all these people.

218
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,435
- It's wrong and she's pissed!
- You're being ridiculous.

219
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,160
I can feel her. It's all changing.

220
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,395
You don't have much time.
You need to trust me.

221
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,073
How could I ever trust you?

222
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,072
Get to your studio.
Don't talk to anyone along the way.

223
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,719
Make a copy of the video and wait.

224
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,872
I'm gonna send someone right now.
Hey, hey, hey!

225
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,278
Everything's gonna be fine, darling.
You understand?

226
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,795
Yes! I understand!

227
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,798
But you don't.

228
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,275
I honestly didn't find the tape
to be that scary, but...

229
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,880
Hey, you're not supposed to be here!

230
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,150
Hey!

231
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,199
You called me the other night.

232
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,876
Hey! Look at me.

233
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,355
You're the girlfriend.

234
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,876
Where's Holt?

235
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,639
I... I can help you.

236
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,792
But I need to show you something first.

237
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,995
You live here?

238
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,912
Yeah. Fine Arts. Grad program.

239
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,760
I need a clear head to do my work,
and I like my privacy.

240
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,436
Is Holt even here?

241
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,673
Did I say he would be?

242
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,553
Be careful where you step.
I just painted the ceiling.

243
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,195
Nothing's wrong. He's not avoiding you.

244
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,832
He's just on a journey.

245
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,877
I want you to watch something
and then you'll understand.

246
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,157
- Is that my phone?
- You're lying!

247
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,756
I need you to do this for me.

248
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,797
It's just a two-minute video.
It won't hurt you.

249
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
Open the door!

250
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,039
Julia! I need you to help me.

251
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,234
Holt watched it. We've all watched it.

252
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,318
Open the door!

253
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,275
You're not real.

254
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,874
You're not real!

255
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,474
7:10.

256
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,034
I win, bitch.

257
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,230
Jules!

258
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,754
What happened? What happened?

259
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,672
Tell me you didn't watch it. Tell me!

260
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,070
She's dead. She's dead. She's dead.

261
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,755
Hello?

262
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,590
Gabriel sent me.

263
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,399
I'm supposed to watch a video.

264
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,276
Hello.

265
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,079
Gabriel. Gabriel.

266
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,269
Do you know about Skye?

267
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,999
I know.
Someone put a picture of her online.

268
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,639
Everyone's dropping out.

269
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,235
Wait.

270
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Wait. Do I still have a tail?

271
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,116
Gabriel?

272
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,156
Is someone still watching for me?

273
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,439
I'm gonna find you someone,
I promise you that.

274
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,874
Just stay where you are.

275
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,114
Who was that?

276
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,079
It was Gabriel.

277
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,993
Everything's gonna be fine.

278
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,912
That's what he told Skye.

279
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,391
Listen, Julia.

280
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,917
I'm really sorry that you had to see that.

281
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,837
But I can't let you get caught up in this.

282
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,912
I think it's a little too late for that.

283
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,520
I watched it.

284
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,439
Twelve hours after Skye.

285
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,597
We were supposed to
help each other through it.

286
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,909
"Help each other"?

287
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,916
Yeah.

288
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,798
- So were you and her...
- No.

289
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,319
Gabriel said a few of us were
gonna be chosen for this experiment.

290
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,590
If you just heard the way he described it.

291
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,593
That we could prove
the existence of a soul.

292
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,319
Of life after death.

293
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,192
I know. I know. It sounds crazy,

294
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,476
but I'm just...

295
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,158
The tape is the doorway to the other side.

296
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,713
Then why did she die?

297
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,672
You have seven days before you die.

298
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,790
You just have to watch the tape and make
a copy, and show it to someone else.

299
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,314
And then you're fine.

300
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,559
Gabriel calls it a "tail."

301
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,399
Her tail just didn't show.

302
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,912
So were you supposed to pass on
a death sentence to someone else?

303
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,276
How could you get involved in this?

304
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,550
Please.

305
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,039
Whatever you are,

306
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,876
leave him alone.

307
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,318
Seven days.

308
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,234
Jules. What did you do?

309
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,715
I saw something.

310
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,349
There was a room. A door.

311
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,675
- Yeah.
- It's Gabriel.

312
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,873
Holt, listen. I've got a tail for you.

313
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,559
It's not for me anymore.

314
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,749
You know why I wasn't
answering your calls, right?

315
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,235
It was to protect you from this.

316
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,831
Gabriel had a solution for me.

317
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,832
It would have been fine.
I would have been fine.

318
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,920
Then I'll be fine, too.

319
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,636
Jules!

320
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,630
What happened?

321
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,080
A bird.

322
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,874
There was a bird.

323
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,755
Julia!

324
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,839
See? I told you there was a bird.

325
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,676
Julia!

326
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
But I saw it.

327
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,196
So, you watched the tape.

328
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,994
And I had dismissed self-sacrifice
as popular myth.

329
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,833
Holt was running out of time.

330
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,352
It was the only way to save him.

331
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,073
Anyone would have done it.

332
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,357
You know, I could show you some research

333
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,477
that would suggest the opposite.

334
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,874
She's marked already.

335
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,714
On day one.

336
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,795
And it's... It's different.

337
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,076
I wasn't marked until day five.

338
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,311
Gabriel, this has to mean something.

339
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,351
It's happening faster.

340
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,553
Maybe it is all changing.

341
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,915
I wanted to believe that tape
meant a lot of things.

342
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,479
That our souls are eternal,

343
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,393
and when we die,

344
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,954
the spirit strives to find a new home.

345
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,919
Then I saw the picture.

346
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,873
I saw Skye's face.

347
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,993
You saw it, too.

348
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,709
You want to survive, you make a copy
and you show someone.

349
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,240
No one is dying because of me.

350
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,635
I'll tell them how it works.

351
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,912
And so what? The cycle just continues?

352
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,593
What do you think survival is?

353
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,430
Just make a copy.

354
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,751
We'll decide what to do with it later.

355
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,909
Please.

356
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,275
What did you do here?

357
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,552
Her version won't copy.

358
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,832
What do you mean "it won't copy"?

359
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,039
Your file size is larger than the original.

360
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,840
How can that be?

361
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,675
Scrub through her copy.

362
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,557
What is that? Go back.

363
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,635
Right there!

364
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,990
The bird.

365
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,275
I told you in the car I saw that bird.

366
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,596
What?

367
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,035
It shouldn't be there.

368
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,194
I need my equipment.

369
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,996
Okay. See, there's these weird gaps
in the digital code.

370
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,316
Glitches where we get
these ghost images, like your bird.

371
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,235
I mean, we're talking one
or two frame still images,

372
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,391
but there's more.

373
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,712
There's video data condensed
in the still frames.

374
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,074
A video within the video?

375
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,075
Well, there is now.

376
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,317
I don't want you to watch it.

377
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,993
Jules, there's no way.

378
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,793
We're watching this together.
End of discussion.

379
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,435
Holt, whatever it is,
I think it's intended for Julia alone.

380
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,040
Look at me.

381
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,078
I know you're upset that I watched it.

382
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,716
But we can't let it be for nothing.

383
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,557
So don't look back, okay?

384
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,796
Put it on.

385
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,510
Jules?

386
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,432
Baby, tell us what you see.

387
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,519
A clock.

388
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,118
A cross in a flood.

389
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,875
A girl.

390
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,360
Jules.

391
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,870
Jules?

392
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,715
I don't know.

393
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,714
A burning body.

394
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,389
Jules!

395
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,351
Sorry. I...

396
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,080
What was it?

397
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,476
Only images,
but I can't explain how it felt.

398
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,919
Flood. Fire. Cremation.

399
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,993
Those are images that have
never been on the tape before.

400
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,390
You know, primitive cultures believed
that the only way to free a soul

401
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,034
is to burn the body.

402
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,077
That is, if you can find it.

403
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,389
Wait.

404
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,274
I saw this.

405
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,397
That's where they buried her.

406
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,112
I traced it to a town
called Sacrament Valley,

407
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,157
about four hours from here.

408
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,752
That's where we need to go.

409
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,676
Hello?

410
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,840
Thank you, Jamal.

411
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,031
The police are on their way here.

412
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,873
And you're not even coming with us!

413
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,316
The police want to ask me questions, Holt.

414
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,869
- They think you killed Skye.
- But you didn't.

415
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,231
I hope if you learn anything
from an education,

416
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,198
it's that more than one theory
can be true.

417
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,600
I didn't kill Skye.

418
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,994
And I did.

419
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,276
But the cops don't deal
in such ambiguities.

420
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,594
My research.

421
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,718
Everything that's known
about the tape is in there.

422
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,957
It'll be more of a help to you
than I can be.

423
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,474
A man never quite measures up to his work.

424
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,874
The images on the tape,
they were her story.

425
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,032
She wanted it to be heard.

426
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,599
"Samara was found abandoned
as a young child.

427
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,510
"No one knew where she came from
or who her parents were.

428
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,637
"She was adopted, and they realized

429
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,030
"that something was unnatural
about this girl.

430
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,235
"Something evil.

431
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,440
"They tried to kill her,

432
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,193
"but Samara survived for seven days
at the bottom of the well.

433
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,476
"They found her body years later."

434
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,835
And they brought her
all the way to this town?

435
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,149
Why?

436
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,677
I don't know.

437
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,430
That girl.

438
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,754
What girl?

439
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,836
Hello?

440
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,155
Hello?

441
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,311
- Can I help you?
- Hey...

442
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,473
There was no light outside.
Do you have any vacancies?

443
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,236
Two rooms?

444
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,670
One.

445
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,594
Cash only. Checkout's at noon.

446
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,197
It's an old house.

447
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,680
Walls are thin.

448
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,838
Hope you don't mind the cats.

449
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,669
I'm just down the hall.

450
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,635
Excuse me. Who's the girl in this photo?

451
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,836
The one in the middle there?

452
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,478
Why, that's my niece.

453
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,831
Beautiful, isn't she?
People say we look just...

454
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,833
No, I'm sorry.
I meant the girl with the violin.

455
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,475
That's Evelyn.

456
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,270
I think I saw her.

457
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,795
Earlier today.

458
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,113
That's not possible.

459
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,552
She disappeared 30 years ago.

460
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,472
Does anyone know why?

461
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,276
No.

462
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,196
And I'd rather not talk about it.

463
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,472
Ma'am, where's the church?

464
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,359
Well, it's not a church anymore.

465
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,791
That's when I hit rock bottom.

466
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,591
I guess the worst part of it
for me was that I let down my kids,

467
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,670
I let down my husband.

468
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,555
Raise your hand if life ever let you down.

469
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,357
Go ahead now, raise your hand.

470
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,596
And then you found the drug
that you thought unlocked a secret.

471
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,674
One day at a time.

472
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,634
Thank you all for coming.

473
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,598
I'll see you next week.

474
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,315
Jules. We better go.

475
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,957
So, what do we do now?

476
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,630
Awful young to be here.
Don't let it kill you.

477
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,800
Excuse me, sir!

478
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,560
Could you tell me a little bit more
about the church?

479
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,960
When did it close?

480
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,480
Been 13 years.

481
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,039
After the flood.

482
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,158
Town used to have five times
this many people.

483
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,830
Ever since,

484
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,551
there's more dead than alive around here.

485
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,230
Thank you.

486
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,395
- He said the church was...
- That's where they brought her.

487
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,030
The cemetery.

488
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,353
Look for her name.

489
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Come on, pick up.

490
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,717
This is Holt. You know what to do.

491
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,519
Holt, it's Gabriel.

492
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,875
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

493
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,759
but I figured out
the mark on Julia's hand.

494
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,514
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

495
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,110
"The waters rose to carry them
and brought them back safely to God."

496
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,710
Holt!

497
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,310
Holt!

498
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,358
Hey, hey, hey.

499
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,394
She's in there.

500
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,712
Someone moved her.

501
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,474
Jules?

502
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,040
What are you doing?

503
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,314
There's writing.

504
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,235
Holt.

505
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,076
Holt!

506
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,394
Julia!

507
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,438
Hey, what happened?
What happened? What happened?

508
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,640
I saw something.

509
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,475
The well.

510
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,995
- We were just looking...
- I know who you're looking for.

511
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,149
Let's go.

512
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,072
- What did you find?
- Two kids.

513
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,519
Caught them breaking into 294.

514
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,074
Breaking in?

515
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,400
Well, that's new.

516
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,233
You want me to take them
down to the Sheriff's Office?

517
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,437
No, no, no, no, no,
don't bother the Sheriff.

518
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,034
I can take care of this.

519
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,034
I'm Galen Burke.

520
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,838
I watch over things here.

521
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,954
So to speak.

522
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,237
Please. Come in.

523
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,520
It's not much.

524
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,030
But I wasn't expecting company.

525
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,951
- I can... I can take...
- No, no. I'm fine, son.

526
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,553
I know every corner of this house.

527
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,070
So,

528
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,834
you're looking for the girl.

529
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,198
I find it interesting

530
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,355
that you managed to find her grave
even after the marker was removed.

531
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,789
I had a vision.

532
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,673
An image of that grave that led me here.

533
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,871
And inside the grave,

534
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,233
I saw a vision of a well.

535
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,075
A vision.

536
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,080
So, you want to know about Samara Morgan.

537
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,910
Our priest was very active
with the community back then.

538
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,630
He heard that after all the little girl
had been through

539
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,231
that she was being denied a resting place.

540
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,517
Well, who's to say that charity
isn't meant for the dead?

541
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,118
So why isn't she there now?

542
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,430
Well, because we paid mightily
for this act of charity.

543
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,869
It was as if God and nature itself
wanted us to be rid of her.

544
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,350
- The flood.
- Yes.

545
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,671
But I had let myself believe,

546
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,720
like you,

547
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,230
that she was trying to tell me something.

548
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,238
I was pulled to that grave.

549
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,550
She showed me things.

550
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,716
Things that no one should have to imagine.

551
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,038
And then I went blind.

552
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,520
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be.

553
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,356
It brought me peace.

554
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,069
The priest requested
that her body be moved.

555
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,311
He left Sacrament Valley.

556
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,720
She was buried in a potter's field
just north of town,

557
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,871
to be forgotten by all.

558
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,034
I think we should get out of here.

559
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,395
Listen to me.

560
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,191
There is nothing about that girl
that's worth being curious about.

561
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,633
I need to see this through.

562
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,995
Why?

563
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,319
Because you think
you were chosen for something?

564
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,314
Having a vision doesn't mean
you know what that vision means.

565
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,154
Thank you.

566
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,393
What's this on your hand?

567
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,800
Why did you put this mark on your hand?

568
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,800
What do you mean?

569
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,830
Be careful.

570
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,950
You hear me?

571
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,389
So, what now?

572
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,755
We gotta find the body.

573
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,155
- What?
- Hey, stay right there.

574
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,591
This road's closed.
There's been an accident.

575
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,638
- Need you to turn it around.
- Okay, sir.

576
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,280
- Julia!
- It's that girl.

577
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,675
From the picture.

578
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,473
Hey! Where do you think you're going, sir?

579
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,192
Excuse me. Turn around.

580
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,596
Stop!

581
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,310
Evelyn!

582
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,230
Stop!

583
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,030
Gabriel?

584
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,670
Gabriel.

585
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,350
- Over here! He needs help!
- Hey!

586
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,350
Gabriel.

587
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,150
What is it?

588
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,675
Hey, sir! Please!

589
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,198
Gabriel, tell me.

590
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,720
You can't be down there!

591
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,115
Julia!

592
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,875
He was coming for a reason.

593
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,152
He wanted to tell us something.

594
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,837
No, she wanted to tell us something.

595
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,636
This girl has something to do with Samara.

596
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,440
We need to go back.

597
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,397
I can feel her pain, her suffering.

598
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,760
I'm sick with it and it's getting worse.

599
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,759
I'm so tired.

600
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,194
Then you sleep.

601
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,437
I'm gonna get us something to eat.

602
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,670
Okay.

603
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,190
Look.

604
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,118
We'll figure this out.

605
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,680
I was right there.

606
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,669
There you go, Karen.

607
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,673
Chicken fried steak and coffee.

608
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,910
Hey. Menu?

609
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,514
Yeah. Sure.

610
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,911
So, what is that? Chicken or steak?

611
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,080
You're funny.

612
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,440
Look, I...

613
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,599
I don't mean to be rude, but...

614
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,554
The girl who's friends with your niece,
the one who disappeared...

615
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,512
Can you tell me a little bit more
about what happened?

616
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,837
My niece and she knew each other
through the church music program.

617
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,911
But she was the most gifted.

618
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,474
People used to kid her,
"You're too good for this place.

619
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,439
"We're gonna wake up one day
and you'll be gone, and that'll be that."

620
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,116
I guess there's certain jokes
you shouldn't make

621
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,600
because it happened.

622
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,839
She disappeared.

623
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,594
No clothes gone. No note.

624
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,240
Just vanished.

625
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,916
The priest.

626
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,879
He kept you down here.

627
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,320
The child!

628
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,357
Thirty-four weeks.

629
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,632
Eight and a half months.

630
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,199
You were pregnant.

631
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,558
You were Samara's mother.

632
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:00,109
The police investigated for six months,
and then we stopped hearing from them.

633
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,954
Town never felt quite the same after that.

634
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,880
The priest.

635
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,390
Do you know what happened to him?

636
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,434
He still lives in town.

637
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,960
Although he isn't a priest anymore.

638
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,713
Not since he went blind.

639
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,951
I have to go. Excuse me.

640
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,910
Mr. Burke!

641
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,635
It's Julia! I have to talk to you!

642
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,073
The boy's not with you.

643
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,910
What's wrong?

644
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,396
I think I understand my visions.

645
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,510
The things she's been showing me.

646
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,317
I need to know about the priest.

647
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,795
I guess, just like most people
in the town,

648
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,915
the event sort of took it out of him.

649
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,478
I just don't see why it matters.

650
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,357
There was a girl here 30 years ago
who disappeared.

651
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,234
I've seen her.

652
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,829
Evelyn Borden.

653
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,714
You knew her?

654
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,640
Everyone knew Evelyn.

655
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,431
She was kept under the church.

656
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,432
I found a room. It was like a prison.

657
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,030
There were days marked off on the walls.

658
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,395
Nine months.

659
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,199
She's Samara's mother.

660
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,754
She suffered from the day she was born.

661
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,796
And she's still suffering now.

662
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,519
I think I understand it.

663
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,799
This curse. This.

664
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,511
It will never stop until she's free.

665
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,994
What's that sound?

666
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,914
Cicadas.

667
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,710
Burke.

668
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,474
Jules?

669
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,790
Jules!

670
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,470
Julia...

671
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,796
I know what it's like
to be guided by visions.

672
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,996
To be certain.

673
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,754
I was certain that I would father

674
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,151
a child that was gonna change the world.

675
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,994
And I was right.

676
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,672
You see, Julia,

677
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,192
she didn't take my sight.

678
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,590
I did.

679
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,680
Good girl.

680
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,391
- You're very brave.
- You're Samara's father.

681
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,672
You kidnapped Evelyn.

682
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,270
The night that I laid with her,

683
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,953
I heard them.

684
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,270
The cicadas.

685
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,960
You moved her bones
and she's still your prisoner.

686
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,919
As are you.

687
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,555
You think that you're
the first Good Samaritan

688
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,200
that she cried out to, to free her?

689
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,511
You're the 12th, Julia.

690
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,320
Though none of the others got this far.

691
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,996
You think that you're so close
to bringing her peace.

692
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,393
But you have no idea the hell
that you would unleash on the world.

693
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,960
Julia?

694
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,874
Samara can't hurt me,
because I can't see her.

695
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,600
But you, Julia,

696
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,199
I can hear your every breath!

697
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,916
You will

698
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,840
not set her free!

699
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,349
Julia,

700
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,758
you remind me of Evelyn.

701
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,279
I chained Evelyn's hands

702
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,990
because she was trying to kill our child.

703
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,913
I should have let her!

704
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,674
She was your daughter!

705
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,713
What are you trying to show me?

706
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,910
No.

707
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,634
Samara.

708
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,479
You're here.

709
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,230
Julia?

710
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,675
Here she is, Samara!

711
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,072
This is what becomes of your savior!

712
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,392
With the grace of the Holy Spirit,

713
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,354
may the Lord who freed you from sin

714
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,509
save you,

715
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,196
and raise you up!

716
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,073
Julia...

717
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,960
Don't leave me.

718
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,593
...from sin!

719
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,836
May the Lord save you!

720
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,755
Through this holy anointing...

721
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,749
Who's there?

722
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,756
Samara.

723
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,518
Hey. It's okay.

724
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,680
It's over.

725
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,509
It's over.

726
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,155
Not yet.

727
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,152
What could that have felt like?

728
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,874
To be feared by everyone
who's supposed to love you.

729
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,553
Not everyone.

730
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,032
You were never afraid of her.

731
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,917
You're free, Samara.

732
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,399
Holt. It's Gabriel.

733
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,755
I don't know if you're getting
these messages,

734
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,560
but I figured out the mark
on Julia's hand.

735
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,677
It's braille.
I'm gonna come find you guys.

736
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,118
Our souls are eternal,

737
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,272
and when we die,

738
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,875
the spirit strives to find a new home.

739
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,749
I'm telling you, she's coming back.

740
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,194
This time for real.

741
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,751
You were never afraid of her.

742
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,840
Just because you had a vision

743
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,600
doesn't mean you know
what that vision means.

744
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,835
You have no idea

745
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,311
the hell that you would
unleash on the world.

746
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,794
And I'm sorry.

747
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,112
It won't stop.

748
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,430
No, no.

749
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:55,910
What?

750
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,120
No, no, no!

751
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,830
Stop!

752
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,119
Come on!

753
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,200
Julia!
