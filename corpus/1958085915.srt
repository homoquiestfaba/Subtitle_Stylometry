- Nothing so far?

210
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,457
They've all been pretty good.

211
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,708
- Good, yes.

212
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,001
Right, no.

213

220
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,392

Glad to meet you, Jamal Cook.

223
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,942
- Theodora Maxwell
and this is Dr. Bones.

224
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,444
- Nathaniel Hawthorne Bones.

225
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,321
- A pleasure to meet you,
we're really big fans.

226
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,406
We listen to KZMB all the time.

227
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,036
Well, well listen, uh,

228
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,538
the group usually
performs in costume, uh,

229
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,666
is there a place where
they can go and change?

230
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,043
- They?

231
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:14,960
- Oh, no.

232
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:15,544
I don't perform, I'm sort of,

233
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,172
like the artistic
director, you know.

234
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,009
Write the music and
sound, that sort of thing.

235
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,761
- Ah, yes, the man
behind the curtain.

236
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,597
Well, we do have
changing facilities,

237
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,435
but right now we're more
interested in the group's sound.

238
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,105
So, and if there is a later,
we'll deal with that then.

239
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,607
- Oh, there will be.

240
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,068
When you hear them, you'll
know what I'm talking about.

241
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,653
- Well then we'll
see about that.

242
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:45,741
- Then, uh, is it okay if
I go into the mixing booth?

243
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,202
That's were I make my magic.

244
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,119
- Of course.

245
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,037
- Okay.

246
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,625
- You're not gonna let him go
in the mixing booth, are you?

247
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,085
- For now.

248
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,920
It's important that
they're comfortable

249
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,131
so that they can produce
the best sound possible.

250
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,134
We'll know if they're
the right ones.

251
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,946
- We are so happy to be here.

252
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:28,242

will not be disappointed.

If you come by tomorrow,
we'll have papers drawn up.

368
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,611
We can talk, I can
show you the studio.

369
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,446
(eerie ambient music)

370
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,116
We got a lot of plans
in store for you.

371
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,076
And trust me, soon

372
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:07,915
everyone will know who you are.

373
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,377
All of you are going to
become very, very rich.

374
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,049
(clapping)

375
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,091
- Ah, damn.

376
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,012
You guys can really blow.

377
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,013
(laughing)

378
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
- Maxie White.

379
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,683
What are you doing here?

380
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,228
- Oh, well, I heard
about the audition

381
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,063
so I thought I'd come on over

382
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,981
and scoop up some
of this talent.

383
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,609
- These auditions are private.

384
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,361
- Chill out, man.

385
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,612
I'm just looking.

386
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,491
- I would suggest you look
elsewhere, Maxie White.

387
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,495
- Uh, yeah.

388
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:48,914
Okay.

389
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,415
Heh.

390
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,291
Look.

391
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:57,089
Sometimes a little
competition is healthy.

392
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,050
Keeps us on our toes.

393
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,182
- Ignore him.

394
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,393
He's just a scavenger.

395
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,689
Always feeding at the
bottom of the river.

396
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,694
Well, shall I

397
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,113
see you guys around one?

398
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,490
I've got a feeling

399
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:28,036
we're going to make some
incredible music together.

400
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,331
- All right.

401
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,624
Sounds good to me.

402
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,548
- Yo, wee.

403
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,300
- Heh, yeah.

404
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,592
We got us ourselves a deal.

405
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,136
- Oh, yeah, okay.

406
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,053
- Not yet.

407
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,471
- Well, tomorrow then, man.

408
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,931
- Oh, yeah, right, man.

409
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,099
This was tight.

410
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,393
(laughing)

411
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,937
- [Lisa] Pookie,
what are you doing?

412
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,564
- [Pookie] Hey, you'll see.

413
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,024
- Hey, hey, guys, guys.

414
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
Try not to rejoice
too much, okay?

415
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,902
Until we know exactly
what the deal is

416
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,946
and what he wants from.

417
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,241
- God forbid he would want us
to sing and play for a living.

418
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,160
I mean, listen, man,

419
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,411
we can't be getting any less

420
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,038
than what we get right now.

421
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
- Hey, people.

422
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,959
- Ah, that's what I'm
talking about, baby.

423
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,044
- Look.

424
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:17,961
- That's what I'm talking about.

425
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,129
There you go, there you go.

426
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
- Yeah.

427
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,006
- Whoa!

428
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,007
- Aha, aha.

429
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,674
- All right.

430
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,508
- All right!

431
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,343
- Yeah.

432
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,177
- Mm-hm.

433
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:25,969
- Right.

434
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,262
- Hey, we got to--

435
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,016
- All right, toast to
the Urban Protectors,

436
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
to our future.

437
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,977
Cheers.

438
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
(laughing)

439
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,688
- Yeah.

440
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,939
- Yo, man.

441
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,983
What's the matter with you, man?

442
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,110
This is a dream come true.

443
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,945
- Yeah, yo.

444
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,113
I mean, we've been
playing together

445
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,573
since we were in high school.

446
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,075
He's right.

447
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,993
This is finally a chance for us

448
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,953
to make this into something.

449
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,623
I mean, you should
be happy for us.

450
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,208
- I am happy.

451
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,085
I mean, is just,

452
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,004
seems like is a little too
good to be true, you know?

453
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,215
I mean, it's just something
about that Dr. Bones

454
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,008
that I don't trust.

455
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
He's--

456
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,428
- Hey, well maybe
it's the way he looks

457
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,971
at our girl Lisa, here.

458
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:13,475
'Cause maybe, if you
were an ice cream cone,

459
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,310
you definitely will be licked.

460
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,603
- You so nasty.

461
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,231
- That's cold, man.

462
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,107
That's cold.

463
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,650
- Hey, young blood!

464
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,277
All right, the Urban Protectors.

465
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,529
Woo.

466
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,614
You guys sound
damn good in there.

467
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,034
Now look, I know you
guys are planning

468
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,036
on doing something
with Bones and all,

469
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,372
but if that don't pan
out, I got a few venues

470
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,375
I wouldn't mind having
you guys playing.

471
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,629
Now, I don't have the
capital that Bones has,

472
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,006
all the fancy radio stations.

473
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,675
But I got a fair deal.

474
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:51,263
And nobody, I mean, nobody
has to chase me for a buck.

475
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,139
You know what?

476
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,223
Take my card.

477
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,184
- Wow.

478
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,185
- Call me up,

479
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:57,978
even if you guys
just wanna talk,

480
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,229
I'm cool with that.

481
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,440
You know, the problem
with young brothers

482
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,649
and sisters these days,

483
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,276
they don't have
people to guide them

484
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,153
in that right direction.

485
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,154
- Right, right, right.

486
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,530
- But you know what I mean.

487
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,157
Well, you guys got my number.

488
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:11,950
Use it.

489
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,243
- Right.

490
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,077
- All right, guys, cool.

491
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,078
Fabulous.

492
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,620
- Right, peace, man.

493
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,038
- [Maxie] All
right, call me, now.

494
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,248
- All right, bye.

495
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,375
- Yo!

496
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,711
(laughing)

497
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,721
(ominous orchestral music)
(choking)

498
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,566
- Oh, here you are.

499
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,194
Easy, there.

500
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,156
- Jesus Christ, but look at him.

501
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,995
- You're falling apart,
aren't you, Alexander?

502
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,207
It's time you retire,
my old friend.

503
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,043
(breaths heavily)

504
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,420
Even in your febile
and decayed mind,

505
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,340
you still recognize this.

506
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,509
(groans)

507
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,555
(breaths heavily)

508
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,725
Rest in peace.

509
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,269
At last.

510
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,147
Dispose of him.

511
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,197
Alexander was one of
my oldest and best.

512
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,908
Way of all flesh.

513
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,244
- But now they all remain dead.

514
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,206
Soon we won't have to
traffic with the dead.

515
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,000
- You always were,
they were reliable,

516
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,962
not like your new science.

517
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,006
- The world will be yours.

518
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,217
Not at the corners of a tomb,

519
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,928
but the living flesh.

520
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,097
- I pray that you're
right, Theodora.

521
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,441
(hip hop music)

522
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,504
- I need to talk
to you about today.

523
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,422
About us.

524
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,091
- Us?

525
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,636
You and me or the group?

526
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,596
- Both.

527
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,015
♪ All the rumors get started ♪

528
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,351
- Look, Lisa, I don't think
there's much to talk about.

529
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,104
We'll find out what
the deal is tomorrow,

530
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,106
either they want
us or they won't.

531
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,358
- That's not what I mean.

532
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,946
- Look, Lisa, you don't
have to do this, okay?

533
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,990
I mean, it's obvious
that I'm the only one

534
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,993
who doesn't think
Bones walks on water.

535
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,913
- We don't think that
he walks on water.

536
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,707
We just think that
he may have a boat

537
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,043
to get us to the other side.

538
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,669
- Yeah, yeah.

539
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,087
- You know what?

540
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:11,838
You shouldn't look a
gift horse in the mouth.

541
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,342
- You know, sometimes a gift
horse can be a Trojan horse.

542
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,011
- But sometimes there
is not a hidden agenda.

543
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,762
- Oh, come on, Lisa.

544
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,557
Everybody has motivations
for the things that they do.

545
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,976
- Oh, and there's
something wrong with that?

546
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,937
- Not if you're straight
up and up-front with it.

547
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,523
- Oh, and Dr. Bones isn't?

548
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,360
- Oh, when it's
about you, he is.

549
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,028
- Oh.

550
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,406
Okay.

551
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,075
- Yeah, Lisa, come on.

552
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,118
Pookie hit the nail
right on the head?

553
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,413
It's obvious that
the guy wants you.

554
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,957
- Yeah, he looks at me.

555
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:48,667
That's right.

556
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,504
He looks at me, but then,
most guys do look at me.

557
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,089
This is a business, right?

558
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,341
That's what you said, remember?

559
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,175
Right?

560
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,052
This is a business.

561
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,931
Now, I don't see you asking
me to wear a nun's habit

562
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,556
when I go up onstage to perform.

563
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,642
- Well, that's, that's
completely different.

564
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,143
- Oh, is it?

565
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,436
You know, I don't think so.

566
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,688
Because sex sells
all over the world

567
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,440
and that does not
mean that I intend

568
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,943
to get boned by Dr. Bones!

569
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,027

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,655

577

- Jealousy.

578
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,543
- It is not.

579
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,962

It's caution.

Nathaniel Hawthorne
Bones is no good.

585
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,556
- Mm-hm, and maybe
he just sees a group

586
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,142
of young black people
that he wants to help.

587
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,601

the Easter bunny.

of having an ulterior motive,

600
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,010

601
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,345

602
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,515
- Lisa, give me a break, okay?

603
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,227
- No, just because a
black man is successful,

604
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,938
it does not mean
that he's a sellout

605

- And the hospital
wouldn't accept her.

671

- She couldn't
afford the insurance.

money at that time,

673

that none of these so-called
brothers want a real sister?

703
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,022
I mean, all they want

704
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,775

Isn't she, Pookie?

732
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,225
- Oh, yeah, sure.

733
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:12,313
- You wanted to ask Wanda out
plenty of times, haven't you?

734
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,106
- Oh, yes.

735
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,692
- Then why haven't you?

736
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,780
- I just haven't.

737
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,787
- All women are not like
your mother, Pookie.

738
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,291
- She used to beat me so much.

739
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,754
- Yes.

740
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,592
- I mean, for the smallest
things, she beat me.

741
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,761
Beat me.

742
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,721
- Until?

743
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,683
- She died.

744
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,645
- How did your
mother died, Pookie?

745
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,523
- She was drunk.

746
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,151
She got into me about something.

747
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,406
She just went berserk and
started wailing on me.

748
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,991
Calling me, "No good.

749
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,159
"Lazy like your father."

750
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,085
She stepped in front
of me at the stairs.

751
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,256
And she raised her hand
to slap me in my face.

752
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,763
I never did it
before, but this time,

753
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,933
I raised my hand to block

754
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,060
when she swung to hit me.

755
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,146
And she fell

756
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,191
down the stairs.

757
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,529
She broke her neck.

758
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,697
I killed her.

759
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,325
- Oh, no, Pookie.

760
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,704
You didn't kill your
mother, it was an accident.

761
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,124
(sobbing)

762
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,792
It was an accident.

763
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,130
You'll never have to
feel ashamed, Pookie.

764
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,091
You will have a home here,

765
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,636
I, I will be like
a father to you.

766
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,690
- Where's Jamal?

767
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,027
Why isn't he here?

768
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,119
- You love him, don't you?

769
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,037
- He--

770
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,123
- Go on, say it.

771
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,211
- He was my first.

772
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,507
- Yes.

773
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,676
And the first is the
one you never forget.

774
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,055
- No.

775
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,433
- I like Jamal.

776
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,270
And bear no animosity.

777
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,606
What has he got against me?

778
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,070
- He doesn't trust you, he

779
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,156
thinks that you have
other motivations.

780
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,741
- [Dr. Bones] Motivations?

781
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,576
Like what?

782
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,539
- He thinks that you want me

783
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,627
and that you are not what
you seem to be to the eye.

784
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,134
- Will that be so bad?

785
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,095
If I wanted you?

786
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,057
- I don't know.

787
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,976
- I'm experienced

788
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:41,063
and I know how to take
care of a woman's needs.

789
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,274
Your needs.

790
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,152
- My needs?

791
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,701
- Think about that.

792
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:58,289
This is only a dream,

793
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,999
and when you awaken,

794
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,752
you won't remember everything,

795
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,090
only the important things.

796
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,093
Go now,

797
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,763
back to your own reality.

798
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,686
I still have work
to do this night.

799
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,026
- You look so good, mmm.

800
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,236
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, God.

801
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,071
- You keep making
statements like that,

802
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,406
you gonna keep me around.

803
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,908
(laughs)

804
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,452
- You might get fluent, girl.

805
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,996
Let me get you in
this car, right here.

806
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,539
- Now, wait a second.

807
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,750
(laughs)

808
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,339
Mmm, that was delicious.

809
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,965
- Damn straight, baby.

810
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,550
(laughing)

811
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,510
Oh, shit.

812
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,969
- Baby, what's wrong?

813
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,970
- Don't worry about it, baby.

814
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,638
Just get in the car,

815
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,933
you keep it nice and warm
for me, all right baby?

816
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,769
(suspenseful music)

817
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,745
Bones, my man!

818
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,331
- Hello, Maxie.

819
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,042
I was hoping I'd find you here.

820
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,544
- Well, you found
me, so what's up?

821
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,545
- My patience.

822
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,214
- Excuse me?

823
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,925
- My patience is up, Maxie.

824
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,510
- Man, what the hell
are you talking about?

825
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,222
- I'm tired of you
interfering with my business.

826
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,392
- Man, get the fuck out of here.

827
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,937
- "Look, I know you guys are
planning on doing something

828
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,105
"with Bones and all,

829
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,107
"but if it don't pan out,

830
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,441
"I've got a couple of venues

831
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,236
"I would love to
have you play in."

832
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,697
It did pan out, Maxie.

833
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,575
I sign them tomorrow.

834
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,285
- How did you find out?

835
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,078
(laughs)

836
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,371
- Maxie, Maxie, Maxie.

837
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,126
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

838
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,169
I'm moving up, Maxie,

839
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,673
to a whole another level,

840
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,635
I've been biding my time
and chomping at the bit,

841
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,430
I'm going global, baby.

842
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,726
I've been on this Earth
for a mighty long time.

843
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,645
- Stay back, man.

844
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,397
- Silence is golden.

845
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,319
(choking)

846
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,071
- Maxie, baby, what's happening?

847
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,072
- Yes, Maxie,

848
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,075
what's happening?

849
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,994
Take him to the car.

850
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,998
(woman screaming)

851
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,418
- What's going on, baby?

852
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,670
(screams)

853
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,342
- [Dr. Bones] We're
back, Los Angeles,

854
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,469
you're listening to KZMB,

855
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,221
the sound of the city.

856
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:05,017
You know the deal,
Dr. J and Dr. Dre,

857
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:09,438
well this is Dr. Bones
and the doctor is in.

858
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,523
Emma, you're on the air.

859
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,361
- [Emma] Love your
show, Dr. Bones.

860
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,698
I just wanna say that I agree
with what you said yesterday

861
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,243
about the effects of
music on our young people.

862
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,621
- [Dr. Bones] Well,
thank you, Emma.

863
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,331
- [Emma] I think you're right.

864
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,667
A lot of parents
are falling down

865
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,960
on their job with their kids,

866
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,296
and blaming music for
their own shortcomings.

867
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,548
- [Dr. Bones] Absolutely.

868
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,050
It's crazy to think

869
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,636
that music will have more
of an effect on a child

870
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,971
than a parent with a
belt in their hand.

871
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,142
And on that note, let's
get to some serious sounds.

872
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,481
♪ You move too slow ♪

873
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,154
- Okay.

874
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,656
- You guys all right?

875
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,740
- Yeah, man.

876
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,120
- I mean, why are you asking?

877
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,164
- You guys are pretty quiet.

878
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,917
- No, man, we're just, you
know, a little nervous.

879
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:12,543
- Yeah, yeah.

880
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,254
- I guess it is a pretty
big day for us all.

881
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,464
- You said it all at
the meeting last night.

882
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,258
- You had a conversation.

883
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,094
- Just a weird
dream, that's all.

884
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,097
- Okay, well, uh, guys, listen.

885
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,349
I just wanna say that, uh,

886
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,977
I know this is a very
important meeting,

887
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,437
you know, probably one of
the most important meetings

888
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,939
we've ever had,
and I just thought

889
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,608
it'd be a good idea
if we asked, uh,

890
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,986
the man upstairs
for a little help.

891
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,113
- Hey, that's a good idea.

892
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:41,947
- Yeah.

893
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,283
- Yeah.

894
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,496
- Heavenly father,
we realize that

895
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,082
we don't always come
to you for help,

896
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,127
but God, we know
that you promised us

897
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,628
that if we come to you in prayer

898
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,672
everything will be all right.

899
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,675
So now we're asking you
to come in here with us

900
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,427
and give us some discernment.

901
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,972
Give us the vision
to see your will,

902
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,018
and the hearing to
hear your voice.

903
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:11,935
Amen.

904
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:12,644
- [All] Amen.

905
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,396
- Let's do this.

906
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,606
- Yeah, let's do this.

907
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,525
(all chattering)

908
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,071
- Hey, what's up, my man?

909
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,323
How you doing?

910
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:30,746
A'ight.

911
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,999
♪ The party's over ♪

912
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,126
- [Theodora] Afternoon.

913
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,669
You are right on time.

914
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,422
- Well, CPT is a
thing of the past.

915
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,048
- Well, that's good.

916
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,384
The doctor's finishing
up on the air right now.

917
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,969
He'll be joining you shortly,

918
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,095
as soon as he can wrap it up.

919
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,013
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,515
We heard him on the way over.

921
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,016
Yeah, it was a good show,

922
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,228
about, uh, about the effects
of music on young people.

923
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,938
- Yeah.

924
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,273
- The doctor has some very
strong feelings on that.

925
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,983
Well, let me give
you the grand tour

926
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,944
while we're waiting
for Doctor Bones,

927
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,071
and I can show you where
you'll be recording.

928
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:04,988
- Great.

929
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,031
- Cool.

930
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,158
(chuckles)

931
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,078
- Of course you
know the dance hall.

932
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,039
Not only is it a stage
and concert hall,

933
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,542
but we use it as
a community room

934
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,670
for organizations,
town meetings and such.

935
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,506
We must do our community
service and all.

936
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,425
(clapping)

937
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,135
- Good acoustics.

938
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,680
- Yes, they are
good, aren't they?

939
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:33,100
- Oh, and I can't wait to
get back in this booth.

940
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,393
- Well, we'll see about that.

941
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,646
(eerie ambient music)

942
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,742
Come on, why don't
we see backstage?

943
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:59,334
This hall leads to the green
room and the dressing rooms.

944
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,962
We have four dressing rooms,

945
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,755
one for each of you.

946
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:05,757
- What about Jamal?

947
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,677
- Oh, I'll probably
be in the booth.

948
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,013
(chuckles)

949
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,431
- Oh.

950
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,517
Y'all, this is so tight.

951
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,518
- Tight?

952
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,936
- Yeah.

953
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,645
You know, most of
the places we play,

954
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:22,149
we gotta get dressed in
the bathroom, or storeroom,

955
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,066
ain't that right?

956
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,276
(laughing)

957
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,569
- [Pookie] You know
what I'm saying?

958
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,322
- Believe me, those
days are over.

959
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,324
- Yeah.

960
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,619
All right.

961
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,923
- This leads to one
of our basement areas,

962
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,676
which is undergoing
extensive renovation.

963
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,638
- Oh, you're taking us
on the scenic tour, huh?

964
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,307
- No doubt, Jamal, you know
every inch of your home.

965
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,018
Mine is not to be seen walking.

966
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,022
- But yours is to or die.

967
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,108
- Precisely.

968
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,028
Follow me.

969
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,625
- Oh, man, this place is huge.

970
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,918
- Yes.

971
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,336
It's deceptive.

972
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,587
When seen from the
outside it looks smaller.

973
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,506
Most people know about
the radio station,

974
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,051
but they have no idea
about the other ventures

975
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,344
the doctor's pursuing here.

976
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,179
When this area is fully ready,

977
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,390
it'll be used for
television broadcasting.

978
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,439
- I saw this place in my dreams.

979
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,607
- Me too.

980
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,609
- What the hell
y'all talking about?

981
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,029
- Hey, man, this
place is amazing.

982
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,072
You need breadcrumbs
just to find

983
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,949
your way out of this joint.

984
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:58,704
- Well, once you
start recording, you
won't want to leave.

985
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,080
- [Jamal] Hold on, hold on.

986
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,540
What's in here?

987
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:05,127
- [Dr. Bones] That's Doctor
Bones' private workshop.

988
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,920
- Ah, here you are.

989
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,131
We've just begun the tour.

990
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,342
- Urban Protectors.

991
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,343
Welcome.

992
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,428
- Thank you.

993
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,053
- Thank you.

994
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,472
- I'm sorry I couldn't
join you a bit earlier,

995
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,308
but I had some business
to take care of.

996
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,936
- Yeah, yeah, we heard
you on the way over.

997
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,979
- Ah, yes,

998
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,356
a major issue these days.

999
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:30,152
The effect of media on
the minds of the public.

1000
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:34,031
Does art imitate life or
does life imitate art?

1001
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,241
- Well, our art influences life.

1002
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,577
- Ah, yes, but to what degree?

1003
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,456
You see, we're all responsible
for our own actions.

1004
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,915
- Well the Urban Protectors

1005
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,085
represent positivity
and inspiration.

1006
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,171
- That's right, that's
right, we don't deal with

1007
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,923
none of that ho, bitch
bullshit, you know.

1008
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,050
That's not who we are.

1009
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,426
That's not what we do.

1010
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,552
- [Pookie] Yeah, right.

1011
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,386
(all laughing)

1012
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,637
- Hmm.

1013
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,390
I like that about you,
you're so different.

1014
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,440
- Well, speaking of different,

1015
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:13,195
what's with all these symbols
and mumbo voodoo whatever?

1016
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,614
- Ah, yes, uh,

1017
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,616
a worker put that up there

1018
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:22,704
for prosperity and protection.

1019
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,247
- That's cool.

1020
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,916
- Yeah.

1021
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:30,295
- So, uh, why don't I
show you your new studio?

1022
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,172
- All right.

1023
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:49,147
- This will be your new home
for the next two months.

1024
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,108
(laughing)

1025
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,025
- Yeah.

1026
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,529
Hey, look at this.

1027
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,036
(hip hop music)

1028
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,704
- Ah, that's too loud!

1029
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,331
- Ah, that's crazy!

1030
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,336
(laughing)

1031
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,132
- I can blow your heads
off with these speakers.

1032
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,676
- I bet you can.

1033
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,094
- A'ight.

1034
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,679
It's kinda small,
don't you think?

1035
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,973
- We're building you a new
state-of-the-art studio

1036
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,975
in the west wing.

1037
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,436
- Yeah, man, won't you be
happy for us some time?

1038
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,938
- Yeah, man, it's the shit.

1039
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,564
I mean, come on, man,

1040
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,109
It beats doing demos
in your little garage.

1041
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,986
- That's for sure, you
know what I'm sayin'.

1042
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,070
- I guess so.

1043
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,530
- You guess so?

1044
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,906
Man, I know so, man.

1045
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,617
This is what it's all
about, right here.

1046
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,912
- First, let's get
down to business.

1047
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:50,041
Theodora, bring the
contracts, will you.

1048
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,338
(all laughing)

1049
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,470
Why don't we all have a seat?

1050
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,682
(eerie ambient music)

1051
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,403
I want you to take a
good look at these.

1052
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,240
Not only will we
record and produce you,

1053
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,159
we guarantee you airplay.

1054
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,329
Not to mention

1055
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,956
planning a major
concert campaign.

1056
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,460
Boys and girls, you
will want for nothing.

1057
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:40,050
In addition to your signing
bonus of $25,000 apiece,

1058
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:41,968
(exhales)

1059
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,428
we are prepared to offer you

1060
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,308
$100,000 apiece for your
three-year commitment

1061
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,227
with Boneyard Records.

1062
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:54,189
We will be committed to you.

1063
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,567
- What, what about record sales?

1064
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,569
- You get a percentage
of every sale,

1065
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,072
and a piece of every
gate at every concert.

1066
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,575
It's all very simple and
clear in your contracts.

1067
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,204
- Okay, right here it says
that, that you are responsible

1068
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:13,041
for the production and
technology of the group.

1069
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,377
So what am I
supposed to be doing?

1070
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,170
- You're part of the group.

1071
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,965
You'll be included in the deal.

1072
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,342
We don't wanna cut you out.

1073
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,135
- That's nice, but
that doesn't tell me

1074
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,720
what I'm supposed to be doing.

1075
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,472
A'ight?

1076
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,641
My job is to control the sound.

1077
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,977
No one knows the sound
better than I do.

1078
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,395
- Jamal, isn't it?

1079
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,983
We need professionally
experienced technicians

1080
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,235
in the field of
audio technology.

1081
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,238
You see, this is a field
that changes every day

1082
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,075
And we just don't have time
to teach you as we go along.

1083
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:47,784
- Teach me?

1084
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,538
- Look, man, come on, man,
this is a good deal here.

1085
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,957
- A damn good deal.

1086
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,585
Actually, you have no legal
position with the band.

1087
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,504
You're not the manager.

1088
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,047
- No, no, I'm not,

1089
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,133
but we've had an agreement
for the last eight years.

1090
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,094
And we're friends.

1091
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,972
- Theodora, perhaps we
should give them a second.

1092
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:13,393
After all, this is the stuff
that dreams are made of,

1093
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:18,189
and you do remember
your dreams, don't you?

1094
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,528
- Look, man, don't
mess this up for us.

1095
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,946
Okay?

1096
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,240
This is a once in a
lifetime thing, all right?

1097
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,533
- Yeah, he's right.

1098
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,701
- Yeah, man.

1099
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,328
- Damn right I'm right.

1100
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,913
Even the majors, they don't
offer this kind of deal

1101
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,707
to an unknown group.

1102
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,624
- Yeah, yo.

1103
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:41,004
- I just wanna be careful
about selling out our music,

1104
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,047
you know?

1105
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,089
I love you, guys.

1106
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,008
- We do too.

1107
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,134
- And we love you too.

1108
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,012
But don't mess this
up for us, man.

1109
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:54,100
Come on, man, it's either
you're down or you're not.

1110
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,018
All right?

1111
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,187
Now, we want you with us, man.

1112
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,024
- Come on, man.

1113
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,442
- Come on.

1114
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,027
- Okay, we'll do it.

1115
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,195
- All right.

1116
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,237
- That's what we're
talking about.

1117
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,155
- Excellent.

1118
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,199
You won't regret this.

1119
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,035
There is one thing that I
wanna tell you up-front.

1120
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,289
It's that we're involved
with the charity

1121
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,917
of One World Trust.

1122
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,919
- Oh, I've heard about them.

1123
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,589
- We've been approached
to do a remote broadcast

1124
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,217
to promote the fight
against world hunger.

1125
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:31,638
The broadcast will be live,
and it will be worldwide.

1126
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,973
Now, we took the
liberty of telling them

1127
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,726
that we were
signing a new group.

1128
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,563
The Urban Protectors.

1129
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,940
(laughs)

1130
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,068
- We're gonna be featured
in the broadcast?

1131
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,528
Oh, man, that's awesome!

1132
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,488
- See, I told you, man.

1133
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,698
That's what I'm talking about.

1134
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,325
- You did, you did.

1135
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
- I'll tell you what.

1136
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,665
We're having a little
party tomorrow night

1137
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,376
to celebrate your signing,

1138
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,628
the upcoming broadcast,

1139
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,548
and a new faze for
Boneyard Records.

1140
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:11,219
We've invited a small
group of our key investors.

1141
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,517
And we will be proud
if you would agree to

1142
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,520
play us a set.

1143
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,938
- You're damn right we would.

1144
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,022
Hey, that's what we do.

1145
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:23,940
Right, y'all?

1146
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,024
- Yeah.

1147
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,777
- Well, I guess that's it.

1148
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,071
- [Phil] All right.

1149
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,156
All right.

1150
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,490
- Uh, Theodora,

1151
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:37,036
I think they're
forgetting something.

1152
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,123
Your checks.

1153
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,003
Don't spend it all in one place.

1154
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,006
- Oh.

1155
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,007
- Oh, shit.

1156
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,177

Lisa, the deal is great.

00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,791
I'd be a fool not to
admit that, it's just,

it's just that, that every

he just, he just
gives me the creeps.

1171
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,053
Have you ever listened to him?

1172
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,096
I mean, really listened to him?

It's like, it's like he's, he's,

1174
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,935
he's modulating
every word so that

everything that's
revealed about him

1176
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:48,233
is exactly what he
wants to be revealed.

1177
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,111
I know he's hiding something.

1178

He's hiding something

1179
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,240
and it has something
to do with our music.

1180
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,243
- Why do you think that?

1181
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,412
- Well, I think that
because he wants us so bad.

1182
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:05,124
- Well, I hate to inform
you but he's already got us.

1183
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,586
You should have seen
the bank teller's face

01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:22,989
- This is dope.

1264
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,240
Thank you.

1265
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,075
That's so sweet.

1266
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:26,701
- Good.

1267
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,204
I want everything to be
perfect for my new star.

1268
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,206
(chuckles)

1269
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,958
- You know, we are, uh,

1270
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,669
very grateful for
everything that you've done.

1271
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,504
- I know.

1272
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,506
That's why I'm doing it.

1273
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,009
You deserve the
very best for your

1274
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,052
great talent.

1275
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,637
(chuckles)

1276
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,057
- You sure know how to lay
it on a girl, don't you?

1277
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,270
- The artist formerly known
as Prince had his vanity,

1278
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,064
Babyface had his Toni Braxton,

1279
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,984
Berry Gordy had his Diana Ross.

1280
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,277
(chuckles)

1281
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,987
- Yeah, Rufus had
his Chaka Khan.

1282
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,907
- Yes.

1283
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,074
Chaka Khan.

1284
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,620
Well, I'd better leave now

1285
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,289
and let you finish
getting ready.

1286
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,043
But if there's
anything you need,

1287
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,670
anything at all,

1288
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,256
just let me know.

1289
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,427
Okay?

1290
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,345
- Okay.

1291
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,014
Thank you.

1292
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:31,724
- No.

1293
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,519
Thank you.

1294
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,314
I just want to keep you

1295
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,068
happy.

1296
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,028
- I am happy.

1297
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,416
(eerie ambient music)

1298
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,542
(knocking on door)

1299
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,918
Who is it?

1300
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,003
- [Jamal] It's me.

1301
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,005
- Well, come on in, baby.

1302
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,010
Hey, mister cook.

1303
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,096
What's up?

1304
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,222
- I got your cloak.

1305
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,140
I just saw Bones.

1306
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,558
What was he doing in here?

1307
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,935
- Baby, he owns the place.

1308
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,604
- Yeah, but he don't own you.

1309
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:03,190
- You know, I'm really tired
of your paranoid bullshit.

1310
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,986
You don't own me either,
for your information.

1311
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,446
Now, give me this.

1312
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,156
Get outta here.

1313
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,073
Come on.

1314
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,662
You're getting on my nerves.

1315
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,589
- Look, man.

1316
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,592
Either stop that shit,
or take it in your room.

1317
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,469
I'm trying to
concentrate here, right?

1318
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,220
- Yeah, up yours, man.

1319
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,723
- Up yours?

1320
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,518
I said stop that shit!

1321
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,562
- Stop what shit, man?

1322
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,022
I'm only tapping.

1323
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,607
- Look, you know what
I'm talking about, man.

1324
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,567
Don't make me put my
foot up your fucking ass.

1325
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,110
- You just said what?

1326
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,028
- You heard me.

1327
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,321
- Nigga, I'll break your neck.

1328
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,405
- What?

1329
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,406
- Hey, hey, hey!

1330
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,532
Hold on!

1331
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,159
What's going on?

1332
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,036
- I'm about to kill this nigger.

1333
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,079
- No, you ain't.

1334
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,913
- Hey, wait a minute!

1335
01:05:58,955 --> 01:05:59,705
Wait a minute, man!

1336
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,248
Y'all like brothers.

1337
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,460
Now, what's going on?

1338
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,129
- He was banging on
a goddamn desk, man,

1339
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,631
that's what's going on.

1340
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,592
- And since when is that a
reason for you two to fight?

1341
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,305
- Look, man, I'm
sorry, all right?

1342
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,015
You just ticked me off.

1343
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,727
- That's cool, man.

1344
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,105
- Cool?

1345
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,314
- Yeah, we cool.

1346
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,070
We're okay, we're
cool, we're cool.

1347
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,154
- Come on.

1348
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,115
We gotta show to do.

1349
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,120
- I said stop that shit!

1350
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,124
(banging on table)

1351
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,250
(sobbing)

1352
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,085
- Wanda?

1353
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,128
(sobbing)

1354
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,045
Wanda.

1355
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,173
Are you all right?

1356
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,427
- Jamal,

1357
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,054
I can't, I can't go on.

1358
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,431
I can't go in there.

1359
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,348
- Wait, wait.

1360
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,516
What are you talking about?

1361
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,560
- There's something
wrong, Jamal.

1362
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,353
There's something really wrong.

1363
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,187
- Wanda.

1364
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,272
Wanda?

1365
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,106
Listen.

1366
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,107
Listen, listen.

1367
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,066
Listen.

1368
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,609
I need you right now, okay?

1369
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:12,653
I need you.

1370
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,573
The group needs you.

1371
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:19,535
All right?

1372
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,620
Now, you're the
backbone of this group.

1373
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:24,957
You know what?

1374
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:25,750
This is just a crazy day.

1375
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,086
It seems like something's going
on with everybody right now.

1376
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,673
But I'm telling you,
when you get on stage

1377
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,176
and you start
playing that music,

1378
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,053
everything will
take care of itself.

1379
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:37,762
All right?

1380
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:40,723
You trust me?

1381
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,060
- Yeah.

1382
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,603
I trust you.

1383
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,395
- All right?

1384
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,522
Now, let's tear this roof off
the motherfucker, all right?

1385
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,440
- Yeah.

1386
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,067
- All right?

1387
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:51,734
- Thanks, boo.

1388
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:56,072
I mean, it's probably
just nerves or something.

1389
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,491
- Yeah.

1390
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,408
All right.

1391
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,494
Okay.

1392
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,502
(eerie ambient music)

1393
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,503
- Showtime.

1394
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,422
(hip hop music)

1395
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,215
- Okay, okay.

1396
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,008
How is everybody?

1397
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,343
- [All] All right.

1398
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:18,385
- You fine?

1399
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,180
All, right, all right.

1400
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,015
I want you to get on stage

1401
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,059
and do what you do best.

1402
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,520
- Yeah!
- All right.

1403
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,938
- Absolutely.

1404
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,940
I wish you all the
very best out there.

1405
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,233
You see, my job is easy.

1406
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,943
All I have to do
is introduce you

1407
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,278
and take all the credit.

1408
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,073
(all laughing)

1409
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,157
- Thanks.

1410
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:43,410
- That's what I'm
talking about right here.

1411
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,912
- Ladies, ladies.

1412
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,665
Could we, uh, do a little
sum sum after the show?

1413
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:48,499
You know what I'm saying?

1414
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,501
(audience applauding)

1415
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,627
- Ah, yes.

1416
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,170
Good evening, everybody,

1417
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,047
and thank you for
coming out tonight.

1418
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,217
This is a very special evening.

1419
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,303
You folks are considered
some of the city's elite,

1420
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:04,306
and I'm glad that
you're my friends.

1421
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,100
So party hardy.

1422
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,977
It's on me.

1423
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:11,605
And I can't wait to introduce
you to our newest discovery,

1424
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,942
and they're going
to top the charts.

1425
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,695
Wanda, Phil, Pookie and Lisa,

The same magic that can
control the bodies of the dead

1514
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,935
is been harnessed of sound,

1515
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,688
to control the
minds of the living.

1516
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,231
Before, though,

1517
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:50,277
whenever we tried to mix
the chants subliminally

1518
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,945
with preexisting music,

1519
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,156
the results were catastrophic.

1520
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,159
Each test subject died.

1521
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:02,581
We finally figured that we
had to mix the music live,

1522
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,000
the chant being performed

1523
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,544
at the same time the
music is performed.

1524
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:13,300
Then, and only then will the
combination be effective.

1525
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,969
Music does indeed have an effect

1526
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,598
on the mental state
of the listener.

1527
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,475
With the addition of the chant,

1528
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,020
we should have
total mind control.

1529
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,276
- And you're sure these
earpieces are gonna protect us?

1530
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:36,323
- Yeah, so far.

1544
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,189
he pulled his heart out!

1545
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,692
It's got something
to do with the music.

1546

1548
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:08,749
Philsie, why don't you tell
him how you really feel?

01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,342
You don't play shit!

1551
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,927
All you do is try to
fuck things up for us

1552
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,138

See, see?

1556
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:26,642
It's messing with your head.

1557
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:29,102
Look, the only reason
why it's not affecting me

1558
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,980
is because I have
this earpiece in.

1559
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,149
The hum interferes
with the signal.

1560

- That's stolen property, sir.

1561
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,073

1562
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:44,993
any idea of your
greater destiny?

1563
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,078

1566
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,209

ladies and gentlemen,

1567
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,044
Weren't they terrific?

1570
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,556
You walk off that stage

1571
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,185
and you'll never walk
back on again anywhere.

1572
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,729
This is just the beginning.

1573
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:17,984

will be played to the world.

1579
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,588
For so long I could only
control the will of the dead.

1580
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,258

(gasping)

1621
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,112
(sobbing)

1622
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,283
- What is that?

1623
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,496
Oh, my God.

1624
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,170
They're hearts.

1625
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,176
What's going on, Jamal?

1626
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,095
- Zombies, they're all zombies.

1627
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,638
(screams)

1628
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,098
- My congregation

1629
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,477
will now get all that changes.

1630
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:42,480
This is the day of
the living dead.

1631
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,527
- You must have sold
your soul to the devil.

1632
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,654
(laughs)

1633
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,073
- Centuries ago.

1634
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,952
Now, in the new millennium,

1635
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:59,039
I will be given the
minds of your youth.

1636
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,918
Soon they will be adults
and breed more slaves.

1637
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:04,377
- These hearts.

1638
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:07,172
These hearts are what
keeps them alive.

1639
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,548
- Oh, not for long.

1640
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,384
Soon they will be obsolete.

1641
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,930
My newer zombies
will not have to die

1642
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:17,265
in order to serve me.

1643
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:22,228
Imagine a world of Lisas
willing to succumb to my will.

1644
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,607
They're my children.

1645
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,152
- Oh, yeah?

1646
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,154
So what happens if I do this?

1647
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:32,948
(Lisa gasps)

1648
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:33,949
- What are you doing?

1649
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,658
No.

1650
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:37,035
Stop it!

1651
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,036
No!

1652
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:38,662
Don't!

1653
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,539
(screaming)

1654
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:42,457
No!

1655
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,043
- Lisa!

1656
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,004
(glass shattering)

1657
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,090
(growling)

1658
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,054
(screaming)

1659
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,265

1660
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,103
(moaning)

1661
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,020
- Move!

1662
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,612
(grunting)

1663
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:16,950
(electricity crackling)
(screaming)

1664
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,411
(Lisa screams)

1665
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:35,093
- Uh,

1666
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,556
that's our show
for tonight, folks.

1667
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,643
Let's get out of here.

1668
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:49,357
(dramatic orchestral music)

1669
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,156
(light guitar music)

1670
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:01,036
- And how is that song
coming along, Mr. Cook?

1671
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:04,080
- Oh, it's coming
along fine, Mrs. Cook.

1672
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:04,914
(chuckles)

1673
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:07,042
How's my baby boy doing?

1674
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,252
- Oh, he's doing okay.

1675
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,128
(chuckles)

1676
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:10,962
(doorbell rings)

1677
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,089
Oh, let me get that.

1678
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,258
- All right.

1679
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,183
(light guitar music)

1680
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,230
- Isn't this wild?

1681
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:32,942
- Who is it from?

1682
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,110
- I don't know.

1683
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,571
- Well.
- What you got in there?

1684
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,615
- Well, let's see what it is.

1685
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:46,915
- Hurry up, honey.

1686
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:47,999
- All right.

1687
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,922
There we go.

1688
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:57,092
(eerie ambient music)

1689
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,094
That's odd.

1690
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,182
- Baby, what's that noise?

1691
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,558
- I don't know.

1692
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:11,064
(chanting in foreign language)

1693
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,148
- Oh my god.

(chanting in foreign language)

1695
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:27,580
- [Jamal] A'ight.

1696
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,290
