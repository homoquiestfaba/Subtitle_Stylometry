the weakness of the virus.

very interesting.

It's right outside
of Los Angeles.

The plague in its infancy.

111
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,785
The AAMA knew this.

112
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,154
But they kept it
secret and then they

113
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,357

their own alternative form

114

AAMA rich and powerful.

People's only hope of relieving
their pain and suffering

created by the AAMA.

So in 1999 someone found
a cure for the plague.

supposed to do us now?

wiped out with the 8.7.

was able to restore this one.

00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,807
[Inaudible].

188
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,576
His eyes weren't
dilated, but still could

189
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,810
Be some concussion or trauma.

190
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,079
I need more oxygen.

191
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,848
Sir, sir, do you
know your name, sir?

192
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,455
No concussion.

193
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,689
No fracture.

194
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,624
No leakage across
the terminator.

195
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,393
The southern hemisphere
of the medulla region

196
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,529
Is at 5% soft tissue trauma,
but that's not the problem.

197
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,730
Doctor, I'm very busy.

198
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,965
The guy's going to live.

199
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,500
Maybe he'll have a headache
for a couple of days.

200
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,368
Is this why you called me?

201
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,802
No.

202
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:23,903
This is what I
wanted you to see.

203
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,642
That can't be.

204
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,778
You've got an alpha wave
here running flat line.

205
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,214
We ran the
electroencephalogram twice.

206
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,848
At first I thought I
had a faulty reading

207
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,050
Or there was a
glitch in the system.

208
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,086
There's not a damn thing
wrong with the EEG.

209
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,888
This is an accurate
wave reading.

210
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,556
Who is this guy?

211
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,057
There's another mystery.

212
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,627
There's no ID, no friends
have called for him,

213
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,128
No one's filled out
a missing person

214
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,164
Matching his description.

215
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,266
He's a non entity.

216
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,235
And he's an amnesiac.

217
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,770
From what we can gather,
given the nature of the trauma,

218
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,539
It's probably temporary amnesia.

219
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,109
But that doesn't account
for the alpha discrepancy.

220
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,078
To have an alpha wave like
this, a person has got to be...

221
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:06,879
Dead.

222
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,680
Yes, I know.

223
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,127
[Beeping]

224
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,969
Tell me you love me, Howard.

225
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,238
I love you, baby cakes.

226
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,173
And you'll never leave me.

227
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,108
No, never.

228
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,911
And there are no other women.

229
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,112
- None.
- Ever!

230
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
No.
Ever.

231
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,082
Oh, goody.

232
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,917
Then I'm going to
go to the bathroom

233
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,821
And change into my new
sexy nightie, okie dokie?

234
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,324
Okie dokie.

235
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,124
Hurry up.

236
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,293
I will.

237
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,093
Don't be long.

Hurry up, baby cakes.

241
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,881
Your daddy-o is waiting on you.

242
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,651
I love you, baby cakes.

243
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,020
I love you too, Howie.

244
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,288
And I can't wait to see you.

245
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,156
Oh, I can't wait to see you.

246
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,836
I'm waiting for
you, my darling.

247
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,037
I'm coming, Howie.

248
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,113
I'm ready for you, Howie.

249
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,982
[Gasps]

250
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,186
Who is this?

251
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,490
Baby cakes, please, I just...

252
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,058
Don't you baby cakes me.

253
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,893
I leave you alone
for two minutes

254
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,596
And you're in bed with
another woman, you big...

255
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,698
Snookums!

256
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,232
I want a divorce.

257
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,033
A divorce?

258
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,870
We just got married.

259
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,973
You are a two timing creep.

260
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:47,907
But baby cakes, I...

261
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,609
All I did was go
into the bathroom

262
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,844
To put on my new sexy
nightie just for you

263
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,346
And look what you do to me!

264
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,682
No, no, she just
appeared out of nowhere.

265
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:56,783
Out of nowhere?

266
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:57,584
Yeah.

267
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,885
Oh, and you're crazy.

268
00:21:58,985 --> 00:21:59,919
No, no, no, listen.

269
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,655
Maybe we could make
it a threesome, huh?

00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,288
I will kill you if I have to.

00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:46,799
I want to know how to
operate the machine.

273
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,969
You'll have to kill me first.

274
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:50,770
Bring her in.

275
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,780
The bus never left the tunnel.

276
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,950
It met with an
unfortunate tragedy.

277
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,485
The mother wasn't so lucky.

00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,760

things with his knife.

279

00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,434
All right.

I'll tell you.

00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,911
Daddy.

371
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,414
[Crying]

372
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:04,416
Dana.

373
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:07,919
No!

374
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,992
Don't kill my baby!

375
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,466
No!

376
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,377
A daughter.

377
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,379
I had a daughter.

378
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,380
Had?

379
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,181
Dead.

380
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,420
Dead.

381
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,422
Gone.

382
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,157
Killed by the dragons.

383
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,258
The dragons?

384
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,394
The dragons come
for the children.

385
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:26,832
They kill the children.

386
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,971
Must save the children!

387
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:39,411
Count slowly
backwards from 10, Joe.

388
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,514
Joe, forget about
the dragons for now.

389
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,484
Count backwards from 10, Joe.

390
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,919
Forget about the
dragons for a moment.

391
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,388
CHILD: Daddy.

392
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:52,358
10, nine.

393
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,294
Eight.

394
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,263
Seven.

395
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:00,199
Six.

396
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,368
Five.

397
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:03,802
Four.

398
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,771
Three.

399
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,406
Two.

400
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,207
One.

401
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,046
So how are things going
at the Browning Center?

402
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,548
Oh, great things are
starting to happen.

403
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,949
You'll be reading
about them soon.

404
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,886
Wow, it must be great working
for a doctor like L. E. White.

405
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,554
Yeah, well he's
devoted half his life

406
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,356
To finding a cure
for the disease

407
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,258
And he's determined
to find it too.

408
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,398
What is it?

409
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,833
Your boy is very
complex, doctor.

410
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,469
I've never seen a viral
infection like that before.

411
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,138
Look, his immune system
seems to have suppressed it.

412
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,641
Yeah, whatever it
was, it was massive.

413
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,775
Yeah.

414
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,143
Well, how's, uh, how's
his memory coming along?

415
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:46,978
Ah, it's still very
delusional, you know.

416
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,282
He thinks he's somebody from the
future wants to save the world.

417
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,149
More power to him.

418
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,284
Yeah, well, he's
probably watched

419
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,352
Too many Star Trek episodes.

420
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:54,353
Yeah, I know.

421
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,454
Yeah, listen, I'll
talk to you later.

422
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,488
I've got to get to post op.
OK, bye bye.

423
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,923
Bye.

424
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,025
Do you have that
file on Bob Gideon?

425
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:00,826
Mm-hmm.

426
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,565
You fight with
great hate, dragon.

427
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,868
I like that.

428
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,737
Who are you?

429
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,374
I am the chief medical
dictator of this facility.

430
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,810
Someone you'll learn
to hate as well.

431
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,382
We call this the dragon mind
control training facility.

432
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,683
You've been brought
here to learn

433
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:29,321
To fight as a dragon for the
preservation of the AAMA.

434
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,391
For the preservation, in
fact, of all of society.

435
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,793
Do you understand?

436
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,728
[Screaming]

437
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,403
Yes, I see that you do.

438
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,738
Lesson number one.

439
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,574
[Groaning]

440
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:55,714
A dragon must learn to
endure pain, to defy it.

441
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,183
And I'm personally going
to teach it to you.

442
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,689
Go to hell.

443
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,857
This is hell, dragon.

444
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:06,658
Welcome.

445
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,840
[Background chatter]

446
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,284
OK.
Thanks.

447
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,285
Bye bye.

448
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,948
Station two looks good.

449
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:10,982
Let's lock it up.

450
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:57,896
Ruth.

451
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:58,697
You got to help me.

452
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:06,337
Joe, you have to be in bed.

453
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,607
Please, I've got to remember.

454
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:09,608
I need your help.

455
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,731
Joe, I have to go to
another hospital now.

456
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,932
It's very important.

457
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,901
When I get back later,
I'll hypnotize you again.

458
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,368
Look, time is running out.

459
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,238
All right, look.

460
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:42,808
Do you know him?

461
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:43,842
Do you know him?

462
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,176
Yes, L. E. White.

463
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,177
I've got to find him.

464
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,679
He has a cure.

465
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,647
But I don't understand.

466
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,227
Joe, you need rest.

467
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,463
Sometimes in life when... when
we go through hard times,

468
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,965
Our minds do funny things.

469
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,007
Start the car.

470
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:16,975
Let's go.
Come on.

471
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:17,776
Let's go.

472
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:18,744
It's not starting.

473
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:19,545
Just...

474
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:00,852
Mason!

475
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,963
[Yelling]

476
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,009
Come on, Mason.

477
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:58,810
Let's go.

478
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:28,640
What's going on, Joe?

479
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,440
Joe?

480
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,408
His name's Mason.

481
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,010
Tell her who you are, Mason.

482
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,044
Come on, Mason.

483
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,246
Mason, you don't remember?

484
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,047
Who's this?

485
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,048
Tell her, Mason.

486
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,785
It's not moving.

487
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:14,786
Get out.

488
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:15,586
Get out.

489
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,675
They're all so healthy here.

490
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,477
Who?

491
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,712
Children.

492
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:49,714
None of them have the plague.

493
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:50,916
You remember.

494
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:51,716
The plague.

495
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,684
What is it?

496
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:56,721
I'll answer more questions
after we rest and have sex.

497
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,930
We've fought together and had
sex together for months now.

498
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,632
The AAMA thinks that's why
we make such a good team.

499
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,835
They call us dynamic.

500
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:10,635
Come here.

501
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,107
You sure about this?

502
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,885
Your man has 10
hours to perform.

503
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:21,566
I talked to the police, but
they had nothing to tell me.

504
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,368
I gave them the description
of those two guys

505
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:26,504
That you said were trying
to kill your friend.

506
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,539
That man and his girlfriend
just disappeared.

507
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,408
Charlie, you wouldn't
believe what happened.

508
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,743
I go down to get my
car, these people

509
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,180
Pop out of nowhere with
swords, they're all fighting.

510
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,282
I get... I get in the car
to go away and one of them

511
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:38,449
Jumps on the back of the trunk.

512
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,418
I was never so scared
in my entire life.

513
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,853
Look, you've been
working long hours.

514
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,622
Your mind is playing
tricks on you.

515
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,058
What are you saying, Charlie,
that I'm hallucinating?

516
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:52,597
No, no, just, you know, you're
a little tired, that's all.

517
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,099
You're right.

518
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,134
Maybe I should just go
home and get some rest.

519
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,542
[Gasping]

520
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:56,627
You've been brought here to
learn to fight as a dragon.

521
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:00,131
For the preservation
of the AAMA.

522
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,601
For the preservation, in
fact, of all of society.

523
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,537
Do you understand?

524
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,206
[Screaming]

525
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,812
Yes, I see that you do.

526
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:16,281
Lesson number one.

527
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,255
A dragon must learn
to endure pain.

528
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,824
To defy it.

529
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:29,294
And I'm personally going
to teach it to you.

530
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,765
Go to hell.

531
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,235
This is hell, dragon.

532
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:39,470
Welcome.

533
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,439
[Gasping]

534
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:58,523
Friends.

535
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,926
A toast to profit
and the plague.

536
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:02,727
ALL: Hail!

537
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:11,169
My friends and
colleagues, before

538
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:15,072
Us is my greatest achievement.

539
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,642
Tonight we welcome into
our ranks this new dragon.

540
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:22,780
He was the most
difficult to conquer.

541
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,284
Not because he was
stronger than the others,

542
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:30,455
Nor smarter or more ferocious.

543
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:33,758
He was difficult, I believe,
because his capacity

544
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:39,897
To love far outweighed his
instinctual capacity to hate.

545
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,932
It's made him a
dangerous creature.

546
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:49,540
Such a man is a
threat to society.

547
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,810
But today he belongs
to me body and soul.

548
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,981
Months of mind control
have bettered this dragon

549
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,083
And reduced him to his knees.

550
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:02,953
Great credit goes to my
trainer here, Fullock.

551
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:03,754
ALL: Hail!

552
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:14,699
The dragon you see before us
once had a wife and a child.

553
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:18,436
They were liquidated due
to plague contamination.

554
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,905
[Gasping]

555
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:31,882
And now instead of an enemy in
this dragon, we have an ally.

556
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,585
Quiescent and docile.

557
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,554
Under my total control.

558
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,071
Daddy!

559
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:27,872
Daddy!

560
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,784
[Screams]

561
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,756
I remember.

562
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,926
Fullock murdered my family.

563
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:49,994
MY wife.

564
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:51,496
My child.

565
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:55,666
He and the dragons
destroyed my whole tribe.

566
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:56,801
Except for me.

567
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,102
That's right.

568
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,271
They took you to
AAMA mind control

569
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,307
To turn you into a dragon.

570
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,009
To turn me into a killer.

571
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,377
No.

572
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,244
You defied them.

573
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:12,317
I remember why we came back.

574
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,784
We got to hurry.

575
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,593
[Inaudible] vaccine.

576
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,928
The vaccine would
destroy the AAMA.

577
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:24,762
No more plague.

578
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,230
And Fullock is their insurance.

579
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:28,232
Yes, but I don't think
he'll be a problem anymore.

580
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,675
Looks like I keep
killing all your women.

581
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,313
One dragon down.

582
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:43,113
One to go.

583
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,128
Mason.

584
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,129
Mason.

585
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,098
Now get the vaccine.

586
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:05,603
Dragon!

587
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:06,404
No!

588
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,047
[Screaming]

589
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:38,969
Hey, watch it.

590
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,360
Hey, hey!

591
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:10,334
Dragon!

592
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,508
[Dog barking]

593
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,456
Shh.

594
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,457
Joe.

595
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:07,291
Mason.

596
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,926
Mason, what are you doing here?

597
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:09,927
I need your help.

598
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:22,272
I have three hours before
I must return to my time.

599
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,076
When I go back, I must
have the vaccine with me.

600
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,278
I've been to the
Browning Center.

601
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,379
It's built like a fortress.

602
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,915
You need access,
documentation, and clearance.

603
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,453
All right.

604
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:39,223
There's one person I
know that can help us.

605
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,492
Dr. Stenton.

606
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,761
He does research there.

607
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,764
OK, we're going to have to
convince him of your story.

608
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:50,200
And after we've convinced him,
can you please work on me?

609
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,711
You are asking me to
swallow a very big fish.

610
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,781
Now look who's skeptical.

611
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:05,182
OK.

612
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,685
Let's say I believe your story.

613
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:10,320
Do you realize what
you're asking me to do?

614
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,891
To violate security measures
and if such a serum does

615
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,594
Exist, to just
turn it over to you

616
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:17,928
So you can save
future generations

617
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,029
For crying out loud?

618
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,397
What if he's telling
the truth, Charlie?

619
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,498
All right.

620
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,034
All right, let's say
he is telling the truth

621
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,104
And the serum does exist
and I give it to you.

622
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,039
What am I supposed to tell
Dr. White when he comes

623
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,008
Looking for it and it's gone?

624
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:32,977
And I violated his trust.

625
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:34,945
That won't matter, Doctor.

626
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:44,421
After tomorrow, things like we
know them won't exist anymore,

627
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,124
Including the Browning Center.

628
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:49,493
We're going to have an
earthquake, Charlie, a quake

629
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:50,595
Like we've never known before.

630
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:09,680
And the cure won't
be used at all?

631
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,217
Not unless I can retrieve it
and get it back to my time.

632
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:31,368
This file contains all of the
security codes needed to break

633
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:34,404
Through the security
measures and the vault,

634
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:38,242
Which is where I'm sure we'll
find the cure for the disease.

635
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,577
Just let me get my coat
and we'll be on our way.

636
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,411
OK.

637
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,848
How much time do we have left?

638
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:45,349
About an hour and 45 minutes.

639
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,317
How long does it take to
get to the Browning Center.

640
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,288
About 15 minutes
without traffic.

641
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:54,925
What happens if you don't
make it to the time doorway.

642
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:57,461
Does it ever open again?

643
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:58,395
No.

644
00:59:58,495 --> 00:59:59,529
Never.

645
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,632
Oh God, we better get
this show on the road.

646
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:04,101
Hey Charlie, let's go.

647
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:04,902
Charlie?

648
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,645
[Screams]

649
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:29,486
Dragon!

650
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,168
Dr. Stenton to see
a Dr. L. E. White.

651
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,325
Excuse me.

652
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,728
Can I help you?

653
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,464
Yeah, I have an appointment
with Dr. L. E. White.

654
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,903
OK, Dr. Stenton, I
need to see her ID.

655
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:57,341
Sorry, this is Dr. Ames.

656
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:58,242
She's not on my list.

657
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,243
I need to see her ID.

658
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:05,715
Dr. Ames is a very good
friend of Dr. White's

659
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:08,685
And an even better friend to the
Browning Center administrator.

660
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,159
OK.

661
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:16,626
[Ding]

662
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,985
Oh, excuse me, doctor.

663
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:42,652
May I ask you to
sign in, please.

664
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,057
Are you here for the seminar?

665
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,392
Yeah.

666
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,295
Well, it's just down the hall.

667
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,663
This the missus?

668
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,499
Yeah.

669
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,300
Thank you.

670
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,887
OK, the electronics
lab should have

671
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,122
All the information we need.

672
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,756
According to this it
should be around somewhere.

673
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:24,628
Bingo.

674
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,905
[Beeping]

675
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,549
[Bell tinkling]

676
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:56,893
How about a blueberry pokey?

677
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,524
The main labs are 100
feet below ground level.

678
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,526
Now, the [inaudible] are
the most [inaudible].

679
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:30,527
They're the hardest to find.

680
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:31,328
All right, just hurry.

681
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,163
I'm trying.

682
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,299
How much time do we have
before the time door appears?

683
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,734
We've got 20 minutes.

684
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:38,969
I got it.

685
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:41,371
[Beeping]

686
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,012
What?
What?

687
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,346
It's on the B level.

688
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,682
It's the most highly secured
area of the whole facility.

689
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,483
Let's go.

690
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,566
Open the door or
I cut your throat.

691
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:18,742
It's open.

692
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,011
You said you wouldn't
cut my throat.

693
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:23,813
So I did.

694
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,282
[Gunshot]

695
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,402
Hey, you.

696
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,203
You!

697
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:47,704
[Gunshot]

698
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,675
[Alarm ringing]

699
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,151
Hey!

700
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,652
[Gunshot]

701
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,623
[Gunshot]

702
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,519
[Gunshot]

703
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,987
[Gunshot]

704
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,491
[Gunshot]

705
01:07:52,536 --> 01:08:05,782
Look, Mason, the
vault. It won't open.

706
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:06,750
All right.

707
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,951
All right.

708
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:09,553
According to this, there's
an underground passage

709
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:13,089
Leading into the vault.
Looks like an air duct.

710
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,890
This way.

711
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,799
OK, it's got to be
in here somewhere.

712
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:23,767
Mason, look.

713
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:44,754
It looks a little tight,
but I think we can make it.

714
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:45,555
Ruth?

715
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:49,025
Ruth?

716
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:53,963
Ruth?

717
01:08:58,235 --> 01:08:58,935
Mason!

718
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,275
The chase is over, dragon.

719
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:08,144
I have the last of your women.

720
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,613
Mason, the vaccine,
there's no time.

721
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:10,580
I'll kill her.

722
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,419
You want a fight?

723
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,220
You've got one.

724
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:40,497
And now, dragon, you die.

725
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,362
Here it is.

726
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:51,901
Oh, there's a laser lock on it.

727
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,603
It's going to be a problem.

728
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,571
No.

729
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:57,006
No more problem.

730
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,975
The alarm!

731
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:00,376
Security's on their way.

732
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:06,349
We've got to make it.

733
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:07,851
Time doorway opens
in just seconds.

734
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:08,918
Come on, let's go.

735
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,394
He's made it.

[Buzzing]

737
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:27,036
What's that noise?

738
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,271
The time doorway's
been opening.

739
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,285
It won't open.

740
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:48,792
Son of a...

741
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,746
[Buzzing]

742
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,719
Dragon.

743
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,721
[Screams]

744
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:08,037
Mason, look, the door.

745
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:08,838
Here.

746
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:09,639
Look.

747
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:10,940
You go.

748
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,941
I can't leave you here.

749
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:12,809
Come on.

750
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,177
Listen to me.

751
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:17,213
For the future, the children.

752
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:18,447
Mason, I can't leave you.

753
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:19,248
Go.

754
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,049
There's only seconds.

755
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,886
Go!

756
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:25,388
No!

757
01:15:25,488 --> 01:15:27,857
[Screaming]

758
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:34,297
[Buzzing]

759
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,609
RUTH (VOICEOVER): I see the
future now with different eyes.

760
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:23,379
I understand the world
in a magical way.

761
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:29,719
And I accept that destiny, like
many things, is truly unknown.

762
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,657
It took the power of a dragon
and the courage of a man

763
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,358
To give me faith.

764
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:40,163
And I'll never forget him, the
dragon warrior who sacrificed

765
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,032
Himself for the
future of the world,

766
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:45,434
For the future of our children.
