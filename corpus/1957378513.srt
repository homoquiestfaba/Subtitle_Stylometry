'Cause obviously there
are bears in Wisconsin too

357
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,260
but like what's on its flag?

358
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:34,895
- Who cares.
- Chill for a second, okay.

359
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,164
We have the whole trip to
talk about bears and flags.

360
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,134
Uh, we good, we
ready, we comfortable?

361
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,502
Yes, can we just go already?

362
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:45,739
All right, Grand Prix
snowboarding here we come.

363
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,473
[Mia] Blake,
you're so dramatic.

364
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:48,408
[upbeat rock music]

365
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,846
[Mia laughs]

366
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,061
So seriously though,

367
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,429
like what's different
about Wisconsin?

368
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,899
More snow and great beer.

369
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:15,568
Okay, right, but like what's
special about the state?

370
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,037
We all learned about
our country in school,

371
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,838
what is that people in
Wisconsin are proud of?

372
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,106
- Why is so important?
- No.

373
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,774
I'm just saying that
it says a lot about us

374
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,376
if we don't know anything
about our country,

375
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,645
you know what I mean?

376
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:25,545
Like I'm not trying
to say anything bad

377
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,779
but like we're lazy.

378
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:27,747
I bet people don't
even really know

379
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,616
that Illinois is the bear state.

380
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,784
I've lived in
Illinois my entire life

381
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,754
and I've never even seen a bear,

382
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,322
so I mean if it
is the bear state

383
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:36,456
where the hell
are all the bears?

384
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,691
No, it's called the bear state

385
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,893
because of like
you know football.

386
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,595
And I'm sure all the
bears are like south.

387
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:42,829
See this is the thing,

388
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:44,630
I just wish people
were smarter, okay.

389
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:48,101
All I know is that Illinois
bear state, Illinois bear state.

390
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:51,337
Illinois is most definitely
not the bear state.

391
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:52,872
Yeah, it is, Blake.

392
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:54,741
There's not a bear on the
flag or anything like that.

393
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,443
And it's definitely not
because of the Chicago Bears

394
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,346
or even the Cubs
for that matter.

395
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,981
Illinois is the Prairie State,

396
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,983
also referred to as the Lincoln
State but not officially.

397
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:06,352
And Wisconsin is often referred

398
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,789
to as the Dairy State
or the Dairy Land,

399
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,924
but it technically doesn't have
an official nickname at all.

400
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:12,760
Wow.

401
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,764
What?

402
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,199
You are one pathetic loser.

I remember stuff.

405
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:26,840
Oh, honey, I'm like
really impressed. [giggles]

406
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,042
Okay, but that brings
me to my original query,

407
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,044
um, what's the bear state then?

408
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,614
Well, there's a bear
on the California flag

409
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:34,780
but it's not the bear state,

410
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,216
it's just the
official state animal.

411
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,518
Shut up, how do you know that?

412
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,053
You're totally making this up.

413
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:40,987
Google it.

414
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,188

Chili Peppers band

416
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:45,558

from being a complete loser.

420
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:57,971
You only know about
California because of music.

421

We're gonna have to
reschedule that until-

429
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:15,322
- I actually have to send an
email quickly to work too.

Social media, it's like
you're walking down the street

436

walking towards you

437

not even there, you know.

439
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,539
I just wish that on this
trip that we could talk

- Okay, yeah, we'll talk soon.

Is your phone broken?

we can have it delivered.

two days without a phone.

class and he just talks.

like whispering into his phone,

473
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:39,339
he's texting, he's like
scrolling through social media.

00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:32,185
I have agents, like
what if they call

529
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:35,287
for a casting or, or
I book an audition?

530
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:36,555
It's just for the weekend.

531
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,257
Your agency's not open
on the weekend right?

532
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:41,561
Usually, but you know
sometimes things come up.

533
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:44,464
Okay, well, then you can
check in with them on Monday.

534
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,732
Don't even tell me
where you put it, Logan.

535
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:46,668
I don't wanna know.

536
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:50,037
So how do we know
how to get there?

537
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,978
Uh.
[traffic humming]

538
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:11,591
[fan whirring]
[upbeat music]

539
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:12,525
I got the door.

540
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:13,862
Oh, it's much warmer in here.

541
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,363
Hey, how are ya?

542
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,233
Real well, yep, real well.

543
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:22,902
Started my shift
about 6:00 am today.

544
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:25,138
Wow, that is early, 6:00 am.

545
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,174
You'd be surprised
actually how many people

546
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,141
are up and moving
at that time of day.

547
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,377
I'll tell you it is more
than you would think,

548
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,344
it's a busy time.

549
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:36,115
Yeah, um, what exit number
do I take to get into Wausau?

550
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,919
I'm trying to get to Granite
Peak, it's a ski resort.

551
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,954
Well, let me see
my charts here.

552
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,692
[paper rustling]

553
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:49,463
All right, all right, all right.

554
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,405
I knew a girl in Germantown
once, and you go up there,

555
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:01,240
and well, I'm not exactly sure.

556
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:03,642
I do know it is in
Wisconsin though.

557
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:05,378
[Attendant and Blake laughing]

558
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,947
Little welcome center humor.

559
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:10,885
Uh, all right, you
go past Milwaukee,

560
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,720
and then it's, it's way
northwest of Green Bay even,

561
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,790
so you've got quite
a ways to go yet,

562
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,694
three, four, hours, I'd say.

563
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,227
Be careful.

564
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:22,562
It's a good thing
you told us be careful

565
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:25,334
'cause, uh, should we
try to be not careful?

566
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:30,706
No, please be careful
on your way up there.

567
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,473
Why do you say that?

568
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:36,442
We've got some heavy
weather coming in.

569
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,912
We'll catch it down here too.

570
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:43,451
Temperature's changing,
can't you feel it, the cold?

571
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:51,257
I think we'll be okay.

572
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,996
Work together,
keep your eyes open,

573
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,231
you'll find the right way.

574
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,401
Good luck.

575
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:02,703
Thank you, and, uh, good
luck to you, my good sir.

576
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:07,439
Remember when I wanted to
work at a welcome center?

577
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:09,642
Yeah, I've changed my mind.

578
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:12,946
That guy's crazy.

579
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:15,617
[ominous music]

580
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,788

[Mia laughing]

583
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,372
[suspenseful music]

584
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,961
I'm bored.

585
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:04,930
I'm gonna watch a movie.

586
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:06,765
Blake, where do you
keep the movies?

587
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,668
I don't think I have
any in here actually?

588
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,603
You have a DVD player
in your car and no DVDs?

589
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,172
Sorry, didn't think about it.

590
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,408
[Reporter] State are experiencing
dropping temperatures.

591
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,575
As it gets later-

592
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:17,811
- I've got something
we can watch.

593
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,345
[Reporter] This
rainy day into snow.

594
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,613
I was gonna wait till we
got to the cabin but, uh.

595
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,015
[Reporter] 30 miles an
hour reducing visibility.

596
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:25,618
Hey, Blake, I have
a surprise for you.

597
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,053
[Reporter] WNO want's you-

598
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:28,521
- What are you talking about?
- To stay safe, so stay-

599
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:30,857
- I found those old moves
that we used to make,

600
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,324
you know in the,
in the back yard.

601
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:35,361
Remember when we
were action stars?

602
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,197
No way, you found those?

603
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,299
Yeah, dude,
they're so hilarious.

604
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,368
Um, I know how much
they meant to you

605
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,171
so I had them
transferred to a disc.

606
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,706
I wanted to wait to surprise
you up at the cabin,

607
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,307
you know thought we
all could watch 'em,

608
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,810
get a kick out of
'em, laugh a little.

609
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,611
Dude, that is so awesome.

610
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,647
Logan, that's really sweet.

611
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:55,881
I can't wait to watch.

612
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,950
Yeah, I wanna see
you guys as little kids

613
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,919
running around playing
in the backyard.

614
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:00,786
Hand it up, man.

615
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:01,989
Pass it to my navigator.

616
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:05,259
Yeah, they're
so hilarious, man.

617
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,326
You were such a jerk.

618
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:09,129
You took everything
so seriously.

619
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,229
And you wanna know what else?

620
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,797
He always had me be the bad guy

621
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,265
because he wanted
to be the hero.

622
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:16,101
Oh, I bet he just
always wanted to win.

623
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:18,073
Oh, the bad guy
wins sometimes.

624
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:21,474
I didn't always wanna
be the hero, shut up.

625
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,311
Andy, it's that one right there.

626
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,644
All right, we're all set.

627
00:24:25,646 --> 00:24:27,213
Oh, my gosh,

628
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,149
- you guys are adorable.
- We both take three paces,

629
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,883
turn, and draw.

630
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:33,119
[Both] One, two, three.

631
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:34,286
- Boom, boom!
- Bang!

632
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:35,921
- I got you, I got you!
- I got you first!

633
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:37,189
[Young Logan groans]

634
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,291
Check this out right
here, right here.

635
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:39,492
Blake looks right at the camera

636
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:40,996
as he's about to take me down.

637
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:42,831
Okay.

638
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:45,431
[Mia laughs]

639
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,533
[giggles] Hey,
stop, that tickles.

640
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:49,302
Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

641
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,803
Bang.
[Young Logan groans]

642
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:51,838
Rookie mistake.

643
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,172
- Man.
- Okay, you're dead.

644
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,240
I miss that stuff so much.

645
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:56,543
[Young Blake] Cut!

[footsteps crunching]

650
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:05,485
[Dispatcher] 27,
our battery suspect

651
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,786
is at 318 East 3rd Street,
is that related to your call

652
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:10,622
or do you want a
different patrol unit?

653
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:14,194
Well, I suppose the
story they're telling us

654
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:16,196
may have actually happened.

655
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,130
So you believe them?

656
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,130
[police radio chattering]

657
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:19,532
No.

658
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:20,800
[Dispatcher] The
suspect or was the victim?

659
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:23,136
No, just a feeling I got.

660
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:24,637
I don't think they're
telling the truth.

661
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,238
I mean look at all
this, the blood,

662
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,908
the, the windshield, the arrow.

663
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:30,209
Two of 'em were murdered,

664
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,444
not only that the
two who were murdered

665
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,613
are brother and sister.

666
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:36,016
Their heads are just on
a little too straight.

667
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:39,419
You got the surveillance
footage up yet?

668
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:40,954
Still working on it.

669
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,755
Who's working on it?

670
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,592
I am.

671
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,627
So is the system out here?

672
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,695
System?

673
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,662
The surveillance system.

674
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:52,599
- No.
- It isn't, is it.

675
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,199
Get inside and look at it.

676
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,134
Man, I gotta see that video.

677
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:58,737

[Blake] Oh shit!

687
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,306
Oh, my god, what happened?

688
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:35,475
Did you fall asleep?

689
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:36,976
No, no, I just
couldn't see anything.

690
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,011
Everyone okay?

691
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,945
- Logan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

692
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,112
we're, we're okay.

693
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:41,613
Holy shit, Blake,
are you okay?

694
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:43,283
Oh, my god, it's
like a bomb went off.

695
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,918
What happened?

696
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,986
There's a tree in here.

697
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:48,655
I think I hit a branch
or something, I'm not sure.

698
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,123
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- [Andy] Ugh, it's so cold.

00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,302
What you just didn't see it?

704
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,403
I couldn't see anything.

705
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:05,338
What are we gonna do?

706
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,005
We gotta get inside somewhere.

707
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:09,207
Do you remember
passing anything?

708
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,509
I haven't seen
anything but snow

709
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,046
for the past for the past hour.

710
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:15,749
What's that?

711
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,018
What?

712
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:19,888
That.

713
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,623
It's like a light
pole or something.

714
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,459
See it.

715
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,829
Nice, man, it's
gotta be a gas station.

716
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,297
Think you can
drive over there?

717
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,865
It's gonna be interesting.

718
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:37,536
[car door clicks]

719
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:40,073
[car door bangs]

720
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,740
We don't have service
on any of these.

721
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:43,208
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have

722
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,643
- to drive a little bit.
- How?

723
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,144
The windshield is cracked,
the window is gone,

724
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,513
there's snow coming
in, we're freezing.

725
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:49,181
We don't have a choice.

726
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,649
There's a light up
there or something,

727
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,851
I wanna go check it out, and
see if we can get some shelter.

728
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,086
I think it's a gas station.

729
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,487
Are you sure you
can even drive?

730
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,023
No, let's find out.

731
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:00,392
[car rumbling]

732
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:03,963
[branch cracking]

733
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,797
Dammit, look at those scratches.

734
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,368
Focus, Blake, we're freezing.

735
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:25,284
Is that it?

736
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,518
What is it?

737
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,653
I don't even know if
I'm on the road anymore,

738
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:28,888
I can't see anything.

739
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,492
[Ella] Just don't
hit another tree.

740
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:35,328
Is it store?

741
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,496
It looks like
a rundown school.

742
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:39,832
I think we're
in a parking lot.

743
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,637
Blake, pull forward, we can
probably get inside there.

744
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:51,444
This is perfect.

745
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:53,012
Let's get in and get warm.

746
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,648
I don't think anybody's
here, it's probably locked.

747
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,115
Doesn't mean we can't go in.

748
00:28:57,117 --> 00:28:58,685
[Andy] So you're
just gonna break in?

749
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:01,086
[Blake] Maybe, you can
wait in the car if you want.

750
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,021
That was mean.

751
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,823
Come on, I was kidding.

752
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,591
It's okay, let's go.

753
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:07,092
What there's no hotels
around here or anything?

754
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:09,094
This is the dumbest
place to stop.

755
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:10,329
Who would ever stop here?

756
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,229
We just did.

757
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:14,734
[car door clicks]

758
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,836

[footsteps crunching]

763
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:36,555
It is a school.

764
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,123
It looks abandoned.

765
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,659
[door banging]

766
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,161
Maybe there's another door.

767
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:43,295
Wanna kick it in?

768
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:46,099
[ominous music]

769
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:47,233

[police radio chattering]

771
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:57,111
That's very Robin Hood.

772
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:02,515
[siren wailing]

773
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:03,351
Hmm.

774

778
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:20,233
I'm so cold.

779
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,001
[door bangs]

780
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:23,335
It's so cold.

781
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:24,603
I'm so hungry.

782
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,371
I know you guys are
probably hungry too.

783
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:27,607
Are we gonna get in
trouble for coming in here?

784
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:28,573
Are the police gonna come?

785
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:30,008
Are we gonna get arrested?

786
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,078
Andy, just try to think about
one thing at a time, okay?

787
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,312
What's that supposed to mean?

788
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,246
I can think about
whatever I want.

789
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:35,247
We just breaked and entering

790
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,615
and we're trespassing right now.

791
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:37,917
Well, I'd rather
be trespassing

792
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,451
than freezing to
death in a blizzard!

793
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:40,719
Okay, okay, settle down.

794
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,255
Look, we're inside
and we're safe now.

795
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,622
We just tell the owner
about the snow storm

796
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,158
and pay for the damages.

797
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,059
This place looks totally
out of commission anyway.

798
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,527
Now he's got an excuse
to get a new door.

799
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:50,963
Hey, what do we do now?
Should we try to call somebody?

800
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,230
We left all the
phones in the car.

801
00:30:52,232 --> 00:30:53,599
They don't have
any service anyway.

802
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,432
I think we should
still get them,

803
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:55,700
they might work in here.

804
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:57,335
It's okay, we
can use the light.

805
00:30:57,337 --> 00:31:00,105
I'm gonna go back out to the
car and get them. We are fine.

806
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:02,507
We're here together
and we are fine.

807
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:03,810
We should try to
find some real lights,

808
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,410
these ones aren't working.

809
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:06,547
[Andy] Really hungry.

810
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:09,916
Hey look, there's a
light on downstairs.

811
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,551
Should I go try maybe
find like a circuit panel,

812
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,351
or some flashlights,
or something?

813
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:14,786
Might have to
break and entering.

814
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:16,255
Oh, great, so now
we're trespassing

815
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,056
and we're stealing
flashlights, oh fun.

816
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,161
No, it's borrowing,
it's different.

817
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,829
There's a bunch of
blankets in the car.

818
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:24,130
I'm gonna go back out
through that freezing hell

819
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:24,964
and get those too.

820
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,465
I'll come with you.

821
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,200
I actually, I brought snacks
and I know where they are.

822
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:30,337
Look, honey, I'm breaking
through and exiting.

823

[door clicks]
[wind blowing]

824
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,611
Well, I'm gonna go
search for a flashlight.

825
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:41,280
We can use it until Logan
figures out the power.

826
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:43,549
Yeah, yeah, and I'm
like really hungry

827
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,884
so I guess I'll go
look for some food.

828
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:47,687
Maybe they have like
snacks, or canned goods,

829
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,354
or other non-perishables,

830
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,989
or maybe even like a
cafeteria or something.

831
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,627
I'm just gonna go look for that.

832
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,294

[suspenseful music]
[wind blowing]

848
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:39,332
Hey, Blake, I'm
gonna go around back

849
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:44,339
and see if there's somewhere
I can go pee, okay?

Guys?

862
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:13,692
What are you doing?

863
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,363
Logan, where's Andy?

864
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:18,998
There's somebody here.

865
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,834
What?

866
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:25,571
[dramatic music]

867
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,274
Logan, Logan, what happened?

868
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:29,574
Andy.

869
00:35:29,576 --> 00:35:31,342
We, we have to
call an ambulance.

870
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:32,611
The phones are down.

871
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:33,448
What happened?

872
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:35,415
I saw somebody, Mia.

873
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,384
Somebody did this.

874
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,886
I saw them run
towards the stairs.

875
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,458
That's where I was,
they coulda killed me.

876
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,158
Where's Blake?

877
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,426
Oh, my god, we, we
have to help her.

878
00:35:48,428 --> 00:35:49,495
Check if she's breathing.

879
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:50,429
She's not.

880
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,432
- She's dead.
- Logan!

881
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:57,069
Okay, okay, we have to
get her to a hospital.

882
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,674
Logan, do something
for once in your life!

883
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,674
What the hell?

884
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,241
Andy, Andy!

885
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,310
God, Andy, come on,
come on, wake up, Andy.

886
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:06,578
Andy, come on.

887
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,612
- What happened?
- There's somebody here, man.

888
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:08,848
There's somebody after us.

889
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,216
God, Blake, we have to
get her to a hospital.

890
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,116
How did this happen?

891
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,618
I saw somebody, man.

892
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,322
I, I just found her like that.

893
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:16,121
What?

894
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:17,323
Man, I heard a scream,

895
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:18,857
and, and I was looking
for a flashlight,

896
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:21,092
and then I just I found her
like that on the floor, man.

897
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:22,393
I, I don't know, I, I-

898
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:24,029
- What do you mean
you saw someone?

899
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,263
How did this happen, Logan?

900
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:26,998
I just found her
like that, man!

901
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,401
We've got to do something!

902
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:31,036
Take this, do it!

903
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,605
What are you doing, man?

904
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,040
No you, you shouldn't move her.

905
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:36,975
[Blake grunts]

906
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:38,009
Blake.

907
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,645
- Move!
- Blake, listen to me,

908
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,580
man, there's a killer
on the loose somewhere!

909
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:44,049
God, Logan stop saying
that, you're scaring me!

910
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:45,583
Fine!

911
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:46,518
Be scared!

912
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,422
I'm scared shitless right now.

913
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,962

920
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,491
Blake!

921
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:26,859
Stop be crazy, man.

922
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:28,594
What are you gonna do?

923
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:29,664
Okay, okay.

924
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:32,964
[door clicks]

925
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:35,969

[tires screeching]

927
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:46,646
Shit!

928
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:50,415
[Logan] Come on, man,
it's not gonna work!

929
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,884
I'm telling the truth!

930
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:54,488
What are you doing?

931
00:37:58,725 --> 00:37:59,559
Hello.

932
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:02,828
[wind blowing]
[car door clicks]

933
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,263

[Mia screams]

938
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,051
[Mia panting]

939
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:28,254
God, what?

940
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:29,420
[Mia] Ella, what
are you doing?

941
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:30,888
I, I had to pee,

942
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,491
so I just went to go find
someplace with light.

943
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:33,658
That doesn't even make sense.

944
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,993
What were you still
doing outside?

945
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:36,527
How did you get in?

946
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:37,862
The door's unlocked.

947
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:38,866
Why, what's wrong?

948
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,468
Did something happen?

949
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:44,070
What?

950
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,774
I told you couldn't
leave, man, it's impossible.

951
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:50,109
You can't see your hand in
front of your face out there,

952
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,511
- what were you thinking?
- Logan.

953
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:53,645
I know there's
somebody here, man.

954
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:54,612
I saw somebody.

955
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:55,980
What makes you say that, huh?

956
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:57,049
Where are they,
where are their car?

957
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:58,016
Why aren't there any lights on?

958
00:38:58,018 --> 00:38:59,984
There's was a light on, man.

959
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:01,085
I can't believe she's dead.

960
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,420
She is though?

961
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:03,888
What is wrong with you?

962
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,156
- What are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

963
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:05,958
[Blake] Who was in
that room with her?

964
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,493
What was doing there?

965
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,828
Look, man, I'm your best
friend you can believe me.

966
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,163
I was in another
room down the hall,

967
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,799
and I swear I saw like
a figure or a shadow,

968
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,199
or something leave
that room, man.

969
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,634
There was somebody
else in there with her.

970
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:18,337
- I just found her like this.
- You saw a figure?

971
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:20,205
Yes, I did, man!

972
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:23,107
What, are you upset because
you didn't know where I was?

973
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:24,609
Oh, why is that, Blake?

974
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,178
Oh, because you weren't here.

975
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,047
So you know what, man? If you
wanna accuse me of something

976
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,580
then go ahead and accuse me,

977
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:31,449
but for all I know you could
have been that figure, man.

978
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,585
Oh, please, okay, I wasn't
in here, I was outside!

979
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:34,819
[Logan] How do I know that?

980
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,621
Because I was with
Ella, you little shit.

981
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,890
Where is Ella?

982
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,426
Blake, hey, what happened?

983
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:41,659
[Blake] Where were you?

984
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:42,995
- What?
- Just now where were you?

985
00:39:42,997 --> 00:39:44,395
I was outside
with you, wasn't I?

986
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:46,031
I left a long time ago.

987
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:48,667
I was outside and back multiple
times since I saw you last.

988
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:49,935
Where did you go?

989
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:51,036
I told you I had
to go around back,

990
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,270
I just really had to pee,

991
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:54,138
and then I found and
entrance back. [gasps]

992
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
These are Andy's.

993
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,009
She let me borrow them.

994
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,078
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

995
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,045
Where is Andy?

996
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,082
Is she hurt?

997
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:02,781
Andy?

998
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:03,848
Oh!

999
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,283
What, no!

1000
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:06,118
What did you do?

1001
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,951
What happened?

1002
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:07,886
Where'd you go?

1003
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:09,187
Did you come back inside?

1004
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,022
[Logan] Oh, come on,
Blake, just settle down.

1005
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,290
Oh, settle down?

1006
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,625
Yes, we need to just
talk about this, man.

1007
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:15,728
I'm still freaking out
'cause I know I saw somebody.

1008
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,529
You saw somebody, what?

1009
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,996
What do you mean?

1010
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,498
Look I just, I think
Logan is right, all right.

1011
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,533
If we just calm down we can
figure out what happened.

1012
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,502
We're all shaken up, we
should have never separated.

1013
00:40:24,504 --> 00:40:25,670
Just calm down.

1014
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,172
Where were you
when I was outside?

1015
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,308
I know how you felt about
Andy too. You all hated her.

1016
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,442
Don't you blame me. All
right, if you really loved her

1017
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:32,643
the way you said you did

1018
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,446
you never would
have cheated on her.

1019
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,380
What?

1020
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:36,647
Oh, don't pretend now.

1021
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:39,150
You never really said
no, Blake, it takes two.

1022
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:39,984
[Logan] What is
she talking about?

1023
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,219
Shut up.

1024
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,721
You cheated on
my sister with Mia.

1025
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:44,188
How dare you call me liar,
man, you're the liar!

1026
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,457
Chill out, okay.

1027
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:46,725
You want me to calm down
then let's calm down.

1028
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,025
But we gotta get
her out of here.

1029
00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:49,127
How are we gonna do that?

1030
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:50,795
We're stuck here man!

1031
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:54,366
You see it out there,
and she's already dead,

1032
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,634
so all we can do is wait.

1033
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,636
No way, man, we gotta
figure this out right now.

1034
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,071
We need to make this right.

1035
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:01,473
How can anything
possibly make this right?

1036
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,841
Why do we have to wait,

1037
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:04,208
why can't we call
somebody for help?

1038
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,810
'Cause the phones are down.

1039
00:41:05,812 --> 00:41:07,145
You love that don't you?

1040
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:08,647
Stop it!

1041
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:10,015
Knock it off! All right,
would you just stop acting

1042
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,817
like a child for three seconds?

1043
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,851
Let's try our phones
all right, all of them,

1044
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:15,154
maybe one of them will work now.

1045
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:16,855
I'm, I'm not gonna be next.

1046
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,225
[Blake] Where are you going?

1047
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:25,965
[glass clanging]

1048
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:29,734
How'd they break this glass?

1049
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:30,969
I'm assuming an object was used.

1050
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:32,404
They used the
fire extinguisher

1051
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,009
that was hanging next to
it, then took this ax.

1052
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,310
- [glass clangs]
- Run any prints on this?

1053
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:40,446
They've already been sent in.

1054
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:41,279
24 hours.

1055
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:42,115
Yes, sir.

1056
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,721
All right.

1057
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:53,025
[glass shattering]
[ominous music]

1058
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,292
[Blake] What are you crazy?

1059
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:55,828
Look whether or
not you believe me,

1060
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,996
I know I saw somebody, I want
something to defend myself.

1061
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:00,364
We all should get something.

1062
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:02,000
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1063
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:03,502
Oh, no one's killing me.

1064
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:06,237
Listen, we need to be
careful, this is serious.

1065
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,440
That's what I'm doing.

1066
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:09,776
This is being careful.

1067
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:15,647
Nobody splits
up, nobody alone.

1068
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:16,949
Let's find an open area.

1069
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,016
Is there a gym?

1070
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,719
Yeah, it's downstairs.

1071
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,690
Let's get to this gym, stay
together, and try our phones.

1072
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,829
What about Andy?

1073
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,870
I honestly think it's best
if we stop moving her around.

1074
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:48,449
[ominous music]

1075

[fist thudding]

1077
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:20,713
We should all take those.

1078
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:24,449
Remember when we used to hunt,
now we can hunt the killer.

1079
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:25,920
Just shut up, Logan.

1080
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,288
What are you doing?

1081
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,589
[arrow thuds]

1082
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,723
Sick.

1083
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:34,894
Guys, can we focus
on the phones, please.

1084
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:37,064
We need to get help.

1085
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:40,901
There's still no service.

1086
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:43,201
Mines not even working.

1087
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,268
It's so cold, I
think it's frozen.

1088
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,670
Same with mine.

1089
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:50,174
Oh, let's see, this one
has a flashing light.

1090
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:51,812
[Blake] That's
Andy's, is it working?

1091
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:54,312
I can see you know.

1092
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:55,580
It's blinking, no service.

1093
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:56,781
I told you they wouldn't work.

1094
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,016
Thanks for the help, Logan.

1095
00:43:58,018 --> 00:43:59,717
Look, I know you're all upset

1096
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,118
but don't throw this at me.

1097
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,721
So far I've been right.

1098
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,823
I told you that you couldn't
take the car and you didn't.

1099
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:07,091
I told you that the cellphones
wouldn't work and they don't.

1100
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:08,393
I've been right, Blake.

1101
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,861
I know that there
is someone here,

1102
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:13,931
and he is just waiting
for us to make a mistake.

1103
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:15,366
Stop it.

1104
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:16,868
What are you even talking
about, make a mistake?

1105
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,504
Guys, fighting each other
isn't gonna help anything.

1106
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:21,038
We should retrace our steps.

1107
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,611
Okay, just, just
breathe for a second.

1108
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:26,712
We need to retrace our
steps to this very moment

1109
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,813
and try to figure what
could have happened.

1110
00:44:28,815 --> 00:44:30,084
That's a good idea.

1111
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:32,717
We should just explain
what we all saw,

1112
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,752
and what we all heard.

1113
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:36,955
Fine, let's do
that, best friend.

1114
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:37,755
Blake, stop it.

1115
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,257
Just sit down, okay?

1116
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,125
It's a good place to start.

1117
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,062
All right, fine.

1118
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,830
I went back out to the car

1119
00:44:45,832 --> 00:44:47,899
to get the blankets
and the phone bag,

1120
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,669
I came back in to find
you two over Andy's body.

1121
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:52,036
There, that's it, next.

1122
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,237
Blake, just calm down.

1123
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:54,438
I am calm!

1124
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,774
Okay, why don't we
start from this morning

1125
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,275
and work our way until now.

1126
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,243
I read somewhere that the
further back you recall

1127
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:00,679
the more specific
details you remember

1128
00:45:00,681 --> 00:45:02,214
up to the present moment.

1129
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:03,714
We certainly have
time for it, right?

1130
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:05,419
- That's not true.
- She's right.

1131
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:08,553
Just start from the morning,

1132
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,422
and then we can piece
everything together.

1133
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:11,723
This is ridiculous.

1134
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,491
You didn't do
it, right, Blake?

1135
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:14,426
[Blake] What?

1136
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:15,895
I mean you loved her, right?

1137
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,631
Prove it.

1138
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:29,074
All right, Blake, let's
take it one more time

1139
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:30,611
all the way from the beginning.

1140
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,147
[police radio chattering]

1141
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,084
I woke up with my
girlfriend, Andrea,

1142
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:43,022
packed up my stuff, and
called my buddy, Logan.

1143
00:45:44,457 --> 00:45:46,024
Wanted to fill up with gas
before we hit the road,

1144
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,761
so I fill it up at
the gas station.

1145
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:51,497
Then headed on to
West Washington,

1146
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,299
that's where I was
picking Logan up.

1147
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:58,136
So one of these girls out
here they're your girlfriend?

1148
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:02,342
No, my girlfriend was the
one who died, Andy, Andrea.

1149
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:04,111
That's right.

1150
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:06,279
Terribly sorry about that.

1151
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:08,082
Please continue.

1152
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,518
I picked him up on the
corner of the street,

1153
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:17,121
got in the car, and used
his phone to call Andy.

1154
00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:18,355
You called her.

1155
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:19,257
Yeah, I called Andy.

1156
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:20,292
I called my girlfriend.

1157
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:21,694
My gosh, she's.

1158
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:24,732
Sit down.

[police radio chattering]

1160
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:37,111
Go ahead.

1161
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:41,415
From there I picked up Ella,

1162
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:43,816
she's the other girl out there.

1163
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,150
She's a model.

1164
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:47,888
Hmm, I see.

1165
00:46:48,756 --> 00:46:50,054
These are some beautiful girls

1166
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:52,190
you spend your time with, Blake.

[Dispatcher] The
suspect or was the victim?

1169
00:46:55,194 --> 00:46:57,895
We went from there
to, to the house, uh,

1170
00:46:57,897 --> 00:47:00,397
Logan and Andy's parents' house.

1171
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:01,834
We all went inside.

1172
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:05,237
Logan went straight upstairs

1173
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,875
but I was thirsty so I, I went
into the kitchen for a drink.

1174
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:11,945
Got these mittens for Andy.

1175
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,748
Was really excited to give
them to her for the trip.

1176
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,884
So I went upstairs, I
said hello to everyone,

1177
00:47:19,886 --> 00:47:21,821
helped the girls
bring their bags down.

1178
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,627
Mia asked me to help
her turn off the dryer,

1179
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:29,661
so we went into the
laundry room together,

1180
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,698
grabbed some of her
clothes for the trip.

1181

She such a girl you know.

1182
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,136
Hmm.

1183
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:41,373
She'll pack an entire wardrobe
just for a weekend trip.

1184
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,209
Crazy.

1185
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:45,745
We loaded up the car, got in,

1186
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,049
we were all together until
we got to the school.

1187
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:56,054
We made a pact together,
turn off our phones,

1188
00:47:56,056 --> 00:48:00,727
not use 'em, just wanted to
spend time with each other.

1189
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:05,763
Storm got really bad,

1190
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:08,699
worse than anything I've
ever seen, actually.

1191
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:12,404
That's when I hit the tree, it
must have fallen in the road,

1192
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:17,411
we crashed, and saw a light,
and we just kept driving to it

1193
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,810
hoping we wouldn't
hit anything else.

1194
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:22,313
Yeah, that must
have been terrifying.

1195
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,348
That was a pretty
bad wreck out there.

1196
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,417
Seems chaotic.

1197
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:28,955
It was, but we handled it.

1198
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,424
Once we got to the school
we calmed down a little bit.

1199
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,828
Was that before or
after you broke in?

1200
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:41,734
After.

1201
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,536
We were all together inside,

1202
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,737
but Ella and I went
back out to the car

1203
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,375
to get blankets
and, and the phones.

1204
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,109
She told me, "She had to pee,"

1205
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:54,547
so she went around the back
of the building I guess.

1206
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,049
I waited for her but
I didn't see her,

1207
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:00,053
so I just figured
she went in, inside.

1208
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:02,853
When I get in there
was no one in there,

1209
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:05,792
I just, I went
downstairs and that's,

1210
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,893
that's where I
found Mia and Logan

1211
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:10,397
standing over Andy's body.

1212
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:13,330
Now Logan tried to tell me
that there was someone there,

1213
00:49:13,332 --> 00:49:17,268
that, that someone killed
Andy, but I didn't listen.

1214
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,573
I, I was really shaken.

1215
00:49:20,873 --> 00:49:23,709
Logan, I just,

1216
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,913
why would Logan think there
was someone else here?

1217
00:49:27,915 --> 00:49:29,116
'Cause he saw someone.

1218
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:31,516
He was right, there
was someone here.

1219
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:32,917
They, they came
in the back door,

1220
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:34,754
that's, that's what
I think at least.

1221
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,793
He was best friend, there was
no reason he would lie to me.

he wanted to protect us.

Still don't know why someone

1226
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:53,304
would wanna shoot him like that.

1227
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:56,642
Maybe they wanted the
car and just killed him.

him my whole life.

00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,325
I understand.

1233
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:13,759
Well, I got one for you,

1234
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:18,495
did you actually see
anybody shoot Logan?

1235
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:21,766
I mean, Blake, did you actually
see anybody here at all?

1236
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,602
No.

1237
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:25,170
We were all in
the janitor's room

1238
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:26,573
when he went out to the car.

1239
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,676
I, I heard something but I
guess I just figured it was him.

1240
00:50:32,178 --> 00:50:34,814
But you carried a weapon
last night too didn't you?

1241
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:36,515
A bow and arrow.

1242
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:40,185
Yes.

1243
00:50:40,187 --> 00:50:41,185
Yes.

1244
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:42,453
Did you have that with you

1245
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:43,620
when you went to
find Logan's body?

1246
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:46,524
No, no, I left it in the gym.

1247
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:47,393
I never shot it.

1248
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:50,194
I don't really like guns,

1249
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:52,429
or, or shooting, or
anything like that.

1250
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:53,931
Really?

1251
00:50:53,933 --> 00:50:56,600
Wow, I used to love shooting
stuff when I was a kid.

1252
00:50:56,602 --> 00:50:58,335
I mean, I'd even just
play guns in the backyard

1253
00:50:58,337 --> 00:51:02,272
with my friends, cops and
robbers, you know army,

1254
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:04,042
even like I was hunting.

1255
00:51:04,044 --> 00:51:07,478
But I did always like
being a cop the best.

1256
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,147
You know I liked to,
to play the hero,

1257
00:51:10,149 --> 00:51:11,283
to get the other guy.

1258
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:16,620
And a bow and arrow, wow,
I mean that's amazing.

1259
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:17,823
That's like Rambo style.

1260
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:21,627
Are you sure?

1261
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,063
[ominous music]

1262
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:28,165
All I know is that
when I came back in

1263
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,366
Ella had on Andy's mittens,

1264
00:51:29,368 --> 00:51:31,069
you two were hovering
over her body,

1265
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:32,837
and Logan had
blood on his hands.

1266
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,073
You had blood on your
hands too, asshole.

1267
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,440
[Mia] Knock it off.

1268
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:37,808
That got us nowhere.

1269
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:40,245
Someone must know
something better than that.

1270
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:41,980
How about you, Ella?

1271
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:44,114
Said, "You came in
through a back door,"

1272
00:51:44,116 --> 00:51:45,917
what was it just unlocked?

1273
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:47,185
Yes.

1274
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,189
Blake, just let
her tell her story.

1275
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,325
Go ahead, Ella,
from the beginning.

1276
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,495
Okay.

1277
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,033
But I just, I just wanna say
that I don't wanna kill anyone.

1278
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:04,803
I don't even think
I can kill anything.

1279
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:09,107
And I definitely
did not kill Andy.

1280
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:10,975
No one saying that you did.

1281
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:13,245
We're just trying to
put everything together.

1282
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:16,148
Okay.

1283
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:20,585
[Ella sighs]

1284
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,987
This morning, uh,

1285
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:26,257
I went to a casting
for a jeans commercial.

1286
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,996
It was really dumb, and
I just hated being there.

1287
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:33,931
And then I went to get coffee,

1288
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:38,435
and while I was waiting
for my order to arrive

1289
00:52:38,437 --> 00:52:42,339
you texted me, and then I, um,

1290
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:45,442
I talked to the girl behind
the counter for a little bit,

1291
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:49,115
and then I, I excused
myself to call Blake.

1292
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,286
And then I was in the car
with you guys, you remember.

1293
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:56,922
When we got the house I, uh,

1294
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:02,560
I went to find a lip
gloss from, from my bags,

1295
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:04,728
I had already brought them over.

1296
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,964
And then we were in the car,

1297
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,502
I was with you guys up,
up until we got here.

1298
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:15,306
Then Blake and I went outside
to get blankets and, and food,

1299
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:17,841
and I really had to pee,

1300
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:22,045
and, and I told him, I, I
told you that I had to pee,

1301
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,714
so I, I went around back,

1302
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:26,783
that is when I found the
door, and there was a light.

1303
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:30,288
And yeah, the door was
unlocked, and I opened it,

1304
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,556
but I still had to pee

1305
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:33,857
so I just decided to
go in the, the snow,

1306
00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:38,864
and, uh, there was something
outside that scared me.

1307
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:40,931
I heard a noise or something in,

1308
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,933
in the bushes next
to the school,

1309
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:44,469
and so I ran back inside,

1310
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,871
and that's when I ran into
Mia, and she was mad at me

1311
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:50,241
for some reason or
seemed mad at me,

1312
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:51,808
and she wouldn't tell
me what was going on,

1313
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,213
and she asked about Andy.

1314
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,020
I didn't even know
anything had happened.

1315
00:54:01,254 --> 00:54:02,920
I was scared myself.

1316
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,188
Wait, so do you have any idea

1317
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,190
what the noise was you
heard in the bushes?

1318
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:10,261
No, I know it was enough to
make me not wanna find out.

1319
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:12,129
- I was gonna tell you guys-
- I told you

1320
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:13,864
Ella saw something too.

1321
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:15,600
Ella didn't see anyone.

1322
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:16,533
There are a million things

1323
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,002
that coulda made those noises.

1324
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,804
Uh, maybe the wind and the snow

1325
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:21,038
may have played a part in it.

1326
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,308
Why are you being
like this, Blake?

1327
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,475
I'm trying to tell
you the truth, man.

1328
00:54:25,477 --> 00:54:27,178
There's something
you're not saying.

1329
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,616
Oh, you would know all about
that, hmm, keeping secrets.

1330
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:33,585
Oh, but don't worry,

1331
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,587
I'm sure Andy didn't
cheat on you with anybody.

1332
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:38,255
My sister was better than that.

1333
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:40,225
So all the sudden
she's your sister now?

1334
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,859
Knock it off both of you!

1335
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,094
We have only heard two stories

1336
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,196
and there is no room
for pointing fingers!

1337
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,665
Just shut up and listen!

1338
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,467
[Detective Young] I would
like you to walk me through

1339
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:53,036
everything you can
remember from last night.

1340
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:54,239
I thought I already did that.

1341
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:58,076
Yes, you did, but
it's been a long night,

1342
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:00,578
and now you've had a couple
hours to think about it.

1343
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,346
I thought maybe
together we could just

1344
00:55:02,348 --> 00:55:03,815
go over it one more time

1345
00:55:03,817 --> 00:55:05,885
and see if there's anything
you missed, sound good?

1346
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:09,187
Andy is my friend.

1347
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:10,022
Was.

1348
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,056
That's mean.

1349
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,725
Yes, but it also the truth,

1350
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,460
and that is a point I
wanna make with you.

1351
00:55:16,462 --> 00:55:18,862
[police radio chattering]

1352
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:20,531
Andy was my friend.

1353
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:21,933
Mm-hmm.

1354
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:23,567
So was Logan.

1355
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:25,604
They were good people, family.

1356
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:28,808
We had all been friends
for a really long time.

1357
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:34,712
The day started out at
Andy and Logan's house.

1358
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:36,179
Andy was really sweet
when I got there,

1359
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:39,350
she, uh, she actually
made breakfast for me,

1360
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:41,286
and, uh, we were
talking about the trip,

1361
00:55:41,288 --> 00:55:42,756
and how cold it was gonna be.

1362
00:55:44,156 --> 00:55:45,556
When we went
upstairs to get ready

1363
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:48,158
she even let me
borrow her makeup.

1364
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,027
She was always like
that, you know,

1365
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:51,564
just so sweet and generous.

1366
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,966
Uh, when Blake and
Logan got to the house

1367
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:58,971
I noticed the mittens
he bought for Andy.

1368
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:02,674
I had Blake help me
carry my bags downstairs,

1369
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:05,676
and, um, we stopped to grab
some last minute things

1370
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:06,779
in the laundry room.

1371
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:12,250
You really pay a lot of
attention to Blake don't you?

1372
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:13,951
Are you sure you guys
didn't have anything

1373
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,054
kinda going on in secret?

1374
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:16,990
What do you mean?

1375
00:56:18,424 --> 00:56:20,526
Well, do you really want
me to explain it to you?

1376
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:24,328
Blake is like a
brother to me, okay.

1377
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,364
Plus he's dating one
of my best friends.

1378
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:27,332
Was.

1379
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:28,167
Yeah.

1380
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:32,402
Okay, so let's just say
you two are very close.

1381
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:34,274
We're all very close.

1382
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:41,081
Anyway, um, the trip
started out really great,

1383
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:44,248
then we got caught in the storm.

1384
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,386
Blake, hit some kind of a,
a tree trunk or something,

1385
00:56:48,388 --> 00:56:50,523
and we just, we had
to get out of the car,

1386
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:52,959
that's when we saw this place.

1387
00:56:55,694 --> 00:56:57,929
We all just kinda settle down
once we got in the building,

1388
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:00,400
and we were really
shaken up from the crash,

1389
00:57:02,701 --> 00:57:04,437
that's when we
decided to separate.

1390
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:06,906
I don't know why we did that.

1391
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:11,808
The last time I
remember seeing Andy,

1392
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:16,382
she was going off to look
for Logan or food, I think.

1393
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:22,886
What made me go downstairs
was I heard this scream,

1394
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:25,589
and, and I saw lights reflecting

1395
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:27,924
off the back wall
of the stairwell.

1396
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:29,092
And I didn't know
what was happening

1397
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:30,627
but I knew there was something,

1398
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:32,129
and that's when I saw Logan

1399
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:34,133
standing over Andy's
body in the room.

1400
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,435
He tried to warn me that
there was someone else here.

1401
00:57:38,437 --> 00:57:39,870
And then Blake
and Ella found us,

1402
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:42,473
and, and Blake tried
to get Andy out of here

1403
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,477
but the storm was
just, it was too much.

1404
00:57:47,946 --> 00:57:49,913
Logan wanted us all to be
able to defend ourselves

1405
00:57:49,915 --> 00:57:53,018
and so he took the ax.

1406
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:57,690
And he wanted us all
to take bow and arrows.

1407
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:01,658
I think that might
have been a mistake.

1408
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,529
Why do you say that that
might have been a mistake?

1409
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:08,332
Whoever was here
used that against us.

1410
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:11,335
I mean they shot Logan
just to try to get the car,

1411
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:13,806
they obviously didn't have
anything of their own.

1412
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,973
Where were you
when Logan was shot?

1413
00:58:16,975 --> 00:58:20,012
The janitor's room,
all three of us.

1414
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:22,846
It was really stupid,

1415
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:25,216
I mean we should have
stayed together, Logan too.

1416
00:58:25,218 --> 00:58:28,553
The killer must have just been
waiting for the right moment.

1417
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:30,656
Well, how did you
even know he was shot?

1418
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:33,591
He yelled.

1419
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:38,429
It was, it was loud, and, and
there was so much commotion.

1420
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,400
Blake ran up the
stairs into the lobby,

1421
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:43,870
and then we just saw Logan
lying there in the snow.

1422
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:47,737
And Blake and I ran out to him,

1423
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:50,408
and we yelled for Ella
to call the police,

1424
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,243
you know to see if the
phones were back up again.

1425
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,679
- And they were?
- Yeah.

1426
00:58:54,681 --> 00:58:55,615
How convenient.

1427
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,884
What time do you think this was?

1428
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,120
I don't know, maybe
about four in the morning.

1429
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:07,924
So you never really
saw who shot Logan,

1430
00:59:07,926 --> 00:59:11,962
and you never really
saw who killed Andy.

1431
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:14,799
No, no, we just heard them.

1432
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,869
Logan saw him though.

1433
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:18,605
Was he sure it was a him?

1434
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,341
No, um, no, I, I
don't know, he, uh.

1435
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:28,879
Mia, is there anything
else you wanna tell me

1436
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:33,886
about Ella and Blake that
maybe you're not telling me?

1437
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,591
You do know what they
say about the truth?

1438
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:41,995
Are you sure there's
not anything else?

1439
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:46,331
No.

1440
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:51,034
Okay.

1441
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:54,004
[ominous music]

1442
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:56,339
You were cheating on my sister

1443
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:58,009
since the day you
started dating.

1444
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,243
Would you knock it off, man?

1445
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,113
She loved you.

1446
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,746
Let me point out that
this is the first time

1447
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:05,149
I've ever heard you refer
to her as your sister.

1448
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:06,449
She woulda loved that too.

1449
01:00:06,451 --> 01:00:07,919
Too bad she's not
alive to hear it.

1450
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:09,953
You don't get to talk about
my family that way, Blake.

1451
01:00:09,955 --> 01:00:11,821
I'm your family!

1452
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:13,225
Me!

1453
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,960
You always hated Andy.

1454
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:17,361
And what because
your dad happened

1455
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,328
to fall in love with her mom?

1456
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,464
While they were still married!

1457
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:22,433
They were all cheating
on each other,

1458
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:24,467
telling lies, keeping secrets.

1459
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:26,270
You were the only
one I could trust,

1460
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:27,672
and I thought that
if you loved Andy

1461
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:29,473
fine I could deal with it.

1462
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:32,643
But then I just realized that
you were like all the rest,

1463
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:33,846
you're a liar too.

1464
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:37,681
You wanna hate me,
Logan, that's fine,

1465
01:00:37,683 --> 01:00:40,618
but I'm not going down for
something you did, you hear me?

1466
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,819
What were you doing in
that room over her body?

1467
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:45,188
Where'd you go? You were
in there before any of us.

1468
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,826
You really think that I
could kill my own sister?

1469
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:50,594
Who the hell do you
think you're talking too?

1470
01:00:50,596 --> 01:00:52,362
I'm not so sure anymore.

1471
01:00:52,364 --> 01:00:53,330
Logan!

1472
01:00:53,332 --> 01:00:54,899
What are you gonna do, Logan?

1473
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,437
You're just as much of a
suspect as the rest of us.

1474
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:00,937
Why don't you
share your story?

1475
01:01:00,939 --> 01:01:02,642
I wanna hear what
you have to say.

1476
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:17,457
Well, this morning I
went to the magazine rack

1477
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:19,358
to get some stuff for our trip,

1478
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:22,996
you know snowboard stuff.

1479
01:01:25,263 --> 01:01:28,065
And then Blake showed
up a few minutes later.

1480
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:29,969
After that we went
to go pick up Ella,

1481
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,305
and then we went
straight to our house.

1482
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,808
When we got there
I went upstairs

1483
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:42,013
and Andy was talking to herself,
Mia was doing something,

1484
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:44,183
but the one thing that
I remember the most

1485
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:48,587
was you two coming out
of the laundry room.

1486
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:53,123
I knew something was going on,

1487
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,560
I could see it in your faces,

1488
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:58,131
and I should have said
something right then and there.

1489
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:04,504
I was going to use this
trip to come clean to Mia.

1490
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:09,640
It wasn't enough that
you had to date my sister

1491
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,475
but that you had to cheat on her

1492
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,078
with the one girl that I wanted.

1493
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:19,418
I was with you the whole time.

1494
01:02:21,853 --> 01:02:24,390
When we came here is
when we separated,

1495
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:29,228
and I went down the stairs
because I saw a light on.

1496
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,498
At the end of the hall
there was a, a boiler room,

1497
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:37,435
and I went in because I was
gonna look for like a breaker

1498
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:40,270
or a circuit panel or
something to get the lights on

1499
01:02:40,272 --> 01:02:41,908
but it was useless
without a key.

1500
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,679
I checked a phone, there
wasn't a dial tone,

1501
01:02:48,948 --> 01:02:50,683
and that's when I
heard the scream,

1502
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:55,320
and I heard like a thud,
or stomp, or something.

1503
01:02:57,323 --> 01:02:59,422
And so then I
grabbed a flashlight

1504
01:02:59,424 --> 01:03:01,560
and that gave me the
courage to go down the hall.

1505
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:07,566
And that's when I saw someone.

1506
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:12,939
I saw a figure or something
come out of that room,

1507
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:17,642
and I thought it was one of
you playing a joke on me,

1508
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:25,518
but then I saw Andy
dead in the dark.

1509
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,355
When I went in that room

1510
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:34,560
there was blood all around
and not a soul in sight.

1511
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,431
But then when I saw
that she wasn't, uh.

1512
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:47,705
Why didn't you call for help?

1513
01:03:47,707 --> 01:03:49,774
Yeah, when I came in you
were just frozen there.

1514
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:51,877
I was like in
shock or something.

1515
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:54,712
Okay, I, I, I couldn't believe-

1516
01:03:54,714 --> 01:03:55,946
- Let's just
pretend for a second

1517
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:57,915
that every word of
your story is true,

1518
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,216
so you heard noise,
was it like a crash or?

1519
01:04:00,218 --> 01:04:03,888
It was like a, a
stomp, or, or a thud,

1520
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,089
- or a bang or something.
- Like a gun.

1521
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,861
No, no, no, it
was, uh, a loud,

1522
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:12,529
look storytime is
over, all right.

1523
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:14,899
Don't we need to be
worried about the killer?

1524
01:04:14,901 --> 01:04:17,433
You know he's gotta
still be her somewhere.

1525
01:04:17,435 --> 01:04:18,270
Oh, god.

1526
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,308
You think he's still here?

1527
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,975
Then let's find him.

1528
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:29,245
There's four of us, we have
lights, we have weapons,

1529
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:30,446
let's find them.

1530
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:32,350
What if we don't find anyone?

1531
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:36,388
Then we'll know whose
story's true and whose wasn't.

1532
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:38,790
Fine.

1533
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:43,328
Let's go together.

1534
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:46,965
I can show you.

1535
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:59,678
Do you guys still
think someone's here?

1536
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:03,616
Who did this?

1537
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:07,019
If there's someone else
here show yourself!

1538
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,156
Not gonna let you
get away with this!

1539
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,123
What'd you do?

1540
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:16,993
Did you take this hammer here
and throw it in her skull?

1541
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:19,330
Is that what you did? Is
that what you did, huh?

1542
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,563
[hammer whooshes]
[hammer thuds]

1543
01:05:20,565 --> 01:05:21,565
[metal clanging]

1544
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,400
[gentle brooding music]

1545
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:24,737
You okay, Ella?

1546
01:05:26,138 --> 01:05:27,404
[ominous music]

1547
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:28,504
Let's go check out
that back entrance

1548
01:05:28,506 --> 01:05:30,574
where you came in, right?

1549
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:32,645
Let's see that back door.

1550
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:55,399
Has the light out here
been on all night?

1551
01:05:55,401 --> 01:05:56,234
Yeah.

1552
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:58,569
It should be locked.

1553
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:00,170
I locked it earlier.

1554
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:02,239
I don't think there's
anyone back here.

1555
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,210
I don't think there's
anyone here at all.

1556
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:07,777
[suspenseful music]

1557
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:10,783
[dial tone humming]

1558
01:06:14,453 --> 01:06:15,888
Phones are working fine.

1559
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:17,555
[Logan] What?

1560
01:06:18,524 --> 01:06:19,892
The phones aren't out.

1561
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:22,061
They're working fine.

1562
01:06:23,728 --> 01:06:25,230
Logan was freaking out.

1563
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:29,168
[suspenseful music]

1564
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:34,940
Logan, put the ax down, man.

1565
01:06:36,642 --> 01:06:38,975
Did you lie to us
about the phones?

1566
01:06:38,977 --> 01:06:42,447
No, no, I didn't kill her.

1567
01:06:43,915 --> 01:06:46,216
I didn't kill her, man, I
just found her like that.

1568
01:06:46,218 --> 01:06:47,484
I don't believe you.

1569
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,419
I don't believe a
word you've said.

1570
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,955
She took everything from me!

1571
01:06:50,957 --> 01:06:52,790
She took my family.

1572
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,924
She took my friends.

1573
01:06:54,926 --> 01:06:55,893
Stay away from me!

1574
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:57,962
Hey, calm down.

1575
01:06:57,964 --> 01:06:58,929
We can figure this out.

1576
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,364
You made a mistake.

1577
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:01,130
Stay away from me!

1578
01:07:01,132 --> 01:07:03,833
[Ella screams]

1579
01:07:03,835 --> 01:07:06,339
[door clicks]

1580
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:09,742
[door clicks]

1581
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:16,513
[arrow whooshes]

1582
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:19,817
[Logan groans]
[wind blowing]

1583
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:22,488
[Logan gasping]

1584
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,732
[body thuds]

1585
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:36,736
[Mia crying]

1586
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:42,908
Let it go.

1587
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,478
Put it down.

1588
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:49,015
[Ella crying]

1589
01:07:50,415 --> 01:07:51,249
It's okay.

1590
01:07:53,718 --> 01:07:54,552
Calm down.

1591
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,169
Oh, god.

1592
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:15,207
[door bangs]

1593
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,642
[Ella crying]

1594
01:08:18,644 --> 01:08:22,212
[footsteps crunching]

1595
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:25,315
[Mia crying]

1596
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:26,886
God, I'm so sorry.

1597
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:30,488
I, I didn't mean to.

1598
01:08:31,823 --> 01:08:34,292
Logan, you made me do it, man.

1599
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:39,228
What are we gonna do?

1600
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,800
We gotta do something.

1601
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:44,935
You think we should
wait until morning

1602
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:45,938
for someone to come?

1603
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:50,673
The phones are working, Blake,
we can call 911, that's it.

1604
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:52,176
No, no.

1605
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:54,378
I, I don't know, I mean
they're already dead.

1606
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,480
They can't be rescued.

1607
01:08:57,116 --> 01:08:57,948
We can't call anyone.

1608
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,882
No, we, we can't.

1609
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,019
Mia, you gotta promise me.

1610
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:03,853
What about her?

1611
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:05,222
You don't think she's gonna

1612
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,992
tell the police
everything that happened?

1613
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,665
Logan admitted to killing her,

1614
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,534
and I think she'll
do whatever we say

1615
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:19,605
as, as long as she's
free from the blame.

1616
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,007
So what do we tell the police?

1617
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:25,642
We have to call them.

1618
01:09:25,644 --> 01:09:28,277
No, the police, no,
no, we can't tell anyone.

1619
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:29,445
What?

1620
01:09:29,447 --> 01:09:31,280
We can bury this.

1621
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:33,182
You and me, we can bury
their bodies both of 'em

1622
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:34,418
and clean up this mess.

1623
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,651
We can get out of here
before anyone comes.

1624
01:09:35,653 --> 01:09:36,820
No one needs to know
that we were here.

1625
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:38,288
We can just say that,

1626
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,923
I don't know that we went
to leave without them

1627
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,424
'cause we couldn't find them

1628
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:43,127
and just figured they meet us
later or something, I just-

1629
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:45,928
- My god, can I have
Blake back please?

1630
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,931
What is wrong with you?

1631
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,033
You just left from a trip
without your girlfriend

1632
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:51,836
because you couldn't
get ahold of her.

1633
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:54,570
No one has to know
she's my girlfriend.

1634
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:56,174
That, that won't work, Blake.

1635
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:58,844
It's not possible.

1636
01:09:59,845 --> 01:10:01,046
It will come back.

1637
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:03,916
We have to call the police.

1638
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:12,390
Hey, I am with you, okay?

1639
01:10:20,632 --> 01:10:23,469
[Ella whimpering]

1640
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:34,645
[wind blowing]

1641
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,049
I'm gonna tell police, Blake.

1642
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:41,687
I'm gonna tell them how we
got stuck here together,

1643
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,957
how you got us in
from the storm.

1644
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:51,496
I'm gonna tell them how
there was someone else here.

1645
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:55,401
They tried to kill us.

1646
01:10:56,769 --> 01:11:00,206
They got Andy first
and then Logan.

1647
01:11:02,808 --> 01:11:04,674
They went for the car,
and they saw the damage,

1648
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:07,444
and they realized that
they were stuck here too.

1649
01:11:07,446 --> 01:11:10,616
We, we don't know who they
are, even what they look like.

1650
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:15,054
All we know is that
they tried to kill us.

1651
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:17,889
We're the victims here.

1652
01:11:21,393 --> 01:11:24,730
Logan, uh, went to dig
us out food from the car,

1653
01:11:25,863 --> 01:11:27,700
and someone shot him.

1654
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:33,572
We're scared and
we wanna go home.

1655
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:40,613
You kept us safe.

1656
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:47,286
You stayed with the
girls, and protected us.

1657
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:52,890
You're the hero,
Blake, the survivor.

1658
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:56,058
But I shot him.

1659
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,263
No, you didn't!

1660
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:02,134
He got shot, not by you.

1661
01:12:05,104 --> 01:12:06,672
No, I don't know.

1662
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:08,840
Nobody knows.

1663
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:16,413
[dial tone humming]

1664
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:20,517
[buttons beeping]
[Ella crying]

1665
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:23,552
[phone ringing]

1666
01:12:23,554 --> 01:12:26,892
[Operator] 911,
what's your emergency?

1667
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:28,626
Hello?

1668
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:31,360
[Ella gasps]

1669
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:33,929
[wind blowing]

1670
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:37,868
Okay, okay, we need
to get Ella on same page

1671
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,335
and make our stories match,

1672
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,105
then we'll be fine,
we'll be fine.

1673
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,512
Oh, no.

1674
01:12:48,514 --> 01:12:50,012
[Blake] Ella!

1675
01:12:50,014 --> 01:12:53,184
[footsteps crunching]

1676
01:12:56,287 --> 01:12:57,822
The police are on their way.

1677
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:01,024
What did you say?

1678
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:02,258
What did you tell them?

1679
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,526
Listen, it's okay,
I just need to know

1680
01:13:03,528 --> 01:13:04,897
what you said on the phone.

1681
01:13:06,264 --> 01:13:09,231
I told them that
we needed help.

1682
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,901
That we got stuck
'cause of the snow,

1683
01:13:10,903 --> 01:13:14,907
and that two people are dead.

1684
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,941
Did you say anything specific?

1685
01:13:17,943 --> 01:13:19,778
Anything remotely in detail?

1686
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:25,149
No, I just told them
that we needed help.

1687
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:29,686
Okay, listen, Ella,
when the police get here

1688
01:13:29,688 --> 01:13:31,690
we all need to say
the same thing, okay?

1689
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:33,957
Do you understand me?

1690
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,728
We all have to be
on the same page.

1691
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:40,998
I'm sorry I shot Logan,
it was a mistake.

1692
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:44,303
But I believe he killed her.

1693
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:46,703
He killed his sister.

1694
01:13:46,705 --> 01:13:47,771
Who knows what he
would have done to us.

1695
01:13:47,773 --> 01:13:49,705
You saw how crazy he got.

1696
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:51,341
She was his stepsister.

1697
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,875
Exactly!

1698
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:55,878
Stepsister he hated
and he said so.

1699
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,079
When the police get here

1700
01:13:57,081 --> 01:13:58,582
we need to tell
them the same thing.

1701
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,752
Okay, there, there was someone
here, they were after us.

1702
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,453
They wanted to kill us.

1703
01:14:03,455 --> 01:14:05,321
[siren wailing]

1704
01:14:05,323 --> 01:14:08,527
They got Andy, they got Logan.

1705
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:13,399
Can you do that for us?

1706
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:17,001
You shot Logan, Blake.

1707
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,837
You killed him.

1708
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:22,239
No, stay away from me!

1709
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:23,075
Stop!

1710
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:25,878
Ella, I need you.

1711
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:30,981
- Stay away.
- Mia and I both

1712
01:14:30,983 --> 01:14:32,251
need you, please.

1713
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:34,950
[Ella] No, stay away.

1714
01:14:34,952 --> 01:14:36,319
[Blake] Ella.

1715
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:37,420
[car door bangs]
[police radio chattering]

1716
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:38,789
[Mia] There's a bunch of them.

1717
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,156
[car door bangs]

1718
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:42,627
Ella, no one has to
take the blame for this.

1719
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:45,330
No one.

1720
01:14:47,064 --> 01:14:47,899
Please.

1721
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:50,736
Hey,

1722
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:54,839
it's okay.

1723
01:14:59,778 --> 01:15:03,215
[police radio chattering]

1724
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,855
Something's up.

1725
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:15,624
Okay, we got it?

1726
01:15:15,626 --> 01:15:17,494
I just needed to hook
some cords up to the monitor

1727
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:19,695
but this should have
full surveillance.

1728
01:15:19,697 --> 01:15:20,629
Did you play it yet?

1729
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:21,832
No, wanted to wait till you-

1730
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:22,932
- Okay, we'll let's
go, let's play.

1731
01:15:22,934 --> 01:15:24,366
Let's roll it, roll footage.

1732
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:29,107
I mean this could be everything.
[gentle melancholic music]

1733
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:31,742
They're taking her now, look.

1734
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,785
[police radio chattering]

1735
01:15:45,657 --> 01:15:46,589
[Detective Young]
[scoffs] What is this?

1736
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:47,857
Why can't we see anything?

1737
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,692
The camera is
only set to record

1738
01:15:49,694 --> 01:15:51,962
when it senses movement.

1739
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,163
Okay, well, it's
recording this,

1740
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:54,865
what's moving in the dark?

1741
01:15:54,867 --> 01:15:56,435
There, someone's in the room.

1742
01:16:02,206 --> 01:16:03,374
Dammit there she is.

1743
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:26,898
Is she trying to
get in the cabinets?

1744
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:38,240
[electricity humming]

1745
01:16:38,242 --> 01:16:39,241
Uh, uh, where did it go?

1746
01:16:39,243 --> 01:16:40,243
What happened?

1747
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:41,710
