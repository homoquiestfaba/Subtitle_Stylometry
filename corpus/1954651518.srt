00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,472
Hi, you called Jude and Celia.
We can not answer now.

2
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,275
Leave your name and number
that will call later.

3
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,375
Drugs.

4
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,032
Marinated in a wine garlic sauce...

5
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,760
Hello.
- What goes in a salad?

6
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,671
Is making salad for him?
- And I am.

7
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,321
Why?
- Well, because I asked...

8
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,993
What he wanted and he said he had lunch
late...

9
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,794
That was too hot to cook.

10
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,563
Spake: 'Why does a light salad...'

11
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:15,299
and I'll bring the wine?'.
I said, 'Fine.'

12
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,442
But you do not eat salad.
- I know.

13
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,170
Well, now will have to eat salad.

14
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,280
Yeah, I know. I put?

15
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,609
Expected, how old he is older?

16
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,929
Are 17 years.
've Talked about it, Shelly.

17
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,899
I need...
- How many meetings have been?

18
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,999
Ones 10, I think.

19
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,955
We worked together for three months when
he was a consultant that project...

20
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:40,790
So we know well.

21
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,243
No more questions, I want to help.

22
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,343
I like it...

23
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,545
Yeah, me too.

24
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,517
It is fabulous.
I wanted to make a salad for him.

25
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,677
Buffalo Mozzarella, lettuce...

26
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,958
Bread, olive oil, vinegar, basil,
garlic, salt and pepper.

27
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,278
This is a caprese salad,
think I can do.

28
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,914
And he has the most
17 years of experience in bed?

29
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,014
Yes, he has.

30
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,791
I love you.
- I love you too.

31
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:24,173
BETWEEN WINE AND LOVES (2007)
Legend: @ ARR ZZO.

32
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,606
She has another meeting with that guy.

33
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,706
Who?
- The Lily.

34
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,975
The older guy?
- It is.

35
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,115
I thought you liked him.
- I like it, it's just that...

36
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,275
He is much older.
- This is too much.

37
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,955
You see nothing wrong with
the age difference?

38
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,575
She likes him?
- Yes, it's ridiculous.

39
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,911
She calls him 'Knight in Shining Armor
,' 'Mr. Wonderful'.

40
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,513
All that crap.

41
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:13,333
It is not with the crap that
every little girl dreams?

42
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,433
Love.

43
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,055
So is saying that she is happy.

44
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,155
Well, it is, but...

45
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,442
So what's the problem?

46
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,946
Nevermind.

47
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,267
Look, he's a guy of 47 years.
With a writer hot 30...

48
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,504
Career about to take off.
And who needs her space...

49
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,190
So she gives to every guy who comes out.

50
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,593
That man will lick the floor at her feet.

51
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,446
Actually, bet he licks.

52
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,432
Love, I'm serious.
- I'm also serious.

53
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,997
I think it's perfect for her.

54
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,802
You do not know.

55
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,971
No, but I know her.

56
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,528
And she never brought it here to
give a person the least of her.

57
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,446
Much less make her happy.

58
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,166
In addition, it is the combination not age.

59
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:06,481
And these two together.
I feel it.

60
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,978
As you and I, Shelly.

61
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,518
Where's the phone?
- Why?

62
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,179
I'll do something nice for us.

63
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,100
What?

64
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll order a pizza.

65
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,971
What? No.

66
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,673
What is Shelly?

67
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,263
If I stayed in the kitchen
and learn with me...

68
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,417
Would do this together.
Would be much better.

69
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,577
I just got home from work.
- Me too.

70
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,618
I do not like to cook.

71
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,226
But I like it. Strive to me.

72
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,316
Like to cook?
- We will have a baby.

73
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,646
Someone has to start to enjoy cooking.

74
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,621
You make great salads.
We can eat a salad.

75
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,931
Hey, where are you going?

76
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,503
Ask your damn pizza.

77
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,490
Hi - Hi.

78
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,749
Health.

79
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,120
Wait.

80
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,105
If you do eye contact, bad luck.

81
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,716
It?
- Seven years of bad sex.

82
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,690
I did not know it.
- No?

83
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,949
It was good to know each other then.

84
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,523
What if we had not known?

85
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,521
It would have been a great tragedy.

86
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,038
Saved my life, thank you.

87
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,546
What a delight.

88
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,098
Nebbiolo.

89
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,198
I love it.
- Good.

90
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,266
Thank portrazer.

91
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,153
And then?
- And then?

92
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,651
Have you ever been married?

93
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,060
No.
- And will you marry?

94
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,281
Pardon me?

95
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,350
Do you want to get married?

96
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,170
This is a request or a question?

97
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,022
It's a question.

98
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,303
Okay, okay. Good..

99
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,842
I want. Is, yes. I want to.

100
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,064
I mean, it depends.
Not have to do with marriage...

101
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,267
Do not have to happen.

102
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,201
I'm not dying of desire to marry.

103
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,238
If it happens, it will be cool.
If not, okay.

104
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,407
I just want serfeliz and enjoy life.

105
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,242
Why do not you married?

106
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:09,912
It's out of fashion.
- What does this mean?

107
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,097
Everyone is divorced.

108
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,555
Not everyone who divorces.

109
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,631
Divorce, fill and move on.

110
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,742
Not in a real marriage.

111
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:27,008
Ah, yes.
- No.

112
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,446
Here. And women...

113
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,387
Betray them as much as men.
In fact, even more.

114
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,939
There are statistics.
- Just talking about it...

115
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,457
Because we are in Hollywood.

116
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,209
Normal people who live out here...

117
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,646
Stay together more than 5 minutes.
- Normal people cheat.

118
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:47,883
There are a few that last.
Has Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn.

119
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:50,653
And Cameron Diaz used to be a singer...
and that.

120
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,729
But that ended. That's it.

121
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,293
They do not even married.
And I bet betrayed.

122
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,433
Okay, you have problems.

123
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,869
I? I have no problems.
- Oh really?

124
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,691
I've tried many things in life
, but were in the past.

125
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,419
People betray and lie.

126
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,847
Reality I know more now than before.

127
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:19,947
Is that right?

128
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,222
What does this mean?
What you do not want to marry?

129
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:30,126
Do not querter
a monogamous relationship?

130
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,636
No. I mean I think marriage is outdated.

131
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,982
Right.

132
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,151
How many bottles did you bring?

133
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,903
2.
- Great.

134
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,706
Think you can?
- Here's 5 minutes...

135
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,725
And we are already in marriage.

136
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,715
Shall I go back to the store?
- No.

137
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,963
Not yet.

138
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,273
It's all you have?
- It is.

139
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,033
That's all?

140
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,596
It. I do not like salad.

141
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,005
Do not eat salad?
- No.

142
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,794
Why not eat salad?
- I do not know.

143
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:07,496
So why do we have salad for dinner?

144
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,150
Because you wanted a salad and
is too hot to cook.

145
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,702
And I thought it was time to
get used to eating salad.

146
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:17,473
I should... eating salad.
- Good, but was for your good...

147
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,242
Not because of me.
- No, not because of you...

148
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:25,431
Is one thing I wanted to start eating
. Your request cheered me up.

149
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,625
Okay. So we have a caprese.

150
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,349
Let's see, what you dislike?

151
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,207
What I like is the bread and cheese.

152
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,459
That's it? No...
- And pepper.

153
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,559
And pepper?

154
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:44,166
So with all these things you
not like, what will we do?

155
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,018
I do not know.

156
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,328
Let's see. Let's make a...

157
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,587
Salad Lily.

158
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:54,251
Okay, but I am very sick.
- I know.

159
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,119
It basil?

160
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,398
Tenho.

161
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,629
Great. And is it cool?

162
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,700
I think you need to think about it.

163
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,103
It is the seventh month of pregnancy and
everything seems much bigger than it is.

164
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,006
No, not that.
I'm not one of those pregnant...

165
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:27,081
Who is freaking out the whole time.

166
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,646
True, but is not it this time.

167
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,746
Ok, then what is?

168
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,797
That's all.

169
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,487
'All' has to do with everyday things?

170
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:42,098
It.
Has much to do with everyday life.

171
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:47,283
Always have. And now has to deal with it
being pregnant.

172
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,846
This is not fair.

173
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,949
But the reality is.

174
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,791
Try this one.
- Our.

175
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,835
Oh my God.

176
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,672
My God.

177
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,002
You see that?
That's the problem.

178
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,030
What? A good bruschetta?

179
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,947
I can not cook.
- So learn.

180
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,116
I'm trying.

181
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,655
But Chris does not participate.
He acts like a sexist.

182
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,070
I think he just did not bother to cook.

183
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,445
Do you want to mount the cradle
and paint the baby's room?

184
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,897
No.

185
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,727
But he wants, right?
- Yes.

186
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,433
This is the part of it.
Cooking is yours.

187
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,155
People are what they are, Shelly.

188
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,403
We can change that, but
generally do not change.

189
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,796
Okay, while being honest with you.

190
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:56,701
Needless to say this to you.
- No.

191
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,269
By the way, cooking is not for me.
I'm not good at it.

192
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,305
I bought all these books idiots, but I'm not...

193
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:06,809
No idea what I'm doing.
- So do not come naturally...

194
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,327
DNA I do not have to do it.

195
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,915
Look at you. Not not paying attention.

196
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,783
What are you doing?

197
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:18,120
I watch the I like to eat, then I do.

198
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,923
Everything has to do with combining
things. It's like your clothes.

199
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:23,092
Nice combination, indeed.
- Thank you.

200
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:27,212
It's the same thing.
- Can you teach me some tricks?

201
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,202
Can each cooking 2 times per week.

202
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,901
It'll be nice.
- Do not you care?

203
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,388
The Celia did not really enjoy
cooking, it is always shooting.

204
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,488
So it might be fun.

205
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,124
You are so lucky.

206
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,229
Why?
- Because you're a lesbian.

207
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,485
What?
- Women are much more...

208
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,710
Tune with their emotions.

209
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,739
Sure, it's a way to see things.

210
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,092
But it is true, no?
I mean, she comes home...

211
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,561
Tells us about her day.
You count as yours.

212
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,798
You have much to talk about what
and vent, if needed.

213
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:05,134
Or get excited. I ask Chris...

214
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,804
As his day and he said 'Great.' That's it.

215
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,219
But this is not bad, huh?

216
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:17,146
Well, you and Celia
share every detail with one another.

217
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,051
They are lovers and best friends.

218
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,152
This is what we are.
Best friends and lovers.

219
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,921
I love it.
- Okay, so you like the idea...

220
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,191
...2 women competing
to vent at the end of the day...

221
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,351
While a guy is just there listening?

222
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,914
It.

223
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,054
This is called estrogen.

224
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,054
Best friends and lovers
are important roles...

225
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,624
But that does not make our relationship
nothing ideal.

226
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:50,314
I think so. At least you
she hears and understands you.

227
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,096
Yeah, right.

228
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,703
Hello.

229
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,606
Speak of the devil...

230
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,146
What are you doing?
- Here I am cooking with Shelly.

231
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,976
Have you finished?
- No.

232
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,629
Any predictions?
- They just bring pizza, then...

233
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,650
Will take a while.
3 hours at least.

234
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,258
Okay.

235
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,259
I love you.
- Me too.

236
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,705
More bruschetta?

237
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,003
Thank you.
- Sure.

238
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,383
How is the wait?
- I do not care if it takes.

239
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,819
I like the team.

240
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,496
So, how is to stay here
hidden in the corner?

241
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,602
Yeah, but I think it has to do
be honest with you...

242
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:56,939
With yourself and with others about
what they are doing together...

243
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,039
And how they feel real.

244
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,998
Marriage is a relationship only
you already have.

245
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:11,538
Marriage is just a celebration of this act.
And make it official.

246
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,840
It is a legal documentation,
then in that sense...

247
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,915
I would like to be a real marriage.

248
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,812
This is something that is not
strength, just happens.

249
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,497
Or not.

250
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:26,218
I can do without the drama of
marriage, all the crap...

251
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,446
But qualquerforma,
I believe in love.

252
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,789
And I love jewelry.

253
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,292
I'll keep that in mind.
- It should.

254
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,810
Have you lived with someone?

255
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,820
Almost.
- Ended up changing my mind?

256
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,690
No. We were in the house a
the other almost every night.

257
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,244
I was there and she had things
things in my house.

258
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,413
This is not living together.

259
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,000
We had the same house, but
we lived our lives together.

260
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,135
Yeah, but that's the fun part.
Mean...

261
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,472
Live together is to divide
the space in the closet...

262
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,175
Undertake to paint the wall,
accepting a mobile ugly...

263
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,927
Yes it is to live together.

264
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,912
Do you have experience with this?

265
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:13,817
Oh, God. I have.
- More than once?

266
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,501
Four times.
- 4 times?

267
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:20,577
It.

268
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,042
I do not know what I was thinking of none.

269
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,944
I was in love?

270
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,376
Everyone had bad habits.

271
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,852
There were bad men, but I do not
should have gone live with them.

272
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,589
I was very insecure about men
when I was younger.

273
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,689
Why was it unsafe?

274
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,346
I do not know. But thought it had to be...

275
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,615
In a relationship to be happy.

276
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,750
And now when I look at my 20 years...

277
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,520
The time that I was not happy, or when
was...

278
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,356
These relationships that
I thought I needed...

279
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,690
But I did not need.

280
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,265
But did it anyway.
- I did.

281
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,476
I was young.

282
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,899
I was a girl of 20 years extremely dramatic.

283
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,769
Now What?
- I'm in my 30 and love it.

284
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,583
Why?
- It is much easier.

285
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,355
I mean... It is what it is, but...

286
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,046
I know very well what I want
and I know what I want.

287
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,577
And I'm not afraid of two things.
Life is life.

288
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:25,003
Ah, is it? Life is life?
Is the key to you?

289
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,369
Yes Were you surprised by that?
- Well, a little.

290
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,362
Generally have a little more than that.

291
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,164
With most women,
the big decisions of life...

292
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:39,284
Or is the answer to everything
or the end of the world.

293
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,217
It seems to be generally so.

294
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,280
I was that way.
Then one day, gone.

295
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,530
Do not know if it's because I'm
more comfortable with myself...

296
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,030
Or if I woke up one day...

297
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,185
And was tired of living like this...

298
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,175
But the two forms,
is a good thing.

299
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,241
It's very good you will not be afraid.

300
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:07,679
I have my moments, but also
is not the end of the world.

301
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,779
Like what?

302
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,267
What kind of time you have?

303
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,797
Frightened you?
- No.

304
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,172
It was only a question.

305
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,272
Okay.

306
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,820
What kinds of moments I have?
- What scares you?

307
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,962
Bad judgment.

308
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,047
It happens.

309
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:33,872
Yeah, but usually you is not the only
person who pays the price for it.

310
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,690
It's part of life.

311
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,903
I think so. So what scares you?

312
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,973
Nothing.
- Nothing?

313
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:46,340
Nothing.
- What is, must have something.

314
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,471
Well, actually...
salad dressing ready...

315
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,571
Freaks me out.
- What.

316
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,646
Well, come on.
Get down from there.

317
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,543
What will you do?
- You'll see.

318
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,001
Go do something from scratch, is not it?
- No, we will. Together.

319
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,854
Lemon. Is the right thing.

320
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,539
The right thing?

321
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,869
It is the right thing.

322
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,139
I wish he lend more attention. I'm...

323
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:19,049
Pregnant, married, live in an apartment.

324
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,171
Work at a movie studio
doing absolutely nothing creative...

325
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,359
Just creating excuses
's why I'm taking the day off.

326
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,028
I should be building movie sets...

327
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,149
And living in a house with a pool.
I do not know how I got here.

328
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:36,284
Well, you made the choices that brought
here.

329
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,570
Are you really so unhappy with them?

330
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,540
No. I just do not know what I'm doing.

331
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,660
What are you afraid of?
- At the moment, to win over 1 kg.

332
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,963
Whatever you're doing,
smells amazing.

333
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:50,599
I know that cheese has enough stuffing to
a horse.

334
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,301
Well, the cheese is good for the soul
and the small bones.

335
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:56,684
So what if gaining weight 7 Kg?
- 8 Kg.

336
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,022
What seem to eighty.

337
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,257
, but are not.

338
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:04,198
Well, I can no longer see my feet.

339
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,591
The baby will love it here.

340
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,501
How is your cholesterol?
- Low.

341
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,469
Really? Impressive.
- I do not know why.

342
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,911
I think...

343
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,079
Terrifying the fuck is Chris.

344
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,552
In what way?
- Of all the ways.

345
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:37,625
You know, I always start.
And he never.

346
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,951
And I want, but the more
I do, I do not like so much...

347
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:44,686
The way I think you should like.

348
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:47,676
Why do you think he does not like?

349
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,951
I know he is not.
- Well, does it end?

350
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:54,872
Yes, but that does not
mean anything to a man.

351
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,867
What is it?
- I think you have...

352
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,545
To give him time.
- No, no.

353
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,122
Look, I think you need a while and he also.

354
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,945
Why?
- Why is your 1st pregnancy...

355
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,749
You're pregnant, it is the 1st
his experience, his is the 1st...

356
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:17,402
I'm sure he's a little more lost than you.

357
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,156
Think about it. If
Celia puts his hand on her belly...

358
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,875
I feel the baby kick and 1 hour later...

359
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,929
She puts her hand a few inches below
for one thing...

360
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,349
Completely different would be very strange.

361
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,941
This is not helping me.
- But that's life.

362
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,373
I know, I know what life is.
But nothing like that.

363
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:42,794
I do not think he looks more to me
the same way he looked.

364
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:48,199
You'll have the baby and return to settle
midnight on the roof quickly.

365
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,757
You know that?
- We got you there.

366
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,905
Oh my God.

367
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,837
Okay,
were there for the same reason.

368
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,278
You'll be fine.

369
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,623
You'll have a baby?

370
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,768
I think I'll wait a bit.
But let's be great babysitters.

371
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,761
I do not know if we will.
- What is happening?

372
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,807
Honey.

373
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,947
Do you think he is cheating on you?

374
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,047
No...

375
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,743
I think not yet.

376
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,469
That's it. And pepper, of course.

377
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,947
Yes.

378
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,750
Yes.

379
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,341
Why did not live with her?
- Who?

380
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:23,078
The girl spent all the time, he was at home.

381
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,596
Why not.
- Why?

382
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,114
It was not what we were doing.

383
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,234
Why?

384
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:36,074
We wanted different things.
- So why were they together?

385
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,802
Because we liked each other.

386
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,480
Even though it would not in any way?

387
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,400
Do not know it would give
somewhere or not.

388
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,120
It was nice for a while and then
was no more.

389
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Okay.

390
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,465
Are avoiding anything with all this talk?

391
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,565
No.

392
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,477
Wow, that's fine.
- See?

393
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,206
No, it is delicious.
- You look so surprised.

394
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,516
I do not like sauce ready.

395
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:31,196
Do not ready this nonsense.
This is not salad dressing.

396
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:35,206
This is much better.
- This is the right thing.

397
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,667
So why not believe in marriage?

398
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:57,322
Why are you worried if
sure that nothing is happening?

399
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,339
'Cause everything is different
now and it has back.

400
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,647
I'm not the girl whom he married...

401
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:07,467
And he is not the guy I married.

402
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:12,355
I will be mother of his son.
And it will be the father.

403
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,931
Yeah, and it's beautiful. It growth.

404
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,694
Do you want this baby, Shelly?

405
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,306
I want this baby more than anything.

406
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:34,943
It's just that this thing is not
Mother's sexiest phase of my life.

407
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,512
And I do not think he will again be
the way it was before.

408
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:41,115
Okay, things are a little different.

409
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,215
But this is not so bad.

410
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:45,275
Not totally, but...

411
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:48,122
Mothers climb on the roof and
have sex under the stars.

412
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:50,959
Who said that?
- The baby said, I think.

413
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,562
For this there nanny.
- What is. You really think so...

414
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,698
A man will look a woman the same way...

415
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,535
After seeing a baby go through
the same opening tiny...

416
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:03,865
That until then it was the Holy Grail?

417
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,976
I could have my body back,
whole damn good, in one week.

418
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,745
Could tiny red panties...

419
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:15,357
A black stilettos, but for him,
I'll still be a 'Mom'.

420
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:22,113
I'll never be his wife beautiful and sexy
him again. Over.

421
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,487
I think you're exaggerating.

422
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,229
I'm not.

423
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:31,474
You have this whole thing lesbianism.

424
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,409
I'm serious.
Women are more complex.

425
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,207
We need more than a stiff butt
to be impressed.

426
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:42,622
We prefer content.
- Speak for yourself.

427
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,714
Gracinha.
- I'm kidding.

428
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:49,617
That is, more or less.
Just think that is out of plumb...

429
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,153
Hormones are taking over.

430
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:55,398
I know my hormones are crazy, I know.

431
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:58,693
But I'm trying to be realistic. That's it.

432
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,962
Men always have a midlife crisis...

433
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,015
And go for the younger
woman. Do you know?

434
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,800
They want to like you as a mother.

435
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,154
At first they try
but it is a fight that can not win.

436
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,441
They are old and distinguished
and before we know it...

437
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:17,145
Has a new girl and sexy. And with the right
smile across the room...

438
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,515
This marriage was already.
Not only because of her age...

439
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,118
But because she does not have the
baggage of wedding or baby bag.

440
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,337
She has the whole world in front of her.

441
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,090
And all she wants is someone who
be around long enough...

442
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,015
To celebrate with her all the things she did.

443
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,271
Easy. And yet, she loves him.

444
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:41,655
If I were a man,
I would want the same thing.

445
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,167
Look Lily and this guy down.

446
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:48,176
He is 17 years older than her.

447
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,276
17.

448
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,982
And he is Photo-Journalist
portodo and travels the world...

449
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:55,801
Doing God knows what,
with God knows who...

450
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:56,901
.

451
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:01,089
You know, in my understanding
he is not married, no children...

452
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,224
And as he goes around the world...

453
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:06,027
He sends cards and flowers
when not in Los Angeles.

454
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,213
And she's happier than
never seen her with a man.

455
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,332
I think has more than one way to look at it.

456
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,432
It has.

457
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,707
What is it?
- I do not believe we're having...

458
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,776
This conversation.
- Oh, please.

459
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,612
With what they have going on?
'Papaizão' or not.

460
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,837
How not to speak of them?

461
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:30,518
I'm not talking about them.
- But what are they doing?

462
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:33,083
What is happening down there?

463
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,932
Why do you care what they are doing?

464
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,595
You need a little flour.

465
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:42,295
No, I do not need.
- Yes, you need to.

466
00:34:42,395 --> 00:34:43,663
...I do not need.
- I'll be back in a minute.

467
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:46,738
Shelly, you can not... - 5 minutes.

468
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,073
Hi, I'm Shelly from above.

469
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,134
Of course, since we met.

470
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,359
I came to get some flour.

471
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,589
We're doing a roast and over.
- Oh, and what are baking?

472
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:44,631
Some cookies...
- Hi.

473
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,503
Hi. I need to flour.
So, how are you?

474
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,615
Well, thank you. And you?

475
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,999
The baby is to soon?

476
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,479
2 months. Thanks for asking.

477
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,815
You have children?
- No.

478
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,823
Yeah... But you querter?

479
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,276
Querter a family?
Want to take root?

480
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,776
It's flour, you say?
- Yes, just one cup.

481
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,949
You think you could
handle a pregnant woman?

482
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,901
Hey.

483
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,387
I just wonder why Lily said
you never married and...

484
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:13,454
That's it.

485
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:15,190
It's just a cup.
- Take the whole package.

486
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,425
You better go, before something burn.

487
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,525
But...

488
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,965
Right. We should
dinner together next week.

489
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,300
A dinner would be great,
can I travel...

490
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,953
Next week.
But when I get back...

491
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,613
Ah, travel... Again.

492
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,313
Okay, let Lily score.

493
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,895
Bye, Shelly.
- Right.

494
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,088
Have fun with the salad.

495
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,398
Okay.

496
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,420
Excuse me.
- No need to apologize.

497
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,824
It's a concerned friend.
- It's a bomb of hormones...

498
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:54,445
Who is bored with his life
and therefore gets the other.

499
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,979
Do not worry.
- Thank you.

500
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,415
Wine?
- Yes, wine.

501
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,504
The wine will be the answer for everything
tonight.

502
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:05,156
There is nothing wrong with that.

503
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,850
Oh my God. I hope not.

504
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,848
Of course she is angry, but...

505
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,523
Already, then let it go.
Apologize tomorrow.

506
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:24,258
But I just...
- Do you have...

507
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,033
More serious issues to resolve
than worrying about Lily?

508
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,433
Look, you know,
am very worried...

509
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,786
With everything you just told me
about you, Chris, and this little baby.

510
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,389
Why? Because it is a harsh reality?

511
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,686
Not because it is crazy.
- Really?

512
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,674
Hi - Hi.

513
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,494
Forgot your screenplay.
- I know.

514
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,423
See you tomorrow.
- Wait.

515
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,231
In a hurry?

516
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:58,326
The studio sent it.

517
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,407
Only one cup?

518
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,007
Well, the bottle is opened.

519
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,448
Accept a drink.

520
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,191
Okay, I thought.

521
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,711
Marriage. A close union,
a combination...

522
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,525
Mating, marriage.
- Is this it?

523
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,967
The dictionary provides
definition, not opinion.

524
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,120
So marriage is
what you think is the definition.

525
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,661
Sure So, what do you think?

526
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,908
In this definition?
- It is.

527
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:41,228
I think it's very good.
- So you...

528
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:43,698
Believes it is possible a relationship?

529
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,534
I guess anything is possible.
- You know what I mean.

530
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,569
Listen, can not make a relationship...

531
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:52,039
Something that is not.
Will be what it is, no matter...

532
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,060
What you want it to be.
- That's what I'm saying.

533
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,980
But the marriage is over.
- But that's what marriage is.

534
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,383
No, society has changed this definition.

535
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,653
Marriage is about terms and
conditions, rules and laws.

536
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:07,471
Do not you believe it.

537
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:12,076
Then why else would marry?
- You would not, that's it.

538
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:15,563
Marry and be in
marriage are different things.

539
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,348
That's what I think.

540
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,067
Marry, I do not care in any way.

541
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:24,486
But the idea of being in a marriage, I like.

542
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,623
A real marriage,
that's the truth.

543
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,459
Are you saying you do not want to marry.

544
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,618
I'm saying that the only
word that represents...

545
00:40:37,718 --> 00:40:40,762
Something I want to be, is 'Happy.'

546
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,925
And when I say I am happy,
I really want to say that.

547
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,065
Because if not, I'm out.

548
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,246
What is it?

549
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:55,341
Think we should open the 2nd bottle?

550
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,885
Absolutely.
- Great.

551
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,578
Noticed which basically is saying
that every woman who gives birth...

552
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,481
Is destined to be betrayed
or exchanged for another woman?

553
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:09,581
No, not every woman.

554
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,319
That is, some homes
think of different ways.

555
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:15,734
It's just that if they act so or not...

556
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,225
Everyone wants a girl young and carefree...

557
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:21,112
Has a perfect body and a constant smile...

558
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,564
As the guy who is with Lily...

559
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:26,500
He just wants a piece of ass
20 years younger than him.

560
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,437
I think is a bit more than that...

561
00:41:28,537 --> 00:41:32,823
But I mean, right or wrong,
is a chance that Lily has.

562
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,960
I just do not think she
want to see him as he is.

563
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,113
And you do not give him the
benefit of the doubt, I mean...

564
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:43,313
Does not matter, why are not you
that is down there with him.

565
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,877
Spoke to someone about it?

566
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,770
Who? What?

567
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,509
Do you need help.

568
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,754
I know, that's why 'm talking to you.

569
00:41:56,146 --> 00:42:00,234
Well, you began to speak when
her husband asked pizza.

570
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,536
I think I need professional help, I mean...

571
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:04,538
At least go see your OB...

572
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:07,041
And see if it's a phase normal pregnancy.

573
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,642
It's normal.

574
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:13,162
These are all normal things,
that's what I'm worried.

575
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,602
You know, that's not what I meant.

576
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,702
It.

577
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,142
What about you?

578
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,212
For my what?

579
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,248
Well, already been tried?

580
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,170
With what?

581
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,384
You know what. I mean, even
is why we are here?

582
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,523
You think I'm projecting?

583
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,171
Designing? Well, it better be
reading self-help books.

584
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,271
I'm not projecting.

585
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Okay.

586
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,809
You are attracted to someone?

587
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,589
Drugs.

588
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,489
You are.
- No.

589
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,366
Oh, shit.

590
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:30,233
Okay. They are only their
hormones are crazy.

591
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:35,205
I not only thought about it. I did.

592
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,901
'Oh Damn' is really the answer
right here, right?

593
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,294
The hormones are...

594
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,555
There are hormones.

595
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:04,400
It was... desire.
Was almost one year ago.

596
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,784
Was a guy in accounting...

597
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,005
And he was working late
and I was working late...

598
00:44:26,084 --> 00:44:28,719
And had no one in the building.

599
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,485
It was not planned.

600
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,654
He not even know I was there...

601
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,539
He came to leave a cost reporting...

602
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,391
So be there by morning.

603
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:40,976
2 And we were working very hard for days.

604
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,016
I do not know what happened.

605
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,916
I had never been attracted to him before.

606
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,491
We have not said anything to each other.

607
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,984
Was something,
something in the air, I do not know...

608
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:06,549
For more ridiculous it seems.

609
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,605
I think...

610
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:16,530
My biggest regret is knowing
how much it hurt Chris...

611
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,630
If he found out.

612
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,912
Why are you looking at me like that?

613
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,565
Well, almost a year.

614
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,928
No, I menstruei one week later.

615
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,531
E pregnant two weeks after that.

616
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,711
Do you think I'm the devil.

617
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,921
No, I think.

618
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,892
Why keeps looking at me like that?

619
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,058
Well, it's just that...

620
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:15,739
If I had done
a list of people who never betrayed...

621
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,049
You would be on top of it.

622
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,248
Do you think all this fear
you're feeling tonight...

623
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,813
Is actually about that night?

624
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,472
No, I... I is now considering?

625
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:33,572
I can not help.

626
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:43,001
You are assuming that since you
betrayed him, he will betray you?

627
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,667
No, I do not know.

628
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:52,213
I do not know if I have more fear
he betray me, betray me than not.

629
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,895
I think my biggest problem is...

630
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:57,865
I need to figure out if I less like who I am...

631
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:01,195
Before discovering what I really want.

632
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,659
Understood.

633
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,029
Got it?

634
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,651
You'll have a baby...

635
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,831
And what you want
not come in 1st place for long.

636
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:28,634
Sorry, is how it happens.

637
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,381
I know.

638
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:41,555
You know, marriage has many rules
that confuse people.

639
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,545
Instead,
pay more attention to the rules...

640
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:45,312
Rather than how they feel...

641
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:48,065
And what they want for
themselves and for the other.

642
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,901
They forget the relationship
and before they realize...

643
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,221
Temptation begins to circle, and they
not even know why.

644
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:56,290
Why is not in the rulebook.

645
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,110
Seems is a place I've ever been.

646
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,628
I have never been married.

647
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:04,515
I know, but you went through some
thing that inspired this statement.

648
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:08,969
Partly, but not as much as
I've seen people passing by.

649
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,805
I have two friends who are now divorcing.

650
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:13,905
I'm sorry.

651
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,124
It's a shame.

652
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,962
Kevin is with his wife 16 years ago...

653
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,032
And my other friends have
been together for 23.

654
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,568
And you are a friend of
the husband and wife?

655
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,588
You think you know someone
and 20 years later...

656
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:29,923
Discovers that they have a hand
has ever known.

657
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:32,023
Or maybe they knew.

658
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:36,046
Until one day, suddenly,
everything was different...

659
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,182
And now everyone is fighting.

660
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,917
Oh, I'm sorry.

661
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,653
Is not what you feel.
- Well, it's sad.

662
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:47,768
Oh, yeah. I heard the wedding of two sides.
I've seen a lot.

663
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,445
Both are not allowed to have their chances.

664
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:54,435
I did not say that.
- But you said.

665
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,196
No. At the time of my life...

666
00:48:57,273 --> 00:49:00,254
I know what I want and what I do not want
. Like you said.

667
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,354
Have you been betrayed?

668
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,842
Yes.

669
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,942
More than once?

670
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,445
And have you ever cheated?

671
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,601
Yes.

672
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,788
I did things in my life
that are not very commendable...

673
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,373
And I'm not proud of it.

674
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:23,383
But I also do not deny.
It was all in the past.

675
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,461
It?
- Yes it is.

676
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,999
Well, why do it?

677
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,487
Why have I been unfaithful?

678
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:36,974
I will not talk about it,
no longer matters.

679
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,676
You learn from life and simply move on.

680
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,595
I'm not sure that you followed.

681
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,730
Can be as you see.

682
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,718
It is your decision how much of my past
matter to you.

683
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,793
There is nothing I can do about it.

684
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,355
Are you worried about mine?

685
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,433
Why not?
- Are behind you.

686
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,857
I will not worry who you were.

687
00:50:10,957 --> 00:50:13,827
I'm wondering who you
is now sitting around this table.

688
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:18,092
With you, it seems that nobody
really know anyone.

689
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,615
Not completely, but I like it.

690
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,241
I have not done
the best choices in my life...

691
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:31,146
But I learned from those who did.

692
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,464
I'm starting to see...

693
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,720
That in his experience,
betray women...

694
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,489
And things tend to go a certain way.

695
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:45,309
So I think you should
know who you're dealing with now.

696
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,628
I never cheated in my life,
it never occurred to me.

697
00:50:48,728 --> 00:50:50,330
I never will.

698
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,449
When I'm in a good relationship...

699
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,469
Is fully satisfactory and if I'm in a bad...

700
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:59,606
I spend my energy trying to fix
, or trying cairfora.

701
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:03,076
And frankly, I do not know
how anyone gets a case...

702
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:05,212
Maybe I'm too selfish with my time...

703
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,797
But I do not know if he had time for one.

704
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,708
What is it? Do not believe me?
- I said nothing.

705
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,476
Not needed.

706
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,296
Listen, I can not be on Planet
so long as you...

707
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:25,099
But have experienced my share of silly...

708
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,934
And I'm not interested in a
relationship that involves it.

709
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,670
I'll contartudo you want to know about me...

710
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,541
Because lying is just another silly
and life is too short.

711
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,176
You are an honorable woman.

712
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:39,846
I know. Not everyone who
know me like me...

713
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,282
But nobody can accuse me of
not to say things as they are...

714
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:43,649
And if I quisertransar with someone else...

715
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:45,586
I'll come and say that
not want anything more to you...

716
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:49,086
And I'll go ahead with the I want to do.

717
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:52,726
Not that I imagine it happening.

718
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:57,180
God, I do not want to be with someone
do not want to be with me.

719
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,832
Not afraid to be alone...

720
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:01,868
And I prefer going through the
disappointment and rejection...

721
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:03,738
And move on,
than being deceived...

722
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,307
Because the disappointment is what
actually destroys the person.

723
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:09,876
I can never stay with you...

724
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:12,813
The break does not hurt
as much as the damage...

725
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:15,899
Caused by the faith of a person
on their own judgment.

726
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,999
I know.
- I'm leaving...

727
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,050
Me too.

728
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,571
Oh, my God.
- I will not be...

729
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:34,034
As a Cowboy Made to be free.

730
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:36,069
There is nothing that I do not.

731
00:52:36,169 --> 00:52:38,805
Not my way not me.

732
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,141
I'll never forget.

733
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,557
I know you moved.

734
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,528
Like a cowboy walks alone What.

735
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,102
Baby, continue.

736
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:59,892
Like a cowboy Made to be free.

737
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:01,862
There is nothing that I do not.

738
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:03,962
Not my way not me.

739
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,439
Oh, no.
- I'll never forget.

740
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:12,189
It's not the guy What does the
...- Commercial Company Super Star.

741
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,289
Know him?
- Yes.

742
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,659
Andy.

743
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,461
Hi, tree.

744
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,995
I'll never forget.
- Andy...

745
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,163
I know you went ahead.

746
00:53:22,256 --> 00:53:25,532
Hey, man of the mattress.
- Chris.

747
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,070
Hey, man, how are you?

748
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,594
You were born to wander through the land.

749
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:35,695
Andy.

750
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:40,512
My heart cries But I understand.

751
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,717
Andy.

752
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,182
Hi, Jude, what's cooking?

753
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,825
Do not live here any more.

754
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,789
You changed one month ago, remember?

755
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,534
Oh, yeah.

756
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,902
Well, it's good to see you guys.

757
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,948
Like a cowboy.
- Andy.

758
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,051
Yes, Jude.

759
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,346
I think you should go.

760
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,188
I will.

761
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,528
Okay.

762
00:54:27,613 --> 00:54:29,929
Be careful, okay?

763
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,667
Okay.

764
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:39,574
Like a cowboy Made to be free.

765
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,236
What?
- He's with the clothes...

766
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:51,438
I'll masturbate, and relax...

767
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,107
So no one sees why I'm dressed in a robe.

768
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,442
I did not need to know.

769
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,378
Well, I bet Celia not have one of these.

770
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:59,478
She does not need one.

771
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,282
You know, I think that the most important...

772
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,083
Is know what you really want...

773
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:39,903
And be honest about it,
so nobody gets confused.

774
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,438
Yes.

775
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:46,298
And knowing that you
all large, and falls into the music.

776
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,061
Will get screwed.

777
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:50,464
You know, you are very botininha
when he says 'will get screwed.'

778
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:56,259
No, seriously, if you could have
anything in life, what would it be?

779
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,156
I do not know, this is a big question.

780
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,486
This is why have more than one answer.

781
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,325
Has a list?
- Why not?

782
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,384
Well, obviously I want to be writer.

783
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:14,232
Writer you.
- A paid writer.

784
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,423
If I could support myself...

785
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:19,326
And so wanted to write, instead
to organize it around...

786
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:21,745
My journey 14 hours of work, that
would be something beautiful.

787
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,180
And the world would know his work.

788
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,882
I think so.

789
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,982
Do you?

790
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,144
I know. I mean...

791
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:34,240
I want to be successful and I want
people like my work...

792
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,910
But I do not think it will be...

793
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,088
Will give me more satisfaction.

794
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,884
Financially, it will be.
And the sense of accomplishment...

795
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,024
What is important to me.

796
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,335
But I think the best part
will always be the case.

797
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:56,502
Is always very difficult to get the 1st page.

798
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,932
I usually not know what I'll do.

799
00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:05,505
And then, I only get this
place, where there a snap...

800
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:07,607
And begins to flow from me...

801
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,510
Like you're in my head all the time...

802
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,077
And I have to put on paper once.

803
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,619
And it's great.
It's amazing, actually.

804
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,686
It's your Magic Hour.
- Yeah, I think it is.

805
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,955
You can not feel what you do...

806
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,691
When you put something on the page...

807
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:25,358
But when we read his work...

808
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:28,912
We experience
a thing exists only because of its process.

809
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,981
And thus we are also touched.

810
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,902
I like it, but I'd never sold anything.

811
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:39,046
But it will.
- Someday.

812
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,990
And what else?
- What else?

813
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,295
You want something else, right?
- It is.

814
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,829
E?
- What is it?

815
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,819
I never made a list...
What was it?

816
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:56,072
It's your list, how can I know?
- Well, I do not know.

817
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:59,972
Of course you know, are typical.
- How?

818
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,176
As a wedding.

819
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,464
That for me may or may not be.
- Children?

820
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,678
The same.
- The same?

821
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,819
It is the same. What else?

822
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,971
We could continue without having a son?

823
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,260
I won without even trying.

824
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:30,774
Yeah, I could go ahead without
a child, this surprise you?

825
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,459
Yes, most women...

826
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,327
I'm not most women.

827
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,744
I see. Will change your mind?

828
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,706
Maybe, maybe not.

829
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,971
In the right situation, I can
imagine myself being a mother...

830
00:58:44,071 --> 00:58:46,539
But only under certain circumstances.

831
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:48,639
You will have them.

832
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,145
Oh, they?
Now I'll have more than one?

833
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:53,730
Why not?

834
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,995
First, because the hormones
surely make you crazy.

835
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,432
And... And why...

836
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:06,459
Because I did not wake up...

837
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,329
A single morning in my life and thought...

838
00:59:08,429 --> 00:59:10,747
I'd really like to have a baby...

839
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,366
And I've never been
with the son of a friend and thought...

840
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,102
It would be great if I had one at home?

841
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:17,202
Not once.

842
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:22,442
Maybe my Biological Clock
has not started ticking yet.

843
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:26,197
I may not have one, I do not know. Maybe...

844
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,965
I wake up tomorrow and think...

845
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,282
'Today is the Day,' and then go
the Sperm Bank.

846
00:59:32,382 --> 00:59:35,505
Or call you and you scared as hell and say:

847
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:40,310
Hi, I want to have lunch with me and
maybe I then try to get pregnant?

848
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,996
I do not know, anything can happen.

849
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:48,848
But today, or now in this kitchen,
I'm not like 'Mom'.

850
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,354
And...

851
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:56,044
As any woman can think
children are the answer to life?

852
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,358
You know what?
You would be a great mom.

853
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:07,303
Well, I'm sure yes, but
that does not mean that I would be one.

854
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,739
And if it happened by accident?

855
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,159
I will not have an accident.
This is very old fashioned.

856
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:14,527
Happen.

857
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:17,347
Not really believe that, do you?

858
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,633
Happens.
- Oh no, not true.

859
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:24,003
Women are 10 times more than the
manipulative of its kind...

860
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:29,288
And when we have accidents
is because we are behind something.

861
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:35,588
Love, connection, security, money...

862
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,717
All these above.

863
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:40,153
But I will say, there are no accidents...

864
01:00:40,253 --> 01:00:44,163
Misleading
there are only women and men stupid.

865
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,293
I'm sorry, but I take pill since high school...

866
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,811
And it's not complicated.

867
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,407
You have children?
- Not that I know.

868
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,579
Well, that's a fair answer.

869
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,997
It is the only one I have.

870
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,423
Do you want children?

871
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,256
I am good with children.

872
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,317
Now I got you without even trying.

873
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:17,464
Yeah, got it.
- It is.

874
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,818
Okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

875
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,158
Have you ever cheated?

876
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,310
I will not have this conversation, Shel.

877
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,592
Sorry, I was just...
not know why I asked it.

878
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,017
Well, because if I betray...

879
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,552
You will use this to justify
her own infidelity...

880
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:52,942
And if I do not cheat, you will feel
the need to punish yourself even more.

881
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,581
You know, you never talk to
me about your relationship.

882
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,450
No.

883
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,550
Why?

884
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,705
Well, for starters, you're
friend of Celia and furthermore...

885
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,508
I do not like to talk to anyone
about our relationship.

886
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:11,498
Why? Do not think you should?
- No.

887
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,031
Why?

888
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,450
Why is our relationship...

889
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,518
And have our own way of doing things.

890
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:21,404
Because you're so confident and secure.

891
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,623
You know, that's what I need Chris.

892
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:25,725
No, that's what you need you.

893
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,327
It's not why I'm the way I am, I mean...

894
01:02:28,427 --> 01:02:30,427
Everyone is different.

895
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,400
You know, I'm glad helps you talk to me.

896
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,952
I really am.

897
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,639
But in the end, the only two people
in your relationship...

898
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:41,391
Are you and Chris.

899
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:45,061
No matter what I say
or what anyone else thinks.

900
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,246
You are the only people who really know...

901
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:52,361
What happens when the door closes
, and that's what matters.

902
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,359
So why know better than you two...

903
01:02:56,449 --> 01:02:59,424
I only see what you want me to see.

904
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:04,274
In many ways, I am sure that
do not know actually.

905
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,433
I hear would be a way for you to hear...

906
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,402
What you're thinking, aloud...

907
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:12,817
So you can sort out what you querfazer.

908
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:17,220
Like a relationship can be
simple if you let them.

909
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,265
Thank you.

910
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,584
You know, I'll always support you and Chris
...

911
01:03:24,684 --> 01:03:27,487
The decisions you make,
even though I like it or not.

912
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:30,335
Unless a crazy with a knife.

913
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,046
You are very good with that, I must confess
.

914
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:42,416
No, I just do not let me go.
So it is easy to have perspective.

915
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,730
Do you think I should tell him what I did?

916
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,698
With that guy?
- It is.

917
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:59,102
Well, is the man who wants to pursue?
- No.

918
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:01,220
Well, Chris does some idea?

919
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,723
I mean, there is some distrust
or some weirdness...

920
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:06,008
Hovering in the relationship?

921
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,108
No.

922
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,379
He used a condom?
- Oh, my God, yes.

923
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,536
Actually, he had a wallet...

924
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:18,588
What I found very convenient.

925
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,486
Men. Then clean?
- Yes.

926
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,084
And this baby is not it?

927
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,145
No.

928
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:29,687
What would be the reason to tell Chris?

929
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,632
Be honest.
- Nonsense.

930
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,387
What?

931
01:04:34,487 --> 01:04:36,455
You are always honest with him?

932
01:04:36,555 --> 01:04:41,033
Yes, very. I mean, that lie has silly, but...

933
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,829
This is not how to tell him...

934
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:45,164
I bought my bag
settlement when they bought it.

935
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:48,034
No, but...

936
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,304
Would be relieved to tell him?
- Yes.

937
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:53,523
Quertirar it off your chest?

938
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,513
Yes, it has haunted me a year ago.

939
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:00,733
And tell Chris make the relationship better?

940
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,851
Tell him you had sex with someone
a night...

941
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:07,553
Shortly before becoming pregnant baby
him, for no particular reason...

942
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,922
Portesão only and you were working late.

943
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,991
This would help the
relationship you have now...

944
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:14,641
To turn into something better?

945
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,316
So my punishment is having to live with it?

946
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,416
It.

947
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,022
And there is no need to punish lo.

948
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,657
No.

949
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,543
And if he finds out, I mean,
it would be much worse.

950
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:32,643
It would be humiliated.

951
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:37,133
Well, what are the chances of that?
- I do not know.

952
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,369
Well, it's been almost a year
and for those who told you?

953
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,469
You...

954
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:47,539
...just for me? Alright.

955
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:55,293
You have to do what he thinks is the best
, Shel.

956
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,439
But if you want the relationship
said he wants to...

957
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,793
I think you need stop living in the past...

958
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:08,823
And olhartodas the wonderful
things you have now, and soon.

959
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:13,815
Listen,
'm not saying that what you did is correct.

960
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:20,393
But everyone makes mistakes and
best thing you can do...

961
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:23,383
Is learn from it and leave behind.

962
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,146
Then you lie?

963
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,575
Everybody lies.

964
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,083
So what is your recipe?

965
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:36,256
For what?
- For the perfect relationship.

966
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,694
Oh, that.

967
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:43,849
1, I think the word 'Perfect' is a silly word...

968
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:46,868
Created by any writer ever.

969
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:51,960
And I'm sure he was drunk and
disappointed when it did.

970
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:58,407
E revenue relationship,
these are customized.

971
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,367
Ingredients are measured per person...

972
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:05,354
And then you have to figure
how to cook for yourself.

973
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,941
It's like cooking, is not it?
- It is just like cooking.

974
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,809
The quickest way to get
the heart of a man...

975
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:13,596
Is through his stomach, and
that of a woman too.

976
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,891
So what is your recipe?

977
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,399
My?

978
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,736
Or is it a secret?
- No.

979
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:26,325
I would say are two shares of realism...

980
01:07:26,425 --> 01:07:31,540
A part honesty, part
of fun, and a part of love.

981
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,700
And a pinch of
be able to look the other way...

982
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,370
When is the best for the relationship.

983
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,204
No one is perfect, Shel...

984
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:43,559
But you just have to figure out who
you want in the kitchen with you.

985
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,162
Well, this is very to find out.

986
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,262
Should be.

987
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:56,133
I travel a lot, but
kids travel well, and I'm not against it.

988
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,305
Why are you laughing?

989
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:02,795
You have a baby.
- When it happens, it happens.

990
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:04,531
If not, does not happen.
- Okay.

991
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:06,866
It's not something I'm planning.

992
01:08:06,966 --> 01:08:11,404
No, no, it would take more responsibility
emotional and mental...

993
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,504
Than an accident.

994
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,174
No.

995
01:08:15,274 --> 01:08:18,210
Okay, I'm just happy be responsible for...

996
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,779
Portomar the Pill...

997
01:08:19,879 --> 01:08:22,514
And believe me, I never forget.

998
01:08:22,573 --> 01:08:24,383
Do not look at me like that.

999
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:27,219
We are having this conversation because
you want to know more about me...

1000
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,804
Or because I want to
know more about you?

1001
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,173
What are you talking?

1002
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,351
Oh, I see.
- What do you understand?

1003
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,300
What you are well aware that
is in control of this conversation...

1004
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,187
And will stay that way
until I call you directly.

1005
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,287
Okay.

1006
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,857
Okay, what?

1007
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:55,024
You're worried, you have something
what you mean, what is it?

1008
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,701
None.

1009
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:12,480
Okay, what you want from life?

1010
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,701
I have everything I need life.

1011
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:19,653
'Want'. Whatever a relationship?

1012
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,741
What I want this relationship?

1013
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:26,829
In any relationship.
What do you think is important?

1014
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,929
Take advantage of lo.

1015
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,967
This is obvious.

1016
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:37,656
Well, it would be, but I think it is
forgotten most of the time.

1017
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,756
After a while.

1018
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,394
I am very happy with my life...

1019
01:09:42,494 --> 01:09:45,164
And I am very happy to accept
it the way it comes.

1020
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,333
How can do this with so many rules?

1021
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,302
Rules? I do not have rules.
- Oh, no?

1022
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:52,402
I have no actually.

1023
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:55,024
Open to all, but committed to anything.

1024
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,461
It has to do with commitment
commitment or not.

1025
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,212
It's about being involved...

1026
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:02,715
What you think which can be anything...

1027
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:05,317
Instead of
enjoy what it is and let that feeling...

1028
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,131
Take you where you want to go.

1029
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,709
This is a rule.
- This is freedom.

1030
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,628
Course. If you like handcuffs
with his freedom, I think it is.

1031
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:17,129
No.
- Yes.

1032
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:19,238
Why?
- Because...

1033
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:24,937
In your quest to be open,
you say 'No' to many things...

1034
01:10:25,037 --> 01:10:27,206
Before know what are the things you want.

1035
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,807
I know what I want.

1036
01:10:28,907 --> 01:10:32,027
Because of the experiences
they had in the past?

1037
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:33,078
Yes.

1038
01:10:33,178 --> 01:10:35,548
Okay. Not limiting their own freedom...

1039
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:39,133
If not explore new opportunities through?

1040
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,671
You know, you is a very good writer.

1041
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,323
I'm good devil's advocate.

1042
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:46,859
Ah, that too. You could have been a lawyer.

1043
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,275
I know. But, really...

1044
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,884
What do you think is more important
in a relationship?

1045
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,619
It depends on the relationship.

1046
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:01,340
It may sound simple, but a
simple relationship...

1047
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,576
Between two people...

1048
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,729
May be the best and hardest thing to do.

1049
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,131
Relationships are not simple.

1050
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,518
No. But enjoying life with your partner...

1051
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:14,763
Can be if you let it.

1052
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,958
It's making me all these questions
because you want an answer...

1053
01:11:19,058 --> 01:11:21,704
Or he has something to say?

1054
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:31,645
Okay.
What is more important to you?

1055
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,175
Honesty.

1056
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:38,523
Mutual respect.

1057
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,857
And similar taste in music.

1058
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,123
Music?
- Yes, it is very important.

1059
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,388
Okay.

1060
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:53,158
Been with someone who has a
completely different musical tastes?

1061
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:55,411
I think not, actually.
- See?

1062
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,721
I see nothing, except you.

1063
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,683
For you, this has been a problem.

1064
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,201
Absolutely.

1065
01:12:02,301 --> 01:12:06,466
And the relationship was not well?
- No. Not good.

1066
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:10,726
A week and a half together, he put a
Techno CD in the car.

1067
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:15,598
Io I should have dropped right there.
Nobody listens to techno.

1068
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,698
Do not have a soul.

1069
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,128
For you, no soul in Techno.

1070
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,290
To others, it defines soul.

1071
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,559
I know, has a multitude
you could argue that...

1072
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,512
And they could all go out
with each other. Not me.

1073
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,864
Do you like Techno?

1074
01:12:31,964 --> 01:12:36,068
No, but if I liked,
not we having fun yet?

1075
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:38,609
No. Not for long.

1076
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:43,442
Okay, complementary differences
enhance a relationship.

1077
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:45,752
Differences conflicting...

1078
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,381
Lead to commitments reluctant.

1079
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:52,401
It's just a matter of time
before the ship sink.

1080
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:56,666
E... difference is
musical 'Reluctant Compromise.'

1081
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,657
Sure, I know.

1082
01:12:58,757 --> 01:13:01,994
Do not look like much, that's why I got
'Mr Techno'.

1083
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:05,164
But if you think about all the times that
listening to music during the day...

1084
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:08,000
And then you think
half that time or even more...

1085
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,650
Is the music that you dislike.

1086
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,040
How about someone who
does not hear music?

1087
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,558
Oh, no. No.

1088
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,547
Sorry, there are some obstacles in the lane
lovers.

1089
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,647
Alameda lovers?

1090
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:27,759
Been in love?
- Yes, of course, and you?

1091
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,188
Yes, many times.

1092
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:33,425
But for you, now I think
which is a very broad question.

1093
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:36,171
What do you mean by love?

1094
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,697
Well, love...

1095
01:13:38,797 --> 01:13:40,366
Love, how?

1096
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:44,910
Love in its essence,
love with everything you do.

1097
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:49,212
That's it, that's the whole definition?
- Yes.

1098
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,894
I loved...

1099
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,398
But not always matter how much you love.

1100
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,087
What does this mean?

1101
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:06,597
Mean it does not always work.

1102
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:22,274
Have you been heartbroken?
- Oh, long ago, and you?

1103
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,753
Not exactly.

1104
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:29,808
I mean, I have loved enough...

1105
01:15:29,908 --> 01:15:33,308
But I do not think I committed enough...

1106
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,049
To experience a heart
broken, I do not think so.

1107
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:39,001
Why not?

1108
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,587
No conscious reason,
I just always went out with guys...

1109
01:15:41,687 --> 01:15:44,490
With whom knew not want to stay forever...

1110
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,509
Then when we finished up, it was good...

1111
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,669
And I was not so sad,
except myself.

1112
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:57,050
Portomar a bad decision?

1113
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:02,804
What seemed to be the right
decision at the moment?

1114
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:04,560
It.

1115
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,788
So may not have been a bad decision.

1116
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:09,648
I do not know.

1117
01:16:09,748 --> 01:16:13,078
You know, sometimes bad
decisions are taken...

1118
01:16:13,178 --> 01:16:14,303
...for good reason.

1119
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,973
Sometimes, but I did
more than a few times.

1120
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,832
But okay, now it's over.

1121
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,980
And found love again?
- Of course, and you?

1122
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,814
Yes I have.

1123
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,669
Sairfora could love?

1124
01:16:30,769 --> 01:16:33,415
Sure, anyone can sairfora love.

1125
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,459
Do you think you have some time
limit for this?

1126
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:42,319
I think the duration is different
for different people...

1127
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,918
But I do not think that love
is the most important part...

1128
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,018
A relationship.

1129
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,926
I love him, you know?
- I know.

1130
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:20,235
I can not imagine life without him
. It would be so much fun.

1131
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,372
Well, it looks like you made
the right choices then.

1132
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,202
Yeah, except for one.

1133
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,276
What?

1134
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:34,283
Have you noticed that the best
conversations happen in the kitchen?

1135
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:38,548
Ah, the satisfaction is the place
and distraction.

1136
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,692
Heart problem,
heart of the house.

1137
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,316
I love these guys.

1138
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,019
Cannoli.
- Cannoli.

1139
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:50,060
Fat and sugar.
- Thank God.

1140
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,334
Know what would be best?
- What?

1141
01:17:53,426 --> 01:17:55,426
A lover in bed.

1142
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,611
So, will give him.

1143
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,281
Okay.

1144
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,949
In more ways than one.

1145
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,254
Passion?

1146
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,670
It's amazing, but this
comes and goes, is not it?

1147
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,016
I do not believe
would be willing to live your life...

1148
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,384
With someone was not in love.

1149
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:28,270
I will not say that love is not a factor.

1150
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,656
We love people with whom we spend time...

1151
01:18:30,756 --> 01:18:31,658
One way or another.

1152
01:18:31,758 --> 01:18:34,159
Otherwise, you will not
spend time with them.

1153
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:37,329
But being in love, being in that
Rollercoaster...

1154
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:39,214
What people want so much...

1155
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:44,286
This is a different kind of love,
and that kind of amortermina.

1156
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,138
Sometimes, perhaps.

1157
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:49,157
No, I think always,
all the time.

1158
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,986
No, you can have two.

1159
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,913
There is nothing wrong with that, but...

1160
01:18:54,013 --> 01:18:57,165
Ride a Rollercoaster not last 50 years.

1161
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,835
There are other things to do... Many other.

1162
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,486
What things?

1163
01:19:01,586 --> 01:19:05,131
Type companionship, good conversation...

1164
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:09,573
Laugh, caring, understanding...

1165
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,842
Consistency, confidence.

1166
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,759
This does not seem so bad.

1167
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,188
I think it looks good, in fact.

1168
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,668
I'll have to agree with you.

1169
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,949
What about tomorrow?

1170
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,154
Tomorrow?

1171
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:56,249
Vai feel the same thing
about all this tomorrow?

1172
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:01,094
Maybe, maybe not. And you?

1173
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,028
I do not know. But...

1174
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,929
I have a request.

1175
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:11,128
What is it?
- Do not break my heart.

1176
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,645
I never want to break your heart.

1177
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,811
Good, because you can.

1178
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,762
St. 2:30 am.
- Oh, no. Bed.

1179
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:05,938
Bed.

1180
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:12,604
'Between Wine & Lovers'...

1181
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,767
Is a good name for a story.

1182
01:24:15,867 --> 01:24:18,285
It?
- Should write it.

1183
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,387
Okay. And it would be about?

1184
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,797
Oh, I do not know.
You will create something.

1185
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:30,582
The Moon in the sky fills
His eyes like a big pizza.

1186
01:24:30,682 --> 01:24:32,417
It is love...

1187
01:24:32,517 --> 01:24:34,517
...love is.

1188
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,771
Like this music?
- Taste.

1189
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:42,001
Well, we have a chance then.

1190
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,663
Bells will ring Ting-a-ling-a-ling,
ting-a-ling-a-ling.

1191
01:24:45,763 --> 01:24:46,965
And you will sing...

1192
01:24:47,065 --> 01:24:49,381
...bella Vita - Vita bella.

1193
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:52,837
The Moon in the sky Fill your eyes.

1194
01:24:52,937 --> 01:24:55,412
Like a big pizza And love...
