He was right there.

173
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,368
I was crying with happiness.

174
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,443
- Oh, erm...
- Sorry.

175
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,724
Ryan. 37.

176
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,370
Nancy. 34.

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,807
Sorry, my hand's a bit wet.
It's not wee.

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,962
- Right.
- It's mojito.

179
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,883
I mean, I didn't think it was wee.

180
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,521
Why would it be wee? That would imply
very poor personal hygiene.

181
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,762
I mean, I don't wipe with my hand.

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,043
I use toilet paper
just like everyone else does.

183
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,885
- Well, that's a relief.
- Hm.

184
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,407
So is wee in a way,
if you think about it.

185

- Yeah, that would be great. Yeah.

190
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,766
- Let me get these.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

191
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,888
- No, it's alright.
- No, no, seriously.

192
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,531
- OK, you can get them.
- You get them?

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,685
- I'll get them, shall I?
- Great, cheers. Thank you.

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,011
Ah... Busted.

195
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,765
You've got a picture of your ex
in the old wallet.

196
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,729
Oh, no, that's my sister.

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,806
Oh. She's very pretty.
I bet she gets all "ze boyz".

198
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,443
She's dead.

199
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,211
Wow. It's going so well.

200
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,930
No, Elaine, I've got pictures

- Well, it's good that you went.
- Why is it good?

204
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,761
It's just so excruciating
and predictable, just as it always is.

205
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,447
I'm just gonna let my vagina
hermetically seal up.

206

<i>- Yeah, well, that will really help.
- Never hurt Barbie.</i>

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,081

208

And a boyfriend.

209
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,524
Is she still with that guy?
Such a fake smile.

- Get your arse over here pronto.

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,049
We have a lot of nibbles
to put into a lot of bowls.

213
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,122
About two hours.

I've got a rough draft.

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,250
You haven't. You've done
a lot of doodles and crossing out.

223
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,607
- I mean, as if.
- Come on.

224
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,648
You know Dad loves it
when you do a speech.

225
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,564
So it needs to be good and special.
OK?

226
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Fine.

227
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,291
<i>- Oh, and Nancy?
-Yeah'?</i>

Don't seal up just yet.
It'll happen. I promise.

Yeah, yeah. Fuck off.

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,921
Oh.

Sorry.

235
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,645
I couldn't help overhearing.

236
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,088
You should really think about
reading this.

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,162
Right. Right, right, right, right.

238
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,760
- Did it, then?
- Did it what?

239
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,411
- Change your life.
- Oh, erm...

240
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,524
- Maybe. Yeah.
- But maybe not as well?

241
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,889
Well, I like to give everything a go,
because otherwise what's the point?

242
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,921
You've got to hope it's going to work.
Because what is life without hope?

243
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,281
- Death.
- Death it is, then.

244
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,125
(laughs)
You see, you do need to read it.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,522
I would lend you my copy
but I need it for my date.

246
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,525
- Why do you need a book for a date?
- It's how we'll recognise each other.

247
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,410
Oh, it's a setup? They always work.

248
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,366
They often work if the matchmaker
has done their homework.

249
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,365
All successful relationships are based
on whether you're both outdoorsy...

250
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,885
- Read it.
- Don't need to.

251
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,167
- It was a best seller.
- So was The Da <i>Vinci</i> Code.

252
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,005
- Another excellent book.
- Not an excellent book.

253
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,845
- I think it's what you need.
- Why does everyone tell me that?

254
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,400
If they're always telling you,
you should listen.

255
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,763
I think you need to shh.
You need to shh your mouth.

256
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,887
- You want me to shh?
- I do, yeah. It would be great.

257
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,849
- I'm only suggest...
- It's time.

258
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,048

269
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,927
Somebody threw themselves
on the track again.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,526
I don't blame them,
there's so many delays. (laughs)

271
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,047
Hey, what a great way for us to
recognise each other. What a great idea.

272
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,841
Although I think it would have been hard
to miss you under that huge clock.

273
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,046
No, no, no...

274
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,203
What do we do in terms of saying hello?
I never know where to pitch it.

275
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,362
Is it a handshake? ls it a hug?
ls it formal?

276
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,728
You know what, we're adults.
Let's just go in... Too soon for that?

277
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,848
- Hello, there.
- (phone rings)

278
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,129
Oh, my God, that's not your
emergency exit phone call already?

279
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,602
I haven't had a chance
to use any of my best lines yet.

280
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,762
That wasn't one of them,
if you were worried.

281
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,524
Listen, I'll handle this, madam.

282
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,285
Hello, caller. Yes, we have met.

283
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,091
I am not a complete psychopath
and we've really hit it off.

284
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,004
She will call you later
with all the gory details.

285
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,765
So thank you for calling and goodbye.
There, done.

286
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,084
Alright! So, book, check.
And clock, check.

287
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,084
And blind date. Check!

288
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,042
Usually in this situation I would say
something and you'd say something back.

289
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,124
And then we'd talk about what we're
gonna do and exchange ideas.

290
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,646
You know, sort of
"quid pro quo, Clarice".

291
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,203
<i>(laughs)</i>

292
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,409
In hindsight, that wasn't the best
impression to do on a first date

293
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,570
because it... it brings to mind...
Anyway, I'm talking a lot

294
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,371
and I know you can sense it.
So I'm gonna just keep going

295
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,930
and I'm gonna start the bidding

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,083
with a drink on London's
fashionable South Bank.

297
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,403
So, as the book says,
what are you waiting for?

298
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,722
I am waiting for you.

299
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,971
- Good. Good.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,169
OK. Shall we...? After you, my lady.

301
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,764
- I'm not a knight.
- (laughs)

302
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,320
(man) Yeah, let's do it.
We'll go out this way...

303
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,685
What do you think?
Good stuff for the first few hours?

304
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,127
Descending in quality as we do.

305
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,249
I'd go quality and quantity, Bert.
It's a massive night.

306
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,403
You're right. We bloody deserve it.

307
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,443
Let's go mental.

308
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,007
Seriously, you do deserve it.
I don't know how you've done it.

309
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,402
Not that I don't intend to go
the whole distance myself, obviously.

310
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,842
I think the trick is, get through
the first 30, 40 years,

311
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,720
then just kind of give up.
From that point on it's a breeze.

312
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,802
- No, I mean it.
- How are we getting on?

313
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,087
- We are nailing it.
- That's great.

314
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
You can put about
half those lagers back, Adam.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,882
What does Nancy want to drink?

316
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,281
- I'm not sure if...
- (Bert) She wants vodka.

317
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,443
The only spirit she can out-drink me on.
We'll see about that later.

318
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,721
No, we won't.

319
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,327
Guys, she didn't even answer the phone.
Some man did. I think she's on a date.

320
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,971
The man from last night?
I thought that didn't work out.

321
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,849
It didn't. It was a disaster.

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,810
- He was in love with his sister.
- Who answered the phone, then?

323
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,406
Dad, I don't know.
He said he wasn't a psychopath.

324
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,568
Well, that sounds encouraging.

325
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,167
We're having a party. She's on a date.
I'm thinking she's gonna bring him.

326
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,322
- Bert!
- If he's not a psychopath.

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,290
Did he sound like a wine drinker
or more of a beer man?

328
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,441
<i>(mother) Bert!</i>

329
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
- I'm just getting some more wine.
- Course you are.

330
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,726
The good host is prepared
for all eventualities.

331
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,768
Come on, Pattersons, clock's ticking.

332
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,161
Fran, you walk straight past that offer.

333
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,721
So, what's going on? ls Nancy OK?

334
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,804
Yes. Yes, Mum, she's fine. She's just...

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,121
- He's looking forward to her speech.
- I know.

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,044
- So she is coming?
- Yes, of course she's coming.

337
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,363
Look, do you want me to write
a few words? You know, just in case.

338
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,088
Not really, darling, no.

339
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,243
Oh, God. That is horrible.

340
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,765
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,049
- I'll give her a call, then.
- Yes, please do, darling.

342
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,210
(Nancy's date) Ah...

343
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,881
<i>(he breathes deeply)</i>

344
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,687
- You OK? You seem a bit freaked out.
- Do I?

345
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,886
- Yeah.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

346
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,089
Gosh. Sorry, just bit of
a first-date no-no...

347
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,811
- (phone rings)
- Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.

348
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,008
- Oh, it's Tom.
- Oh.

349
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,241
Hey,buddy.

350
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,566
Yeah, I'm here. I'm with Jessica.

351
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,768
Yeah, we're on the South Bank.

352
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,366
Yeah, d'you wanna speak to her?
Alright.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,411
We will.

354
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,129
Yeah. OK, Tom.
Yeah, I'm gonna hang up now.

355
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,884
Yeah, OK. Bye. Bye.

356
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,725
- He thought we hadn't met up.
- As if.

357
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,043
- Shall we switch these things off?
- Yeah. OK, good.

358
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,445
Right. So, Jessica.

359
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,800
So...

360
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,805
- Tom says that you work in the City.
- I do, yeah. That's what I do.

361
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,611
- Is that a stressful job?
- Ah, no.

362
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,001
- "Lunch is for wimps."
- <i>(both</i> laugh)

363
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,081
Sorry.

364
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,208
- No, no, it's from Wall Street.
- Yeah.

365
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,443
"If you need a friend, get a dog."
I love that movie.

366
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,006
- You do?
- Yeah, it's one of my favourites.

367
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,323
- And you are a...?
- I'm an online marketing manager.

368
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,529
I love online marketing managing.

369
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,246
What I really wanna do is paint.

370
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,891
I don't wanna be an online
marketing manager forever

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,203
because, you know,
the bots are taking over!

372
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,727
They're gonna be managing
all the marketing in the future.

373
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,124
- It's like "help".
- Exactly, yeah. Erm...

374
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,248
- I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
- Really?

375
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,451
Yeah. A little bit. Just a little bit.
I'm not used to all this dating chat.

376
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,804
Although, you know, I had a few
reservations about today,

377
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,770
but I just thought,
"You know what, Jack? I trust Tom."

378
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,890
He's not gonna set me up with somebody
who I've nothing in common with.

379
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,041
- And he's a good friend, right?
- Who, Tom?

380
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'd take a bullet for him.

381
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,567
Yeah. So, shall we
get a beer or something?

382
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,450
- There's one of those pop-up bars.
- Sure, that'll be great.

383
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,245
They appear out of nowhere,
then they're gone the next day.

384
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,881
This can't be our favourite place
because it'll be gone in the morning.

385
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,043
- Can we get two Red Stripes?
- That'd be great.

386
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,724
- So...
- So...

387
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,883
Where are you on the old, you know,
the relationship...

388
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,689
the spectrum of relationships?

389
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,049
- It's my mime for relationships.
- That's good. Right.

390
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,851
Well, I guess long-term-wise it's...

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,843
It's been a while.

392
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,605
- Since Pete, right?
- Since Pete.

393
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,125
Tom told me. Massive cock.

394
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,247
- Really?
- Huge.

395
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,243
- It wasn't that big...
- What he did to you.

396
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,606
- ...a deal.
- Unforgivable.

397
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,921
I know how it feels.
I had it done to me, you know.

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,571
- Affairs, eh? Who'd have them?
- Yeah...

399
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
- They would.
- They would.

400
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,440
The other people would.

401
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,291
So where are you on the... spectrum?

402
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,046
On the spectrum? I think recently,
I've had a few one-night stands.

403
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,647
You know, just girls I've met at work

404
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,405
and in bars and just, like,
on the street.

405
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,041
But this is my first real date really
since the D-word.

406
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,081
- Dead sister?
- Sorry?

407
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,970
Just something I say before I drink.
Dead sister.

408
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,166
Dead sister.

409
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,722
But I'm not gonna let a failed marriage
put me off relationships for good.

410
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,211
Divorce.

411
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,931
You be thankful that
you and Pete didn't get hitched.

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,766
It gets a lot more complicated when you
have to figure out who gets the flat.

413
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,285
Winner.

414
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,242
- I did.
- Yeah.

415
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,761
I got big home-improvement plans.
I'm gonna do up our... my flat.

416
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,922
Paint the hallways, bleach the sheets.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,049
Anyway, let's not talk about that.
It's just bad juju.

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,407
- And I'm so over it.
- You really sound it.

419
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,081
It's <i>in</i> the past. What does <i>it</i> say
<i>in</i> Six Billion People and You?

420
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,891
- F... Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past, yeah.

421
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,964
If that book has taught me anything,
it's taught me that.

422
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,407
So, Tom says you're a triathlete.

423
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,121
- Hm-hmm.
- Do you have to train a lot for that?

424
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,931
Yeah, I've just got
to regularly carb up.

425
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,331
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

426
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,529
Go on then. I don't mind.
I've actually worked out today...

427
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,571
I work out every day.
I like to keep fit. I pump iron, sure.

428
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

429
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,286
This is nice, isn't it? I don't envy
any of my friends with kids.

430
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,806
Are they here now? Hell, no.

431
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,327
They're at home lying in wait
for the next nappy change.

432
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,686
Not that I don't want kids.

433
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,048
I'm 40. They're not gonna be swimming
in the right direction forever.

434
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,966
But just not right now. I should
probably get a girlfriend first.

435
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,728
I definitely want kids. I'm just not
freaking out about it yet.

436
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,406
I mean, why would you? You're 24.

437
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,807
D'you wanna get out of here?
It is fucking freezing

438
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,202
and I know a really fun place
just over the river.

439
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,285
We can get shots and maybe hang out
a bit more if you feel like it.

440
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,764
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.

441
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,047
- (Jack) This is gonna be fun.
- (Nancy) Yeah. What is it?

442
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,884
(Jack) It's like a cantina.

443
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,804
It's a bit cheesy
but you can have slammers and...

444
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,529
<i>oh, wow. Arriba!</i>

445
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,210
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

446
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,526
- Are you a regular here?
- Well, define "regular". What is it?

447
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,887
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Helen, how's it going?

448
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,007
Oh, so you...

449
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,241
Ah! Snap.

450
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,163
- We're swapping, right?
- Swapping?

451
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,926
For the genius Six Billion Ways to get
to know you list that you suggested.

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,571
Is that your one?
Mine's at the front. OK...

453
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,211
<i>- (she clears her throat)
-</i> Hm...

454
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,931
Let's have a look, shall we?
OK, then.

455
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,368
Shall I read yours first?
"Put yourself out there."

456
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,251
"Take chances."

457
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,290
- "Black pant wash."
- It's a band.

458
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,207
- Are they new?
- Yeah, they're new.

459
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,727
They're... They're fresh. Very young.
They're my favourite band.

460
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,451
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're very, er, funky.

461
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,561
"Get stronger thighs."

462
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,201
Hey, this is spooky.
I also love spaghetti bolognese.

463
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,009
What are the chances of that?

464
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,402
- Like none chances.
- I know. That's the lists done.

465
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,090
- Yeah!
- And didn't they go well?

466
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,924
- Really great.
- That was...

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,731
- (Nancy) Look, let me get this.
- No, I should get it.

468
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,167
- Please, let me.
- OK. I'll get the next ones.

469
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,005
- Oh, my God. Who are they?
- Who, what?

470
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,290
- These guys.
- Oh, this is Slash and Axl.

471
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,691
Oh.

472
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,285
Paradise Kitties.

473
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,248
- I blew it, sorry. That was no good.
- Er...

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,369
Jack. I've got a confession to make
and I'm just gonna...

475
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,522
- So have I.
- "come out with it. You have?

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,968
- I have, yeah. Let me go first. I...
- OK.

477
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,883
I've never heard of Black Pant Wash.

478
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,401
I'm sorry. I wanna be honest with you,
because honesty is very important...

479
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,567
Yes, I agree.

480
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,042
These lists are great
and they're a brilliant ice-breaker,

481
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,761
but you don't really believe that
just because we both like spag bol,

482
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,650
we're gonna wind up together
forever, right?

483
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,167
- Depends on the spag bol.
- Might be a really good spag bol.

484
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,086
But right now, whatever happens tonight,
wherever we end up,

485
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm having a really good time
getting to know you.

486
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,250
And you're being really patient with me,
so thank you for that.

487
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,243
And I don't know why I brought you here.

488
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,891
It was a stupid idea
and I think we should...

489
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,611
Let's do something different.
Let's go someplace else.

490
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,241
- Tom said you liked bowling.
- I love bowling.

491
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,767
OK, so shall we have a couple more
and then hit the lanes?

492
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,081
C)I(-

I gave you that Valentine's card
in Year 9.

515
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,763
You tore it up in front of everyone.

516

- Oh, God, don't worry.

519
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,850
Glued it back together.
It was only about 57 pieces.

- Yeah, I went on the 5:2 diet.

525
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,043
Five days on chocolate Nesquik.
and two days strawberry Nesquik.

526

But luckily not from here.

OK, cheers.

536

- What? No.

537
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,931
- Not at all, no.
- I was, like, "Whoa, competition."

538
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,651
No, I wasn't. I'm the least jealous
person you'll meet.

539
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,210
Oh, God, me, too, yeah.

540
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,327
So,

541

543
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,451
(Sean) Nancy.

544
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,083
Brought you some nachos. On the house.

545
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,527

548
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,449
- What is it? Where'd you get that?
- In my wallet.

549
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,449
- Who took it?
- I did.

550
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,847
I don't remember you ever
being in my bedroom.

551
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,447
I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.
I was outside. In a tree.

552
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,166
- Jessica, watch and weep.
- (Nancy) OK.

553
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,370
Why is he calling you Jessica?
You're called Nancy.

554
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,330
- You're Nancy Patterson.
- I'm in a bit of a situation here.

555
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,085
(sniffs)
Oh, you still use Pantene Pro-V.

556
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,130
That guy is not my boyfriend.
He's actually not even my date.

557
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,124
I sort of stole him from
underneath the clock at Waterloo

558
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,329
and I'm pretending to be the girl
he's supposed to be on a date with.

559
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,687
- So it's a bit... I don't know.
- Kinky.

560
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,410
(Jack) Hey, there.

561
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,967
- How's it going? I'm Jack.
- And I am Sean.

562
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,963
- He's Sean.
- There it is.

563
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,601
- So you guys know each other?
- We just went to school together.

564
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,287
- Yeah, we're old friends.
- We're old, old friends.

565
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,170
We used to have a bit of a thing
going on.

566
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,844
- Good for you.
- It was.

567
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,604
It really wasn't that good.

568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,330
You never forget your first.

569
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,687
Lovely to see you
after all these years.

570
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,684
- We'll take it from here.
- (Sean) Hang on, Jessica.

571
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,922
Hey. What are you doing?

572
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,891
It would appear that I finally have you
over a barrel, Nancy Patterson.

573
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,282
Indeed, you are clearly not the girl
you used to be once.

574
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,321
Cool and confident. Now, stealing other
women's dates from under clocks.

575
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,131
You're working as a barman
in a novelty bowling alley so...

576
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,567
- Just as Mr Armstrong predicted.
- Who's that?

577
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,928
Our careers advisor at Saint Andrew's.
Do you not remember anything?

578
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,322
- No.
- Because I remember everything. Nancy!

579
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,201
Sean, I'm out bowling with a man who...
might actually have some potential

580
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,523
and not in just that
he's a really good bowler-type way.

581
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,251
So don't ruin it for me. Just be cool.

582
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,129
- OK, I will.
- Yeah?

583
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,807
- Uh-huh. If you give me a blow job.
- You what?

584
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,649
- Take it or leave it.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

585
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,769
Come on, wouldn't hurt.
Just a tiny little blow job.

586
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,046
<i>(smacks lips)</i>

587
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,762

web of deceit, Little Miss... Muffet.

588
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,731
- Not gonna give you a blow job, so...
- Hand job? Pearl necklace?

589
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,246
- Kiss? Please. Come on.
- Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

590
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,322
I just want to fulfill
a lifelong ambition.

591
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,131
OK, OK. I'll do one kiss. OK?

592
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,770
- With tongues?
- No tongues.

593
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,286
- Oh! But in the toilets.
- Yeah, in the toilets.

594
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,010
And it has to be tonight.

595
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,402
Otherwise I won't find you again
because you have no online presence.

596
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,726
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

597
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,451
- But I'll be watching you.
- I don't doubt that.

598

It's fine, they're fine.

600
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,243
Everyone'll just get drunk
and shove them down.

601
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,845
- They will.
- Yeah?

602
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,046
Look.

603
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,124
- Ooh, blimey, they're hot.
- Any word from Nancy?

604
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,202
Not... Not exactly.

605
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,044
(Fran) Oh, no. No, no.

606
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,920
But in her defence, she does have
a very good reason for her tardiness.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,128
And she's right, Fran.

608
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,604
And who knows, maybe today will end up
being not just our anniversary.

<i>(he whines)</i>

659
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,761
No, we said no tongues.
We said no... Hey!

660
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,330
(Jack) Jessica?

661
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,845
- Hey, man.
-Jack.

662
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,844
You'd been gone awhile
so I thought I'd come and find you.

663
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,844
- This is not what you think.
- I think I'm just gonna leave.

664
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,571
- No, wait. Please, let me explain.
- You don't have to.

665
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,803
I thought we had a connection
but you still have something for Sean.

666
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,406
I'm gonna leave you
to whatever fucking weird shit...

667
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,444
Jack,Jack,Jack.
Just slide it on down to chills-ville.

668
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,961
Don't be so harsh on Nancy.

669
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,327
Who's Nancy?
Why is he calling you Nancy?

670
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,847
- Why?
- It was my other pet name for her.

671
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,241
- After Nancy Reagan.
- Nancy Sinatra.

672
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
- I'm gonna go.
- OK, wait, hang on.

673
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,248
Wait, Jack, let me just tell you
the truth because...

674
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,448
now is as good a time as any
just to confess.

675
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,800
Confess what?

676
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,169
The reason Sean called me Nancy
was because I'm not called Jessica

677
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,926
and the reason I'm not called Jessica
is because I'm not actually Jessica.

678
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,884
She's Nancy. She's Nancy Patterson.
(laughs)

679
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,407
Thank you, Sean. Can you put your
clothes back on and leave? Please.

680
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,205
- What about my kiss?
- Out. No. Jog on. Out!

681
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,770
Anyway, look, I was in here with him

682
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,322
because he said he wouldn't tell you
who I really was if I kissed him.

683
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,607
The truth is,
I'm not really your blind date.

684
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,207
You thought I was, what with the book,
the clock and the quid pro quo.

685
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,921
So you're not the girl
that I was supposed to meet earlier?

686
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,570
- No.
- What?!

687
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,405
I know! It sounds a bit mad.
But don't think of it as mad.

688
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,887
Think of it as impulsive.

689
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,042
What kind of person
stands underneath a clock

690
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,566
- waiting to steal someone's date?
- I wasn't waiting.

691
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,291
It's not stealing
in the conventional sense of the word.

692
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,091
That girl gave me her book
so that's why you thought I was her.

693
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,771
No, I thought you were her
because you said you were.

694
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,569
Did I actually say that?

695
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,769
When were you thinking of telling me
about this bizarre decision?

696
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,561
- There wasn't actually a plan.
- I'm sure there wasn't a plan.

697
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,610
Because who would have a plan
for something so fucked up?

698
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,411
I think people have done
worse things in the world.

699
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,161
- I'm racking my brains.
- That girl wasn't even right for you.

700
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,086
We'll never know. I'll never meet her
because you stole her.

701
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,243
I was merely trying to meet my mate
in the modern world.

702
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,847
- Who are you?
- I'm Nancy Patterson. Hello.

703
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,764
- Are you even a triathlete?
- That's the next thing you ask?

704
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,923
- And where's Jessica?
- Probably gone home by now.

705
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,844
- Past her bedtime.
- Are you even 24?

706
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,685
- Aw. Add another ten.
- What?

707
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,526
- Fuck you, Granddad.
- Not in six billion years.

708
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,887
- That was uncalled for.
- That was uncalled for?

709
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,849
- Yeah.
- Do you know what's uncalled for?

710
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,524
Derailing my date.

711
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,840
<i>- OK.
- (girls laugh)</i>

712
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,163
Laugh it up, girls. I am your future.
Just so you know.

713
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,322
<i>- (Jack) 34!
- (Nancy) 40:</i>

714
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,971
- I think you're overreacting a bit.
- Really?

715
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,724
- Yeah.
- How would you feel, Nancy,

716
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
if you'd been set up
with someone perfect for you

717
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,442
and some psycho
pretends to be them instead?

718
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,609
- Setups never work.
- Tom said we matched.

719
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,082
Please, she reads self-help books
and The Da <i>Vinci</i> Code.

720
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,640
She works in the City.
What does that even mean?

721
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,210
When people say that?

722
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,250
It means she is a high-flying
24-year-old businesswoman...

723
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,005
24. You love that word.
It's your favourite word.

724
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,764
Isn't that just the classic response

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,162
of the lonely 34-year-old woman
desperate for somewhere to put her eggs.

726
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,005
I'm nearly at my sexual peak.
It's all downhill for you.

727
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,287
Knock knock, who's there? Viagra!

728
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,964
The bitter look really suits you.

729
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,202
It doesn't surprise me
that Pete slept around.

730
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,681
Hang on a sec. Oh, oh, oh!
There is no Pete!

731
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,922
And there is no wife
because she left you.

732
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,924
Here's your theory. You think,
"I'm so wounded and rejected."

733
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,561
"Please, help me, younger woman,
who's nearly half my age."

734
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,530
This is coming from someone
who had to steal someone else's date

735
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,647
to even get one.

736
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,849
At least I'm not walking around
like I'm bloody catch of the century.

737
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,367
Look at me with my own flat
and my online marketing management job.

738
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,250
But what I really want to do is paint.

739
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,641
- I am gonna paint. OK?
- Sure you are.

740
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,530
Thank you very much, it was lovely
not getting to know you

741
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,649
and congratulations
on your massive pack of lies.

742
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,564
- Where's my bag?
- That was all there was on the ticket.

743
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,924
- Where's my bag?
- How should I know?

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,365
Why have I got your notepad?

745
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,762
Oh, f... Oh, my God,
we've left my bag at the cantina.

746
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,207
Your bag, not mine.
How many tequilas have you had?

747
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,647
- My divorce papers are in there.
- Ooh, sexy.

748
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,291
- I came from the lawyers, alright?
- Sexier.

749
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,842
Your divorce papers...
and my notepad with my speech!

750
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,922
(Jack) What speech?

751
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,890
It's my folks' 40th wedding anniversary
tonight.

752
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,806
It just gets better. Not only do you
steal somebody else's blind date,

753
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,441
you stand up your parents on one of the
most important milestones of their life.

754
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,042
You really, really need to consider
your motivations for doing things

755
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,884
and not doing things.

756
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,122
- I'm gonna get my speech.
- Whatever. Taxi!

757
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,602
- What are you doing?
- Calling a cab so I can go to the bar.

758
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,967
- It's a ten-minute walk.
- No, it's 20 minutes.

759
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,442
- It's ten minutes!
- You seem awfully confident, Nancy.

760
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,449
- Because it's a fact, Jack.
- It's a fact.

761
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
Is it a fact?
Like the fact that you're a triathlete.

762
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,088
- Great.
- Here's a good idea.

763
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,881
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the
bar and we'll see who gets there first?

764
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,531
- What?
- You don't know what a triathlon is.

765
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,011
- Yes, I do.
- You do, do you?

766
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,367
- Yeah.
- Well, ready, steady...

00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,651
- You could've just told me the truth.
- I know and I was going to,

822
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,291
I really was, but then...

823
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,520
..."Jessica" was doing so well.

824
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,126
(clears throat) One man-bag.

825
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,168
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

826
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,004
<i>(laughs)</i>

827
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,560
- What?
- Black Pant Wash.

828
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,170
Funky.

829
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,726
Idiot.

830
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,041
Idiot.

831
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,171
(Woman) Jack?

832
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,922
What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed.

833
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,286
What are you doing here?

834
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,567
- Hello, Jack.
- Fuck off, Ed.

835
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,928
I get this place between five and 10 pm
on a Saturday.

836
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,128
Sorry, I thought it was a Sunday.

837
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,044
I think we all know that you know
that it's not on a Sunday.

838
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,124
Oh, how I miss that
pissy little diary of yours.

839
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,283
Do you still put an "M" in it
when it's moustache-dyeing week?

840
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,365
He didn't know. Hey, this is Nancy,
by the way. My girlfriend.

841
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,562
Nancy, this is Hilary,
my soon-to-be ex-wife,

842
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,688
and Ed, the man she left me for.

843
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,446
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah, come on, silly me.

844
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,962
You know what? We're all in
the same bar with our new partners.

845
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,283
Let's have a drink together.
We're adults, aren't we?

846
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,966
We're mature, stable adults.

847
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,042
- Come on. Have you got a table?
- Yeah.

848
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,930
- Is it "our" table?
- Not any more.

849
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,048
Good! Even better. Lead the way.

850
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,920
- Oh, my God. What is happening?
- Just go with it, darling.

851
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,809
Just go with it, Edward.

852
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,322
Oh, my God. You knew they'd be here.
That's why you brought me here earlier.

853
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,803
That is why I brought "Jessica" here.
Then I came to my senses and we left.

854
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,611
- But then you left my bag here...
- You left your bag.

855
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,401
And then you came out of the toilets
looking like... Hmm...

856
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,569
I just thought people have done
worse things in the world

857
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,689
and you are very good at pretending
to be people that you're not.

858
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,366
And you owe me, Nancy.

859
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,726
<i>Hm.</i>

860
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,604
<i>(Hilary laughs)</i>

861
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,568
(sighs) OK. What exactly
are you hoping to achieve?

862
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,968
I believe they call it "closure".

863
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,967
<i>(loud conversation)</i>

864
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,602
Missed a call from Nancy. She's not
even gonna make it for the speeches.

865
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,967
What the fuck do you think she's doing?

866
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,726
- What you always tell her to do.
- But not the greatest night to pick.

867
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,087
But she's being spontaneous.

868
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,766
Be spontaneous
when there's nothing else planned.

869
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,444
Don't you think this is a bit...

870
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,086
I'm gonna see what's happened
before I pass judgement.

871
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,889
Are you? Well, good for you.

872
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,089
Jesus, when has she ever done
anything like this before?

873
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,004
- Well, never, but...
- Pardon, what was that?

874
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,206
Never.

875
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,841
She's out there, somewhere,
doing you proud, meeting a man.

876
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,208
Having a lovely time.
Just like when we first met.

877
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,126
- We met in a pub.
- But it was a lovely romantic pub.

878
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,163
It was a Yates's Wine Lodge.

879
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,164
Do you remember the first thing
you ever said to me?

880
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,249
- "Vodka and tonic, please."
- And I said?

881
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,449
"Pint or a half?"

882
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,083
What is the worst-case scenario?

883
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,006
- We never see her again.
- Alright, second worst?

884
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,088
<i>- (sighs)
- (chuckles)</i>

885
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,042
<i>Aw. (chuckles)</i>

886
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,530
- You hungry?
- No.

887
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,841
- Little snackette?
- No, don't need it.

888
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,160
(Hilary) So...

889
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,727
...how long have you two
been seeing each other?

890
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,962
- Not long.
- Not long at all.

891
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,451
(Ed) How did you meet?

892
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,800
- At work.
- At a party.

893
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,042
- At a work party.
- At a party that worked.

894
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,283
<i>- So you're in online marketing, too?
- (mimics childishly)</i>

895
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,081
No. I am a...

896
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,726
- "firewoman. I'm a firewoman.
- (scoffs)

897
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,849
- There was a fire.
- At his work party.

898
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,082
And then in our pants.

899
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,769
So, Hilary, what is it that you...
What do you do for a living?

900
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,842
I'm an account manager
at a leading PR firm.

901
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,445
Mind-blowing. And you, Ed?

902
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,608
- I'm a merchant banker.
- Interesting fact.

903
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,411
"Merchant banker" is
cockney rhyming slang for "wanker".

904
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,760
Oh, for fuck's sake, Jack.

905
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,002
It's a fact. I'm just saying.
I'm not lying.

906
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,048
- It's been a year.
- It's OK, Hil.

907
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,090
It's not the first time
I've heard that one.

908
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,004
- First time I've heard it.
- I'm unaffected by it, so...

909
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,608
And it's been more than a year,
actually, Hilary. It's been 368 days.

910
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,082
Not that I'm crossing it off on
my wall calendar of pain and deceit.

911
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,571
I need a piss.

912
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,169
Oh, fuck! Shit.

913
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,883
- Oh, shit.
- Hey...

914
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,402
Hey, don't worry, Baby Cakes. This was
bound to happen sooner or later.

915
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,323
He does this. It's kind of blackmail.

916
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,328
He's a very emotional man.

917
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,970
We're gonna need more nibbles, please.
So...

918
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,846
"question.

919
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,768
- You two had an affair?
- We fell in love.

920
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,763
Yeah, but you had an affair?

921
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,325
- The marriage was over anyway.
- But you had an affair?

922
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,245
- Yeah.
- I guess he is just an emotional man.

923
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,884
Look, I'm sorry, Hilary.

924
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,850
- The truth is...
- I missed you, Big Nuts.

925
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,160
<i>(kisses I laughs)</i>

926
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,086
So what rating
are you two rabbits on now?

927
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,130
- Rating?
- Yeah, sexually speaking?

928
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,204
Because Jack and I, God,
we're still in porno land really.

929
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,884
- (chokes)
- (Hilary) Porno land?

930
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,531
- Hm-hmm. Shall I explain?
- Please do.

931
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,649
OK. You know when a woman
first starts sleeping with a man,

932
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,051
she acts like a porn star.

933
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,009
Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.

934
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,527
Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath
the bridge, guided tour of site B,

935
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,170
if you know where that is. He knows.

936
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,528
Remember when you said we should
and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."

937
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,284
- You said, "Go on, try it."
- Did I?

938
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,160
And I was just thinking, "I'm actually
quite scared," because I couldn't see.

939
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,766
Then, God, you flipped it.
And all of a sudden...

940
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,571
God, I felt like, "Please don't stop."

941
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,645
"Jack, please don't stop. Don't stop,
Jack. Do what you do, Jack."

942
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,961
"Thank you, Jack.
I love your work, Jack."

943
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,965
And you lot are like, "Wow, our sex life
is always gonna be like a porn film."

944
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,362
Six months in, the ladies,
we drop it down to an 18,

945
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,001
and then a 15, maybe a quick 69
but only if we've just had a bath.

946
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,927
And then suddenly, whoa, we're a PG-13
wearing tartan pyjamas to bed

947
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,641
doing the goodnight rollover before
you can say "missionary position".

948
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,728
That is a brilliant theory.

949
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,407
Thank you. But do you know what, Jack?
I really feel

950
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,570
like we're gonna be in porno land
for a lot longer than usual.

951
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,451
- I have a theory, too.
- Yeah? What is it?

952
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,087
If you get a woman back to your place
and you say you don't wanna have sex,

953
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,882
you just wanna take it slowly,
I guarantee she will go down on you.

954
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,849
- The Blow Job Paradox.
- Blow Job Paradox!

955
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,083
- Yeah! "Use it, don't abuse it."
- If divorce papers were honest,

956
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,561
they wouldn't say
"irreconcilable differences".

957
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,325
- They'd say "not enough blow jobs".
- Not enough blowjobs!

958
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,528
Like, get down there, fix it.

959
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,446
Sorry to interrupt. Did you
get a chance to sign those papers?

960
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,367
Yes, I did, actually, Hilary. In fact,
coincidentally, I have them with me.

961
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,161
Although, stupid Jack,
I signed them with a pen.

962
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,210
You'd probably prefer it
if I did it with my own blood.

963
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,324
Hey, this is our song. We should dance.
It's very special. Isn't that mad?

964
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,327
Don't fucking touch me.

965
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,890
- Yay.
- What are you doing?

966
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,962
Stopping you from making
a twat of yourself

967
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,008
by using the medium of dance. Hello.

968
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,765
I'm gonna slow-dance you
into submission, OK?

969
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,367
You'll need to put your arms around
my waist for it to work properly. Good.

970
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,125
- I'm such a dick.
- You're not. You're not a dick.

971
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,044
It's always better
to be the one that's dumped.

972
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,646
You never regret anything.
She made the decision.

973
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,007
She's gotta live with that
for the rest of her life.

974
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,562
- It's not as simple as that, is it?
- But it will be. it just takes time.

975
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,440
- Your hands are slipping down my arse.
- Sorry. Old habit.

976
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,170
Everybody knew they were doing it.
Nobody told me.

977
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,129
It's rough. I'll admit it's rough.

978
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,690
I was really traditional about

979
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,525
the whole "don't sleep around
when you're married" thing.

980
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,602
Hands-arse. That's right.

981
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,570
I bet you proposed
on the top of a Tuscan hill.

982
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,210
Cephalonian, actually.

983
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,089
Spent a year planning your big day.

984
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,924
- Twenty grand, all in?
- Bit more.

985
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,367
- Let's not forget the ring.
- It was four grand.

986
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,284
And we had to get it resized
because she got awfully thin.

987
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,842
You spent £24,000
on a party and some jewellery?

988
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,001
It was a grand gesture.

989
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,811
What's the point of life
if you're not up for stuff like that?

990
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,566
A grand gesture that amounted
to nothing. Hands-arse.

991
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,162
- God, you're such a fucking cynic.
- And you're such a fucking romantic.

993
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,604
You put so much emphasis on that one day
and forget about the rest of your life.

994
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,365
What's wrong with having a big day?
Look at your parents.

995
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,011
I bet they had a party and guests
and a wishing tree.

996
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,203
Six guests. Local registry office.
Drinks at the pub afterwards.

997
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,964
They decided it was more important

998
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,327
to concentrate on the promises
they were making.

999
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,681
Don't you think that's what I wanted?

1000

you make a promise you can't keep,

Sorry.

1044
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:09,086
I've had a bad relationship run
over the past few years

1045
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,722
and so it's made me
not the most positive person.

1046
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,846
I overanalyse and I...

1047
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,808
...come up with elaborate theories and
make monumentally bad decisions and...

1048
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,566
I've gotta move on, you know,

She's out there, she's happy.

She's getting on with her life

1051
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,765
...I’m just holding on.
- OK.

1052
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,602
A, I wouldn't say "happy", exactly.

1053
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,844
And secondly, I mean,
you're not holding on to her.

1054
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,843
You're holding on to a feeling

1055
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,561
and that feeling will eventually pass.
Promise.

1056
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,850
I mean, look, maybe I was wrong.

1057
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,642
Maybe dating 24-year-olds
is exactly what you need right now.

1058
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,530
- You've changed your tune.
- Well, unlike...

1059
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,131
...the older lady,
they do have less baggage.

1060
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,281
I mean, shit, I'm way over
my baggage allowance.

1061
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,125
I'm four years single.
Four fucking years.

1062
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,201
Prior to that, I had six years
with the supposed love of my life,

1063
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,124
when, out of the blue,
he ended it and then he...

1064
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,044
He said he wanted to go to China
to find himself.

1065
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,600
Then he found himself
shacked up in Shepherd's Bush

1066
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,648
with some other girl six months later.

1067
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,724
- I'm over it, obviously, but I just...
- Yeah, you really sound it.

1077
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,361
I'm a journalist. Yeah.

Slash wannabe literary polymath.

1079
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,167
- That figures. You got good theories.
- Oh, you like them now?

1080
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,844
I wouldn't listen to me, though,

1081
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,766
because I'm not exactly the poster child
for the dating industry.

1082

1085

back together.

00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,163
You know, start with the corners.
Look for the blue bits.

1087
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,850

that her porn star theory is correct.

1092

01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,524
Hey. Where did you two get to?

1094
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,921
Probably 69-ing in the toilets,
no doubt.

1095
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,765

Let's do some shots.

So, what is your theory on this one?

1144
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,211
- My theory?
- Yeah, I wanna hear it. What's the...

1145
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,681
ls it "boy meets girl"
or "boy doesn't meet girl"?

1146
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,529
(chuckles) I mean...

1147
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,331
This is when you tell me what to do
and then we argue and then...

1148
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,529
You know, it's a bit of back and forth
and eventually...

1149
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,331
- Oh, wait.
- What for?

1150
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,210
All night you've had
all these theories and opinions

1151
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,009
and suddenly you've nothing to say?

1152
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,163
What do you want? Do you want
my permission or something?

1153
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,006
- No, not at all.
- Then I think you should meet Jessica.

1154
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,641
- Yeah, but that's not...
- What are you waiting for, right?

1155
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,042
What am l...? I don't know
what I'm waiting for.

1156
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,451
Fine, I'll meet Jessica.

1157
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,449
- OK. Great.
- OK.

1158
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,929
- Are you meeting her here or...
- Yeah. Yes, there it is. (laughs)

1159
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,286
- OK.
- That's where the...

1160
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,601
You can give her this back then.

1161
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,651
- No, she bought another one.
- Course she did.

1162
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,769
I haven't really read it, to be honest.

1163
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,330
Maybe we should have.

1164
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,845
So, erm...

1165
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,085
- ls that everything?
- Yeah.

1166
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,531
So sorry for derailing your date.

1167
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,367
I'm glad you did, otherwise I'd have
nothing to talk about on the next one.

1168
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,569
It is a good anecdote.
I'll probably use it in future myself.

1169
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,120
So, well, look after yourself...

1170
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,010
- It's what I do best.
- OK, and...

1171
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,525
- Bye.
- Bye.

1172
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,326
- I'll Facebook you.
- Not on Facebook.

1173
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,244
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

1174
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,124
Idiot.

1175
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,966
Idiot.

1176
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,250
What kind of nutter pretends to be
someone else's blind date?

1177
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,890
(Jack) I know. It's...

1178
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,726
Although it does prove what a publishing
sensation Six Billion has been.

1179
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,881
Yeah.

1180
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,124
Let's just pretend the whole thing
never happened and we shall start again.

1181
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,361
Cheers.

1182
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,410

I did a lot of walking today.

I hear you work in the City.

- Correct. And I love it.
- "Lunch is for wimps."

It's from Wall Street. From the film.

Oh, is that the one
with Leonardo DiCaprio?

1189
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,686
Er, no.

1190
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,160
Erm, so listen, Tom told me
that you are a triathlete.

Well, here we all are.

1200
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,087
I had rather hoped that
our youngest daughter, Nancy,

would have been here to do the speech.

1202

But, er, she's been a little delayed.

1203
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,767

another 40 years ahead of us...

01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,564
- Bloody hope not.
- (laughter)

1215
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,722

1216
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,808
...that you can park on
a double yellow line on a Sunday...

I'm gonna paint my hallway.

Yes, Tom said that
you were a bit of an artiste.

Yeah, I, you know... I dabble.

No, I don't dabble.
Who am I trying to kid?

I was late to meet you.

But, actually, the reason
that I had to buy another copy

1255
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,889
was because I left my copy
for this woman on the train

1256
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,249
and she so needed to read it.
She was a very unhappy soul.

hope", "clock ticking" kind of women.

What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,805
If I hadn't left her that book...
It's like the most epic love story ever.

01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,202
And it means that I was right
and she was wrong. Taxi!

- Where to?
- Shit, I have no idea.

- This isn't a power ballad.
- Well, it should be.

- Nancy, I had to come and find you.
- How did you...?

1317
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,326
- I couldn't just leave it like that.
- Oh, my God. Nancy, is this...

1318

- Oh, it's marvellous.
- We've got a chair for you.

1319

- A chair? For me?
- Yeah.

your attention, please.

1370
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,769
I'm just... just gonna say
a few words. Er...

1371
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,691
Er, I actually had
something prepared but...

1372
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,331
I lost it. It's kind of a long story...

1373
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,289
Actually, I'm just gonna tell you,

1374
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,408
cos it's actually the reason
I was so late

1375
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,046
and the reason why this speech
is gonna be so rubbish.

1376
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,610
<i>(laughter)</i>

1377
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,885
I met a man today.

1378
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,770
- Hello.
- (Nancy) No, not this man.

1379
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,684
I was standing underneath
the clock at Waterloo Station

1380
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,762
when a man called Jack

1381
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,605
mistook me for his blind date

1382
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,603
and instead of just saying,

1383
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,924
"Hey, you got the wrong girl,"
like a normal person, erm...

1384
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,125
...l thought it was a good idea
to just pretend that I was his date.

1385
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,123
<i>(gasps) No, you didn't?</i>

1386
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,522
- I did. I did. But, but...
- (laughter)

1387
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,003
You know, we went out and, you know,
for the first time in ages,

1388
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,289
I put myself out there,
and I took a chance,

1389
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,930
and I even got stronger thighs.

1390
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,725
Then Jack found out
I wasn't who I said I was,

1391
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,246
a 24-year-old triathlete by the way.

1392
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,890
<i>- 24?</i>
<i>(Nancy) Yeah.</i>

1393
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,770
And so he went to go
and meet his real blind date.

1394
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,888
So blah, blah, blah, the end.

1395
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,086
<i>(all groan)</i>

1396
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,290
No, don't be sad. God, I'm not sad.

1397
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,241
I'm a bit sad. (sighs)

1398
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,166
Er, but I'm also quite proud of myself
because I tried.

1399
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,687
And, you know,
no, it didn't work out, but...

1400
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,561
I got a hint of what
could be out there for me.

1401
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,005
You know...

1402
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,604
...a fun...

1403
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,321
...loving, crazy, contradictory,

1404
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,051
long, happy life with someone.

1405
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,929
Something that these two have had

1406
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,527
since they first laid eyes on each other
40 years ago.

1407
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,090
So, please...

1408
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,851
...join me in toasting them and
wishing them a very happy anniversary.

1409
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,523

1412
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,047
I liked that speech. I liked it a lot.

1413

Cheers, Dad.

1414
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,164
- Much better than last year's.
- Yeah, that wasn't very...

1415

Nancy, I thought
you might want your speech.

It's too late. I've...

1429
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:07,803
- No, do you want your speech, Nancy?
- Er... Yes.

1430
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,963
OK, good. Just be quiet
and let me give it to you, then.

...erm, and friends
and members of Nancy's family

1434
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,201
who I've never met before in my life.
This is...

1435
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,649
I met a girl today, the wrong girl,

1436
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,530
except she turned out
to be the right girl.

1437
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,080
And this girl who took a chance on me

1438
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,323
in the most bizarre
and romantic way possible

1439
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,449
wanted me to take a chance on her,
but, erm...

1440
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,363
...l didn't, you know. I didn't.
I blew it,

1441
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,809
like a stupid 40-year-old,
mid-life-crisis dickhead that I am.

1442
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,327
Which is why I sought help
from old beaus.

1443
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,371
Yes, you... not the most reliable
of sources, really. Whatever.

1444
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,525
But undeterred, I commandeered
these brilliant young drunks,

1445
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,763
because nothing was gonna stop me
from finding this girl

1446
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,844
and telling her what
I should have told her earlier on.

1447
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:13,569
Nancy, I am so bloody glad
you pretended to be my date today,

1448
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,244
because, if you hadn't,

1449
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,008
then I never would've heard
any of your amazing sex theories

1450
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,881
or... watched you trying to get
jalapeno out of your teeth

1451
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,204
or witnessed your very instinctive
firewoman skills.

1452
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:35,003
I would never have got to know
that muddy, beautiful triathlete face

1453
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,926
or witnessed that awesome,
highly competitive arse

1454
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,048
as you were about to get another strike.

1455
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,602
In fact, if you hadn't have
pretended to be my date today,

1456
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,411
my day would have been utterly rubbish.

1457
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,646
And so, quite possibly,

1458
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,200
- would have been the rest of my life.

Don't make those noises,
I'm right on the edge.

1460
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,202
Nancy, you said
I was an emotional jigsaw

1461
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,760
and that I should look
for the blue bits.

1462
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,526
I think you might be the blue bits,
Nancy.

1463
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,844
So what do you say?

1464
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,130
