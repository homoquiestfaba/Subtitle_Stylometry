00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,375
You called me.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,541
Wow, you are, like,
exactly how I pictured you.

175
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,583
The suit and the little pocket square,

176
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,750
all proper.

177
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,000
Right. [clears throat] This way.

178
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,500
[bell dings]

179
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,250
Holy freakin' moly.

180
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,416
This is so similar to all the other
hotel suites I've seen in my life.

181
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,583
So similar.

182
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,958
May I introduce Prince Thomas of Lavania.

183
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,250
- Hello.
- [Izzy] Ah.

184
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,416
Um, I'm Izzy of 183rd Street.

185
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,500
Oh, please. You don't have to curtsy.

186
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,375
I know. I only have to curtsy to you
if I'm a citizen of your country.

187
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,333
I'm just doing it for extra credit.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,250
You know a lot about greeting a royal.

189
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,416
Just what I looked up
on the subway over here.

190
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,958
It said, "The curtsy should be
a discrete movement with a slow rise,

191
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,500
maintaining eye contact."

192
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,416
Uh, shall we get started?

193
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,083
Oh.

194
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,541
- Something wrong?
- I'm not supposed to touch you first.

195
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:46,666
"Never initiate contact with a royal.
Wait until the royal initiates contact."

196
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,916
Ah, yes. Yes.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,791
That is one of the rules
we vigorously reinforce.

198
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,500
You know, a man once
patted me on the back during a parade.

199
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,333
Well, what happened?

200
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,833
I never saw the man again.

201
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,291
[whispers] He was taken care of.

202
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,833
[laughs] What?

203
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,416
Don't do that.
I'm nervous enough as it is.

204
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,583
There. I touched you first.

205
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,750
Thank you.

206
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,750
Seriously, don't do that.

207
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay. So what do you wanna do here?

208
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,458
You tell me.

209
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,000
Your Highness. Your tea?

210
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,875
I didn't order tea. Thank you.

211
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,583
- But I was told that...
- I ordered the tea for you.

212
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,708
- You don't want it?
- [Thomas] No.

213
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,833
You heard him. Go!

214
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,791
Y-Yes, of course. Sorry.

215
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,000
[tray clatters loudly]

216
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,500
Incompetence. Complete incompetence.

217
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,250
I-I'll inform housekeeping.

218
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,833
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

219
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey, it's okay.
You're okay. Everybody spills stuff.

220
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,458
[woman] Thank you.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So what cut
do you think would best suit me?

222
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,250
Why didn't you say anything?

223
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,958
That lady was so mean,
and you just sat there.

224
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,291
Well, it's not really my place to say.

225
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,750
- Not your place?
- No, it's...

226
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,458
Isn't she a reflection of you?

227
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,041
If I treated people like that,
I'd have no customers.

228
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,958
I'm a prince. I don't have any customers.

229
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,041
Really?

230
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,000
The people that live in your country
aren't like your customers?

231
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,041
No. They're subjects.

232
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,208
Yeah.

233
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,791
Subjected to your crap.

234
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,083
Perhaps you should just cut my hair?

235
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,875
Carefully.

236
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,333
You know what?

237
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Perhaps you should cut your own hair.

238
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,125
What are you doing?
You haven't finished my haircut.

239
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,041
I-Is something wrong?

240
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
[Izzy] Yeah, something's wrong.

241
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,875

242
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,875

245
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,875
[woman] That's why you gotta watch
that medical stuff. You'll get addicted.

00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, my... Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

248
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,083
I'm sorry. My phone died.
I had to walk back home.

249
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,625
- What? From Uptown? Sit.
- <i>Grazie,</i> Nonna.

250
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,333
Why didn't you take the subway?

251
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,791
I didn't have money.
I was counting on that $500.

252
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,500

253
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,041
Rich people, always stiffin'

254
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,916
No, it's not like that. I, um…

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,125
I didn't exactly finish the haircut.

256
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,833
- I saw some injustices...
- Oh, Isabella. You and your injustices!

257
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,916
- What did you do?
- [Izzy] Doesn't matter.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,208
The prince saw somebody being a jerk,
and he didn't even care.

259
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,958
A prince is supposed to be gallant,
to stand up for the little people.

260
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,208
- A prince is supposed to...
- Not be in the store.

Please, don't let me stop you.

- She cut two princes' hair today.

- Happens all the time. They...
- What are you doing here?

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,208
You forgot your scissors.

265
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,625
Also, I was hoping
I could get the rest of my haircut.

266
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,708

I can barely stand up straight.

I see. Well, at least let me
pay you and apologize.

271
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,250
I promise, I do have a more charming side.

- Take a seat.

280
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,750
- I wiped it earlier. Very clean.
- [Thomas] Thank you.

342
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,000
[whimsical music plays]

343
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,333
Go, go!

344
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,750
Go, go, go, go!

345
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,041
This way. Go! Go! Go! Go!

346
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,083
[both laughing]

347
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,416
- [car thuds]
- [both chuckle]

348
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
Oh, my God.

349
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,750
I think we may have given them
a heart attack.

350
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,375
Yeah, that's all right.

351
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,666
It's a little payback for Walter.

352
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,958
He confessed that his phone
made an error calling your salon.

353
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,041
He intended to call a salon named Belle.

354
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,208
Ah.

355
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,500
Yep, that makes more sense.

356
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,166
All the biggies go there.

357
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,375
But their cuts start at 700 bucks,
a total waste of money.

358
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,750
I can give you
the same haircut for 29.99.

359
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,583
But I paid you 500.

360
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,000
Hey, it's what Walter offered.
I'm just a good businesswoman.

361
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,958
Well, I'm glad he made the mistake.

362
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:49,541
This was the best night I've had in…
well, a very long time.

363
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,666
I thought you were gonna take the subway.

364
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,458
I insist we give you
a ride back to your salon.

365
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,500
Ah, no, thank you.

366
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,458
It's a beautiful night, and I just…

367
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,000
I wanna look at the stars.

368
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,208
What stars?

369
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,208
What do you mean, what stars?

370
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,583
Sirius. Vega.

371
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,583
Where's Vega?

372
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,208
Look, it's right…

373
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,916
There.

374
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,416
I'm used to stargazing
with lights and pollution.

375
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,375
[sighs contentedly]

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,958
Amazing.

377
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,000
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Your engagement party begins shortly.

378
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,416
Of course.

379
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,333
Well…

380
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,458
It was a pleasure meeting you, Izzy.

381
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,666
You too.

382
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,041
You know, you're not so bad,

383
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,041
when you're not acting like a prince.

384
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,708
[woman] Who do these hairdressers
think they are? Hmm?

385
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,000
No. Now, you trust me,
I was doing her a favor.

386
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,750
No, I do not always do that.

387
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,125
[Thomas] Good morning.

388
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,375
Oh, you hold on.

389
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,958
- [woman laughs]
- Morning.

390
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,708
Come on, you two. Let's go. Kiss kiss.

391
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,166
- Mom!
- Lauren.

392
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,541
I'm just makin' memories.

393
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,083
- Makin' memories.
- [phone beeps]

394
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,791
- She hung up.
- [Thomas] So how are the wedding plans?

395
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,166
Damned expensive.

396
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,166
There've been a few bumps,
but it's no biggie.

397
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,208
No biggie? We just lost
our fourth hair and makeup designer.

398
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know what we're gonna do.
We're running out of time.

399
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,750
If I may,
what of Miss Isabella, Your Highness?

400
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,541
[Lauren's mom] Isabella?

401
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,083
Owner of the salon Bellissime.

402
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
She just cut the prince's hair.

403
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,500
- Does she do crew cuts?
- She and her team do everything.

404
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,625
Are you happy with her, this Isabella?

405
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,208
Uh, yes. Yes. Best salon in New York.

406
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,083
Difficult to book, though.

407
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,500
Very popular.

408
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,541
Oh. Well, we must get them.

409
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,583
[chuckles] We gon' get them.

410
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,875
- [woman] I love those. Are those real?
- 24 carat.

411
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,458
There you are, Rochelle.

412
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,166
- I always know where to find you.
- She's all set.

413
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,750
- You're welcome.
- Bye, Izzy.

414
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,333
See you tomorrow.

415
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,583
You do too much for them.

416
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,041
She does.

417
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,250
I love it. It's really not a problem.

418
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,416
It is.

419
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,208
Izzy, I'm not getting any younger.

420
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,916
I would love to hand over
the community center to someone I trust.

421
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:49,916
Oh.

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,083
I'm flattered, but I don't know anything
about running a community center.

423
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,125
No! Because you're a hairdresser.

424
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
- Nate, out of here. Out!
- But...

425
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,708
Out! Out! Out!

426
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,208
- [sighs]
- [Izzy] Mama!

427
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,916
Rude. Even for you.

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What? He's coming over
for lasagne later,

429
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,875
and besides, you work here.

430
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,125
Right there.

431
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,666
This is where you belong.

432
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
With me.

433
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,250
Oh, uh, good day.

434
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,333
Walter. Did the prince forget somethin'?

435
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,666
On the contrary.

436
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,166
On behalf of the LaMotts
and the royal family,

437
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,208
Prince Thomas would like
to extend to you an offer.

438
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,000
Okay.

439
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,125
- Is he serious?
- Very.

440
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,208
- What's it say?
- What does it say on it?

441
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:45,291
Bellissime has been requested to do
the hair and makeup for the royal wedding…

442
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,958
- [gasps]
- …in Lavania…

443
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:47,875
[gasps]

444
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,166
…for $50,000.

445
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,666
Those business cards are amazing.

446
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,833
[tearfully] All of us?

447
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,958
- All of you.
- [screams]

448
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,083
Oh, my God!

449
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,291
[Izzy's mom] No, wait. Wait. Wait.

450
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,333
- We can't go!
- What?

451
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,000
Who's gonna mind the store?
We've got customers.

452
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,458
This is a chance of a lifetime.
Dad would've wanted me to go.

453
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,083
[in Italian] You and I will stay here
and take care of the salon.

454
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,166
[in Italian]
Let the girls go and have fun.

455
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,708
But it's so far away.

456
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,208
Isabella, what if
something happens to you?

457
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,125
Mama, if I stay here,
nothing's gonna happen to me.

458
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,958
What shall I tell the prince?

459
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,583
[quietly] Come on. Come on.

460
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,500
Tell him to hold onto his crown
because Bellissime is coming!

461
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,708
- [shouting]
- That's my girl!

462
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,375
We're going to Lagunia, or wherever…

463
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,250
Mama!

464
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,250
[overlapping excited chatter]

465
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,291
[Walter] Oh, golly! Oh!

466
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,791
It's chaos. Look.

467
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,083
[overlapping indistinct chatter]

468
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,583
Good golly.

469
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,458
[shouting continues]

470
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,208
[woman 2] What's it called again?

471
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,791
- [Walter] Lavania.
- [woman 2] We're going there!

472
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,875
[dramatic music plays]

473
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,291
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?

474
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,250
This place is gorgeous.

475
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:28,083
No pollution, no graffiti,
and no buildings.

476
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,541
- I'm actually a little bit freaked out.
- Is this stuff free?

477
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,000
Ooh! [Destiny laughs]

478
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,208
That's a bad smell.

479
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,958
- There's the castle!
- [gasps]

480
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,625
[friend] Oh, my God!

481
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,791
[indistinct excited chatter]

482
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,541
Hey, everybody.
We in Lavania, and it's like...

483
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,875
Welcome to Lavania.

484
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,666
Walter, what's up?

485
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,666
Ah…

486
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,375
I've got so much to teach you.

487
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,750
This way, ladies.

488
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,416
This is incredible! Oh, my God!

489
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,291
Are all the people working the wedding
staying in the castle?

490
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,791
Only you three.
Prince Thomas wants to make sure

491
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,750
your first experience
in Lavania is a memorable one.

492
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,708
- Who are all these oldy-von-moldies?
- D!

493
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,375
[Thomas] Those are my relatives.

494
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,583
[Walter] Your Highness.
What an unexpected surprise!

495
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:37,416
Uh, what I meant was,
they look glowing and mature.

496
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,875
No, you're quite right.

497
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,666
They are a rather moldy lot.

498
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,791
And I seem to have inherited
the family nose.

499
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,916
How do you look in the mirror every day?

500
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,375
[bell chiming]

501
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,333
Catherine, Father, there are some people
I'd like you to meet.

502
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:54,208
These are the stylists
I was telling you about from New York.

503
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,333
Oh, yes, of course. Welcome.

504
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:59,291
Hmm. Oh, that's, uh…

505
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,958
That's a very interesting, um…

506
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,708
Oh, it's a neck pillow.

507
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,791
She'll trade you for your necklace.

508
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,333
[friend, Destiny laughing]

509
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,625
[Thomas chuckles, clears throat]

510
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,250
Not really. That's yours.

511
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,041
I see.

512
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,250
- Thomas.
- [Thomas] Of course.

513
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:23,125
Well, it's lovely to have you all here.
Thanks for making the trip.

514
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,125
Can you imagine
if those were your parents?

515
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,916
I ain't never seen my pops
in anything but a bowling shirt.

516
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,958
[Walter clears throat]

517
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,416
This is where you'll be staying.

518
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,000
And this is your personal housekeeper.

519
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,916
If you need anything,
just press that button,

520
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,375
and she'll be summoned.

521
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,500
Hey, I'm Izzy.

522
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,541
Oh, there's no need
to introduce yourself to her.

523
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,166
Sure, there is. She's a person, right?

524
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,458
Yeah, Wally. Where your manners at?

525
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,875
Manners are the very foundation
of my life and work.

526
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,208
So, introduce us.

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,833
Uh…

528
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,375
I…

529
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:05,125
Isabella, Destiny, and Lola,
may I introduce you to Petra.

530
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,166
- Petra!
- Hey, Petra!

531
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,208
- Izzy. It's so good to meet you.
- This color on you!

532
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,083
Your hair, it's so pretty!

533
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,541
See? That wasn't so hard.

534
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,791
[Lola] I call this one.

535
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,958
I want this one!

536
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,541
[Izzy] I know you hate doing this,

537
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,708
but can we push the beds together,
make one big bed?

538
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,833
- No!
- No!

539
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,583
Definitely not.
You always make me sleep in the crack.

540
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,208
I'm not gonna sleep there.
Where am I supposed to sleep?

541
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,666
Your room is next door.

542
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,000
My room?

543
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,125
Why do I get my own room?

544
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,958
The prince feels he made
a rather bad first impression with you.

545
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,666
I believe he's trying to make amends.

546
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,458
[chuckles]

547
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,666
Tell him he has a long way to go. Hmm.

548
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,041
But it's a pretty good start.

549
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:05,000
- [Destiny] …so elegant. I love it.
- I know!

550
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,125
What is this?

551
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,541
[Walter] Wait till you see
the view from the roof!

552
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,500
[Destiny, Lola] Oh, my God!

553
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:15,250
[Destiny] Would you look at this?

554
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,333
[majestic music rises]

555
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,958
[Thomas] Ten thousand imported roses,

556
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,416
champagne fountains,

557
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,125
dinner for 800 guests.

558
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,666
Sounds divine, doesn't it?

559
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,375
I said I wanted something small.

560
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,500
We could save money if we just...

561
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:46,583
Again, you concern yourself with
financial issues, which you should not.

562
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,458
Besides, the LaMotts
are paying for most of this.

563
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,791
That man owns half of Texas.

564
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,083
We still hold responsibility
to our people and their needs.

565
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,791
But that's exactly
what we're doing, my son.

566
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,083
I mean, we could fix a few potholes,
which no one will remember,

567
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,708
or we could provide
extravagance, pageantry,

568
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,625
which they will remember forever.

569
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,666
So I'm just a pawn in this.

570
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:09,875
To boost approval.

571
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:13,500
Darling, you're young and in love.

572
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:14,750
In love?

573
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:17,791
With all due respect,
Catherine, I hardly know Lauren.

574
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,708
This is nothing but an arranged marriage.

575
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:24,125
Oh, Thomas, are you actually complaining
about living the life of a prince?

576
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,166
No, of course not, Father.

577
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:27,583
[father scoffs]

578
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,958
Why would I do that?

579
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,833
[excited chatter]

580
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,166
- [Destiny] It was so cute.
- This is the one.

581
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,291
- Hi. Sorry.
- I've never seen a dungeon before.

582
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:40,541
- It looked really good on us.
- You are late.

583
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,541
[Lola] Whoa.

584
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,875
Yeah, sorry.

585
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,208
- This castle has five million hallways.
- Yeah.

586
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,791
- We ended up in the dungeon...
- Then we had to pretend we were locked up.

587
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,791
- It was a whole thing.
- It was good.

588
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:51,750
Silence!

589
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,958
The royal wedding
is in less than two weeks.

590
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,291
We have never,
in the history of the royal family,

591
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,958
had unknown persons
do the hair and the makeup,

592
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,333
but the LaMotts insisted

593
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,916
on you three.

594
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:16,791
So this is precisely why I've called you
here today to test your skills on several…

595
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,458
Volunteers.

596
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,833
- You understand what she's saying?
- She's very intense.

597
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:26,416
You. You are in charge of
grooming the men for the wedding.

598
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,625
This is your model.
He works in the stable.

599
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,333
- Hey, I'm Izzy.
- Francis.

600
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:36,291
You have amazing hair.
I promise you, I won't hurt you.

601
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,583
You two, you will be preparing the women.

602
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,416
- Whoo!
- Yeah. [chuckles]

603
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,625
Hi. I'm Destiny,
and this is Lola. And you are?

604
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,916
- Abigail.
- Clara.

605
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,458
They work in the kitchen.

606
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,833
You two ever wear makeup?

607
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,416
- [gasps] But you have such pretty eyes!
- And look at those cheekbones!

608
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,708
You two are movie stars.
And they got you working in the kitchen?

609
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,041
- Mm-mmm.
- [gasps]

610
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,250
[both] Makeover!

611
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,250
["Il Ballo del Mattone"
by Rita Pavone playing]

612
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,833
[Izzy] And he is finished.

613
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,583
Francis?

614
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,666
I took a machete to that beard
because it just had to go.

615
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,625
I updated his hair,
and then I cleaned up his eyebrows.

616
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,791
Now look at those beautiful eyes.

617
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:42,875
Acceptable.

618
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,041
I'll take that as a French compliment.

619
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,750
- You're free to go.
- I'll wait for...

620
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,083
- Leave us!
- Okay.

621
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,833
- I'll catch up with you guys...
- Go!

622
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,125
Okay, okay.

623
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,000
[Destiny] Okay.

624
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,750
We're done.

625
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,958
Are you ready to have your mind blown?

626
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,375
Pardon?

627
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,416
On three.

628
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:10,666
[both] One, two, three!

629
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,750
[duck honking]

630
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,500
Ugh.

631
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,541
- What is this?
- [crying]

632
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,125
[both] Nailed it!

633
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm so sorry.

634
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,625
- [Lola] So happy!
- [Destiny] Oh, my God!

635
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:24,916
She's crying with joy.

636
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,583
You made her cry with joy!

[jaunty folk music playing]

638
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,833
Oh, hi!

639
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:45,791
- Hi!
- Hello.

640
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,291
[phone chiming]

641
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,708
- Baby.
<i>- Mama?</i>

642
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:52,666
What's wrong?

643
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,208
I'm fine. You should see this place.

644
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:58,500
You know those towns in train sets?
It's like I'm in a train set.

645
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,958
<i>What, you're near train tracks?
That's how your cousin died.</i>

646
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,875
Please be happy for me.

647
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,250
Look how pretty this is.

648
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,333
Look over here.
Wait, actually, look over here.

649
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,416
- How crazy is this?
- Whoa. Slower.

650
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,708
You're making me sick.

651
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:15,000

652

00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,833
I love you.

<i>I love you too.</i>

655
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,125
These look amazing.

656
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,875
Hey, how are you?

657
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,166
Hi.

658
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,291
[mouths] Hi.

659
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,333
[child] Come back here, guys.

660
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,416
[inquisitive, whimsical music plays]

661
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,958
Excuse me? What part of town is this?

662
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,041
Uber de Gleise.

663
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,458
- What does that mean?
- "Across the train tracks."

664
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,625
Oh.

665
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,625
That's a very nice fish.

So! You think you know hair.

You wanna see my license from Barbizon?

669
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:14,875
Royal hair is vastly different
than the hair of commoners.

670
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,041
It is subtle. It is chic.

671
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,125
It flows, but it does not move.

672
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,583
Like a swan gliding through the water.

673
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,500
She crazy.

674
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,666
Show me your hands!

675
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,958
"Hands." She's saying "hands."

[groans in disgust]

677
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,833
You have no muscle.

678
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,583
They are weak,

679
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:34,958
soft,

680
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,833
pathetic.

681
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,000
- I can make a fist.
- Silence!

682
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,083
[sighs]

683
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:43,875
I never thought
I would be in this position again,

684
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:47,458
but your lack of skill leave me no choice.

685
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,416
Scissors ready!

686
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,000
- Which ones?
- Those ones.

687
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,083
I can't use these.

688
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,125
- Just...
- They blunt!

689
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,541
- Get them!
- Okay.

690
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,416
We begin.

691
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,250
But there are no heads.

692
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,166
You imagine!

693
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,416
One, two, three.

694
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,958
One, two, three.

695
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,500
[all] One, two, three.

696
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,000
- One, two, three.
- [counts in French]

697
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,875
- Faster.
- One, two, three.

698
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,125
Yes, two, three.

699
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,583
Faster now.

700
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,500
Count with me.

701
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,875
One, two, three. One, two, three.

702
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,000
You can feel it, no?

703
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,791
One... I'm getting cramped!

704
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,833
- Destiny, just do it.
- One, two, three.

705
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,000
[Lauren] There are so many people
coming to our wedding.

706
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,541
I don't know hardly any of them.

707
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,583
Neither do I.

708
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:44,875
Who's that?

709
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,375
[Thomas] Oh, that's Izzy.
Pull over, please?

710
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,375
Izzy, were you not assigned a driver?

711
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,000
I was, but I like to walk.

712
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,000
Cake, pastry?

713
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:59,125
I'd offer a kolaczki,
but Everett ate all four.

714
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,166
Thank you.

715
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,333
Hey, there. You want one?

716
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,541
- [Lauren] Please.
- Mmm.

717
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,666
How rude of me.

718
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,791
This is Izzy, owner of Bellissime.

719
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,083
- Izzy, this is my fiancée, Lauren.
- [Lauren] Mmm!

720
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,958
I hear you're making me
look beautiful for my big day.

721
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,583
From where I'm standing,
it's not gonna be hard.

722
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:22,666
- Aren't you a sweetie!
- I'm gonna give the rest to the gardeners.

723
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,666
- How many are there?
- Gardeners? I have no idea.

724
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,333
You've lived here all your life,
and you don't know?

725
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,500
It was good to finally meet you, Lauren.

726
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,083
Love her.

727
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,500
Hey! What's up? Do you want one?

728
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,583
- [Izzy] I had one.
- [gardener] Thank you.

729
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,083
Yeah, she's great.

730
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,083
Guys, I had the most incredible day.

731
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,750
I went into town,
and I found the cutest shops.

732
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,500
I got these for the kids
at the community center.

733
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,708
No idea what they are.

734
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,583
I asked the guy twice,
but his accent was so thick I gave up.

735
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:57,916
They're cool though, right?

736
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,291
[toy makes noise]

737
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,000
Guys, what's wrong?

738
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,666
All day long,
we cut invisible heads of hair.

739
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,791
Hundreds of 'em!

740
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,625
- [Destiny] I can't feel my arms.
- What are you talkin' about?

741
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:11,208
That evil French lady thinks
we can't do hair and makeup

742
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,291
for the royal wedding,

743
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,375
so she put us in an evil hair school.

744
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,291
Us!

745
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,250
Let's go out tonight and have fun.

746
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,208
Check out Lavanian night life,
maybe a little dancin'?

747
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,208
- No way. Go without us.
- [Destiny] Go.

748
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,791
- I can't go without you.
- We'll be there in spirit.

749
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,291
- We'll be fine!
- Deep spirit.

750
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,416
- Don't worry about us. [moans]
- Dance the night away.

751
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,791
- Go live for us! Fly, butterfly!
- [Lola] I can't move my legs!

752
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,333
- Dance like you've never danced before!
- Oh, God!

753
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,791
- I love you!
- I lost my pizzazz.

754
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:43,000
May I say, Miss Isabella,
you look lovely this evening.

755
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,750
Thank you. Fist bump.

756
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,500
This is called a fist bump.

757
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,541
Oh. [chuckles]

758
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,875
And this is called a double fist bump.

759
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,416
- [mimics explosion]
- Oh…

760
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,375
Very good.

761
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:58,125
So a fist bump is for every day.
Double fist bump, special occasions.

762
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,333
And what is the special occasion?

763
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,541
- I'm goin' out.
- Into the gardens?

764
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,791
No. Back into town.

765
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:07,416
Oh, but it's almost dark,
and y-you're unaccompanied.

766
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,666
Walter, if I can handle myself
on the streets of New York,

767
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,625
I can handle myself in a town
where people push apples in carts.

768
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,750
- I just don't think it's a good...
- You need to lighten up and have some fun.

769
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:21,791
Who knows? Maybe if you learn to have fun,
you can teach the prince how to have fun.

770
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,291
Oh, I can assure you,
Prince Thomas knows how to have fun.

771
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,708
Really? How? 'Cause I've never seen it.

772
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,750
- Um...
- [footsteps receding]

773
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,625
[spluttering] Uh...

774
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:37,041
- I-I just don't think it's a good...
- I'm going to be fine.

775
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,041
[grunts]

776
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,125
[Walter hesitates]

777
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,000
[sighs nervously]

778
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,958
Your Highness, I hate to be a bother,

779
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,166
but your hairdresser
is walking down the drive.

780
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,208
Her intent is to leave the castle
and go into town.

781
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,333
It's getting dark.

782
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,541
- That doesn't seem safe.
- I didn't think so, but she insisted.

783
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,333
[Walter] She needs a chaperone.

784
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,416
You should go with her.

785
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,833
Oh, my skipping days are over.

786
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,208
She needs someone
who can keep up with her.

787
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,583
You have someone in mind?

788
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,958
What about you, Your Highness?

789
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:19,958
She knows you.

790
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,791
And I believe
a night away from your royal duties

791
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,041
might do you some good.

792
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,625
[Thomas] Mmm.

793
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,791
I need some clothes.
Regular person clothes, Walter.

794
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,375
Right away, Your Highness.

795
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,458
[Thomas] Pardon me, ma'am.

796
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,916
You're not permitted
beyond the castle walls.

797
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,125
- Prince Thomas.
- I'm not Prince Thomas tonight.

798
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,666
I'm just Thomas. Tom. Tommy.

799
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,791
- What are you doin' here?
- I was hoping I could join you.

800
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,041
You could be
my Sherpa guide to normal life.

801
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:04,291
Mmm, I don't know.
Am I gonna get in trouble for this?

802
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:07,666
At school, I always got in trouble,
even when I did nothin' wrong.

803
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,250
Nothing's going to happen to you.

804
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:13,416
At the most, a small prison sentence
for kidnapping a royal.

805
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,291
Just a little... little one.

806
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,583
- Fine.
- Yes!

807
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,041
But only because I hate to party alone.

808
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,791
And you're payin' for everything.

809
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,000
I don't have my wallet.

810
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:30,666
You're annoying.

811
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,875
And you're refreshingly honest.

812
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,083
[Thomas] So where are we headed?

813
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,208
- [Izzy] Into town.
- Yeah.

814
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:46,416
- [Izzy] Have you ever been?
- [Thomas] No, not often.

815
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,291
So this is Lavanian nightlife?

816
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,666
I suppose so.

817
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,708
We're a stiff, uncomfortable people,
as I'm sure you've seen.

818
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,125
Perhaps we should, uh,
head back to the castle.

819
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,000
Wait. I know where to go.

820
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,375
Of course you do.

821
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,083
Come on.

822
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:28,458
I'm not sure we should be here. I'm told
this part of town is quite dangerous.

823
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,541
[festive folk music playing]

824
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,500
[child] Let's go this way!

825
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,958
We'll be lucky
if we make it out of here alive.

826
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,750
Mmm, I smell something delicious.

827
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,291
Two, please.

828
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,208
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

829
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:00,833
Thank you.

830
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,750
Mmm!

831
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:06,750
This is fantastic.
I wonder what kind of meat this is.

832
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,916
Ooh, I've learned in these situations
it's better not to ask.

833
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,416
Come on.

834
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,458
I can't just stand here.

835
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:36,125
Wait, what? Where are you going? Wait...

836
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,208
[Izzy] Whoo!

837
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,875
Hi! Get over here.

838
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,875
Ready? Twirl!

839
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:03,708
Whoo!

840
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,625
- Whoo!
- [applause]

841
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,083
[band stops playing]

842
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,583
- You were so good. What's your name?
- Esme.

843
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,250
I'm Izzy. It's so good to meet you.

844
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:29,625
- You really are such a good dancer.
- [woman] Who's ready for the bumba?

845
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,750
[all cheering, whooping]

846
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,125
What's happenin'?

847
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,875
- Our national dance.
- Oh.

848
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:38,750
- Come on. You must know this dance.
- Only from afar.

849
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,833
Seriously?

850
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,958
Can you go get him for me?

851
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:44,875
- No. I...
- [man 1] That guy looks like the prince.

852
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,333
[woman] Is that the prince?

853
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,208
Everyone, can we please
give him some encouragement?

854
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:52,625
- [man 2] Hey! It's the prince!
- [man 3] Yeah, come join!

855
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,875
I'm not speaking to you.

856
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:59,208
- Fine. Less talkin' more dancin'.
- [woman] One, two, three, bumba!

857
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,500
[playing jaunty folk music]

858
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,791
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

859
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,875
Oh, thank you.

860
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,458
[all] Hey!

861
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,708
Hey!

862
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:13,875
Okay.

863
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,000
[all] Hey!

864
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,041
Hey!

865
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,375
What?

866
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,583
- You really don't know this dance.
- Please, I'm trying to concentrate.

867
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,833
- [all] Hey!
- Okay.

868
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,041
Hey!

869
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,125
Hey!

870
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,041
Hey!

871
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:56,666
Hey!

872
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,375
[cheers and applause]

873
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,875
Whoo!

874
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,541
[laughs]

875
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,791
[indistinct chatter]

876
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,416
- Thank you, Izzy.
- It's my pleasure.

877
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,541
- Now, do you live around here?
- In that building over there.

878
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,250
This is my school.
Wanna see where I sit?

879
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,333
Oh, it's not locked?

880
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:24,000
- Uh, be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

881
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,125
I helped make this.

882
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,833
I painted this.

883
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,375
And this is where I sit.

884
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:54,833
Wow, it's got a lot of character.

885
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,875
So this is where you sit?

886
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,208
- How's your ice cream?
- Good.

887
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,583
Is it really good?

888
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:07,208
It looks very good.
I'm excited to have mine.

889
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,125
[emotional folk music playing]

890
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,166
[Thomas] Ooh.

891
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,875
- [laughs]
- It's kinda drippy.

892
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:24,208
Uh, you're welcome?
If you don't like it, buy your own.

893
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,500
Wait, that's right.
You don't have any money.

894
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,625
My apologies.

895
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,250
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

896
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,458
I can't believe I feared this place.

897
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,541
These people are…

898
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,375
Amazing.

899
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,125
Come on. I wanna show you something.

900
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,166
[Izzy] So this is what stars look like
without pollution.

901
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,500
[Thomas] Quite humbling, isn't it?

902
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:01,708
Amazing.

903
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,333
It is.

904
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,125
Hey. How come
the prince of Lavania doesn't know

905
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,125
the national dance of Lavania?

906
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:17,750
Well, my parents are fond of traditions
that involve meeting heads of state

907
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,750
and wearing crowns from the 14th century.

908
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,333
They're not too fond
of peasant folk dances.

909
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:25,875
How stupid is that?

910
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,083
You have no idea.

911
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:32,583
You know, I never realized
what a melting pot Lavania is.

912
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:35,083
But I guess it makes sense.

913
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,833
Hundreds of years ago,
it was on the trade route to India, right?

914
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,416
Ah, so you're a lover of history
as well as astronomy.

915
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,583
I love everything, really.

916
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,208
- So why are you just a hairdresser?
- "Just"?

917
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,416
- No, I didn't… I didn't mean that.
- Mm-hmm.

918
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,208
I just meant,
you could use your mind for anything.

919
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:00,958
Truth is, I'd love nothin' more
than to do somethin' else.

920
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,416
But my mother needs me.

921
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,166
My dad passed away five years ago, and…

922
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,416
She's never been the same.

923
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,041
I'm sorry.

924
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,791
My mother passed away when I was seven.

925
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,583
I'm sorry.

926
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:27,583
You know, I, too, find myself
bound by family obligation and duty.

927
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,041
At least your decision
was of your own choice.

928
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:34,000
- I don't even get to choose my own wife.
- Wait, seriously?

929
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,791
You didn't swipe right on Lauren?

930
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:39,375
No. [chuckles]

931
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,666
No. Although, considering
the history of the monarchy,

932
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,416
I'm lucky she's not my cousin.

933
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,541
[Izzy chuckles]

934
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,875
[Thomas] I can't begin to tell you
how refreshing it was

935
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,833
to be around people
who treated me like I was a regular person

936
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,958
and not… use me for my title.

937
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,625
So why are they struggling so much?

938
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,791
My father takes care of the economics,
and, uh, he's made it clear

939
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,833
he does not want me involved.

940
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:14,125
I've always thought I could change
the world, if I was given the chance,

941
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:17,833
but you've been given that chance,
and you're not takin' it.

942
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,250
Thank you for a wonderful night.

943
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:43,041
You're welcome.
But next time you're paying.

944
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:43,958
I promise.

945
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:44,875
[chuckles]

946
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,500
Uh, what are you doin'?

947
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:51,916
Uh, nothing.

948
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,041
- Yeah. You were giving me the look.
- Wh-What look?

949
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:56,833
This look.

950
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,708
Like I'm gonna be ill?

951
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,666
No. Like… Like you like me.

952
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,708
I do like you.
I-I thought we were becoming friends.

953
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,541
Oh, that was not a friend look.

954
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:11,250
Well, I apologize.

955
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:14,458
Before we meet again,
I will forgo all my royal duties

956
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:17,875
so that I can practice
the nuances of my facial expressions.

957
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:20,791
You do that. Good night, Tommy.

958
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,208
May I say something,

959
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,333
as a friend?

960
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,041
Go for it.

961
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:32,333
You said you could change the world
if you were given the chance.

962
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,458
I don't think anyone's gonna
give you the chance. You have to take it.

963
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,625
Be the change you wanna see in the world.

964
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:43,250
And you should, because, well,
you're an extraordinary person.

965
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,083
Goodnight, Izzy.

966
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,250
[sighs]

967
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,000
"Extraordinary."

968
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,125
[sighs]

969
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,916
[birds chirping]

970
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,666
- Good morning, Catherine, Father.
- [Catherine] Good morning.

971
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,666
Morning.

972
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,125
You both look lovely this morning.

973
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:28,708
[both chuckle softly]

974
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,875
[Thomas] Thank you.

975
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,125
Father, have you ever had a kebab?

976
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:35,541
Uh, maybe when I was in the army.

977
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,375
Goat, I think.

978
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,375
[both laugh]

979
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,875
- They're very good.
- Yes.

980
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,708
I-I've been thinking about
the people in the Uber de Gleise.

981
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,666
- Isn't there anything we can do for them?
- Funny you should ask.

982
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,875
Lauren's father has agreed
to purchase that area of town

983
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,666
and renovate it for the people.

984
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,625
Really? That's brilliant.
Are there any plans I can see?

985
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,791
[father] Oh, they're just in the works.

986
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,458
It's all very hush-hush.

987
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,208
It's not something
you should be concerned with.

988
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,541
You know the Uber is an area
we've always protected you from.

989
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,708
It's quite dangerous.

990
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:13,041
Well, that's… that's not true.
Have you been there yourselves?

991
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,250
Darling, I don't have to pet a tiger
to know that it bites.

992
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,041
[both laughing]

993
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:24,083
Well, I'd love to be involved
in any way that I can.

994
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,083
I wanna do more for our people.

995
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:29,583
You are already doing
more than enough for our people.

996
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:32,083
Now, the subject is closed, Thomas.

997
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,166
Your mind should be
focused on the wedding.

998
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,875
[classical piano music playing]

999
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
[sighs]

1000
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,791
I can't do it. They're so bland.

1001
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:06,083
No color, no sparkle,
not even a diamond stud.

1002
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,375
As an artist, I just can't. I can't.

1003
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,875
You can do it, D.
You're stronger than you know...

1004
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,041
- Silence!
- [both yelp]

1005
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,166
[Destiny] Mmm.

1006
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,416
[Lauren's mom] Make sure
there will be flowers all the way down.

1007
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,291
There's gonna be flowers, right?

1008
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,458
Roses. Pink roses. Um, swans.

1009
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,291
You have the swans?
You told me they were coming in?

1010
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,208
Okay, we want swans in there.

1011
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:36,500
Just real pretty, no fightin'.
Lock it down, you know.

1012
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:40,250
All the way down to where the stones are,
not a blade of grass in sight.

1013
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,916
I don't wanna see
a single blade of grass in this.

1014
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,500
Just petals, petals, petals all the way…

1015
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,166
Thomas?

1016
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,916
You're gonna lean in and kiss her

1017
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
just about the time the doves have crested
those bushes over there, okay?

1018
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:05,583
Everett, do you have
any free space in that guard shack?

1019
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:08,333
Oh, yes, ma'am.
It's bigger than my own house.

1020
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:09,250
[both chuckle]

1021
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,333
Think you could store some stuff for me?

1022
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,666
Yeah. Don't see why not.

1023
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,666
But, if it's dessert…
I can't promise I won't eat it.

1024
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,666
- [chuckles]
- What'd you have in mind?

1025
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:24,333
"Got any old toys,
books, bikes, or furniture?"

1026
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,333
"Help a child less fortunate

1027
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:29,416
by bringing all the items
to the castle guard gate."

1028
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,625
"Ask for Everett."

1029
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1030
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,208
Hey, help a child in need.

1031
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,875
Hey, ladies. How you doing?

1032
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,916
Help a child less fortunate
than yourself, in the Uber.

1033
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,916
Oh, hey! Help a child less fortunate.

1034
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,500
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

1035
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:58,125
- Hey.
- Hi.

1036
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,583
How much is the spaghetti?

1037
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,750
You got room for one more cook?

1038
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,500
Izzy. What do you need?

1039
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,791
Oh, yes! You guys made it.

1040
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,916
- Fabre stepped out.
- So we snuck out.

1041
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,041
What's goin' on?

1042
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:15,541
Okay. Well, this may sound a little crazy,

1043
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,333
but I wanna make a batch of spaghetti
with homemade tomato sauce

1044
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,333
for the kids in the Uber de Gleise school.

1045
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,791
I already have all the ingredients.
I just need a stove and some help.

1046
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:25,750
Of course.

1047
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:28,083
- Please, anything to get a break.
- Mm-hmm.

1048
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:30,041
Okay, this is why I love you guys.

1049
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:34,458
So, first rule with Italian cooking,
you can't cook without wine.

1050
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,708
[Destiny] Hey!

1051
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,625
And music.

1052
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:40,625
["Guarda Come Dondolo"

1053
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:53,750
Yes…

1054
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,291
Yes, Petra.
This is what I'm talkin' about.

1055
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,000
[yelps]

1056
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:30,958
- [Petra] Whoo!
- [chanting happily]

1057
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,666
- Busy?
- No, not at all. Please, come in.

1058
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:51,833
Mom gave me
the new redesign for the country estate.

1059
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,000
That was fast.

1060
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:55,583
Things usually operate
much slower in Lavania.

1061
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,125
Not when she's around.

1062
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,583
So, she likes the estate.

1063
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,500
She just thinks it needs
a little updating before we move in.

1064
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:06,333
Also, I was hoping we might be able
to make this room here my work studio.

1065
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,250
Studio? For what?

1066
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,708
Well, so I have this business idea,

1067
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:15,333
and I haven't told many people,
so let me know if you think I'm crazy.

1068
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:18,083
- You know how dogs have all this stuff?
- [guard] Izzy!

1069
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,500
Tennis balls, sweaters,
dog chews, stuff like that.

1070
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,416
But they don't have
any way to carry it all around…

1071
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,416
[romantic piano music plays]

1072
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,750
Oh, my God! This is so sweet.

1073
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:31,000
- [music stops]
- …and I'm gonna call it "Purses for Dogs."

1074
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,083
So what do you think?

1075
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,083
Brilliant.

1076
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,541
Really? You like it?

1077
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,916
Yes, yes.

1078
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,625
My mom hated the idea.

1079
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:51,958
She said, "Your job is to be a princess,"
which, of course, it is.

1080
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:53,958
[music resumes]

1081
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:56,125
- [Izzy] Thank you.
- [Lauren] …can do both.

1082
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:57,541
[music stops]

1083
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,208
Yes.

1084
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:05,000
Good, 'cause I was actually hoping

1085
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:07,541
we might open
the first store on the estate.

1086
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:09,125
Mm-hmm.

1087
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,208
[Lauren] And maybe you might
wanna be the official mascot.

1088
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,916
We put you in your little crown.
You can hand out fliers.

1089
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,833
That sounds wonderful.
Would you excuse me a moment?

1090
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,541
I can barely fit in here anymore.

1091
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:30,458
Oh!

1092
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,083
This is incredible.

1093
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,750
[chuckles]

1094
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:39,041
This used to be mine when I was a boy.

1095
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,541
And I figure,
I'm not playing with it anymore,

1096
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,125
so let's give it
to somebody who might love it.

1097
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,583
[music box playing delicate tune]

1098
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:51,916
Yeah.

1099
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:54,916
[Thomas] Everett!

1100
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I wanted to let you know,
there's a Norman invasion outside.

1101
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:00,041
Uh, Your Highness, we were, um...

1102
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:03,500
Playing with toys. Is this how you spend
all day long in the guardhouse?

1103
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:06,291
Stop it. You're scaring Everett to death.

1104
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,791
He's kidding, I swear.

1105
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10,958
It's just so hard to tell with him.
He's so cardboard.

1106
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:15,083
Ah, I'm sorry, Everett.
I was just, uh, kidding around a bit.

1107
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:19,375
Can I ask why the guardhouse
has turned into a novelty shop?

1108
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,750
I was thinking about
what you said the other night,

1109
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:24,125
and I'm not saying you were right...

1110
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:25,208
But?

1111
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,166
I need to be the change
I wanna see in the world, right?

1112
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,583
So I've decided
to help the school in the Uber.

1113
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:35,583
Need a partner?

1114
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,416
What do you got in mind?

1115

[intense drumbeat plays]

1116
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,166
The sides are a little uneven.

1117
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,166
But… I am not revolted.

1118
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,083
[excited squeak]

1119
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:14,000
- She is not revolted!
- She is not revolted!

1120
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,083
[excited clamoring]

1121
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,500
Here's a beauty.
Always been one of my favorites.

1122
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,166
It's gorgeous.

1123
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,750
Why isn't it in the castle?

1124
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,541
The queen likes
to switch out the furniture.

1125
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,166
Anything she doesn't fancy
ends up in the storage.

1126
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,958
Can't the staff use the furniture
in their houses?

1127
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,666
I mean, it's going to waste.

1128
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,666
Against policy, I'm afraid.

1129
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,208
Absurd! Let's load them all in the truck.

1130
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:48,458
Uh, respectfully, Your Highness,
they're not allowed to leave the storage.

1131
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,291
Francis, how often
does the queen visit the storage?

1132
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,958
- Never.
- Well, then she she'll never know.

1133
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:57,833
Gather all the gardeners, all 18 of them,
and tell 'em to lend us a hand, will you?

1134
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:59,291
Right away, Your Highness.

1135
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,875
You know how many gardeners there are?

1136
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,625
Well, I've lived here all my life

1137
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,083
and been told
not to fraternize with the help.

1138
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:10,333
- [in New York accent] How stupid is that?
- [chuckles]

1139
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,708
No, I didn't ask for 125 pigeons.

1140
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,291
I asked for 125 doves

1141
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,500
with just a whisper of pink
on their wings.

1142
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,583
I don't know
what's difficult about that.

1143
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,583
Y'all need to get it done. That's all.

1144
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,583
May I say, you look stunning, my dear?

1145
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:36,125
[sighs]

1146
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,333
Walter, do you know
if the swans have arrived?

1147
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,666
An hour ago. They should be
being held out the back here.

1148
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,708
Actually, they're on the other side
of the castle near the stables.

1149
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,083
- I'll show you.
- Who is that with the prince?

1150
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:54,916
Who? That's just
a temporary employee for the wedding.

1151
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,416
Tea? W-We have chamomile.

1152
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,458
We have peppermint.
Some Earl Grey, perhaps.

1153
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,708
You may go, Walter.

1154
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,625
Yes. Of course, milady.

1155
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,666
That's Izzy from the salon in New York.

1156
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,416
- Mm-hmm.
- She's super nice, Mom.

1157
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,708
I'll bet she is.

1158
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,833
Mom. Don't go causing any trouble
right before the wedding.

1159
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:27,708
Oh, well, looks like
if it was up to this hairdresser,

1160
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,625
you wouldn't have a wedding at all.

1161
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:30,541
[chuckles wryly]

1162
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,916
Well, maybe that wouldn't be
such a bad thing.

1163
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:35,500
Excuse me?

1164
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,333
I barely know the guy, Mom.

1165
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,125
Oh, honey. Knowing your spouse
is highly overrated.

1166
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,791
How romantic!
That gonna be in your wedding toast?

1167
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,708
You are just having
some pre-wedding jitters. That's all.

1168
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:53,375
Now, Thomas is a kind,
charming, handsome prince.

1169
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:56,750
And you're lucky to have him,
and he is lucky to have you.

1170
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,041
But I'm not ready to settle down yet, Mom.

1171
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,833
I wanna start my own business.

1172
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:05,083
Ooh, not another word
about those ridiculous cat backpacks!

1173
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,958
Dog purses, Mom. God!

1174
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:10,583
Lauren, you're gonna be a princess.
This wedding is happenin'.

1175
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,625
He just needs
his chain yanked a little bit.

1176
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:20,791
[engine turns over]

1177
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,625
You okay there?

1178
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:27,916
Yes, yes, yes.
I just haven't driven in a while.

1179
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:35,708
- [horn honks]
- Oh! [Izzy laughs]

1180
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:40,208
What's so funny? Would you care to drive?

1181
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:43,166
Hey, I'm from New York.
We take public transportation.

1182
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,750
I'm just glad
I didn't eat before we did this.

1183
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,875
[Thomas] See? I told you I could drive.

1184
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:58,041
My father used to let me drive
at our estate in the north,

1185
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,500
but there were no real roads,
nothing to hit,

1186
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,125
so they were never really
proper driving lessons.

1187
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,250
It was fun, though.

1188
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,541
Only time I got to spend
alone with my father.

1189
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:12,208
Most of my memories revolve around me
being stuffed into an uncomfortable suit

1190
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:15,125
and propped up for royal photographs.

1191
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:19,500
Once, for my birthday,
I got this brand-new pair of tap shoes.

1192
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:21,750
- Cool.
- I hated those tap lessons.

1193
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:24,375
Even now when I hear
a bird tapping on a window

1194
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,875
I break out into a cold sweat.

1195
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:29,666
Oh, my God!
Please stop. You're depressing me.

1196
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,083
Cheer us up, then.
Tell me a story about your childhood.

1197
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,625
- Well?
- Well, I'm thinkin', okay?

1198
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,916
I'm sortin' through
a lot of embarrassing stories

1199
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,458
that I'm not gonna tell.

1200
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:44,708
Okay. I got one.

1201
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,333
It's about my dad.

1202
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,708
I was about five.

1203
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,750
We had no money and we just moved
into my nonna's tiny apartment.

1204
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:56,791
I was havin' a hard time
making friends in the neighborhood,

1205
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,708
and I was kinda miserable.

1206
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:01,916
I don't even know
how my dad didn't get arrested for this,

1207
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,833
but he knew some guy who had one of those
horse-drawn carriages in Central Park.

1208
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:12,833
So he borrows the guy's horse,
and he rode it right to our apartment.

1209
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:13,833
Really?

1210
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,250
Yeah.

1211
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,458
Here I am, sittin' on the steps,
I'm feelin' sorry for myself.

1212
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,833
And here comes my dad on a horse.

1213
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,208
He scooped me up,
rode me all through the neighborhood.

1214
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,500
Then he got me gelato.

1215
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,625
He even bought gelato for the horse.

1216
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,666
[chuckles]

1217
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,500
I didn't have trouble
making friends after that.

1218
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,041
My dad would've loved this place.

1219
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,291
He had an adventurous heart.

1220
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,416
Like his daughter.

1221
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,791
He also had no money, like his daughter.

1222
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,708
Ah, I forgot my wallet again.

1223
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,625
Are you kidding me? Oh, my God!

1224
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,125
[both chuckle]

1225
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,125
You really wanna wear a disguise?

1226
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:28,625
Yes. I'd prefer it
to be about them, not me.

1227
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:31,500
Totally.

1228
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,958
Great disguise, by the way.

1229
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,041
Hi.

1230
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,125
Hey.

1231
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:46,125
Hey, you must be Jane.
I'm Izzy. We spoke on the phone.

1232
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,916
Uh, and this is my friend…

1233
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,250
- Uh…
- [clears throat]

1234
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,583
Tommy.

1235
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:51,791
[Thomas] Good day.

1236
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,375
I can't thank you enough for doing this.
The children are so excited.

1237
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:58,291
Let's not keep 'em waitin'.

1238
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,333
Who wants books and toys?

1239
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,041
[kids] Yeah!

1240
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,416
And spaghetti!

1241
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,166
Yeah!

1242
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,791
And haircuts!

1243
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,500
[kids murmur, groan]

1244
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,208
After the spaghetti
'cause we don't want hair in the food.

1245
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,333
Yeah!

1246
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,958
Okay, let's get some toys
up in here. Come on.

1247
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,375
- Toys!
- [kids] Thank you.

1248
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:18,541
[Izzy] You're welcome. Who wants the book?

1249
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:21,083
This school's about to look
a lot different.

1250
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,125
[bell ringing]

1251
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,166
- Here you go, my man.
- Thank you.

1252
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:35,875
There you go.

1253
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:41,625
Do you like it?

1254
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:45,291
Wow! Who are you,
and what have you done with Esme?

1255
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,000
Do you want some spaghetti?

1256
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:55,541
Okay, I think I've given all the kids
a haircut except that one.

1257
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,791
You can run but you can't hide.

1258
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,458
Well, it's absolutely wonderful.

1259
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:05,625
And it's all because of you.

1260
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,041
You helped.

1261
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,000
A little.

1262
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:10,166
[Thomas] Just a bit.

1263
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,416
[Izzy laughs]

1264
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:19,916
Can you read this to us?

1265
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,291
Me? I'd be honored. Come on.

1266
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:26,958
You know, it's easier
to read books without sunglasses.

1267
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,208
[sighs]

1268
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:29,833
- All right.
- Come on.

1269
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:32,750
Hold on. Let me fix this up.

1270
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250

1272
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,458
Thank you.

1273
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,625
You're welcome.

1274
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,458

[birds chirping]

1276
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,833
Hey, did I miss breakfast?

1277
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:05,541
They're never this late.
I need my coffee in my silver pot.

1278
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:07,500
Two weeks and you're already spoiled.

1279
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:11,250
Spoiled? We're in hair camp,
and you're out flirting with hot royalty.

1280
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,333
I'm not flirting with Prince Thomas.

1281
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:16,625
[gasps] Oh, how you know
we were talking about the prince?

1282
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,208
- Yeah.
- We didn't say "prince."

1283
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:20,958
No. Maybe we were talking
about his dad, the king.

1284
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,833
Yeah. His waddles are smexy.

1285
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:24,833
- Have you kissed?
- Okay, hold up.

1286
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:27,083
Prince Thomas and I are just friends.

1287
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:30,833
Besides, he's about to get married.
You know I wouldn't do that.

1288
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,625
Finally, Petra! Where's the coffee at?
I need that in my veins.

1289
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,041
You okay?

1290
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:39,500
There's something you should see.

[Lola gasps]

1292
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:44,041
- See! I told you. You like him.
- D!

1293
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,958
You really like him.

1294
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,125
It's bad, isn't it? Yeah.

1295
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,250
Sorry. It's a cute photo, though.

1296
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:03,875
[sighs]

1297
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,125
Is something wrong?

[grunting]

1299
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,250
Oh, for heaven's sake! [sighs]

1300
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:18,291
- Think the LaMotts have seen this?
- Pray they haven't.

1301
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,041
Walter, come in here.

1302
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,041
Find Thomas
and bring him to us immediately.

1303
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:28,958
I want you to see to it that any copies
of this filth are destroyed,

1304
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:32,625
and please inform this girl
that her services are no longer necessary.

1305
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:36,625
But Miss Isabella is in charge
of hair and makeup for the wedding.

1306
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:39,375
There are two others.
They'll stay. She will go.

1307
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,250
- But I really feel that...
- John!

1308
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,333
Oh, no.

1309
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:46,291
We had a deal. That did not include
your boy hooking up with some hairdresser.

1310
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,750
- Y'all need to look at this.
- We've taken care of it.

1311
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:51,958
Yes, we... Walter! Now!

1312
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,541
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

1313
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,875
It better be. Because there's
a lot riding on this weddin'.

1314
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:00,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

1315
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:04,541
Izzy?

1316
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:08,833
Shoot.

1317
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:12,666
Where's Izzy?

1318
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,416
She left.

1319
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,875
- Please let me...
- It's okay.

1320
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,833
- Let me help you.
- No, please.

1321
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:25,916
Izzy.

1322
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:27,708
Izzy!

1323
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,916
- Izzy, where are you going?
- Haven't you heard? Walter fired me.

1324
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,666
I'm so sorry.

1325
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:35,375
Leave us.

1326
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,958
It's not his fault. Your parents made him.

1327
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:43,791
- They have no right.
- The king and queen have no right?

1328
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,250
Look. It doesn't matter.

1329
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,291
I'm making a mess of everything,
and I'm leavin'.

1330
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,583
No, that's not true.

1371
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,500
over your incident with the hairdresser?

1372
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:30,041
Son, you're about to get married.
Have some discretion.

1373
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:32,458
I'm not getting married.
I'm calling the wedding off.

1374
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:34,000
The wedding will proceed.

1375
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,875
Our entire lifestyle
and the fate of the crown rests upon it.

1376
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,708
What are you talking about?

1377
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,708
We…

1378
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,166
Are penniless.

1379
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,166
- Penniless?
- High inflation. Bad investments.

1380
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,791
Bad decisions.

1381
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,250
It's not easy for monarchs these days.

1382
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,708
Do you know how expensive it is
to heat a 200-room castle?

1383
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,333
Well, I don't either, but it's...

1384
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:04,583
The LaMotts wanted land to develop.
We needed cash.

1385
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,041
That's the arrangement
in the arranged marriage.

1386
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,500
Wait, what... what land?

1387
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:13,291
The Uber. As the city's grown,
it's become quite prime real estate.

1388
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,791
And the LaMotts are renovating it
for the people?

1389
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:20,041
Well, they're renovating it.
But not for those people.

1390
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,000
"Those people"?

1391
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,208
We had no choice.

1392
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:24,833
I will not be a part of the injustice
done to that community.

1393
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:25,750
Thomas.

1394
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:27,458
Thomas! Just wait.

1395
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:32,500
Go forth with the wedding,
and we promise you we'll do right by them.

1396
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:35,375
We will find them a better place to live.

1397
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:38,041
Your marriage is our only hope
for survival.

1398
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,125
[sighs]

1399
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,958
[classical music plays]

1400
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,708
We got this.

1401
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:13,916
For the salon,
for each other, but most of all…

1402
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:15,333
[both] For Izzy.

1403
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,625
[intense drumbeat playing]

1404
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,791
Who's ready to look gorgeous today?

1405
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,125
Get your patootie in the chair, sweetie.
We about to go in.

1406
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,208
[exhales]

1407
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,000
[Lola] Okay, D. I'm here for you.

1408
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,708
- Hairbrush.
- Hairbrush.

1409
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:37,875
You ready?

1410
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:40,291
Let's go.

1411
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,625
[clock ticking]

1412
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,250
What do you think of this hat?

1413
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,750
Excellent!

1414
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,625
What's excellent about it?

1415
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,583
Thomas, I grew up in a very small village.

1416
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,541
As it so happened,
I did very well in school,

1417
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:18,541
and by the time I was a young man,

1418
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,541
I had caught the attention
of the Royal Academy

1419
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,416
who offered me the coveted job
of tutoring the young prince,

1420
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,083
a very naughty three-year-old boy.

1421
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,625
The problem was there was someone,

1422
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:32,666
Richard,

1423
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,375
and we were very much in love.

1424
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,166
But when you're called to duty,
you must go.

1425
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:39,833
What happened to Richard?

1426
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,625
I had to leave him behind.

1427
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,708
Why are you telling me all this?

1428
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,958
'Cause I have enjoyed a privileged life

1429
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,500
no one in my village
could ever have dreamed of.

1430
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:54,125
I have a wonderful job and all
the material possessions one could want.

1431
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:00,333
Yet, what does it all mean without love?

1432
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,166
I'm sorry.

1433
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,625
Don't get married.

1434
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:15,083
What about Father and Catherine?

1435
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,666
The last time I checked,
they were grown adults.

1436
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,708
They got into this mess,
they should get themselves out.

1437
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:22,625
You're not in love with Lauren.

1438
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,125
You're in love with Izzy.

1439
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:31,791
I don't think she loves me.

1440
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,958
I know love when I see it.

1441
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,791
I hate the hat.

1442
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,083
[both laughing]

1443
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:45,958
- [straining]
- [grunting]

1444
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,125
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.

1445
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:01,708
[sighs]

1446
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,791
The anticipation is killing me, ladies.

1447
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:07,083
[Destiny] Okay, we're done.

1448
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,291
Boom.

1449
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,208
Oh, my stars!

1450
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:16,000
Her hair, her makeup, she…

1451
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,250
I've never seen her look lovelier.

1452
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,333
You're all incredible. [chuckles]

1453
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:22,541
Where you located?

1454
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,250
183rd Street,
right next to Cho's Dry Cleaners.

1455
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,666
We accept walk-ins.

1456
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,041
Pardon me.

1457
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,958
I'd like to speak to Lauren.

1458
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,750
Alone.

1459
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,291
Well, no, that's not possible.

1460
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,375
I'm afraid it is.

1461
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,166
Have you checked the flowers recently?

1462
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,666
I heard the delivery man
was stuck or something.

1463
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:47,500
- Apparently they were covered in slugs.
- He said you needed geraniums…

1464
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,750
Lauren, I, uh, I know
this is our wedding day,

1465
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:56,291
so the timing of this is a bit off.

1466
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,666
Not just a bit, quite a bit.

1467
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:02,500
You're a wonderful person. It's not that.

1468
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:06,208
And I know it's awful
when people say, "It's not you, it's me."

1469
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:08,833
But it is. It is me.

1470
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,833
I... Call me old-fashioned,

1471
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:14,833
but I like to think that love
should be a factor in getting married,

1472
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,291
the... the main factor.

1473
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,041
- And, well...
- Thomas, stop.

1474
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:23,916
You're smiling.

1475
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:26,416
I don't wanna get married either.

1476
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,458
[relieved sigh] Yes.

1477
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,541
[both chuckle, sigh]

1478
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,291
Always a pleasure.

1479
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,500
What was that nonsense all about?

1480
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:44,041
Mom, we need to talk.

1481
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,625
[soft gasp]

1482
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:57,125
[both whispering] Oh, my God!

1483
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,875
Hi.

1484
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,875
Mrs. Johnson.

1485
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:10,333
Izzy! Baby, you're back.

1486
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,958
I'm so sorry
you had to cut your big trip short.

1487
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,500
- It's okay. It was time to leave.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

1488
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:21,666
This always makes you feel better.
On the house.

1489
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,625
No, thank you, Mrs. Johnson.
My tabloid days are over.

1490
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:27,041
- [kids] Izzy!
- Hey! Hi.

1491
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:30,416
I missed you guys so much.
Get over here. Yes!

1492
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,000
Got you presents.

1493
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,083
Boom,

1494
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,833
boom, and boom.

1495
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,000
I have no idea either.

1496
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,916
Izzy, you should've seen the fire.

1497
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,458
Yeah, if you were here,
you could've put it out.

1498
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,583
Probably not this time.

1499
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:58,333
[Izzy's mom gasps]

1500
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:00,416
Oh, my baby's home!

1501
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,833
Oh, look!

1502
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:05,541
[in Italian] There was nothing
we could do. It all went up so fast.

1503
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,541
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

1504
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,833
Izzy, we tried to save your globe.

1505
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,625
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1506
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,333
Sorry.

1507
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:19,416
[slow clapping]

1508
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,458
Well, well, well…

1509
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,875
I've warned you
about that slow clappin', Doug.

1510
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,208
You did it this time, didn't you, Izzy?

1511
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:30,625
Unless you got more money,

1512
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:34,458
and I mean a lot more money,
in that magic globe of yours,

1513
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:36,583
I don't know what I will tell the owner.

1514
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:42,083
Don't worry about it.
Mr. Bartoli and I have already spoken.

1515
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:45,208
You spoke to Mr. Bartoli? How did you...

1516
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:47,791
He was surprised to hear
about the trouble with the property,

1517
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:50,250
since he paid you
to have it rewired a year ago.

1518
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,625
Well, he paid me. I...

1519
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,916
He was more surprised to hear about
the money you've collected from me.

1520
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,541
Money he's never seen.

1521
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:59,125
He sounded pretty upset.

1522
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,875
- He did?
- He did.

1523
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,625
- He did?
- He did.

1524
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:03,916
[gulps loudly]

1525
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,875
Get out of my salon, Doug.

1526
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,750
- Ow!
- [Izzy] Oh!

1527
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,750
[kids] It's a rubber band shooter!

1528
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,083
[all laughing]

1529
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:17,208
[Izzy] Hey, hey, Doug.

1530
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:19,916
Know what I love about this neighborhood?

1531
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,916
Huh?

1532
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,791
Everything.

1533
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,416
<i>- Adios!</i>
- Get out of here!

1534
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,541
<i>Ciao, bello.</i>

1535
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,625
[Izzy] That's right, keep on walking.

1536
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,375
- [kids shouting]
- [Doug] Get away!

1537
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,083
Thank God you're home!

1538
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,916
[romantic Italian ballad playing]

1539
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,958
Yes, thank you very...
That's enough. Thank you.

1540
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:49,250
You know, I think the salon burning down
was a blessing in disguise.

1541
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:53,958
We are free of Doug,
and with Mr. Bartoli rebuilding the salon,

1542
