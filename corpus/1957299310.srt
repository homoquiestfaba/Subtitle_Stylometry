00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,556
Goddammit, see
that's the thing,

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,057
I also don't understand

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,025
when people say things like
Goddammit or Jesus Christ

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,528
for a curse.

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,128
No matter what religious
affiliation you come from,

7
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,730
we can all agree
that Jesus Christ

8
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,966
was like a really
good dude, right?

9
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,501
So like, why did we
say it as a curse?

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,470
Why don't we replace
it with like,

11
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,104
I don't know terrible people.

12
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,407
You stub your toe, you're
like, "Oh, Adolf Hitler."

13
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,476
Or like you pour hot coffee
in your lap, you're like,

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,679
"Oh, oh, hot coffee,
Christopher Columbus."

15
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,913
Christopher Columbus?

16
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,349
Oh yeah, apparently
a really bad dude.

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,251
We were completely misinformed
in elementary school.

18
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,254
Oh, stupid guy
can't catch the ball.

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,854
These pro athletes
get paid millions

20
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:56,390
of dollars a year
to catch balls.

21
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,891
You'd think their video game
avatars could do the same.

22
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,160
If I was a pro, I
would catch every pass.

23
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,597
Oh yeah, just like you'd
make every single sale?

24
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,798
So why aren't you out there
making your millions then?

25
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,701
Oh dude, you have no idea.

26
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,069
I have a mint idea in the works.

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,374
You put your kids in a car
seat and they are contained.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,575
The nice, steady rocking

29
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,109
of your vehicle
knocks them right out.

30
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,580
Kids always fall
asleep in the car.

31
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,686
And that is why I came
up with the bed seats.

32
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,955
All you have to do is
strap your little spawn

33
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,424
in with these restraints

34
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,459
and they will never be
able to climb out of bed,

35
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:36,796
and they will finally fall
asleep when you want them to.

36
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:41,834
And as an added bonus, patent
pending car simulation.

37
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,439
[generator engine roaring]

38
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,211
Obviously just a
prototype, oh [chuckles].

39
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,847
A couple more tweaks, those
things will sell like dog meat

40
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,216
at a Chinese wet market.

41
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm having an affair.

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,293
You're what?

43
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,530
I'm seeing another girl.

44
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,499
Just like in like a movie,
real world adult shit man.

45
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,734
I'm cheating on my wife.

46
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,036
A little bam bam in the ham.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,639
Bone storming the castle.

48
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,208
Going to pound town
with another bunny.

49
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,876
Pickle tickle by
another chicken.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,180
Okay, okay wait,
going to pound town?

51
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,182
This is the time to
try out that phase?

52
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,621
You're serious?

53
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,889
Yeah, what do you think?

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,096
I think you're a
complete son of a.

58
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,543
Oh no, it's just daddy.

59
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,224
Ah, Saddam Hussein.

60
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,794
- Hey babe.
- Hey.

61
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,128
How was the game?

62
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,934
The game, the
game was fantastic.

63
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,637
I crushed it.

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,305
You would have
been so impressed.

65
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:04,076
Matt however is the most
disappointing human being

66
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,747
I've ever met in my entire life.

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,614
Why?

68
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,253
You promise not
to tell anyone?

69
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,389
Sure.

70
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,457
You promise not
to tell anyone?

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,891
- Sure.
- Not even Jen.

72
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,398
Matt is putting his banana
into a different fruit salad.

73
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,099
What, he's cheating on Maddie?

74
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,936
- Yep.
- Get out, does she know?

75
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,239
- Nope.
- What about the kids?

76
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,042
I don't think
they know either.

77
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,646
Okay no, I mean like what
is gonna happen to them?

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,481
Those poor kids!

79
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,015
This is all so crazy.

80
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,084
I can't even process this.

81
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,887
Yeah, I totally understand.

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,823
This is like beyond insane.

83
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:53,360
My best friend got a
passport, packed his bags,

84
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:57,264
purchased a ticket and flew
straight to pound town.

85
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,732
I'm sorry babe, it's rough.

86
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,802
Can you turn on a
show or something?

87
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,437
I gotta get my mind off of this.

Hey Chad, I'd like to buy this.

91
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,276
Go ahead and scan it.

92
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,177
Excuse me?

93
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,381
Grab a scanner and scan.

94
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,250
Isn't that your job?

95
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,958
[scanner beeps]

96
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,227
$2.32.

97
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,848
Can I get a bag please?

98
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,686
Sure.

99
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:38,164
Wow, excellent
customer service dude.

100
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,068
Thanks for shopping at
Big Jim's corner store!

[doorbell dings]

102
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,477
I've got some
potentially upsetting news.

103
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,845
Oh no, now what?

104
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,447
Monthly promotion changed.

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,181
Ugh, you gotta be kidding me.

106
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,583
I know, again.

107
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,918
They gotta stop
doing this four days

108
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,653
before the month starts.

109
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,389
I'll send you the
email, make the changes.

110
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,457
Thanks Rene.

[upbeat music]

112
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,037
Mary, did you get the info
on the change for next month?

113
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,672
- No.
- If I send you some numbers,

114
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,940
can you replace them for me?

115
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,441
- Sure.
- All right, thanks.

116
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,878
Chandelle are those new
website photos ready?

117
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,449
- No, Ricky had those.
- Thank you.

[upbeat music]

119
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,589
Carol, have you seen Ricky?

120
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,457
Okay, thank you.

121
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,228
Hey, have you seen Ricky?

122
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,363
Not since this morning.

123
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,301
Hey man, have you seen Ricky?

124
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,976
Ricky?

125
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,911
Oh sorry Doug, just
looking for Ricky.

126
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,248
Ricky, oh hey you look good man.

127
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,450
No chance, bro.

128
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
No one can find him.

129
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,359
Ricky, do you have the
updated photos for the website?

130
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,894
Which ones?

131
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,829
The updated product shots
for next month's promotion.

132
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,597
- It changed?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,632
To what?

134
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,233
Now if you buy a
garden solar panel kit,

135
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,435
you also get a garden toolkit.

136
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,103
That's lame.

137
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,604
It's actually a
really nice kit.

138
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,039
Still lame.

139
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,675
It comes with the nice leather
carrying bag and an apron.

140
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,877
Chandelle should be on that.

141
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,779
Chandelle, are you kidding me?

142
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,880
Are you sure?

143

Oh, come on!

Are you sure?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Chandelle
should be on that project.

[upbeat music]
She's better.

148
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,297
- Chandelle?
- Yep.

149
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,798
Ricky told me that
you were working

150
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,400
in the new garden tool kit
photos for the website?

151
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,802
- Yep.
- Okay, but you told me

152
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,871
that Ricky, never mind.

153
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,774
Can you email them to me please?

154
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,075
- Yep.
- Thank you.

155
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,584
Turns out we're going
to the original plan

156
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,018
for promotion this month.

157
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,955
- Great.
- No need to change.

158
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,142
- Hey Tim.
- What's up?

159
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,216
You know, those
are for everyone.

160
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,951
I know, I'm just putting
a stash of them at my desk.

161
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,622
But what if we run
out of them in here?

162
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,427
Look, the fruit
snacks always go first.

163
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,629
That's why I take a huge stash

164
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,464
and I just put
them in my drawer.

165
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,400
I mean, are we supposed to
go to your desk to grab them?

166
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,669
Either I can come up

167
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:07,174
and grab one every day
like a homeless person

168
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,410
or I can just come grab them
all at once every month.

169
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,946
It's actually more
time efficient bro.

170
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,781
That's for you.

171
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,016
I think we'd prefer for you

172
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,551
to come in here
though once a day.

173
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,189

where inefficiency is best,

[gentle music]

181
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,170
- [Connor laughing]
- [Teddy] No Connor,

182
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,339
why would you show me that?

183
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,773
- That's disgusting.
- It's fricking awesome.

184
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:14,708
Here, look at this one.

185
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,344
[Teddy] No, no I'm good.

186
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,577
And you're terrible.

187
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,745
You're a terrible,
horrible person.

188
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,013
Wait, what's
going on down there.

189
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,215
Connor's showing me
pictures of his poop.

190
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,317
What, it's human art form.

191
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,118
I mean, look at this log.

192
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,287
I did this this morning.

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,821
It came straight down,

194
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,324
landed perfectly vertical
in the toilet bowl.

195
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,925
I'm surprised it
didn't fall over.

196
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,193
I mean, look at this?

197
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,695
- No.
- Okay, okay, let me see it.

198
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,863
[Connor] Look at that.

199
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,732
That is awesome.

200
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,234
Okay all right, let me see.

201
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,837
Oh, oh my gosh no.

202
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,071
Okay, take this.

203
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,341
You know what, full disclosure

204
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,775
and I'm no expert
on this Connor,

205
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,379
but I'm fairly certain
COVID-19 originated with you.

206
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,613
It's just poop,
everybody poops.

207
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,982
It's a book, a New
York Times bestseller.

208
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,652
I mean, why do we have to
be so weird about poop?

209
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,787
Hell, you know who poops?

210
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,588
The Pope.

211
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,891
The Pope poops.
Also true.

212
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,159
Adam, Adam, save us please.

213
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,661
All right, all right,
all right guys listen up.

214
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,163
Poll question, so I'm
at the office, right?

215
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,564
And I'm in the
community break room

216
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,633
and this stupid little
hipster kid walks in

217
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,502
and steals all the fruit snacks

218
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,470
and stashes them at his desk.

219
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,273
He does that so that he
doesn't have to keep getting up

220
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,540
to get more.

221
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,410
Now I say one fruit
snack for one trip.

222
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,244
What say you?

223
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,077
Wait, who was it?

224
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,545
Tim, the Copywriter.

225
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,846
Oh yeah, that
guy's a total douche.

226
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,448
- Douche.
- No, it's fine by me.

227
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,116
I mean, whatever makes
your life easier.

228
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,751
Connor, your whole
life is the easier.

229
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,254
What about the rest
of the employees?

230
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,621
Survival by the fittest?

231
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,022
- Survival of the fittest?
- Yes, survival

232
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:36,856
- of the fittest.
- Connor,

233
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,991
they're for everyone.

234
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,192
It's not the fricking
hunger games.

235
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,995
[dramatic music]

236
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,481
Ugh yeah, I can't even
rationalize that line of thinking.

237
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,983
It bothers me so much

238
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,617
that there's all these dumb
millennial kids just doing

239
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,086
whatever they want.

240
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,055
Whoa Adam, you know
you're millennial, right?

241
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,257
- Yeah.
- What?

242
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,792
No, I'm not.

243
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,928
- Yeah, you are.
- You guys?

244
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,263
What year were you born?

245
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,064
- '86.
- Yup.

246
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:22,203
- Ooh, millennial.
- Millennial.

247
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,437
No, no, no, no, no.

248
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,272
Let's see that.
From 1982 to 2004.

249
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,806
- Yep, that's you.
- What, no!

250
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,309
- Totally.
- You guys,

251
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,076
I always thought millennial
were like way younger than me.

252
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,746
I'm not terribly old,
but I always put myself

253
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,747
in the Gen X tribe.

254
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,615
No way, Gen X is the lame.

255
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,485
But that's how I
lived my whole life.

256
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,785
I always worked really hard

257
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,587
and always tried to
do the right thing.

258
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,122
I hate millennial mentality.

259
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,992
Could you try the organic
lotion on my feet?

260
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,528
I just love the way
it makes my toes feel.

261
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,596
Do you hear that?

262
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,797
Yeah, he's always millennial.

263
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,299
Hey, make sure you get
your cuticles this time.

264
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,367
We saw your feet last week,

265
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,436
- oh my gosh.
- Okay, stop.

266
00:13:55,469 --> 00:14:00,441
[store bell rings]
[mid tempo music]

267
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,468
Hey, I wanna buy this drink
and you're gonna sell it to me.

268
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,668
So get off your damn phone

269
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,570
and scan it and then
put it in a bag.

270
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,417
Now ask me if I want the
receipt in the bag, ask me.

271
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,618
Would you like your
receipt in your bag?

272
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,920
No, no I wouldn't.

273
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,464
[store bell ringing]

274
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,765
Actually, I don't know what
kind of credit card information

275
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,334
is left on there.

276
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,668
Oh, just the last four digits,

277
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,169
but still I don't wanna give you

278
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,939
or anyone else the satisfaction
knowing the last four digits

279
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,475
of my credit card dipshit.

280
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,581
Thanks for shopping at
Big Jim's corner store.

281
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,350
[crickets chirping]

282
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,084
- Hey babe
- Hey.

283
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,688
What's wrong?

284
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,457
I'm a fricking
millennial that's what.

285
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:25,559
- What?
- A millennial.

286
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:29,028
A selfish, lazy penis
ball cancer on society.

287
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,598
I'm sorry to hear that.

288
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,032
Okay, you don't care.

289
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,602
Go ahead and make fun of me.

290
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,603
No, no, no, no,

291
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,736
I'm not making fun of you.

292
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,606
And newsflash,
you're one of them too.

293
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,609
So what's the big deal
with being a millennial?

294
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,876
I hate them.

295
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,677
I don't even want to
identify with them.

296
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,013
The millennial mentality
is the complete opposite

297
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,549
of all of my core beliefs.

298
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,884
I know, one might say that
they are the inferior race.

299
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,419
- Exactly.
- I know [laughs].

300
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:57,023
Okay, you're definitely
making fun of me.

301
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,993
Okay yeah, that time I was,
but I wasn't the first time.

302
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,129
I can't even get the
support of my own wife.

303
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,233
Okay, I don't get it, just
because you are a millennial,

304
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,369
it doesn't mean you
have to be one of them.

305
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,603
Well, that's just it.

306
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,137
I realized I hate
millennials so much

307
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,872
because I'm jealous of them.

308
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,642
Everything they do
is the exact opposite

309
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,210
of how I live my life.

310
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,778
I'm uptight, stressed
out, a little dramatic.

311
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,013
A little?

312
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,915
The point is I do
everything by the book

313
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,251
and I look at these piss
hand kids and I'm envious

314
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,685
of how nonchalant they are,

315
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,053
how they can do whatever
the hell they want

316
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,489
without any consequences.

317
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,723
Okay, well I'm sure there
are some consequences.

318
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,824
I can't stop
thinking about this.

319
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,026
Thinking about what?

320
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,061
About embracing millennialism.

321
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,531
Okay, well I think you
should just go to bed

322
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,333
and you'll stop
thinking about it.

323
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,733
I'm pretty sure this is
just like another one

324
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,436
of your things.

325
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,505
I'm gonna start
living among my people.

326
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm going to become
a millennial.

327
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,512
Meaning what exactly?

328
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,746
I'm gonna start
being more selfish.

329
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,482
If I want a piece of
cake for breakfast,

330
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,352
I'm gonna eat a flipping
piece of cake for breakfast.

331
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,820
No more being Mr. Responsible.

332
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,523
So you're just going to
start doing whatever you want?

333
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,923
- Whatever.
- Absolutely whatever?

334
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:08,094
Completely whatever,
100% whatever I want.

335
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,397
So is this like the
one time you went vegan?

336
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,834
Do you guys have anything
vegan that comes on a bone?

337
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,440
[chuckles] All right,
does this little game

338
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,575
include other women?

339
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,843
[chuckles] Oh no,
this is no game.

340
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,044
All right, I know,

341
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,547
but you're just
like way too sweet.

342
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,748
You can't even come up with
your top five celebrity list.

343
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,517
Okay well, that is
way too much pressure.

344
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,751
Only five women?

345
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,220
My goodness, too
many parameters go

346
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:34,655
into that decision for me.

347
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,989
I mean, who is on your top five?

348
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,191
Will Smith, Channing
Tatum, Zac Efron,

349
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,328
Dwayne the Rock
Johnson and Gal Gadot.

350
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:43,129
Okay well, that was a little
bit delivered too quickly

351
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,465
for my liking.

352
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,533
I know, but if you come
to bed, I will show you

353
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,569
who my main man is.

354
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,671
I can't, I feel like my
heart's beating out of my chest.

355
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:53,072
Is the millennial you
just like that excited?

356
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,742
Nope, I had my
first energy drink.

357
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,175
I think it's working
a little bit too good.

358
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,211
A little too well.

359
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,946
[birds chirping]

360
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,915
- Hey man.
- Hey, what's up?

361
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:03,783
Oh, nothing.

362
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,420
Are you going to work?

363
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,455
Yeah, I just wanted
to talk about something

364
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,291
- with you real quick.
- Okay.

365
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,827
I just figured you'd be
someone who would understand

366
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,095
what I'm going through.

367
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,431
- Eggs?
- No, I'm good.

368
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,899
So with your inside information,

369
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,636
what is the next big social
movement going to be?

370
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,605
My inside information?

371
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,674
Yeah, so I was late
to the whole acceptance

372
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,041
of the gay phase.

373
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,108
Not a phase.

374
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,711
What I mean is I was
the borderline bigot

375
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,111
to the gay community
even though now I've come

376
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,046
to accept their decision.

377
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,281
Not a decision.

378
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:35,649
Okay, I need you to
stop taking offense

379
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:36,517
to everything I'm saying.

380
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,451
Stop being offensive.

381
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,719
Okay, just listen all right?

382
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,186
This isn't about your stuff.

383
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,423
This is about my stuff so
just shut up and deal with it.

384
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm not trying to offend you.

385
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,392
Well, you are so.

386
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:46,226
Oh well, I'm sorry.

387
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,461
It's so hard

388
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,195
for me considering I think
all gays are going to hell.

389
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,264
Nice, and more simply

390
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,732
because you think
penises are gross.

391
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,199
Well, I'm even
repulsed by my own.

392
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,435
Love is love, man.

393
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,236
Okay, and that's
exactly why I'm here.

394
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,104
Look, I don't care
about the gays.

395
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,407
Screw them, I missed
that social fight.

396
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:04,177
Ah, straight White
male life, so simple.

397
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,313
Okay, I can fight for my
straight White male rights

398
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:07,781
if I had to.

399
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:08,716
Could you though?

400
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:09,916
Thank you all for coming.

401
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,219
- Yeah, USA, USA
- [Crowd] USA, USA.

402
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,288
Go away, go away.

403
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,123
This was a mistake.

404
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,261
Guys put the signs
down, put the sign down.

405
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,331
Okay, shut up.

406
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,533
Look, what is the next big
social movement going to be?

407
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,303
What do you mean you don't know?

408
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,671
Teddy, come on.

409
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,406
I need to be on the front
lines of accepting it.

410
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,074
Adam, it's not like the gays

411
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,876
or the minorities get together

412
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,481
and have secret meetings
about how to overtake society.

413
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,182
Bestiality it's
bestiality isn't it?

414
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:44,752
I'll do love is love.

415
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh come on, man.

416
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,321
I'm on your team.

417
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,822
I don't want you on my team,

418
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:50,657
but also I don't know what the
next big social movement is.

419
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,893
I think everyone should
love who they wanna love

420
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,195
and be comfortable and accepted

421
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,531
for who they are, that's it.

422
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,632
That is so generic.

423
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,199
I got a question geez.

424
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,703
Sorry to interrupt your love.

425
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,374
If God doesn't accept
homosexuality, right?

426
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:11,110
Sorry Teddy, and he does not
accept bestiality, right?

427
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:14,080
Is it more worse
or more punishable

428
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:17,718
if like a human dude got
it on with an animal dude?

429
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,720
Or is it like two
different things,

430
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,423
or is it because there's two
negatives it makes a positive?

431
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,457
Does it even matter?

432
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,593
Connor, you are
completely naked

433
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,662
in front of your gay roommate.

434
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,531
Relax, I mean it's not

435
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,633
like Teddys' gonna
rape me or anything.

436
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,602
Still Jezebel, you're just
throwing temptation out there.

437
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:36,670
Oh, hold on.

438
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,639
That is closer to bestiality.

439
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:43,644
- Wow, hey!
- Oh, come back here Rona.

440
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,078
Oh come on, don't be so sad.

441
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,414
We're just playing.

442
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,182
I love you Connor.

443
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,751
Anyway, what is this,
what's happening?

444
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,487
Oh, well I have
decided to come out

445
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,322
of my proverbial
closet if you will

446
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,459
and embrace my
millennialistic ways.

447
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,992
What does that even mean?

448
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,595
I'm glad you asked.

449
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,664
Ah, I wondered
what that was for.

450
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,301
Okay, let's see here.

451
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,137
Millennial, a person
reaching young adulthood

452
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,775
in the early 21st century who
grew up on computer technology

453
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:18,712
and is often referred to as
the me, me, me generation.

454
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:19,947
Okay?

455
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,851
So I am going to
become a millennial.

456
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:26,653
Okay, just so I
have this straight.

457
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,689
You coming out as a millennial

458
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:31,325
is the same as me
coming out as gay.

459
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,327
See, I knew you'd get it.

460
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:37,564
- You're so brave.
- Thank you.

461
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,098
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

462
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,668
Millennial wouldn't even
be in this dictionary.

463
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:48,976
Oh okay, I think you
might be more millennial

464
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,712
than you give
yourself credit for.

465
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,012
What?

466
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,882
I wanted it to have a
more dramatic effect.

467
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,283
No, this is nice.

468
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,317
I like this.

469
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,585
Good job, I approve.

470
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,553
Thank you.

471
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,954
How long did that take you?

472
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:01,755
Way too long.

473
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:06,158
[mid tempo music]

474
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,703
- Hello there, Father.
- Hello brother.

475
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,472
What can I help you with?

476
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,742
Oh father, I am
here to prepent.

477
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:22,743
You're here to what?

478
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:23,977
- Prepent
- Prepent?

479
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,979
Prepent, I would
like to confess

480
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,381
of sins I'm going to commit.

481
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,849
It's not exactly how it works.

482
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,018
Well, I figured I can come
in here and take care of all

483
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,619
of the guilt and the feeling bad

484
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,521
and the confession stuff
now so I can go out

485
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,690
and enjoy the sin with
a clear conscience.

486
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,860
We are here to avoid sin.

487
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,895
- Right.
- And to try our best

488
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,797
- to be like Jesus.
- Right, I get that.

489
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,265
But you're wanting to go sin?

490
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,800
- Correct.
- And confess those sins

491
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,302
before we actually
commit those sins.

492
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,469
Correct, you get it.

493
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,103
This isn't in God's teachings.

494
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,473
- Agreed.
- So why would you want

495
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:54,741
to go sin?

496
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,175
Well, I figured we're
all imperfect, right?

497
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,744
- Right.
- And we all sin, correct?

498
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,078
- Correct.
- So why not confess

499
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,147
of the sin now so we
can enjoy them later?

500
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,250
Because then those
things would be even worse.

501
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:04,484
Why?

502
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:05,919
Because they'd be
premeditated sins.

503
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:07,521
Well, that's why I
wanna confess of them now.

504
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,256
Prepentance isn't a thing.

505
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,424
I beg to differ.

506
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,858
I'm literally
doing it right now.

507
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:14,328
Sort of a confession
before the crime.

508
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,562
What's the difference?

509
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,331
What kinds of sins are
we talking about here?

510
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:18,966
Oh, I don't know exactly.

511
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,434
Then how are we
supposed to prepent

512
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,935
if you don't know
what your sins are?

513
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,403
So prepentance is a thing?

514
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,005
I'm just trying to understand.

515
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,340
What propellant is.

516
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,275
No, I fully get the concept.

517
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,877
I want to understand what
sins you're wanting to do.

518
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,111
Well, here's the thing.

519
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,680
I have been a pretty
straight shooter.

520
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm talking grade
A heavy material.

521
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:37,484
That's a good thing.

522
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,886
But I'm going through
this like life crisis.

523
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,855
And I just wanna let
loose, Carpe diem,

524
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:45,392
sow my wild oats, rub my
nose into some fruit salad

525
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,226
if you will.

526
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,461
But you don't know

527
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,096
what commandments you
would want to break?

528
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:51,832
No, no, no, not really.

529
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,433
I mean, I'm open to
some suggestions.

530
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,935
I just know I wanna
become a millennial

531
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,503
and basically be more selfish

532
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,673
and do whatever the hell I
want, oh excuse me father.

533
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,075
My worry is that you
will stumble into sin

534
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,678
and then not be able to get
yourself back out of it.

535
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:08,315
Right, right, that's
definitely a possibility.

536
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,449
What about your family?

537
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:10,651
Oh, they're on board.

538
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,388
I guess that settles it.

539
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,722
So I have your blessing then?

540
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,124
- No.
- You vocally said no there

541
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,093
but I feel like
your heart said yes.

542
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,795
- No
- I love you Father.

543
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,041
What's going on here?

544
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,611
They're seeing who can
hold their pee the most.

545
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,780
Okay you guys, I came
here to reveal my big plan

546
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,449
and how I'm gonna start living
my life as a millennial.

547
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,351
My third life
crisis if you will.

548
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,054
That makes it sound like
it's your third life crisis.

549
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,856
I think you've had one,
two, three life crisises.

550
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,558
Good point, not like
it's a third point

551
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,360
in your life crisis?

552
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:54,861
Mid-life crisis works.

553
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,897
If we used half-life crisis,
it would just cause confusion.

554
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,066
Okay, but like a third of my
life, what would I call that?

555
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,567
I think that's why
a third life crisis

556
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,601
isn't a thing bud.

557
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,237
Why are you doing so
much better than he is?

558
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,673
Oh, I didn't even come close
to drinking my gallon of water.

559
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:10,944
You beautiful bastard,
you son of a, move, move.

560
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,581
First order of business,
get some new friends.

561
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:15,849
Whatever.

562
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,184
I don't mean I'm
gonna replace you.

563
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,418
I just need additional friends.

564
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,854
I just need a splash
of class in my life.

565
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:23,857
Where do I find sophisticated
people like the ones

566
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,228
that go to museums or
talk politics or whatnot?

567
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,996
How about at a museum?

568
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,999
Okay, but I don't want
to actually go to a museum.

569
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,234
Okay, so what is that?

570
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,003
I didn't make it.

571
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,875
Connor, go take a shower.

572
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,310
Why do I even have to tell you?

573
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,611
That should be your next step.

574
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:47,514
- Sorry, jeez.
- Awesome.

575
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,217
It's not like I drank
a gallon of water.

576
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,717
All right you guys, come on.

577
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,588
It's time for me to reveal
my plan "Home Alone" style.

578
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,089
I don't understand
that reference.

579
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,691
You know, when little
Kevin makes the blueprints

580
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,959
for when the robbers are coming?

581
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,327
That's a pretty
obscure reference..

582
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,561
Dude come on, just go with it.

583
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,763
You're ruining my
big reveal here.

584
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:05,098
I mean, if you
were just gone aah!

585
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:06,800
Then I'd be right
there with you.

586
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,001
That has nothing
to do with this.

587
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,237
Well then, use a
reference that works.

588
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:10,971
I'm sorry, it's just
the best Christmas movie

589
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,572
of all time I would
have expected you

590
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:14,040
- to get it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

591
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,309
"Home Alone" is not even
the best "Home Alone" movie

592
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,712
of all time, let alone
the best Christmas movie.

593
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,947
Are you suggesting that
when little Kevin is lost

594
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:22,983
in New York City that
that's a superior film?

595
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,285
- Yeah.
- Cheap for a sequel rip off

596
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,321
as if Mr. And Mrs. McCallister
would lose their son again.

597
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,891
Not to mention the title has
nothing to do with the plot.

598
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,392
He's not even home alone again.

599
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,228
Whatever, it's still not
the best Christmas movie

600
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,061
of all time.

601
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,396
Oh yeah, what is?

602
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,664
"Love Actually".

603
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,467
[scoffs]Yeah, I mean maybe.

604
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,002
[scoffs] I'm sure all
your gay friends say that.

605
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,770
Lift yourself higher Adam.

606
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:48,276
Okay, so basically
I made a detailed list

607
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:51,645
of all the things that I could
find that millennials do.

608
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,015
A simple Excel spreadsheet
would have sufficed.

609
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,684
Yeah, but not nearly
as cool or dramatic.

610
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,986
I expected you to be the
one to understand this.

611
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,023
Oh my God, another
gay stereotype.

612
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,192
That is so sweet.

613
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,693
Dude, you should dust off some

614
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:09,396
of your famous high school
journalism with this.

615
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,331
Are you concerned with
a modern day cast being

616
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,301
in a Shakespeare period piece?.

617
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,167
Nope.

618
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:19,273
Drama in the drama club.

619
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:22,310
Rumor has it that chip prices
will increase next week.

620
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:24,278
Can you confirm?

621
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:25,545
I don't know.

622
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:28,949
Inflation attacks
high school ta ta tan!

623
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,588
Whatever the high school
equivalent of a Pulitzer prize is,

624
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,122
I would have it.

625
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,091
Whatever Adam, this is just
another one of your charades.

626
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,426
You'll be done with
this soon enough.

627
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:40,994
Not this time my gay friend.

628
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,297
Props to you.

629
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,399
The next time you both see me,

630
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:49,002
I will be a full
blown millennial.

631
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,608
Bye!
[door slams shut]

632
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:57,777
Anyways, I think if the
entire world converted to bamboo

633
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:59,713
instead of use plastic,

634
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,915

Why did you do that?

Well, it was a diss kind of cake

676
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:39,172
and they said they would put
whatever I wanted on the cake.

677

Okay no, why did you quit?

Well, I was doing a job
that I hated for so long.

00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,248
It was time for me to be happy.

I don't think
that was really fair

681
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,220
that you didn't even talk
to me about it first.

682
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:54,854
Well trust me, this
is just one little step

683
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:55,855
of my millennial journey.

684
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:57,224
Okay well, I hope
that works out.

685

Hey, I got you.

686
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,062
Yeah well, curiosity
killed the cat you know?

687
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,596
So I have nine
lives to do my thing.

688
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,831
That is not what that means.

689
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,099
It means that the
cat was so curious,

690
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:06,966
it ended up killing itself.

691
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,235
Why not curiosity
killed the dog.

692
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,803
I mean, I guess cats are
more curious than dogs.

693
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,571
I don't know, I find
dogs quite curious.

694
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,106
Okay, that's
not what it means.

695
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:14,275
And I didn't come up with
the saying so you can stop

696
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,809
- being an ass hat.
- Stupid saying really.

00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:17,010

698
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,178

you don't have a job?

me for my paycheck?

girl has got to eat.

00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,017
Okay, we're gonna be fine.

703
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,653
I have enough PTO cash that
will last a while, all right?

704
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,893
[mid tempo music]

705
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,500
- Hey there!
- Hello, are you Sydney?

706
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,935
That's me.

707
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:44,205
I'm Adam, I'm
here to interview

708
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,039
for the barrister position.

709
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,241
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

710
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:52,078
- Corporate guy aren't you?
- Was.

711
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:52,912
Why'd you quit?

712
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,150
No more Mr. Ratchett.

713
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:00,720
Keep playing [snickers].

714
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,592
I'm just looking for
something new and exciting.

715
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:11,332
- Huh?
- Huh, what?

716
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,634
Don't know if
you'd be a fit here.

717
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,902
Why is that?

718
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,805
Am I not young or cool
or hip enough for you?

719
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:22,041
I mean, I think it's unfair
to judge me so quickly.

720
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,211
Just don't know if
you can hack this job.

721
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:25,812
I've worked a much
more difficult job

722
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,214
for the past 10 years.

723
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:30,217
I think I can handle
pouring coffee.

724
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,119
This job is crazy
and fast paced

725
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:36,189
and it doesn't pay that well so.

726
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,359
I'm game, I want this job.

727
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:46,600
Excuse me, eyes up here please.

728
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:53,641
Okay, okay, we'll
give you a shot.

729
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:56,142
Great, when do I start?

730
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,546
Right now.

731
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,718
- No, stop, no!
- What, do I push this button?

732
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:07,787
No, I told you it
was the other one.

733
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,055
I'm sorry, it's my first time.

734
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,957
No, stop spraying everywhere.

735
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,826
- Whoa!
- Adam, I was talking

736
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,429
about the espresso.

737
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,763
Oh, sure you were.

738
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,633
Jeff, here you go.

739
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,535
Have a good day Jeff.

740
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,337
Did you just see my
customer service?

741
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,071
I did and it was impressive.

742
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,806
You hired the right guy.

743
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,675
I guess I did.

744
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:31,378
Who's this?

745
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:33,947
Oh Todd, this is Adam.

746
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,181
He just started today.

747
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:39,953
- Hey man.
- You needed another person?

748
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:44,625
- Yeah.
- I see.

749
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,598
- He's a bit dramatic.
- I'll say.

750
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,199
[bright music]

751
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:14,622
[door slams shut]
[Adam humming]

752
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,026
What is this?

753
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,161
The kids are at my mom's

754
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:25,031
and we are gonna have
a millennial day out.

755
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,234
Oh?

756
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,003
I'm trying to do this with you.

757
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:32,573
I don't deserve you.

758
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:42,549
Oh wait, are you kidding me?

759
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,117
- This place?
- Oh come on,

760
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,220
this is like the most
millennial place in town.

761
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,188
It's hip, modern and
everything is vegan.

762
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,158
Yeah, I don't wanna do this.

763
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,528
Oh come on, millennial
up Adam, let's go.

764
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:58,031
Oh, Lord help me.

765
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:00,734
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

766
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,969
[car door slams shut]

767
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:05,838
[mid tempo music]

768
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:10,977
Hello?

769
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:15,316
Oh, what do you want?

770
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:21,020
Can I get a
raspberry iced tea?

771
00:35:21,054 --> 00:35:23,390
I'll just have a decaf coffee.

772
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:26,025
Oh, 'cause you don't
already have everything, mmh?

773
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:30,397
$8.36.

774
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:40,240
Oh, and can I get my receipt?

775
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:51,719
Wow, service here
is really great, huh?

776
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:53,986
Hmm mmh.

777
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,122
It's a pretty cool
place though, yeah?

778
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:57,990
Yeah.

779
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:02,529
- Are you okay?
- Hmm, what, yeah.

780
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:10,970
Oops.

781
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:14,040
Do you have a problem with us?

782
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,411
Excuse me, I'd like to
speak to your manager!

783
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:18,445
What are you doing?

784
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,747
I don't think he should
treat us like that.

785
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,980
It's fine, it's fine.

786
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,817
Is everything
alright over here?

787
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:27,488
Oh okay, is he bothering you

788
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:28,622
'cause I can kick him out?

789
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:29,889
[Adam laughs]

790
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:32,526
No, actually your
employee over there

791
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,294
has been extremely rude to us.

792
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:37,431
Oh gosh, sometimes it feels
like I'm running a daycare.

793
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,867
I apologize for
Todd there, he's.

794
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,535
Anyways, I'm Sydney.

795
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:45,372
Oh, Jennifer and this is Adam.

796
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:47,641
But of course.

797
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,311
Are you gonna shake her hand?

798
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:57,183
Oh no, no, I think that
would actually be rude

799
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,554
to shake her hand, or your
hand or like anyone else's hand

800
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:04,591
'cause I'm actually still
practicing social distancing so.

801
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,826
I love this guy.

802
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,895
Anyway, you two enjoy.

803
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:09,863
Oh, I forgot something.

804
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,565
Why are you being so weird?

805
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:14,167
It's this place,
it's not my vibe.

806
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,639
You forgot this.

807
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:22,342
Oh, look at that, a
souvenir [chuckles].

808
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,419
Well, thank you so
much for the coffee

809
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:37,357
and the tea and the
souvenir and the hand shakes

810
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:40,594
and it's just great, great.

811
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:44,030
We should probably
be going you know?

812
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,699
No, we just got here.

813
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,033
Come on, let's just.

814
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:49,436
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,940
All right, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

816
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,211
Don't be so pretentious
as if I'm coming back.

817
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,588
[dramatic music]

818
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,585
- Hello.
- Hi.

819
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,288
Hello, how are you doing?

820
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:43,189
Good.

821
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:51,865
So what happens next?

822
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:58,939
Right, ask if you can help
the customer with anything.

823
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:07,981
Well, I was
looking at this car.

824
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,652
Can you tell me
anything about it?

825
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:25,131
This is a blue car.

826
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:32,039
Oh, interesting, interesting.

827
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,274
So it runs well?

828
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:41,415
It's a good model of car?

829
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:43,684
Hmm hmm.

830
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,955
All right, I'm gonna be
straight with you, Paul.

831
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,155
I don't know enough about cars

832
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:50,390
or know what to
even ask about them.

833
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:53,260
So I'm just gonna
say if it runs well

834
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:57,464
and it looks pretty,
that's good enough for me.

835
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:59,299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

836
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:07,307
So I think I'll take it.

837
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,076
Okay, you have
a good day, sir.

838
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:14,414
Paul, Paul, get
back here, buddy.

839
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:21,321
I'm gonna need you to
listen to my words.

840
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:23,557
I want to buy this car.

841
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,899
That's great, my first sale.

842
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,302
Oh well, that's surprising.

843
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,839
I'm glad this
could be our first.

844
00:40:38,872 --> 00:40:40,207
It's more special that way.

845
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:43,944
All right, I'm gonna make this
a real quick and easy for you.

846
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:46,246
I just have one simple request.

847
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,849
You know those big bows
that you put on cars?

848
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,852
Is there any way I
can get one of those?

849
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:02,229
Just right on the top there.

850
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:04,498
Maybe the front.

851
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,802
We don't have those here.

852
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:13,607
I think they only do
those on TV commercials

853
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,645
or on luxury cars, not
on cars less than 10,000.

854
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:23,216
Right, right, well Paul,

855
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,522
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

856
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,657
I mean the car is great and all,

857
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:34,227
but I really just want
one of those bows.

858
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:40,600
There's gotta be something
that you can do for me.

859
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:47,607
Come on Paul.

860
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:55,215

Oh, thank you darling.

No sweetheart.

872
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,902
But daddy is.

873
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:18,371
That's because daddy's
having a nervous breakdown.

874
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,773
Oh, ha ha.

875
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:21,007
[Iris] What's a
nervous breakdown?

about it, just eat.

Truman, how in the world

878
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:26,813

then I go wash my hands.

his hands mind you,

1052
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,581
What are you doing?

1053
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:15,449
Scrolling through people's
profiles and clicking like.

1054
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:16,983
Wait, do they know
you're doing that?

1055
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:19,152
Yeah, it sends
them notification.

1056
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:20,654
Okay well, I wanna see.

1057
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:22,755
Oh no, no, no, no, no,
no, you are no good at this.

1058
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:24,658
You can't even come up with
the top five celebrity list.

1059
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:26,527
Okay well, if I'm supposed
to like these people,

1060
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,262
I at least should
pick them, yeah?

1061
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:31,532
Okay, but I get
to hold the phone.

1062
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:37,770
Fine, okay no, no.

1063
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:40,374
Her nose is too big.

1064
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:43,677
- What?
- No, no, no, pass that one.

1065
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:46,879
Okay no, too much
makeup, my goodness.

1066
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,047
That's a low hairline.

1067
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,418
Nope, oh no, nope.

1068
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:53,420
No, swipe, no.

1069
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,590
Oh, her eyebrows are
so close together.

1070
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:58,091
She's cute.

1071
00:50:58,124 --> 00:51:01,262
Quasimodo, pass, pass.

1072
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,296
Oh, hello buck teeth.

1073
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:03,530
Okay, come on man.

1074
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:04,565
- What?
- You're saying no

1075
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:05,798
to every girl.

1076
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:08,369
Well, yeah, 'cause
they're not right.

1077
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:11,672
How did you even get one
girl to fall in love with you?

1078
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:15,141
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means you're being too picky that's what it means.

1079
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:16,410
It means that you
don't even understand

1080
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:17,645
what a beautiful
girl looks like.

1081
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,613
Look at this girl,
she's gotta to be what,

1082
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:20,780
an eight at least?

1083
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:22,249
I don't like her haircut.

1084
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:24,551
You're not gonna be bone
storming her hair cut.

1085
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,387
Well, if that's how she
takes care of the upstairs,

1086
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,021
who knows what the
downstairs looks like?

1087
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,556
Sometimes that's a good thing.

1088
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,158
It's good to explore
some creative downstairs.

1089
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:33,694
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1090
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:35,194
You know what,

1091
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:36,563
you couldn't have gotten
a match with her anyways.

1092
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:40,933
Oh okay, okay yeah, go
ahead and like that one.

1093
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,436
I'll show you.

1094
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:46,806
Like it, or swipe, or push
the yes I want this button.

1095
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:51,578
- Just tell her yes, come on.
- Liked.

1096
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:57,150
Goodness, so
what happens next?

1097
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,654
Well next, you wait to
see if you're lucky enough

1098
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:03,424
for her to give you a like
and then you have a match.

1099
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,824
Don't worry about it.

1100
00:52:04,857 --> 00:52:07,093
I'll start some conversations,
get you a date or two.

1101
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:09,929
This actually could
be a lot of fun.

1102
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:11,632
Well, I'm glad that my
love life just brings you

1103
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:13,400
so much entertainment.

1104
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:14,735
It really does.

1105
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:16,270
It's kind of like a
video game or something.

1106
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,604
All right, I gotta go.

1107
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:20,574
Oh hey, I should
head out with you.

1108
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,842
I got a third date with
this chick tonight.

1109
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,611
I'm hoping tonight's
gonna be the night,

1110
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:26,413
a little bone storming.

1111
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:29,216
[Adam] Dude, how do you keep lying to
your wife and getting away with it?

1112
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,718
[Matt] I don't know.

1113
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,587
[door slams shut]

1114
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:41,127
[chuckles] Betty White.

1115
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:54,708
Hello, beautiful.

1116
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:01,013
I love it.

1117
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:04,685
She'll like it.

1118
00:53:14,228 --> 00:53:17,063
[mid tempo music]

1119
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:19,899
I think you've arrived.

1120
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,436
What are you talking about?

1121
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,137
You're a full on
millennial, bro.

1122
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:26,273
You think so?

1123
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,174
Only one thing left to do.

1124
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,343
What?

1125
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,345
You gotta give Sydney
the old naked hug.

1126
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,615
Dude no, I can't.

1127
00:53:34,648 --> 00:53:36,949
Come on, years from now,

1128
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:39,653
you don't wanna tell your
kids you went part millennial.

1129
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:41,789
You wanna go full millennial.

1130
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:45,426
Carpe diem, just do it,
the time is now baby!

1131
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,761
Yeah, rousing
speech Shakespeare.

1132
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:49,897
Okay, then just go
on a date with her.

1133
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:52,800
No, I'll still feel like
a majorly cheating on Jen.

1134
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,835
Think about it this way,

1135
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:56,904
it's not like you're
taking another job.

1136
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:58,839
It's just like you're
going on an interview.

1137
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:03,510
So you'll do it?

1138
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,680
- Okay, perfect.
- Wait dude,

1139
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:08,282
what are you doing?

1140
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,919
- Hey Mikayla, right?
- Sydney.

1141
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:12,853
Oh, that's what I meant.

1142
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,120
Yeah look, my name's Matt.

1143
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:15,722
I think you know my
friend Adam, right?

1144
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:16,757
I think so.

1145
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:17,990
Okay look, I'm trying

1146
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:19,192
to set up this little
double date thing

1147
00:54:19,226 --> 00:54:20,461
I'm not that good
at planning though.

1148
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:21,662
I'm wondering if you
wanted to come over

1149
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,129
and maybe we could
figure something out?

1150
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:24,298
I guess I could.

1151
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,332
Cool, come on over.

1152
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:26,800
- I'll follow your lead.
- Okay.

1153
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,172
So, double date huh?

1154
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:37,711
Is your wing man gonna
be doing all the talking

1155
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:38,846
for you as well?

1156
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:40,347
Whoa, I'm not
actually gonna be going,

1157
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,683
our buddy Connor is gonna
go with your friend.

1158
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:48,020
Well, tell your friend that
I will see him there at seven.

1159
00:54:48,054 --> 00:54:50,257
Oh and maybe make
him some flash cards

1160
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,693
so he has something to say.

1161
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:53,894
Right, right, right.

1162
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:55,229
Dude, you got a date
with your crush,

1163
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:56,396
but you can't screw this one up

1164
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,898
'cause it's work romance too

1165
00:54:57,931 --> 00:54:59,800
and that could look
bad for everyone.

1166
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,034
- Dude, why aren't you gonna be there?
- All part of the plan my man.

1167
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:03,537
See with Connor there,

1168
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,973
you are gonna look like a
knight in shining armor.

1169
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:10,644
Odd dates, why, why, why!

1170
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,989
Is that gonna be me if
the date doesn't go well?

1171
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:23,790
I think your
break's about done.

1172
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:24,925
Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:55:34,868 --> 00:55:35,969
Where are you going?

1174
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:38,739
Out with the guys.

1175
00:55:38,772 --> 00:55:41,708
Well, since you seem to
be making all the decisions

1176
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:43,544
for us, do you wanna tell me

1177
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:45,379
how we're gonna pay
for these bills?

1178
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,449
I don't know, take
it out of our savings.

1179
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:50,384
What savings?

1180
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,288
Let's pay with a credit card.

1181
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:57,056
Okay, I consider myself
to be a pretty chill wife

1182
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:58,825
and I hate how I'm
turning into a nag.

1183
00:55:58,859 --> 00:55:59,993
Well then, don't nag.

1184
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,397
I feel like I have to.

1185
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,966
We have a responsibility to
provide for our children,

1186
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:07,568
something which you seem
to have forgotten about.

1187
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:09,670
You know what,
I got another job

1188
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,204
so we should be able
to make it work.

1189
00:56:11,238 --> 00:56:13,206
Right, minimum wage plus tips.

1190
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,708
Yeah, doesn't quite cut it.

1191
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:17,311
I am sorry I finally found
something that I enjoy doing.

1192
00:56:17,344 --> 00:56:20,047
All right, well
this little experiment

1193
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,515
is putting a strain on things.

1194
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:24,051
Nope, and this is no
longer an experiment dear.

1195
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,986
I actually enjoy
being a millennial.

1196
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:28,755
Yeah, you like it because you get
to do whatever the hell you want.

1197
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:29,923
And what's wrong with that?

1198
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:31,858
You made a decision
to have a family

1199
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,093
and I hate to break it to you,
but you don't get to do

1200
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:36,162
what you want all
the time for forever.

1201
00:56:36,195 --> 00:56:37,664
Sure I can.

1202
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,566
I married you because you
had your head on straight.

1203
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,503
You were patient and you were
mature and loving and selfless

1204
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:46,105
which are tremendous attributes
for a father and a husband.

1205
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:47,574
And this whole new outlook

1206
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,476
that you have can only
go so far before you have

1207
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:50,711
to make a big decision.

1208
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:51,979
Oh, what's that?

1209
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:53,413
If you wanna keep
your family or not.

1210
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:10,330
Oh yeah.

1211
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,034
Dude, you're disgusting.

1212
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:16,536
What, I gotta eat or
else I'm gonna get sick.

1213
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,872
And if I get sick, none of us
are gonna have a good time.

1214
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:20,240
I already feel sick.

1215
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:22,109
No, you're just
nervous and it's okay.

1216
00:57:22,141 --> 00:57:24,211
I mean, I was nervous the
first time too when you know.

1217
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,712
Dude, I'm not nervous sick,

1218
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,146
I actually just don't feel good.

1219
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,383
And you realize this
isn't my first time right?

1220
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,418
I've been married for 10
years and I have two kids.

1221
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,787
You don't have to throw your
accomplishments in my face.

1222
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,522
- Why did you wear that stupid shirt?
- It's not a stupid shirt.

1223
00:57:35,555 --> 00:57:37,324
You're a stupid shirt.

1224
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:38,258
You want some?

1225
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,993
No, we're about to eat dinner.

1226
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:47,934
- Hello ladies.
- Hello.

1227
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:49,069
This is Keira.

1228
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:50,404
- Hi.
- Hi Keira

1229
00:57:50,437 --> 00:57:53,240
This is Connor.

1230
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:55,142
Okay, I guess we'll sit down.

1231
00:57:57,611 --> 00:58:01,415
So, can we get you
ladies anything to drink?

1232
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:03,417
Sure, that'd be nice.

1233
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,952
Neither of you are like
wishy-washy fems, right?

1234
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:10,624
You know, like there's
hardcore feminists

1235
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:11,858
that are all about equal rights,

1236
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,192
but then there's the
wishy-washy ones.

1237
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:14,728
What's the difference?

1238
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:17,030
Okay well, the wishy-washys
are fighting for equal rights

1239
00:58:17,064 --> 00:58:19,366
but they also expect
traditional chivalry on dates.

1240
00:58:19,399 --> 00:58:21,868
You know, like opening doors and paying
for the meals or something like that.

1241
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,370
I'm just like, you're
trying to have the best

1242
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:25,939
of both worlds and you
can't have it both ways.

1243
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:27,708
We're fine paying
for our half.

1244
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:28,909
Oh good, thanks.

1245
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,713
No, I was actually
just kidding.

1246
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:36,049
Just making a
stupid observation.

1247
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,150
He does that a lot.

1248
00:58:37,984 --> 00:58:39,419
I can't help it.

1249
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:40,787
There's just a lot of
stupid things to observe.

1250
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,726
Well, what about me?

1251
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:48,295
Is anything stupid about me?

1252
00:58:50,664 --> 00:58:53,500
Nope, no, there's
nothing stupid about you.

1253
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:58,138
You're just beautiful, and
smart, and funny and good.

1254
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:02,342
So what about you Connor?

1255
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,379
What do you wanna know?

1256
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:08,982
I'm just trying to get
to know you a little bit.

1257
00:59:09,015 --> 00:59:11,852
Well, what would
you like to know?

1258
00:59:12,919 --> 00:59:15,188
- What do you do for work?
- Fine, go ahead and ask that.

1259
00:59:15,223 --> 00:59:16,723
Excuse me?

1260
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:20,360
Jeez, what's with all the
vague what you do questions?

1261
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:21,762
Get to the point Karen.

1262
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:23,130
Oh my God.

1263
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:24,364
Keira, he is a joke.

1264
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:26,099
We're just gonna head
to the little boy's room

1265
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:27,467
and freshen up okay?

1266
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:28,468
That's disgusting,
we don't need

1267
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:29,870
to know about your details.

1268
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,071
I'm talking about
me and you buddy.

1269
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:32,005
Oh no, I'm good.

1270
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:33,440
Okay, we'll be right back.

1271
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:38,645
Dude, what the hell are
you doing out there?

1272
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:41,515
Relax, it's a
part of my strategy.

1273
00:59:41,548 --> 00:59:43,583
Your strategy
is to berate them.

1274
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,452
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not gonna rape her.

1275
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,521
Oh my God, no berate, berate.

1276
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:49,322
Look, I act like I don't care,

1277
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:50,991
like I'm not interested in her

1278
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:53,227
and it makes her
want me even more.

1279
00:59:53,261 --> 00:59:55,729
So the more act like
I don't want her,

1280
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,197
then she's gonna love it.

1281
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,933
I'm like, I don't want her,
but then she wants this.

1282
00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:02,969
Dude, you're taking
it too far all right>

1283
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:04,604
- Okay, fine.
- Tone it down.

1284
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:08,708
Oh my God, I think I gotta shit.

1285
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,410
My goodness, my
stomach hurts so bad.

1286
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:12,045
See, you should've
ate before we came.

1287
01:00:12,078 --> 01:00:15,582
Shut the hell, get out there
and make nice, all right?

1288
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:17,551
Stop being such a doofus.

1289
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:18,618
Did you just flick me?

1290
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:19,486
Get out there.

1291
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,498
[toilet water flushes]

1292
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:32,332
What?

1293
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:37,504
[toilet water flushes]

1294
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:38,738
Son of a bitch!

1295
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:48,415
[toilet water flushes]

1296
01:00:48,448 --> 01:00:50,083
Son of a bitch!

1297
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:51,451
What's your dog's name?

1298
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:52,552
Felix.

1299
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:55,289
- That's quite the name.
- I know.

1300
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:02,429
Okay, so they seem to be
getting along a lot better.

1301
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:05,932
[Sydney] I ordered for
you, I hope that's okay.

1302
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:08,034
Oh yeah, what'd you get me?

1303
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:09,337
Pig's feet.

1304
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:10,537
Oh really?

1305
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,938
Yeah, the waiter says
they're really good

1306
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,307
so I just went with it.

1307
01:01:15,108 --> 01:01:17,878
[Keira giggling]

1308
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,548
Tell me about yourself,

1309
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:23,284
something that's
not work-related?

1310
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,387
Well, I'm from Michigan

1311
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,522
and I still have a
sister that's back there

1312
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:31,091
with my mom and dad.

1313
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:33,526
Okay, why did
you move out here?

1314
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,595
I wanted to new experiences.

1315
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:39,966
I like mixing things up you
know, keeping life interesting.

1316
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,803
Plus Michigan is
a bit of a hole,

1317
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:46,039
like a hell frozen
over kind of hole.

1318
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:48,575
Why?

1319
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:52,479
The town I'm from,
people just, I don't know,

1320
01:01:52,512 --> 01:01:55,649
they stayed the same as
they were in high school.

1321
01:01:55,682 --> 01:01:57,351
Not a lot of growth or change

1322
01:01:57,385 --> 01:02:00,086
and I guess I just realized

1323
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,289
that I wanted to explore life

1324
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:04,491
and I want different
places around the world

1325
01:02:04,524 --> 01:02:06,459
to help shape who I am.

1326
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,766
Lately, I kind of
feel like I've gotten

1327
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,403
into like just a rut.

1328
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:20,073
My life is just the same routine

1329
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:23,043
like all my other high
school friends back home.

1330
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,412
Yeah, you have.

1331
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,647
Okay, how would you know that?

1332
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:31,718
You have kept everything
safe and consistent.

1333
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:33,186
I'll have you know

1334
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,889
that I was quite the party
animal back in my day.

1335
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:37,358
- Oh really?
- Hmm hmm.

1336
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:39,960
All right guys,
who's flexible?

1337
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:43,697
I got not one but
two games of twister.

1338
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,233
You eat the same thing
for lunch every day.

1339
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:49,337
Okay, so you're keeping
tabs on my lunches now?

1340
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,170
What can I say?

1341
01:02:50,203 --> 01:02:51,171
I'm a lunch stalker.

1342
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:56,344
Gosh, I envy you.

1343
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:58,078
How so?

1344
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:04,117
You're just carefree and
you do whatever you want.

1345
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:06,119
Life is short.

1346
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:07,887
I mean, do what makes
you happy right?

1347
01:03:09,556 --> 01:03:10,724
What makes you happy?

1348
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:17,298
New experiences, exploring,

1349
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:19,699
meeting new people.

1350
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:25,772
What I love most of all is
doing things I'm afraid of.

1351
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,042
That is so awesome.

1352
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:33,713
That's disgusting.

1353
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:36,217
[chuckles] Oh, you're serious.

1354
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,351
I'm sorry, no, no, no.

1355
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:38,252
You weren't supposed
to see that.

1356
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:39,487
Keira, what's wrong?

1357
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,489
He has pictures of
his poop on his phone.

1358
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:45,658
Wow, gross.

1359
01:03:45,692 --> 01:03:48,094
Yeah, he does
actually have those.

1360
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:48,962
Come on Syd.

1361
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:52,032
Reschedule, I guess?

1362
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:52,899
Yeah.

1363
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:56,803
Cool.

1364
01:03:58,905 --> 01:04:03,009
Everybody poops, it was a
little nugget like a little nut.

1365
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,878
- Dude!
- I didn't show the big stuff.

1366
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:08,282
- Oh my God!
- It's okay, you want a roll?

1367
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,551
- No.
- There's a lot of them left.

1368
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:16,689
[Jen] I think we should all
have crowns on, don't you?

1369
01:04:16,723 --> 01:04:18,292
- Hmm hmm.
- No, you don't want a crown?

1370
01:04:18,325 --> 01:04:20,261
- Hmm hmm.
- Look I think they're...

1371
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,194
What are those?

1372
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:22,296
They're eating giant fruit,

1373
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,465
- that's almost the size-
- Giant pears.

1374
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:29,503
[crickets chirping]
[knocking on door]

1375
01:04:34,508 --> 01:04:35,708
- Hey.
- Hey.

1376
01:04:35,742 --> 01:04:37,610
Sorry, my roommate's sleeping.

1377
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:38,446
Let's go over here.

1378
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:39,313
Oh sorry.

1379
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:42,715
What's up?

1380
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:46,920
I just wanted to apologize.

1381
01:04:46,953 --> 01:04:50,990
That is not how I
wanted this date to go.

1382
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:53,327
It's fine, it's
not your fault.

1383
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,095
And Keira's just a
bit overdramatic.

1384
01:04:55,128 --> 01:04:59,132
- So everyone poops.
- Exactly.

1385
01:04:59,165 --> 01:05:01,801
I mean, just not everyone
takes pictures of it.

1386
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,505
Right, right, yeah.

1387
01:05:05,772 --> 01:05:09,809
I am sorry about my friend.

1388
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:12,078
Connor can be a
real tool sometimes.

1389
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:16,749
I really wanted to go on
a proper date with you.

1390
01:05:16,783 --> 01:05:17,617
Me too.

1565
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:51,539
I've never had someone try
to return a car before.

1566
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:53,374
Well, you've also never
had someone buy a car

1567
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:54,941
from you before.

1568
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:56,743
A lot of firsts
between you and me.

1569
01:23:00,113 --> 01:23:02,115
Would you want another car?

1570
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:03,651
I think I'll just
take my old car back

1571
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:04,684
if that's okay with you.

1572
01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:09,989
My father-in-law's gonna
be so flipping PO'd.

1573
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:19,333
Wait, if I sell you
your old car back

1574
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:23,304
that still counts
as a sale, right?

1575
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:27,006
Well, look at
you growing all up.

1576
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,343
All right, so why don't
you sell me my car

1577
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:31,144
for the same price I
sold it to you for,

1578
01:23:31,177 --> 01:23:33,247
and then I'll
return this new car

1579
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,549
for a slightly less price.

1580
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,417
Seem fair?

1581
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:38,452
Boy, I'll say.

1582
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:41,388
All right, put it
here buddy, yeah!

I'm sorry about that.

- Hey.
- Hey.

1603
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:54,187
I was thinking that we
should talk about last week.

1604
01:25:55,556 --> 01:25:57,725
Yeah, that might be good.

1605
01:26:00,093 --> 01:26:04,631
Yeah, so I shouldn't have
done that, kissed you, I mean.

- What's the too?
- The too?

1612
01:26:26,787 --> 01:26:29,155
Yeah, I said it's not
good for co-workers to date

1613

You know, if you're gonna
dump me like a child,

1618
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:41,200
then at least give me
the truth like an adult.

1619
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:42,935
Okay, I didn't dump
you like a child.

Really I mean, called in
sick, avoided me for three days.

And every time you
went to the bathroom,

1622
01:26:47,974 --> 01:26:50,844
you'd go outside around
the back corner just

1623
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:52,346
to avoid passing my desk.

1624
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:55,081
Okay, so now you're keeping
tabs on my bathroom habits?

1625
01:26:55,114 --> 01:26:56,417
Yeah, I'm a pee stalker.

1626

Come on, just tell me, okay?

It's cool, we're gonna be fine.

1628
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:03,357
It was just a kiss.

1629
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:12,366
So you remember that
woman I came in with?

01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:13,233
Yeah.

1631
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:19,606
So she is my wife.

1632
01:27:30,183 --> 01:27:31,117
You're married?

1633
01:27:35,856 --> 01:27:39,793
Wow, you're married
and you didn't tell me?

1634
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,362
Yeah, yeah.

1635
01:27:42,396 --> 01:27:43,963
You know, that's a
pretty messed up situation

1636
01:27:43,996 --> 01:27:45,131
to put me in, right?

1637
01:27:46,132 --> 01:27:47,166
Wait, what?

1638
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,335
You made me an adulterer.

1639
01:27:48,368 --> 01:27:50,237
No, no, no, no,
you're not an adulterer.

1640
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,306
Well, at least an
accomplice to adultery.

1641
01:27:52,339 --> 01:27:54,441
You made me the
other woman Adam.

1642
01:27:54,475 --> 01:27:56,042
Okay, but it was just a kiss.

1643
01:27:56,075 --> 01:27:57,377
It wasn't even a big deal.

1644
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:59,413
Yeah, a kiss is no big
deal, but with a married man

1645
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:00,814
that's totally different.

1646

Okay, okay yeah,
I am really sorry.

01:28:05,117 --> 01:28:06,787

Not exactly.

1649
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:13,293
Okay, you're a
total piece of shit.

1650
01:28:14,728 --> 01:28:18,130
Yeah, yeah, I am aware and
I actually agree with you.

01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:22,669

1652
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:25,405
and then left us to be
with his new girlfriend.

1653
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,674
I don't have a lot of
respect for cheaters.

1654

Well, at least your dad is
still alive right [chuckles]?

about your dad being dead?

Speaking of death, I
actually killed a cat today.

Adam, you're fired.

1658
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:51,130

pissed if he sees you.

1665
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,729
Yeah, I think
he'll come around.

1666
01:29:24,798 --> 01:29:28,502
Hey, I wanted to talk to
you about the other day.

1667
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:29,937
I got nothing.

1668
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:33,307
Okay yeah, all right
look, it's on me, all right?

1669
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,173
It's all on me.

1670
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:38,312
I want to apologize

1671
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:42,549
for attacking you
on your special day.

1672
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:45,419
Dude, you just used bunny
ears on my special day.

1673
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:47,086
That can't possibly
mean you're sorry.

1674
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:51,258
I'm sorry, I realized I
don't respect your decision.

1675
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:54,093
Oh, you're knocking this apology
out of the party slugger.

1676
01:29:54,126 --> 01:29:56,463
What works for you
just doesn't work for me,

1677
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:59,566
but hey, I'll always love you.

1678
01:30:03,135 --> 01:30:06,138
Thanks, but this
is what I want.

1679
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:12,579
Yeah, yeah, this is your path
and I can't join you on it.

1680
01:30:13,614 --> 01:30:14,615
It's your thing.

1681
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:16,249
It's definitely not mine.

1682
01:30:18,885 --> 01:30:20,186
I totally kissed Syd.

1683
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,023
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

1684
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:23,857
What the hell?

1685
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:25,092
Tell me about it.

1686
01:30:25,124 --> 01:30:26,326
I mean, there's
nothing to say.

1687
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,127
I just went to her
place after the date

1688
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,030
and it kinda just happened.

1689
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:31,231
How was it?

1690
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:33,300
I mean, it was
pretty good I guess.

1691
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,334
Anything else?

1692
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,503
No, no, I told
her I had to go.

1693
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:37,371
A little chug though?

1694
01:30:37,404 --> 01:30:38,338
- Oh my gosh.
- Yes?

1695
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:39,573
Maybe a little.

1696
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:41,074
Things were changing down there.

1697
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:44,444
But the point is, it was
very quick and it was wrong.

1698
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:46,913
And I felt terrible.

1699
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:47,914
You're crazy, man.

1700
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:50,117
You have a black eye?

1701
01:30:51,418 --> 01:30:53,253
Did you tell Jennifer?

1702
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:57,090
No, no, no, this is Syd.

1703
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:59,726
She didn't know I
was married and just.

1704
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,863
Oh, that's hilarious.

1705
01:31:02,896 --> 01:31:04,698
So that means you're
unemployed now?

1706
01:31:05,832 --> 01:31:08,635
No, actually I
got my old job back.

Well yeah, yeah,
I'm taking care

1714
01:31:28,455 --> 01:31:29,790
of my other mistakes first.

1715
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:31,858
And I'm saving the
big one for last.

- What?

1717
01:31:34,061 --> 01:31:34,928
Don't woos out,

1718
01:31:34,961 --> 01:31:36,730
go tell her right now.

1719
01:31:36,763 --> 01:31:37,664
Right now?

1720
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,900
Right now man, right now.

1721
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:41,768
Come on, you said it yourself,

1722
01:31:41,802 --> 01:31:44,771
you're better than me, right?

1723
01:31:44,805 --> 01:31:46,206
Yeah.

1724
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,308
Go make sure you
save your family.

1725
01:31:50,277 --> 01:31:52,145
- All right, okay.
- Go!

1726
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:53,113
- All right.
- Go!

1727
01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:54,715
Yes all right, thank you, yes.

1728
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:57,551
Do you accept my apology?

1729
01:32:00,153 --> 01:32:01,488
- Yeah.
- Hmm hmm.

1730
01:32:04,758 --> 01:32:06,960
I love you both so much.

1731
01:32:06,993 --> 01:32:09,763
You're coming to my next
violin recital, right?

1732
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:12,632
I won't miss it for anything.

1733
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,701
Okay, hey buddy.

1734
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:17,003
I gotta go talk
to your mom, okay.

1735
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:18,138
- Okay.
- You guys can stay

1736
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:19,940
in here for a minute?

1737
01:32:19,973 --> 01:32:21,074
- Hmm hmm.
- Hmm hmm.

1738
01:32:21,108 --> 01:32:22,309
I gotta go apologize.

1739
01:32:22,342 --> 01:32:23,243
- Okay.
- Okay.

1740
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:24,311
All right, love you guys.

1741
01:32:24,344 --> 01:32:25,612
Love you too.

1742
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:39,359
- Hey.
- Hey.

1743
01:32:43,396 --> 01:32:45,298
What happened to your face.

1744
01:32:45,332 --> 01:32:48,769
Oh, millennialism.

1745
01:32:53,607 --> 01:32:54,775
I need to talk to you.

1746
01:32:54,808 --> 01:32:55,909
Yeah, I know.

1747
01:32:55,942 --> 01:32:56,743
I saw your live.

1748
01:32:59,546 --> 01:33:00,347
And?

1749
01:33:03,283 --> 01:33:04,384
It was really sweet.

1750
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:09,389
But?

1751
01:33:12,425 --> 01:33:15,128
But actions speak
louder than words.

1752
01:33:15,162 --> 01:33:19,366
Well, curiosity killed
the cat, all right?

1753
01:33:21,568 --> 01:33:23,670
- I'm a cat, I got killed.
- No, I get it.

1754
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:31,378
Hey, I got my old job back.

1755
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:34,314
And are you gonna be happy?

1756
01:33:35,849 --> 01:33:38,185
I'm happy knowing you
and the kids are happy.

1757
01:33:39,486 --> 01:33:41,255
I know, but I want
you to be happy.

1758
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:42,689
I am, I am.

1759
01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:45,259
I was just in a funk.

1760
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:47,228
Okay, okay, okay, come here.

1761
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:48,595
Sit down please.

1762
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:56,036
Listen, I'm gonna be honest.

1763
01:33:56,069 --> 01:33:58,338
Okay, I liked a lot

1764
01:33:58,371 --> 01:34:00,974
of the changes I made over
this last month or so.

1765
01:34:01,007 --> 01:34:03,076
It was really fun to
do whatever I wanted.

1766
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:07,315
But then, I had a breakthrough

1767
01:34:08,548 --> 01:34:13,086
and I realized that
it's not worth it.

1768
01:34:14,754 --> 01:34:16,890
I realized that doing what
I wanted would just end

1769
01:34:16,923 --> 01:34:20,994
with me being alone and
I don't wanna be alone.

1770
01:34:22,429 --> 01:34:24,998
I don't wanna be without
you and the kids, I don't.

1771
01:34:27,133 --> 01:34:31,339
I want things just to go back
to the way they were, okay?

1772
01:34:31,371 --> 01:34:35,408
But, this time I want
complete honesty,

1773
01:34:35,442 --> 01:34:38,378
just everything out
on the table 100%.

1774
01:34:39,512 --> 01:34:44,218
So I have something
that I need to.

1775
01:34:52,592 --> 01:34:57,597
I sort of cheated on you.

1776
01:34:58,198 --> 01:34:59,432
Okay, that's it.

1777
01:34:59,466 --> 01:35:01,067
It was just a kiss, nothing else.
And I put an end to it.

1778
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:02,502
It's completely over, okay.

1779
01:35:02,535 --> 01:35:03,503
Never again, honey.

1780
01:35:05,705 --> 01:35:07,507
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

1781
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,915
Wow, I think it was the
right thing to tell me.

1782
01:35:21,521 --> 01:35:23,156
I'm so sorry, honey.

1783
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:26,693
I mean, I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

1784
01:35:28,962 --> 01:35:31,431
Honestly, I feel a
little bit relieved.

1785
01:35:31,464 --> 01:35:33,600
I mean, so the thing is,

1786
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:37,570
I've been cheating on you
for the last few years

1787
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:39,539
but it was more than kissing.

1788
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:49,749
I thought we were just being
honest with each other.

1789
01:35:51,419 --> 01:35:53,220
Can you say something?

1790
01:35:53,254 --> 01:35:55,555
Just say something.

1791
01:35:55,588 --> 01:35:56,790
Are we gonna be okay?

1792
01:36:01,528 --> 01:36:03,029
Can you say something?

1793
01:36:06,766 --> 01:36:10,003

But I really like you.

01:40:06,806 --> 01:40:07,707
I know

1854
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,942

- I mean love maybe but.

01:40:12,745 --> 01:40:14,548
Did you say in a
less kind of way?

1858
01:40:14,582 --> 01:40:15,616
Like in a lust.

1859
01:40:15,649 --> 01:40:16,550
- Oh, lust?
- Yeah.

1860
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:18,319
Yeah, I'm very aware of that.

1861
01:40:18,352 --> 01:40:19,719
I'm very in lust with you.
