Good evening Los Angeles,
I'm Athena Ramirez,

49
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,058
KPRZ channel nine, you're
watching "Special Report."

50
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,579
Tonight, we'll be
discussing a topic

51
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:33,065
that's become all too
familiar to Angelina's,

52
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,966

city of gang violence.

56
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,401
Some Angellino's would say,

57
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,507
"Just another day
in Los Angeles."

58
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,338
As a criminal gangs expert,

59
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,928
I was hoping that you could
help us gain some insight

60
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,689
into the causes behind
this latest wave

61
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:14,279
of gang related crime
and murder in our city.

62
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,318
First, thank you for having me.

63
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:23,737
I've been personal an experience

64
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:28,638
and gone down this road before.

65
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:31,641
I believe that it's twofold.

66
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,125
There's a spiritual side,

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,163
and then there's
also a natural side.

68
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,028
Let's first talk about
the natural side.

69
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,755
We've been plagued
in our community

70
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,103
with homes without fathers.

71
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,693
We've been playing
with joblessness.

72
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:53,698
So it is a scarcity
of health, support,

73
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,599
et cetera, et cetera.

74
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:04,364
And because of that, many
of these gang bangers

00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,662
I see you later, I'll be back.

181
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,468
Yeah, you ain't done
until I say [indistinct],

182
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,425
you be back here at
a reasonable time.

183
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,600
All right, I see
you then, am out.

184
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:24,605
Many of these gang bangers
preys on our young children,

185
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:29,610
and because of pure
pressure and loneliness

186
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,889
and all of that, that
we could talk about.

187
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,445
Most of these guys
succumb to joining gangs.

188
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:40,967
The other side, I believe
this is a spiritual warfare.

189
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,427
There's something
that had taken place

190
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:45,281
that we have not seen,
that we can't see.

191
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:50,286
And because it's almost like
these guys are so ignorant,

192
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:56,706
they're being used, and
we have this violence.

193
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,054
And so we bring it all together,

194
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,264
it is spiritual,
and it is physical.

195
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:08,166
Take care [indistinct].

196
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,340
What's up home boy.

197
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:11,905
What's up Curse, what's
cracking with you.

198
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:12,826
Here you go.

199
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,622
Whoa, this is clean homie.

200
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,382
I can make a few
dollars off of this.

201
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,901
These kids down for their crime.

202
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,489
Straight up.

203
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:21,523
So we in?

204
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,566
Slow down a little
homie, almost.

205
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,155
So what's next.

206
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,128
You hard or something.

207
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:41,717
Man look them laptops and
stereos ain't nothing.

208
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:43,753
Give us a better links
so we can get in.

[orchestral music]

210
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,454
Hey, you like this chick?

211
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,321
Yeah.

212
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:02,807
Hey girl, go give young
Curse a little sugar.

[upbeat music]

214
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:24,967
Man, you see who that was?

215
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,106
Yeah.

217
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:31,940

[upbeat music]

219
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,124
Man, I can't do it with
that girl in that bathroom,

220
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,332
just can't.

221
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,367
Why you can't.

222
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:51,097
'Cause I don't
got no protection.

223
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:55,377
What kind of brother would
I be without protection?

[car engine grinding]

225
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,595
I'm a virgin [indistinct].

226
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,529
[car engine grinding]

227
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:10,563
No way.

228

[upbeat music]

229
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,021
Get down on.

[gun shots]

231
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:26,028
Come on let's go.

[orchestral music]

233
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,069
[indistinct] dropped my phone.

234
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,311
Can you pick it?

235
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,279
Yes, 'cause I bet it's
not even broken, see.

236
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,110
Look at that, battery's
right in there.

237
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:41,664
Thank you.

[orchestral music]

239
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,111
Do you not see me
sitting here eating?

240
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:15,215
About the cigarette.

241
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,434
You already about to sit here

242
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,229
and avoid that conversation
we had last week.

243
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:32,543
What, about the raise?

244
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,752
Yeah about the raise.

245
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,272
I told you the state's
cutting all the programs.

246
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:38,204
The budget is tight.

247
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,653
Okay, when is it not tight?

248
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:40,896
I know Tony but-

249
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,691
But man, look, I don't
need your buts, okay.

250
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:45,694
I've been busting my back and
giving my all to this company.

251
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,007
I need this for my family.

252
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,287
The money isn't there.

253
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,540
The only way we can
get you this raise

254
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,004
is if we cut at the
outreach program.

255
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,122
Look man, there's
gotta be a way.

256
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,473
Look, we work in
LA in a nonprofit.

257
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,030
I do know one way.

258
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,896
What we can do, fire some
of them handicap workers.

259
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:20,763
No look, do not fire
the workers, okay?

260
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,695
You're not good with that.

261
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,810
No, I'm not good with that.

262
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:27,977
God will find a way.

263
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,358
Wait a minute, what'd you say?

264
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,775
I said, "God will find a way."

265
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,846
There you go with that
God mess again, man.

266
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,401
I can't even eat in
peace in front of you.

267
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:38,781
Oh man, I'll see you later.

[orchestral music]

269
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,173
No thank you Bishop.

270
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,417
No, we will be glad to
join your congregation.

271
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:54,521
Okay, take care.

272
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,356
We got the gig.

273
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,426
Congrats.

274
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,085
You know what?

275
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,016
I'm gonna call the
fellas real quick

276
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,131
and let him know what's up.

277
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,779
Whatever you do get back to it.

278
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:11,813
Okay.

279
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,267
[phone ringing]

280
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,208
Stan's phone is off.

281
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,003
That figures.

282
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,075
I don't know what
to do with that guy.

283
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,145
It's always something.

284
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,701
Why don't you just let
him go from the group.

285
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,427
The rest of the
guys will be fine.

286
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,568
'Cause I don't want to.

287
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:43,845
Why not?

288
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,194
Because Stan is my friend

289
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:47,619
and I don't wanna be
like everybody else

290
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:48,886
and just giving up on the guy.

291
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,094
He's a good man Chris.

292
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,339
Stan is not as
dedicated as you are.

293
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,169
Okay, so I'll do
what most people do

294
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:59,138
in situations like this,
who cares about someone.

295
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,356
I'll chat with em,
I'll give em a call,

296
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,624
but I'm not quitting
on them okay?

297
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,281
Okay, fine.

298
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,460
How was work?

299
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:19,192
Work is good, it's always
good. [clears voice]

300
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,471
Any word on the raise?

301
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,820
Yeah, it's words on a raise.

302
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,443
Well?

303
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,931
Tony.

304
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,080
I can't believe you
the kids read this.

305
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,485
This is really not.

307
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,489
They don't have the
funding right now, Chris.

308
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,907
Are you gonna take
the other job then?

309
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,668
No, I'm not gonna
take the other job.

310
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:47,702
Are you crazy?

311
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:54,745
Tony, why not?

312
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,750
Okay, look Chris, Look I'm
making impact over there, okay.

313
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,652
Not to mention if I
wait a little while,

314
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,827
funding will be coming
down from the state.

315
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,139
It'll be good, okay.

316
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:13,315
Tony, money is tight, okay.

317
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,352
The other job will pay more.

318
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,458
You're right Chris, the other
job pays more, that's great.

319
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:20,357
But let's think about it,

320
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,635
what am I really
gonna be doing there?

321
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:24,601

322
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,467
I'm making an
impact at that shop.

Tony.

324
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,367
Chris, it's gonna be okay.

325
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,097
Where are you going?

326
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:38,132

00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,124
Tony, what are you doing here?

329
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,382
How man, I can't even
tell you, we got the gig,

330
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:10,890
but your phone is off.

331
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,927
Money's been kind of tight,
it'd be on the week though.

332
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:15,722
You come on inside.

333
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,759
Do you mind if we just
chat here for a second?

334
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,762
Yeah, what's going on?

335
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,246
You knew what's going on man.

336
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,766
I know your phone is off with
you been missing practice.

337
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,907
You know we got that, an
empty praise coming up.

338
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:30,979
I'm trying Tony out here,
just got a lot going on.

339
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,050
These bills are not
paying themselves.

340
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,534
And we all do, man.

341
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:38,366
But this music we do man,
this is our ministry.

342
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,061
Tony, I pawned my guitar
to keep the lights on.

343
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,788
I know man, your wife
told me, here man.

344
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,587
Man Tony, we don't
even have a deal.

345
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,382
And it's in advance
to keep you playing.

346
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,176
Believe it or not I believe it.

347
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:57,454
You got it like this?

348
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,387
Thank you no, I don't
have it like that yet.

349
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:02,642
I appreciate it but I
can't take this time.

350

Hey look little man lord
look, just take it man.

351
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:06,463
I know something's
gonna pop, okay.

352
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:09,983
But in the meanwhile, I just
need you to do one thing, okay.

353
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,606
Focus on the music.

354
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:14,747
Why Tony?

00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,543

00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:19,670
What's going on.

534
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:20,879
Hey woman get in the car.

535
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,160
Thanks beb.

536
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:35,859
Thank you Jesus, for this peace.

Stop that ain't him.

543
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:41,349
Come here, quick
[indistinct] Punk.

544
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,926
Man I ain't doing this.

545
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,169
You heard what the game said.

546
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,825
Man forget what
the game said, man.

[groaning]

548
00:32:58,148 --> 00:32:59,667
And here you go
with that punk crap.

549
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:01,186
Man I ain't about to do this.

550
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,140
If you kill a man and the
blood is on your hands.

551
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:16,132
In the name of Jesus, you
are not going to shoot me.

554
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:50,028
You let this happen to me.

555
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:52,961
I heard your will.

It's going to be all right.

561
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:16,423
Why.

562
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:19,151
Not for me to answer?

563
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:20,186
Why me?

564
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,465
Ask the Lord.

565
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,303
There is no need to look back.

566
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:34,891
I know.

567
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,996
Let's go home.

00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:39,620
[tensed music]

569
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,740
Detective Stoneberg.

570
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:59,364
Ms. Ramirez,
always a pleasure.

571
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:00,537
And I can tell you mean

572
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:02,298
that from the bottom
of your heart.

573
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:03,540
Of course.

574
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,404
So nothing better to
do on a weekday night

575
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,579
than come out and harass us.

576
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:10,823
Detective, there is
nothing I'd rather be doing

577
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:12,687
with my evening than
keeping the good people

578
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:14,206
of Los Angeles informed.

579
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,554
Well, at least we're
on the same page then.

580
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:18,383
What, what's that?

581
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:19,417
Oh, we're ready, okay.

582
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,425
[Instructor] And now, your
most trusted name in news KPRZ,

583
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,841
Los Angeles changed the game.

584
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:34,468
This is Athena Ramirez
with KPRZ9 Los Angeles

585
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:38,644
at the scene of yet another
gang related shooting.

586
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,407
Detective Stoneberg, yet
another gang related shooting

587
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,788
at this hour in the
city of Los Angeles.

588
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:46,411
What can you tell us about it?

589
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,653
Well, at this point in time,

590
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,310
we really don't have
enough information

591
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:52,140
to determine whether this
is gang related or not.

592
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:54,419
But detective isn't it true
that this is retaliation

593
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:55,730
for last week's blood bath

594
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,456
between the Crips
and the bloods.

595
00:36:57,491 --> 00:37:00,010
Again, we don't have
enough information.

596
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:01,426
My men are currently
investigating

597
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,324
and we will learn
more as time goes on.

598
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,464
What can you tell us about
the victim detective?

599
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:06,741
He's currently with paramedics

600
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:08,191
being treated for his wounds.

601
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,780
Detective, are you
then confirming

602
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:14,128
that the victim has in fact
suffered multiple gunshot wounds

603
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:16,613
as the result of a
drive by shooting,

604
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,340
and is now in critical
condition fighting for his life?

605
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,827
I think we're done here.

606
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:28,246
Really, you're gonna
do that to me tonight.

607
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,181
And there you have
it, Athena Ramirez,

608
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:35,322

This is Davis, Sergeant
Stoneberg LAPD.

615
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,016
I'm so sorry.

616
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:54,401
No, no, no, no.

617
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,857
- [crying]
- It's all right.

618
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,039
No.

619
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,290
Is that right, Tim?

620
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:25,259
No, five shots, 10 holes.

621
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,606
Five enter points,
five exit points.

622
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,608
The guy nearly bled to death.

623
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,230
Gang member?

624
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:33,819
Not according to his
wife, just a normal guy

626
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,133
Sounds about right.

627
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,134
It's always the wrong
ones that get hurt.

628
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,618

629
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:41,413
I'm just saying, "It
seems like the good guys

630
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,657
are always the ones that get
hurt and your drug dealers

631
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,624
and gang bangers come
in for flu shot."

632
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:49,179
Just ironic.

633
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,148
Miracles more like it.

634
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,632
Miracle?

635
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,426
Well, according to this,
he was dead 30 minutes

636
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,152
by the time he came in.

637
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,602
They got him stabilized,

638
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:59,638

tough road out on that coma.

Not like I have much
of a choice these days.

659

So what do you think, drive
by, retaliation, random?

660
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:17,258
It doesn't seem like a hit.

661
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:23,057
And we don't have enough
casings for it to be a drive by,

662
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:26,923
the casings we do have though
the distance is too far

663
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,546

Well, whatever it is, you
need to close this one quick.

666
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:44,009
The last thing I need is
another gang war breaking out.

667
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,287
We still haven't recovered
from the last one.

668
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:51,569
All right, I'll leave you to it.

[dog barking]

670
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:57,505
They should be personal
responsibility,

671
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,060
but however, what I'm trying
to bring across to you,

672
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:03,822
they also need education.

673
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:07,170
When you grow up in a
home without direction,

674
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:11,450
without father, without
properly role model,

675
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:14,626
it's easy to listen to
someone directing you.

676
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:16,766
You don't know if
it's wrong or right.

677
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:19,597
And the reason why we have
these gangs all over the city,

678
00:43:21,253 --> 00:43:23,980
most of these young
people are afraid.

679
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:27,328
Peer pressure, they're
afraid to be by themselves.

680
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:31,470
So it's easier to connect
with someone in a group

681
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:35,820
so they can feel secure
as a security blanket,

682
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:38,719
and by doing such things,
these gang banger,

683
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:42,585
preys on the vulnerability
of our young people

684
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,451
and which causing them now to
go out and do crazy things.

685
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:49,074
So I don't think
that they started out

686
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:54,079
wanting to be gang banger to
kill or to harm or maim people.

687
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,498
They want protection,
support and because of that,

688
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,468
it led to the next page
or the next chapter

689
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:06,298
of what has taking
place in our community.

690
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,921
I need to ask you
some questions.

No [speaks in Spanish]

Well you have, but you haven't.

I need to know why that
man shot your husband.

696
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:22,452
Why don't you go find
a shooter and ask him.

697
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:24,144
Is there any reason
why anyone would want

698
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:25,248
to shoot your husband?

699
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,321
What about his former
running buddies?

700
00:44:29,356 --> 00:44:30,668
Did he owe any money?

701
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:33,878
My husband was just
fixing a friend's car.

702
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,813
Shot five times
for fixing a car.

703
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:40,678
Wow, maybe he was just unlucky.

704
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:45,579
I'm sorry, but you
want me to believe

705
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:46,960
that he was just a nobody.

706
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:48,099
Was a nobody.

707
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,758
No, my husband is a man of God.

708
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,276
What a purpose on his life?

709
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,728
We'll watch him in bed with
holes all through his body.

00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:31,171
13A, 61, 13A, 61
[indistinct] for 13.

887
00:57:31,206 --> 00:57:33,519
You know it's work,
you know what it is?

888
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:36,176
What's that?

889
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:38,040
It's all work.

890
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:40,560
It's definitely play,
but it's all work

891
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:41,734
when it comes to that gang.

892
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:44,944
See that's problem,
I like to play.

893
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,428
[laughing]

894
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,983
[indistinct chattering]

895
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:52,779
I get that, I get that.

896
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,022
[indistinct chattering]

897
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:58,475
We need more YMCA,
we need more funding.

898
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:02,064
We need all these things
to help in our community

899
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,791
and that will
lower the violence.

900
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:07,104
We'll not stop it,
but it will lower it.

901
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:09,796
When you give people
direction and vision

902
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:11,246
things will change.

903
00:58:12,316 --> 00:58:14,629
Mr. Beach, I certainly
take your point

904
00:58:14,663 --> 00:58:17,701
about the need for
intervention and support

905
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:19,979
and community
organizations like the YMCA

906
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:21,912
and these communities.

907
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:28,125
However, one can't deny putting
violent offenders in jail

908
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,231
certainly does take
them off the street.

909
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:34,062
And after all the
United States of America

910
00:58:34,096 --> 00:58:36,961
is a nation of laws.

911
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:40,655
I mean, wouldn't chaos reign
if we didn't have respect

912
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:44,521
for the rule of law, if people
didn't have to do the time

913
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,799
when they committed the crime.

914
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,423
Well, I do respect what you
say, but throwing them in jail

915
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:52,390
will not solve all the problem.

916
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:55,083
What I'm talking
about is prevention.

917
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:57,879
I'm trying to stop them
before they go to prison

918
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:00,019
to come out being worst.

919
00:59:00,053 --> 00:59:01,203
Should we just throw them away

920
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:03,816
because someone made a mistake.

921
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:06,819
I myself made a
whole lot of mistake.

922
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:08,348
Personally I shouldn't
be here talking to you.

923
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:11,099
I've been in jail a few times,

924
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:14,378
but I'm doing great
to society right now.

925
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:16,000
I've reached a
whole lot of people.

926
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:20,384
People lives are being
changed because of my change.

927
00:59:20,418 --> 00:59:22,386
[Tony] Lord, how
do I understand?

928
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,942
[Lord] [laughs] That's
what I love about you.

929
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:28,461
[Tony] What's that?

930
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:31,015
[Lord] Even the disciples
didn't so many questions.

931
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:36,607
I'm sorry, it's just hard.

932
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:40,162
There's so much pain
on earth, so much evil.

933
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,820
[Lord] Let me ask you something.

934
00:59:42,855 --> 00:59:45,961
If you were me, would you have
different people free will?

935
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:51,517
I don't know.

936
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,452
[Lord] Tell me something,
do you trust me?

937
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:57,283
Yes Lord, I trust you.

938
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,254
[Lord] Okay, it's
your time yet son,

939
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:05,222
I still have work for you to do.

940
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:10,572
Your soul is here, but your
body is still on earth.

941
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:15,439
Now, I want you to give
a message to my people.

942
01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:19,995
[indistinct chattering]

943
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,100
- [knocking]
- Yes.

944
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:24,585
Oh, not a problem.

945
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:27,772
It's like she doesn't see
me standing right here,

946
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:29,636
you know what I mean.
Yes ma'am, it'd be great.

947
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,903
It'll help me.

948
01:00:30,937 --> 01:00:32,905
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me mess?

949
01:00:32,939 --> 01:00:34,147
- Yes.
- Yes.

950
01:00:34,182 --> 01:00:35,746
Do you know where the
Tony Davis room is?

951
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:36,840
First door on the right.

952
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:37,979
Thank you so much.

953
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:40,775
- Don't forget to -.

954
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:43,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

955
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,678
Can I help you?

956
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:49,991
Is this a Tony Davis room?

957
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,025
[indistinct] family?

958
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,417
Oh, help me Jesus.

959
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,706
Brother, brother,
brother, brother, brother.

960
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:19,641
We are are so sorry.

961
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:25,233
If you hadn't picked us up,
this wouldn't have happened and-

962
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:26,268
Don't say that.

963
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:27,303
Oh man,

964
01:01:28,512 --> 01:01:30,687
Jade, you know what?

965
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,482
I don't have your inhaler,
you don't have your inhaler.

966
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:34,977
Why you gonna have
an asthma attack now?

967
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,392
- It's like, it not the time.
- No, Karen,

968
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:37,416
it's not funny.

969
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:39,730
I'm [indistinct]
find out who did this

970
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:40,845
and I'm gonna kill him all.

971
01:01:41,939 --> 01:01:43,769
Maybe you should
wait outside, please.

972
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:47,127
No, I'm [indistinct] go
over there with my people.

973
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:49,740
No, no, Tony is the
toughest person you knew.

974
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:51,373
You put on your jacket
and you calm down-

975
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:53,123
Woman I'm a man,

976
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:55,263
and I need to get them
fools for what they did.

977
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:56,540
[indistinct] Jay, okay.

978
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,888
"Vengeance is mind,"
says the Lord all right.

979
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:03,167
Let God deal with that
all right, please.

980
01:02:04,928 --> 01:02:06,274
I'ma carry his vengeance alone.

981
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:07,137
That's what I'm gonna do.

982
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:09,001
Come on Jake, come on.

983
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:11,555
[indistinct] too much
baby, you're too much.

984
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,976
I haven't seen him act
like that in a while.

985
01:02:21,082 --> 01:02:22,324
It's okay, Karen

986
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:25,465
No, what I'm saying
is he was hot, right?

987
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,788
He saw the way he
got [indistinct]-

988
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:28,675
Karen really it's okay.

989
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:34,647
[orchestral music]

990
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:40,583
You okay?

991
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:45,313
I'm sorry.

992
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,661
[crying]

993
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:53,700
[birds chirping]

994
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:58,705
Lord, this message it's
needed, but me father?

995
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:07,991
Yes you, I want you to tell
the world what you have seen.

996
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:10,579
I want you to live a life,

997
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:14,687
demonstrating my
power and forgiveness.

998
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:17,621
Wouldn't you say that jail
was a kind of turning point

999
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:18,655
in your life?

1000
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:22,591
It was in a sense, it
kind of woke me up.

1001
01:03:22,626 --> 01:03:25,353
I hate to go there, but
I went back a few times,

1002
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:28,874
but it was a spiritual
awakening that opened up my eyes

1003
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:31,842
that I realized I don't
have to go back to jail

1004
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:34,051
after my spiritual awakening.

1005
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:37,192
So even more than
your time behind bars,

1006
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:41,300
this spiritual awakening
is what set you on the path

1007
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,749
that you're now on.

1008
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:44,544
Exactly, 'cause sometimes
you go behind bars,

1009
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:47,754
you come out worse, 'cause
you learn more behind bars

1010
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:51,310
to come out to do things
outside, even worse.

1011
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:53,277
It's not solving the problem.

1012
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:58,696
Heaven on one side and
earth on the other.

1013
01:04:00,077 --> 01:04:01,665
[Lord] And do you have a choice?

1014
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,219
Chris can't do this alone.

1015
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,153
[Lord] I made her Tony.

1016
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:08,292
I know what she can do.

1017
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:11,986
Wow, what's that feeling?

1018
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:15,472
[Lord] That's my spirit.

1019
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:19,165
Lord, I'll deliver your message,

1020
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,580
just wash me in your spirit.

1021
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,964
[Lord] My son, because as
your faith and willingness

1022
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:27,691
to serve, you will be healed.

1023
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:36,251
[indistinct chattering]

1024
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:47,055
You can stop right now, it's
no choice, you can stop.

1025
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:49,644
- Look.
- What?

1026
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:51,439
Look at that car.

1027
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:53,027
Is that the car that shot at us?

1028
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:56,375
I don't know.

1029
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:57,824
Yeah, I think it is.

1030
01:04:59,481 --> 01:05:00,724
So?

1031
01:05:00,758 --> 01:05:02,519
If it is call them
let them do this.

1032
01:05:02,553 --> 01:05:04,521
No, we could take them fools.

1033
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:06,350
We gonna be heroes.

1034
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:07,282
Heroes.

1035
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:08,145
Yeah, come on.

1036
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,008
What?

1037
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:10,043
Come on.

You heard what the gang said.

Man forget what the game said.

1044

I ain't about to
kill no innocent man.

1045
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,030
He can go with that punk crap.

1046
01:05:31,065 --> 01:05:32,756
Man I won't do this.

1047
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,758
If you kill this
man, it's on you.

1048

are not gonna shoot me.

You understand what I
just explained to you?

1062
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,889
You may not realize it
yet, but you're a miracle.

1063
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:17,136
I've seen patients come in
with one gunshot wound dead.

1064
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,171
You're here.

1065
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,625
Look the leg, it's gone.

1066
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,561
The muscle tissue's dead, we
need to take it in the morning.

1067
01:07:30,805 --> 01:07:35,499
I understand this isn't easy,
but look you have to focus

1068
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,536
on the fact that you're
alive and that's a miracle.

1069
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,849
I have some good news.

1070
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,991
If you can breathe on your
own, we can take the trach out.

1071

We'll try again tomorrow.

1082
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:33,695
You took faith.

1083
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,838
There's a reason you're
alive, focus on that.

1084
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:42,394
[beeps]

1085
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:55,476
Can you tell us a bit about
this spiritual awakening

1086
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:56,994
that you had?

1087
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:59,928
Well, my spiritual
awakening came

1088
01:08:59,963 --> 01:09:02,138
because I was tired
of doing wrong.

1089
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:05,486
Tired of being a
manace to society,

1090
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:10,560
and I was kind of suicidal
'cause I was hurting.

1091
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,286
I was tired of selling drugs,

1092
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,977
exactly what we're
talking about.

1093
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:19,293
But I had a spiritual awakening

1094
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:21,295
where I have an outer
body experience,

1095
01:09:22,537 --> 01:09:25,299
and it wakes me
up, I became woke.

1096
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:29,199
And when I follow that
direction, by changing my life,

1097
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:34,204
giving my life to Jesus,
it brings a life changing,

1098
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:39,347
Profound life changing,
life meant something.

1099
01:09:39,382 --> 01:09:42,937
Loving my brothers,
caring about people,

1100
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:45,767
it was so different.

1101
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:48,908
So now I live my life
not trying to sell drugs,

1102
01:09:48,943 --> 01:09:51,773
destroying people,
destroying my society,

1103
01:09:51,808 --> 01:09:53,223
destroying my community.

1104
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:56,295
I live a life now
trying to help,

1105
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,711
not to break down
but to build up.

Mr. Davis, how are
we doing today?

1130
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,717
I just need to get a
quick look at the leg.

1131
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:38,777
Yes.

1132
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:46,232
We were scheduled to amputate
this leg today, right?

1133
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:47,267
Yep.

1134
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:51,755

leg is completely healed.

Can you do it again?

1137
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:03,457
No, this leg's alive and well.

1138

"This leg was dead."

01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,931
So what exactly happened?

What these two gangs just
are killing each other.

1405
01:28:38,865 --> 01:28:42,213
One gang shoot one, the
other one retaliate.

1406

They even killed a
innocent bystander.

1407

Glory to God they didn't.

Oh.

You come to get revenge?

No man, I came to forgive.

1412
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,651
Don't you think it's a
little late for that?

01:29:07,894 --> 01:29:08,894
Maybe.

I don't understand,
you told me to forgive

1416
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:23,772
and use myself as a
tool, I'm confused.

1417
01:29:25,014 --> 01:29:27,741
Hey young blood, your
mission is your message,

1418
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:32,850

that was for you.

that homeless man?
