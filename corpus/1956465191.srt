1
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,270
Okay, I think that does it.

2
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
All right.
Let's go.

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,280
Felix, we'll see you
over at the east wing.

4
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Don't take too long.

5
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,370
Still got that mummy...

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,160
Hmm.

7
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,540
This way!

8
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,500
Freeze!

9
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,160
Wha...

10
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,790
Shots came
from over here!

11
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,090
Are you sure?Yeah!

12
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,220
Move!

13
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,370
What the hell is that?

14
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,720
If we shadows have offended,

15
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,070
think but this,
and all is mended.

16
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,600
that you have
but slumbered here

17
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,030
while these visions
did appear,

18
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,340
and this weak
and idle theme...

19
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,000
...no more yielding
than a dream.

20
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,740
Gentles, do not reprehend.

21
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,350
If you pardon,
we will mend.

22
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,050
And as I am an honest Puck,

23
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,140
and if we have unearned luck,

24
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,490
now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue,

25
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,490
we will make
amends ere long.

26
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,490
Else the Puck a liar call,

27
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,060
so good night
unto you all.

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,890
Give me your hands
if we be friends,

29
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,460
and Robin shall
restore amends.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,780
Special delivery for
the most talented actress
in all of New York City.

31
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,390
Stephan, you came!

32
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

33
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,220
Did my dad leave
these with you?

34
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,830
Uh, yeah...

35
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Y-Yeah!

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
He said to tell you
he was sorry

37
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,140
he had to leave early.

38
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,930
Said you'd understand.

39
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,410
That's just like him,
but at least you stayed
until the end.

40
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,630
How could I leave?

41
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,670
You were riveting.

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,460
You're so sweet.

43
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,240
Give me a sec
to get changed.

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,850
You can walk me home.

45
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,240
Don't change too much,
Maggie.

46
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,510
You're perfect
just the way you are.

47
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,350
Look at him.
Who's this?

48
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,050
Can I help you?

49
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,100
Near as I can tell,
nothing was taken.

50
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,490
That makes it a local murder.

51
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,060
How does this involve
Interpol?

52
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,540
Cheese and crackers!
What the heck
happened to him?

53
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,460
I'll let you know
as soon as I do.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,650
Grrr!

55
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,950
Okay, people,
give me what you got.

56
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,890
Hmm.

57
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,420
Hey, sorry, fella.

58
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,900
Would hate to have to
brought you all the way
from Africa only to...

59
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,250
Nelson.

60
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,560
We have a dead
alien here.

61
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,780
Where are you?

62
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,950
Something came up.
I had to check it out.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,740
What is it?
What did you find?

64
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,610
Not over the phone.

65
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,830
The park.

66
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,390
Across the street
from the office.

67
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,700
Ten minutes. Ten minutes.

68
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,410
What was so important

69
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,670
he couldn't have waited
a few more minutes?

70
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Your dad works
for Interpol,

71
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,500
and the whole world
is his precinct.

72
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,240
But, as busy as he is...

73
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,510
He came tonight,
and I appreciate it.

74
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,680
It's just,
I know in his heart,

75
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,430
he doesn't get
the whole acting thing.

76
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,040
He doesn't appreciate
how similar we are.

77
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,690
Him being an international
investigator,

78
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,870
and you?

79
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,560
And me being
an actress, yes!

80
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,390
Where do you think I get
my impeccable eye for detail?

81
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,090
Maggie Nelson,
multinational secret agent?

82
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,750
Now, there's
a scary thought.

83
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,360
Why not?
I've studied martial arts...

84
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,540
Ha!

85
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,540
Fencing... ha.

86
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,240
Target practice
and horseback riding...

87
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,630
You realize most young
actresses wait tables?

88
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,510
Speaking of which,
double caramel
mocha frap on me?

89
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,770
Yeah. But my treat.

90
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,860
We're celebrating
your opening night.

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,600
Well, let's go, Candice.
I haven't got all night.

92
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,300
Where are you?

93
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,470
Where are you?

94
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,210
I'm in the park.
You said to meet...

95
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,340
I'm not in the park.
I'm at the museum,

96
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,910
where you should be
explaining to me

97
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,430
what this creature
is doing here

98
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,040
wearing
a guard's uniform!

99
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Ha ha!

100
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,040
At long last,
eh, Agent Nelson?

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,340
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,740
I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage, sir.

103
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,830
I've been called many
things over the years.

104
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,310
I happen to have grown
a particular fondness

105
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,580
for Manikin.

106
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,360
It suits me,
as I put on guises easily.

107
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,230
Pleased to finally
make your acquaintance.

108
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,850
Though it isn't as if
you haven't tried,

109
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,150
following me all over
the globe and back again.

110
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,550
Now, you have something
that belongs to me.

111
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,720
Ha!

112
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,250
I don't really need
that woman's stone,

113
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,470
but it would make
my task a lot easier...

114
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,820
Damned noisy,
that gun of mine.

115
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,120
Grrr!

116
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,780
Watch your back.
Shots have been fired.

117
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,740
Let's go, men.
Search around.

118
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,230

Ooh, tough crowd.

129
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,430
With me here in
the studio is Mr. Mix,

130
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,780
reptile-at-large,

131
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,310
a gift from
my globetrotting
parental unit

132
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,570
and the subject of
my science term project.

133
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,750
May I say, sir, I'm
a big fan of your work.

134
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,150
A chameleon does
naturally what an actor
works so hard at.

135
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,150
It's why I chose to do
my bio term paper

136
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,930
on you and your ilk.

137
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,890
Ilk.
I love that word.

138
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,640
Right.

139
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,470
We so have to talk
to Dad about

140
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,040
getting me
my own computer.

141
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,380
Aah!

142
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,910
No-o!

143
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,920
You've got it?Yeah.

144
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,490
Can it be?

145
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,330
Maggie!
Are you okay?

146
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,030
Uh, is she okay?

147
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,730
Mags, if... if something
happened to you,

148
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,730
I don't know...

149
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,730
Lightning! Pow.Huh?

150
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,480
Crackle. Ouch!

151
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,000
Uh, yeah.
I think so.

152
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,350
Thanks
for letting me in.

153
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,960
I think we'll
be all right now.

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,960
Yeah, well, I gotta go
to the basement

155
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,570
and check the breakers.

156
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,100
I warned you about
using a computer

157
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,410
in the middle
of a storm.

158
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,680
Whoa.
This is radical.

159
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,900
You're telling me.

160
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,460
Mags, you sure
you're okay?

161
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,070
Yeah.You're not acting okay.

162
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
Are you saying
I'm a bad actress?

163
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,210
How the heck did you...

164
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,120
How the heck did I...

165
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,610
Very funny. I came because
I heard you shout out,

166
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,300
not to get made fun of.

167
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,870
What?

168
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,260
Steph, what did I say?

169
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,090
You imitated me.

170
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,570
I did?

171
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,450
Um, can I have
some... water?

172
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,500
Hmm.

173
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,940
Aah!

174
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,070
Huh?

175
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,990
What is it?

176
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,340
What's wrong?

177
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,040
I just saw...
something I couldn't have.

178
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,780
Thanks.

179
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,170
Maggie, listen.

180
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,000
Just now...

181
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,260
when I wasn't sure if you
were gonna be okay,

182
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,050
it made me realize
I have something

183
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,270
I really need
to tell...

184
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,410
Hello?

185
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,670
Yes, Margaret Nelson.

186
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,020
What's wrong?

187
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,540
We'll see him
in a moment, Maggie.

188
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,020
Room 416.

189
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,460
Wha...

190
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,950
While you're here,

191
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,170
you might want
to get checked out
yourself, Maggie.

192
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm fine.

193
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,950
You may have been
struck by...

194
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,910
Stephan, it's my dad
I need to worry about
right now.

195
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,090
Dad!

196
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,360
I'll wait downstairs.

197
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,150
Hey, Magpie.

198
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,800
Oh, Daddy, shh.

199
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,410
Don't try to talk.

200
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,940
Yeah. I'm sorry about
leavin' your play.

201
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,380
You know sometimes
the real world...

202
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,810
Gets in the way
of the acting world.

203
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,510
I know, and...

204
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,170
you know how much
I love you.

205
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,050
Nurse? Someone?

206
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,180
No, no.

207
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,350
It's okay, Magpie.
Promise me.

208
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Anything.

209
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,270
Keep your grades up.
Go to college.

210
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,490
Get a real job.

211
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,670
Something safe and secure?

212
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,240
Yeah.

213
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,370
Like an Interpol agent?

214
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,330
Magpie,
you were great tonight.

215
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,550
Better than great.

216
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,120
Your mother
would have been so proud.

217
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,120
I'm so proud.

218
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,430
You ace your term paper...

219
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,820
I'll...
I'll read lines with ya.

220
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,170
Deal, Daddy.

221
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,580
Is he okay?

222
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,270
Can you tell me...

223
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,670
What's going on?

224
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,450
Huh?

225
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,330
Where did they go?

226
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,410
How could
they get past us?

227
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,460
We have to find them,
or "M" will melt us alive.

228
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,260
"M"?

229
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,080
How did I do that?

230
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,910
Margaret?

231
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,310
Your father
needs his rest.

232
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,660
Who are you?

233
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm his boss,
Special Agent Newell.

234
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,100
I must insist
you come along.

235
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,620
What happened to him?

236
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
That's classified.

237
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,840
I've been
an Interpol agent's
daughter my whole life.

238
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,540
I should have seen
that non-answer coming.

239
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,670
Is he gonna be okay?

240
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,370
I'm not a doctor.

241
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,330
You're not the most
sensitive person
in the world,

242
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,460
either, are you?

243
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,460
My job is to find
the person or people

244
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,990
responsible for what happened
to your father, Miss Nelson.

245
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,470
Would you rather
I do that,

246
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,770
or fall to the floor
in tears?

247
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,380
We'll have guards
posted 24/7.

248
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,690
What should I do?

249
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,690
Go home, Maggie.

250
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,430
You have a paper
due tomorrow, don't you?

251
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,170
Your dad talks about you
all the time.

252
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,440
He does?

253
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Go get some rest.

254
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,310
I want you two
to stay on guard here.

255
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,750
Special Agent Newell?

256
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,530
No one...

257
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,490
Please call me
when he wakes up.

258
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,460
Steph,
he looks so weak.

259
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,330
It'll be okay, Mags.

260
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,590
It will.Stephan, you're always
there for me.

261
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,420
What was it you were
gonna tell me earlier?

262
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,420
It can wait.

263
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,600
I'll get us a cab.

264
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,170
Thanks.

265
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,300
Taxi! Taxi!

266
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,290
Don't think you're
getting another nibble

267
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,340
until you explain what
the heck happened to me.

268
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,860
Mm, here.

269
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,260
I could understand
getting bitten by
a radioactive chameleon,

270
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,740
but lightning?

271
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,960
How is it that I can
copy your abilities?

272
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,410
And why isn't anything
happening now?

273
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,980
Maybe I imagined
the whole thing.

274
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,470
Aah!

275
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,960
No.

276
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,440
No!

277
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,400
Aah!

278
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,420
No!

279
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,830
Aah!

280
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,530
Maggie, you okay?

281
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,400
Steph, don't you
ever sleep?

282
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,710
I was thinking about what
happened to your dad.

283
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,720
Maybe if we went through
some of his papers.

284
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,850
Y-Yeah?

285
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,500
Just to see what
he was up to.

286
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,590
You know, before
he was attacked?

287
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,000
How did you know?

288
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm not the one
who should be answering
questions right now,

289
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,270
starting with who,
or what are you?

290
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,050
The closest English
pronunciation of my name

291
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,490
that I could come up
with is "Mosaic."

292
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,970
As to what I am...

293
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,190
"M!"

294
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,670
Who? What?

295
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,410
You're "M."

296
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,020
You sent those men
to get my dad. Why?

297
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,590
No. That wasn't me.

298
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,720
That's the man
I'm looking for.

299
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,720
He often calls himself
Manikin.

300
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,080
You're probably a bit
confused right now.

301
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,560
Golly gosh, ya think?

302
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,560
You deserve an explanation.

303
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,560
Good student that you are,
I'm sure you know

304
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,350
about the origins of man,
homo sapiens.

305
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,740
Uh, right.
Okay.

306
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,880
Well, there was another
branch to that tree.

307
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,620
Homo chameleal.

308
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
That's what we are
descended from.

309
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,710
We meaning you
and this Manikin guy?

310
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,540
We meaning my people.

311
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,800
When the continents were one,

312
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,410
we lived on a large island

313
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,850
in what you call the Indian Ocean.

314
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,720
And for thousands of years as we evolved, mutated,

315
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,380
we were isolated by the sea from other humans.

316
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,690
We developed abilities

317
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,600
that helped us survive.

318
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,430
We forged a society,

319
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,950
became a civilization unto ourselves:

320
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,390
the Chimera.

321
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,650
Just as we were able to change ourselves,

322
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,920
so were there those among us

323
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,140
who could imbue metal and stone with abilities

324
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,790
they were never meant to possess:

325
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,750
alchemy.

326
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,410
The few times we left our home

327
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,110
to come in contact with the human world...

328
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,890
to be honest, it never ended well.

329
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,290
Nearly 300 years ago,

330
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,070
a natural disaster devastated
our island paradise.

331
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,090
Chimera was mostly claimed by the sea.

332
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,750
Or scattered
into other lands.

333
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,270
We tried to blend in
with the human population.

334
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,890
So you stayed hidden
all this time?

335
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,850
Well, let's just say
we've tried.

336
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,850
Then why are
you here now?

337
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,030
Several years ago,
a movement began

338
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,250
to try to rebuild
our dying civilization.

339
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,290
We met in remote places in secret.

340
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,080
The human world had forgotten about us,

341
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,510
and our experience was such

342
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,820
that we chose to be careful and remain hidden.

343
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,740
But there was this one, a revolutionary,

344
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,910
who decided we shouldn't let the human race

345
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,910
dominate us anymore.

346
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,130
He argued that our science and technology

347
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,140
were far superior to anything the humans had

348
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,880
snatched by archeologists and thieves

349
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,790
and left to gather dust in museums

350
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,970
by fools who had no clue to their power.

351
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,930
Gathering them together,

352
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,760
there was no reason we could not use

353
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,190
the alchemical power of the chameleal

354
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,930
to hold dominion over the earth.

355
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,810
A few of our people began to agree with him.

356
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,200
The Council rightfully rejected his cause.

357
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,900
Let me guess:
his name was Manikin.

358
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,560
Yes. Manikin
left Chimera,

359
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,210
and took his followers
with him.

360
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,000
A select handful
of us were dispatched
to apprehend him.

361
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,910
So, you're
a chameleon...cop?

362
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Something like that.

363
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,130
What does any of this
have to do

364
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,740
with what happened
to my father?

365
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,970
In recent months, Manikin began

366
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,490
retrieving these ancient objects

367
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,840
from various museums around the world...

368
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,750
leading here to New York City.

369
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,930
I have been tracking him.

370
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,850
So, apparently, had your father.

371
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,070
I had placed chameleal agents in various museums.

372
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,460
Tonight, one was killed.

373
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,200
So those are the thefts
my dad's been investigating.

374
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,860
And this Manikin guy
attacked him because...

375
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,210
I don't know why.

376
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,730
He'd already escaped

377
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,600
with the sacred eye stone
of Chimera.

378
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,650
Um, yeah, so...

379
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,430
This is all
pretty ridiculous.

380
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,350
Contrary to
popular belief,

381
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,870
not every drama club geek
has a phaser in her locker,

382
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,610
and all 10 hours of
Lord of the Ringson DVD.

383
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,090
Clueless.

384
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,400
Admit it. You know about
as much about my world

385
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,920
as I know about yours.

386
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,140
You need my help.

387
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,150
Nonsense. You would
serve no other function

388
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,710
than to be in my way.

389
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,190
Quite a line
you got there, Mo.

390
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,020
You really know how
to charm the ladies, eh?

391
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,110
Let us be frank, Maggie.

392
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,500
You are an actress.

393
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,330
Guilty as charged,
but I'm an actress...

394
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,770
who can do this.

395
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,940
Sod's blood!

396
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,120
Well, you think
that's impressive,

397
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,380
I'm just getting
started.

398
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,170
I don't understand.
You're only human.

399
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,220
Never in the history
of our separate races

400
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,040
has there ever been a human
who shared our abilities.

401
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,050
Yeah, well, practice,
practice, practice.

402
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,480
That's my motto.

403
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,360
Earlier,
I sensed something.

404
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,750
Tell me, did anything
unusual happen to you?

405
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,450
Other than my father
being hurt,

406
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,100
not that I can think of.

407
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,150
No. Nope, sorry.

408
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,280
There was
an ancient myth,

409
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,020
I always thought
it was little more
than a child's tale.

410
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,550
When there came a time
of great darkness,

411
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,850
a mighty chameleal
warrior,

412
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,770
who could stand
between two worlds,

413
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,340
would walk the earth.

414
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,250
Uh, yeah. That's me.

415
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,950
Little old camelia
at your service.

416
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,000
This Manikin guy
hurt my father.

417
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,780
I don't know
if you know what it's like
to see your dad in pain.

418
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,920
For whatever reason,
I can do these things.

419
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,090
I don't care
how long it takes,

420
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,920
how high or low I have
to search for this guy.

421
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,050
What do we do next?

422
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,930
I'm so gonna have
to learn that trick.

423
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,070
Mr. Mix, what did
you get me into?

424
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,220
Uhhh!

425
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,790
Too easy.

426
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,240
Cool!

427
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,900
Hi, there's Tom!Oh, crap.

428
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,820
I love him!

429
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,170
Oh, my gosh!
I'll get him.

430
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,370
Mom! That looks
like Spiderman.

431
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,330
See? Up there
on the building.

432
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,900
You've been reading too many
comic books, young man.

433
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,120
Gotta remember
to be more careful.

434
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,850
Hmm.

435
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,470
Whoa.

436
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,290
Get a grip, girl.

437
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,260
Visiting hours
at the hospital

438
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,260
don't start
for a couple of hours.

439
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,480
Maybe they have
a chameleon exhibit.

440
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,550
Wow, it's amazing
how closely we're related.

441
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,550
Couple of DNA strands
different,

442
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,860
and I'd never be able

443
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,770
to shave all the hair
off my legs.

444
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Ha ha ha!

445
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,830
Hey, sweetie.
Where ya goin'?

446
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Yeah. Wanna party?

447
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,710
Hey, don't walk away!

448
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,450
Stay.

449
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,030
Aah!

450
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,560
Huh?

451
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,840
The two guys
you're looking for

452
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,800
are hiding right over there,
behind that clump of bushes.

453
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,760
All right, you two,
come out with your hands

454
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,420
nice and high,
so I can see 'em.

455
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,250
That was kind of fun.

456
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,550
This is so weird.
I seem to be able

457
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,640
to see people's
and animal's DNA.

458
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,520
Once I see it,
I can change into it.

459
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,040
I can blend into
the background

460
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,130
and essentially
disappear.

461
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,790
How, and why,
did this happen to me?

462
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,750
Was I holding Mr. Mix
when the lightning struck?

463
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,490
Maybe some of his abilities
got zapped into me.

464
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,620
If I've got some of
his abilities, I wonder

465
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,280
if I've got any
of his weaknesses?

466
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,190
Well, I'll have to do
more study on that later.

467
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,850
Or I won't make it
to the hospital on time.

468
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,780
Oh, Maggie.

469
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,210
Stephan!Huh?

470
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,340
I tried to catch you
before you left this morning,

471
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,300
but I...overslept.

472
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,570
I can imagine. After
everything that's happened,

473
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,700
you must... I must need help
with my term paper.

474
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,310
Exactly.

475
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,310
Stephan, you're
the smartest person I know.

476
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,400
I need you to tell me
everything you know
about chameleons.

477
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,270
Uh, sure.

478
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,540
I got a private science
lab session right now,

479
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,540
but we can talk
at lunch.

480
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,370
No! I need your help now.
Lunch might be too late.

481
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,020
What? Your paper
isn't due until...

482
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,460
Mr. Bullwraith!

483
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm sure there is
a reason

484
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,590
why the bell has still rung
and you are both still here

485
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,120
in the hallway?

486
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,990
Yes, sir!No, sir.

487
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,600
Um...

488
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,610
I have to talk
to Stephan now.

489
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,750
Wow!

490
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,230
No sign of the real
Principal Bullwraith.

491
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,020
Aha!Huh?

492
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,370
I caught you at last.
Mrs. Notten...

493
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,460
Ahem.

494
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,900
Mrs. Nottenmyer.

495
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,510
So what can I do for
the school's librarian today?

496
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,680
You can address the matter
of overdue books

497
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,080
at the next school
assembly, if you would.

498
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,120
It would be a pleasure.

499
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,650
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Mrs. Nottenmyer...

500
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,870
No problem,
Mr. Bullwraith.

501
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,220
Oh!

502
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll be in my office
during lunch hour.

503
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,490
Again.

504
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,880
There are just some things

505
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,020
a student shouldn't know
about her teachers.

506
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,200
There you are.

507
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,550
Maggie.
What are you doing here?

508
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,340
Are you in some
kinda trouble?
Is there anything...

509
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,910
Please, Stephan, focus.
I need you.

510
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,470
You need me?
Uh...

511
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,780
Yes, I need your
encyclopedic brain.

512
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,570
Do chameleons have
any weaknesses?

513
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,440
Weakness?Margaret.

514
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,570
There's been a problem.

515
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,150
Taken?Yes.

516
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,890
You had guards there.
I saw them.

517
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,280
How did it happen?

518
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,460
Apparently, someone
signed for his release.

519
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,160
Someone who looked
exactly like me.

520
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,550
An imposter, who managed
to fool two agents

521
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,470
that have worked with me
for 12 years.

522
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,430
Where are we going?

523
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,820
You're the most important
thing in your father's life.

524
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,250
If anything happens to you...

525
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,390
I don't need you
to protect me.

526
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,350
Your townhouse has already
been ransacked, torn apart.

527
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,620
They know where you live.

528
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,190
Besides, your father would
want me to look out for you.

529
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,110
Maggie!
What are you...

530
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,510
Come on! Get out
of the street!

531
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,510
Hey! Move that thing!

532
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,530
I know I can find my dad
faster than they can.

533
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,490
They're not gonna keep me
under lock and key.

534
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Thanks, Stanley.

535
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,470
Stanley, I need a favor.

536
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,910
I've left
my security badge home,

537
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,560
and I need you to issue me
a temp visitor's badge.

538
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,740
Sure, no problem,
Agent Newell.

539
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,700
I just need you
to confirm your I.D.

540
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,520
with your
thumbprint here.

541
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,540
Show time!

542
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,510
This is a little awkward.

543
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,770
I can explain.

544
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,260
Not necessary, Mosaic.

545
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,910
I still don't understand
how you have

546
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,520
the ability to see
past my disguise.

547
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,480
Can't you see my DNA?

548
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,660
Uh, no.
You can do that?

549
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,660
Not to worry, Mo,
when you've been doing this

550
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,010
as long as I have.

551
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,360
So, what did we find out?

552
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,620
We?

553
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,020
These are the places
your father

554
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,930
has tracked Manikin
for the past year.

555
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,280
And there's only one place
not yet checked off.

556
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,370
Rome.

557
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,460
Hmm. I've always
wanted to go to Italy.

558
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,370
On three.

559
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,990
Do you smell gunpowder?

560
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,550
I'm sorry?Uh-oh.

561
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,030
What-oh?I'll meet you there, okay?

562
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,910
Everyone freeze.

563
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,740
Everyone meaning me?

564
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,570
Arrest this woman.
She's an impostor!

565
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,830
Not funny.

566
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,970
But you have to admit,
this is kinda funny, right?

567
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,410
Sorry.

568
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,120
Finally, a fan club,

569
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,030
and they're out to kill me.

570
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,170
Sorry, no time
for autographs.

571
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,910
She's like a chameleon.

572
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,290
Hold it right there.
I.D., please.

573
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,510
All right.
Go ahead.

574
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,220
Hmm? Ah.

575
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,080
Maggie!

576
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,080
Shh.Maggie.

577
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,260
What's going on?

578
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,350
The police, federal agents,
your apartment...

579
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,740
It's something
my dad's mixed up in.

580
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,780
You know, Interpol stuff.

581
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,090
I thought your dad
was still in the hospital.

582
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,880
How's he doing?

583
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,880
He's been kidnapped,
Stephan.

584
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,750
And they've broken
into our place
and torn it apart.

585
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,190
That's horrible.
What are you gonna do?

586
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
They're putting me
in a safe house

587
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,020
until they get
my dad back.

588
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,020
Listen, Stephan,

589
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,500
I'm not really supposed
to be here,

590
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,110
but I had to get some
of my stuff, you know?

591
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,940
Anyway, I gotta go
before anyone sees me

592
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,210
and I get into trouble.

593
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,340
So don't tell anyone
you saw me here, okay?

594
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,860
Oh, sure.
I get it.

595
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,870
Listen, Maggie,
you take care, okay?

596
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,300
Don't do anything foolish.

597
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,130
I'd had to have
something happen to you.

598
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,310
I mean, I'd...

599
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,350
It's just that,
well, you... You're...

600
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,140
I know, Stephan.
I'll be careful.

601
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,400
Things will work out.
My dad will be fine.

602
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,930
And we'll both be back
before you know it.

603
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,370
I love you, Maggie.

604
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,040
There you go.

605
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,350
Flight 123 to Rome

606
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,610
is now ready for final boarding.

607
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,840
Wait!

608
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,890
Huh! Just made it.

609
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,520
You're good. What you
lack in experience,

610
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,180
you make up for with your
natural ability to improvise.

611
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,610
Mosaic?

612
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,010
How did you know
it was me?

613
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,440
And how come you're not
in disguise yourself?

614
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,880
I only knew it was you

615
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,580
because I was
looking out for you,

616
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,840
and noticed
the flight attendant

617
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,630
enter the rest room,
and you stepped out.

618
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,890
I'm not in disguise,
because, well,

619
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,720
frankly, no one
will recognize me.

620
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,940
Good point.

621
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,890
I guess I have
a lot to learn

622
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,850
about my new,
um, powers.

623
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,900
Golly gosh, ya think?

624
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,120
We'll be dimming the lights

625
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,510
for the rest of the flight to Rome, Italy.

626
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,430
The truth is,

627
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,040
very little in life
is what it appears
to be, Maggie.

628
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,000
Like the artifacts
my father has been known

629
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,090
to chase down
all across the planet?

630
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,570
Among other things, yes.

631
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,700
Now, we might be in
for quite the ordeal.

632
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,310
We're not exactly sure
what to expect

633
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,140
when we arrive in Rome,

634
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,710
and while you will no doubt
resist the notion,

635
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,020
you should at least try
to get some rest.

636
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,080
Don't take this
the wrong way,

637
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,990
but when you finally
settle on a face,

638
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,910
you're kinda cute.

639
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,560
Uh, thank you?

640
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,220
My mom used to travel.
She was a writer.

641
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,520
That's how
she and my dad met.

642
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,260
She always said she wanted
to take me to Europe.

643
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,530
It's just all so...
beautiful.

644
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,270
This city, this day...

645
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,450
I guess it's just
hard for me to believe

646
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,100
that we're on the trail
of some evil, master criminal.

647
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,670
More than just a criminal.

648
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,110
Manikin believes that
he has within his grasp

649
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,330
the power
to rule the world.

650
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,160
Okay, well, that
puts it in perspective.

651
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,030
Thanks.

652
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,910
Well, here we are.

653
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,470
Are you serious?

654
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,300
Manikin came all this way
for a loaf of bread?

655
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,960
The chameleal are
not the only ones

656
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,270
who disguise things
in plain sight.

657
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,570
Grazie
Ciao.

658
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,070
Are those... bones?

659
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,590
Hundreds...
no, thousands of bones?

660
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
The Cripta dei Cappuccini

661
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,380
houses the remains
of exhumed Capuchin monks.

662
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,820
The concept of having bones
in a chapel isn't unique.

663
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,300
For centuries, it was
common to have a bone

664
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,260
or a lock of hair
of a venerated person

665
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,910
as a relic in a church.

666
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,390
What distinguishes
the Capuchin crypt

667
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,180
is the unabashed
and flamboyant manner

668
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,350
in which the bones
are displayed.

669
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,880
Cardinal Antonio Barberini,

670
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
who was of
the Capuchin order,

671
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,190
in 1631
ordered the remains

672
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,410
of thousands
of Capuchin monks

673
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,970
exhumed and transferred

674
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,540
from the friary of
Via de Lucchese

675
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,060
to the crypt.

676
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,630
The crypt now contains
the remains of 4,000 monks

677
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,640
buried between 1500
and 1870,

678
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,420
during which time
the Papal States

679
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,420
permitted burial
in and under churches.

680
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,290
Come along, now.
Come along.

681
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,950
Oh, and please
don't touch the femurs.

682
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,700
A camera and a bunch
of bagged lunches.

683
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,400
What do you think
that means?

684
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,350
Several tourists
came through here?

685
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,440
I'll bet they were
named Manikin

686
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,360
and his Gumby
goon squad.

687
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,660
The guys
from the hospital.

688
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,190
It's what I was telling
Stephan: eye for detail.

689
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,280
Stephan your boyfriend?

690
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,760
Stephan my best friend.

691
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,070
We could wander down here
for days and never find them.

692
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,590
Not to worry, Mo.
We're right on their heels.

693
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,160
Head straight up that way.

694
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,740
It was paved with blood!

695
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,620
I can understand
what he's saying.

696
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,060
At the sight
of your dark harvest,

697
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,280
at this consecrated ground

698
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,970
where you stood your last,

699
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,020
rise again and deliver

700
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:49,150
on your prophecy.

701
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,420
I understand
what he's saying,

702
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,250
but I don't understand what
he's saying.

703
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,820
What's going on?

704
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,470
If that's what
I think it is,

705
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,600
what's going on
is not good.

706
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,870
Here, at the site
where the treachery

707
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,220
of your race
was brought to bear,

708
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,480
here, where
the disciples of Chimera

709
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,490
at long last
sought their destiny...

710
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:21,530
here, where we lost
our brothers and sisters,

711
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,010
sons and daughters,
fathers and mothers,

712
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,240
husbands...and wives.

713
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,850
Ahh.

714
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,640
We always thought Manikin
had ulterior motives

715
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,730
in collecting
our sacred totems.

716
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,990
But the Hive Council
never envisioned this.

717
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,340
What? What, tell me.

718
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,430
Whose mummy is that?

719
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,740
The body interred
in that sarcophagus?

720
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,350
Facade.

721
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,440
I guess you'd call her

722
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,270
the high priestess
of Chimera.

723
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,090
The shaman.

724
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,440
She was also
Manikin's wife.

725
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,310
But she's been dead
for over...

726
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,320
We live a long time.

727
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,580
Wait. How old are you?

728
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,630
Centuries ago,
here at the Via Veneto

729
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:17,150
you were betrayed
by the weak

730
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,290
and the blind
of your own race,

731
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,940
and murdered
by these animals

732
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,330
that call
themselves human.

733
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,510
He's saying we humans

734
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,560
were responsible
for the death of his wife

735
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,650
and all these
other people here?

736
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:33,560
You need to know
the whole story.

737
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,090
Facade had
a brilliant mind.

738
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,610
She took
the practice of alchemy

739
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,090
to a whole new level,

740
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,310
no longer bound by tools
and other apparatus.

741
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,090
She was able to
transform elements

742
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,490
by sheer will.

743
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,400
The Midas touch.

744
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,840
Yes. Sort of.

745
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,620
You can guess the origin
of that legend.

746
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,930
But this power
drove her mad.

747
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,670
She schemed to rule
the world, both
chameleal and human.

748
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,550
So the races actually teamed up
to defeat her? Where did...

749
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,330
And so, you have
teamed up again.

750
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,380
At least when
you took on my wife,

751
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,730
you had the sense to send
overwhelming numbers.

752
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,950
I feel slighted.

753
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,340
Where's my father?

754
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,430
How endearing!

755
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,480
You actually care
for this young human.

756
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,310
Really? Me?

757
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,270
Huh?

758
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,360
A human who can
wield our powers?

759
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,670
Then the legend
has come to life.

760
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,670
The Chimeran Princess,
at last!

761
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,850
At your service.

762
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,460
Ohh!

763
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,310
Don't move.

764
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,480
I have no idea
why you want

765
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,660
whatever it is you want,

766
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,050
but you having it
can only be a bad thing.

767
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,620
I think
I'll take this.

768
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,500
Gone, eh?

769
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,420
Or perhaps not as gone
as she would like to be.

770
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,810
Oh, yeah.
That'll help.

771
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,470
You must be quite
impressed with yourself.

772
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,650
A human, to have
acquired the abilities

773
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,650
of the long-lost
chameleal.

774
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,220
But you will discover
there is a difference

775
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,350
between ability
and experience.

776
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,270
I'm as big a fan
of improvisation

777
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,320
as the next girl,
but this is crazy.

778
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,640
Uh-oh.

779
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,610
Anomaly or no,

780
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,180
you are beneath
my contempt, human.

781
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,740
I'm an actress, Manny.

782
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,530
I'm beneath
everyone's contempt.

783
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,440
There. Now, in a moment,

784
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,880
you'll be beneath
a ton of earth and stone.

785
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,120
Come on, Maggie.
You may be scared,

786
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,550
but you don't
have to act like it.

787
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,280
Funny, isn't it,
Special Agent Newell?

788
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,460
You're always
five minutes behind us.

789
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Hmm.

790
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,330
Mo, you're okay.

791
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,600
Don't.Don't be stubborn.

792
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,640
You need help.No.

793
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,560
I mean, don't
call me Mo.

794
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,910
Nice, huh?

795
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,520
Nothing a little
pancake make-up won't heal.

796
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,920
Shape-shifter, right.
Forgot.

797
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,530
You need rest.

798
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,190
I cannot.

799
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,580
We've got to go.
Now.

800
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,930
Time is of the essence.

801
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,280
Where are we going?Where else?
After Manikin.

802
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,710
Well, where
is he going?

803
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,590
Didn't you notice
the map on the wall?

804
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,550
The magnetic top
of the earth.

805
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:23,940
The North Pole?

806
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,160
Close enough.Mosaic?

807
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,210
Do you think
my father is with him?

808
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,380
And still alive?

809
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,080
I don't know for sure.
But I think so.

810
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,090
Manikin doesn't
do things for no reason.

811
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,610
He must have some reason
for kidnapping your father.

812
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,570
And therefore,
keeping him alive.

813
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,600
Colonel Vespucci.

814
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,600
It is an honor that you
will be pursuing

815
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,300
the transport jet
that was stolen from here

816
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,130
only half an hour ago.

817
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:26,260
Let us-a not waste-a
time standing here
talking about it, Captain.

818
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,010
I can't believe
we're stealing a jet.

819
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,270
We're not stealing it

820
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,280
as much as
we're borrowing it.

821
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,240
And you can fly
this thing?

822
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,760
It wouldn't be
the first time

823
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,590
I've had to pass
myself off as a pilot.

824
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,540
You pick things up
here and there.

825
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,940
What happens
when they discover

826
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,160
the real
pilot and copilot

827
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,330
are still in the mess hall
eating dinner?

828
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,680
By then,
we will be far away.

829
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance.

830
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:22,060
I have finally pieced
together his master plan.

831
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,060
Master plan?

832
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,280
You are in serious need
of a script doctor, Mo.

833
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,930
Script doctor?

834
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,020
Go on.

835
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,370
Why is he trying
to resurrect his wife?

836
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,980
That is not an option.

837
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,680
Even for our race,
dead is dead.

838
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,860
Manikin has figured out
how to transfer

839
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,690
his wife's abilities
to himself.

840
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:49,870
Maybe I am stupid, but why
is this so earth-shattering?

841
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,960
He would have
absolute power.

842
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,740
He would be like a god.

843
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,660
Imagine what he could do.

844
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,570
He could change oil into water, or water into oil.

845
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,920
Industrialized nations

846
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,920
would fall to their knees before him.

847
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,710
Dad was right.

848
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,360
This whole acting thing

849
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,970
suddenly feels
empty and stupid,

850
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,840
when you consider
the world is at stake.

851
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,020
I hope he's still alive
to hear my apology.

852
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,940
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

853
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,280
Would you say
farmers are stupid,

854
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,200
or doctors,
or the police?

855
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,030
No, but they feed people.

856
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,860
They heal people.

857
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,250
The police protect us.

858
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:27,210
They feel and heal and
protect their bodies, yes.

859
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,780
But it is acting
that feeds their minds.

860
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,170
Gives them hope.

861
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,820
It takes them
from what is,

862
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,260
and envelops them
in what might be.

863
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,960
Do not ever forget that.

864
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,610
Oh, my gosh!
I totally forgot!

865
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:39,530
What?

866
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,790
I've got midterms on Monday.

867
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,880
I don't have any
of my books with me.

868
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,140
How am I gonna study?

869
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,230
I'm gonna flunk out.
I'm so dead.

870
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,260
Oh, the Borealis Stone.

871
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,390
The lay lines
on the ancient map

872
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,870
all led here.

873
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,880
The hardest totemic
icon to find

874
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,010
is also the most
powerful one.

875
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:33,100
Soon, soon!

876
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,070
You're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

877
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:49,030
Actually,
I couldn't give a...

878
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:52,030
I need a life-spark
for the final element.

879
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,040
I thought,
for all your tenacity,

880
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,210
for every time you peered
into the darkness

881
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,340
while others
would turn away,

882
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,740
it would be a fitting
reward that you be

883
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,220
in no small part
responsible

884
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,050
for my ascendancy!

885
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,830
You're welcome.

886
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,640
What was that?

887
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,080
It has begun.I see him.

888
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,390
I see my father.
He's still alive!

889
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,350
We have to hurry.
Remember our plan.

890
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,480
Here. Take this
magnesium flare.

891
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,570
You tried to lead them.

892
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,050
And they killed you,
my beloved.

893
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,710
Now. Now I will,
at long last,

894
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,280
assume your
rightful throne!

895
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,200
Facade.

896
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,680
My beloved.

897
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,290
This is why you bring
me back, my husband?

898
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,030
To watch you repeat
my mistakes?

899
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,950
Did you learn nothing?

900
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,730
That was a long time...

901
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,910
And you have spent all
this time wanting nothing

902
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,080
but revenge?

903
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,960
Do you not see
that the power you crave

904
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,960
will poison you
as it did me?

905
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,310
Who are you?A friend.

906
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:36,350
In the time
you've been gone...

907
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,100
I understand more
than you can imagine.

908
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,100
I know that
the cycle of revenge

909
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,750
only leads to the mutual
destruction of all life.

910
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,110
I know that a person
must always stand
for what is right,

911
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:52,540
or he will fall
for anything.

912
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,290
Liar!

913
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,770
Where I come from,
we call it acting.

914
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,560
No!

915
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,650
Your star turn
as the Chameleon Princess

916
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,650
was only designed
to distract me

917
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,050
so that your ally could
plant the explosives.

918
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:18,830
Cut and print.

919
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,180
That's a wrap.

920
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,660
Now it's up
to you, Mosaic,

921
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,930
to get my father
out of here alive.

922
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,100
Aah!

923
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,650
Thank you, son.
I couldn't have... Huh?

924
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,090
Oh, my sweet Lord.

925
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,850
Next!

926
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:37,170
The Hive Council
sent you?

927
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,220
No, Father.

928
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,610
I volunteered.

929
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:42,130
He's your dad?

930
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,740
Facade was your mother?

931
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,930
You would have expected
nothing less of your only son.

932
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:56,320
You should be fighting
by my side for our people!

933
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,320
Our people?
Our heritage?

934
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:01,240
Everything my mother
believed in

935
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,940
before the power
drove her mad?

936
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:06,720
That is why I must stand
against you, Father.

937
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:17,040
Mosaic!

938
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,780
Aah!
Aah!

939
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:28,960
No-o!

940
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,370
Nate, are you okay?

941
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:45,110
You don't know
what I saw, Candice.

942
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,110
For the past
several years,

943
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,330
I've been cataloguing
anomalies.

944
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,460
Evidence of a hidden race
that walks among us.

945
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,770
Disguised as humans.
They can take our shape.

946
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,990
Until tonight, I hadn't
seen any with my own eyes.

947
01:07:58,030 --> 01:07:59,340
But now that I have,

948
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,430
now that I know
the threat is real,

949
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,520
I swear, I won't rest

950
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,650
until every last one
is destroyed.

951
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,220
Every last one, Dad?

952
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,480
Even me?

953
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,420
I don't know
why you chose me.

954
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,720
Heck, I don't even know
if it was you

955
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:35,980
or the Hive Council,

956
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:38,940
or if it was just some
kind of cosmic accident.

957
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,860
But I can tell you this...

958
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,900
I'm not going to let
anyone down.

959
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,560
I'm going to
track down the rest

960
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,170
of the chameleal
artifacts out there,

961
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,830
and well, somehow, I know
you're going to help.

962
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,740
I'm gonna use the power
to be different.

963
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,920
To make a difference.

964
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,310
Come in!

965
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:01,270
I brought you a double
caramel mocha frap.

966
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,400
Thanks.
That's so sweet.

967
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,840
I, uh...

968
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,320
hear it's good for
mending a broken heart.

969
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,060
You can tell?Yeah.

970
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,150
I know that look.

971
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,370
Stephan, you just don't
know what it feels like

972
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,590
to lose someone
you love,

973
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,250
someone who never
knew how you felt.

974
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:22,160
Oh, I think
I can imagine.

975
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,160
Mags.

976
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,510
Why didn't you tell me?

977
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,860
Tell you what?

978
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:34,570
Oh, that. Did you
expect anything less?

979
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:38,350
Maggie, a lot has happened
in the last few days.

980
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,310
Things that I'm not
at liberty to talk about.

981
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,530
But it's why,
more than ever,

982
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,010
I want to make sure
you keep your grades up.

983
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,360
Study hard, so that
you have the security

984
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,150
of a career
to fall back on.

985
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,540
She's got a career.

986
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,280
Here, Maggie.
Here's those playbooks

987
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,890
you asked me
to pick up.

988
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,550
Hamlet?

989
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:01,900
You tryin' out for
the part of Hamlet?

990
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,640
"If not I, who?"

991
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,380
Isn't it traditionally
a part played by a man?

992
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,080
That's why they call it
acting, Daddy.

993
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,170
Come on, Dad.
A promise is a promise.

994
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,740
You have to
read lines with me.

995
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,740
Well, if you're
playin' Hamlet,

996
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,390
which part
do I read?

997
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,440
I'm not readin' Ophelia.

998
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,140
You can play Laertes.

999
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,310
Or the clown.

1000
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,400
I think
I'll take Laertes.

1001
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,010
Alas, poor Yorick.

1002
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,530
I knew him, Horatio:

1003
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,060
A fellow of infinite jest,

1004
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,930
Of most excellent fancy:

1005
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,500
He has borne me on his back
a thousand times...

1006
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,240
What is he, whose grief
bears such an emphasis,

1007
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,330
whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars,

1008
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,290
and makes them stand,
like wonder-wounded hearers?

1009
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,380
This is I, Hamlet the Dane!

1010
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,690
The devil take thy soul.

1011
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,340
Thou prayest not well,
I prithee,

1012
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,780
take thy fingers
from my throat.

1013
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,650
Mosaic and Manikin are gone,

1014
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,440
and perhaps all the chameleals.

1015
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,010
But they have left a part of them in me,

1016
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,090
for better or for worse.

1017
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,920
It's up to me to find a way to use this gift

1018
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,450
for the good of mankind.

1019
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,710
As a tribute to him,

1020
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,100
I must become the new Mosaic.
