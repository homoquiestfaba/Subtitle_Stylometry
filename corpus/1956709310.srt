The house is hers?

Not much luck up there

Seems more folks coming back

206
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,609
pockets empty
than full of gold.

207
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:12,918

Buck, just do
what Spitz does. Okay?

Buck, we're all
tied up together now.

Crying for a dog.

No, no.
I wasn't crying.

391

In all his years
hauling the mail...

Perrault has never
been on time.

Not once.

399
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,264
But he drives every day
like it might happen.

400
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,398
He believes.

401
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,802
But I never saw him
believe in anything

402
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,571

he believes in you.

POSTMASTER:

Elizabeth Snow?

something for O'Malley?

561
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,117
WORKER: I got three!

00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:43,157
WORKER 2: Laverne!

563
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,590
Doyle? Kennedy?

564
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,159
POSTMASTER: I've got
one for Smith. Here.

WORKER 2: Lynch.

566
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:54,192
See, Buck?

567
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,580
We don't carry mail.

568
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,016
We carry lives.

569
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:01,608
We carry hope.

570
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,667
We carry love.

571
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:08,825
We leave in the morning.
Let's get some rest.

572
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:13,018
POSTMASTER: O'Neil? Walsh?

573
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:16,914

- POSTMASTER: Gallagher?

574
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,723
Look.

575
00:39:35,882 --> 00:39:38,173
MALE NARRATOR: <i>Dearest Sarah.</i>

576
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:42,175
<i>The soul seems to have
gone out of me now.</i>

577
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,335
<i>Each day</i>

578
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:48,236
<i>starts with the memory
of our dearest son.</i>

579
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,199
<i>Tim's approaching birthday</i>

580
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:55,668
<i>reminds me
of all that's been lost.</i>

581
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,450
<i>The warmth of our home...</i>

582
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:02,482
(laughter)

583
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,217
<i>...the adventures
our son dreamed of.</i>

584
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:12,263
<i>I wish I'd found the words
to express how I felt</i>

585
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,667
<i>before the silence became</i>

586
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:18,175
<i>unbearable.</i>

587
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,442
<i>And I left.</i>

588
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:30,917
<i>I search for a place...</i>

589
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,151
<i>I might feel some</i>

590
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,850
<i>peace.</i>

591
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,917
<i>Though I fear
I will never find it.</i>

592
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:48,217
(wind howling)

593
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:55,282
<i>Because I know
that as I am,</i>

594
00:40:55,284 --> 00:41:01,117
<i>there may be no home
for me in this world.</i>

595

00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,351
(dogs continue howling)

598
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:17,126
(sighs)

599
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:26,892
- (people cheering in distance)
- (bell tolling)

600
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:33,290
(cheering continues)

601
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:34,792
(dogs barking)

602
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,673
- Don't leave. Don't leave!
- PERRAULT: Mush!

603
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:40,809
(barking)

604
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,509
(all cheering)

605
00:41:46,308 --> 00:41:48,509
(panting)

606
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,640
PERRAULT: No, no, no!

607
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,074
Whoa! (grunts)

608
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,499
(crowd exclaims)

609
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,234
Buck! What?

610
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:59,417
You got time for one
more before you leave?

611
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,248
You're late.

612
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,148
It's just that
it's my son's birthday.

613
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,116
And I need to send
this remembrance to my wife.

614
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,851
You should have come
when we were taking.

615
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,526
Took time
to find the words.

616
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:21,940
Oh.

617
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,309
You learn to read,
we won't need Perrault anymore.

618
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,707
You are lucky.

619
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:29,773
Buck is the boss.

620
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,409
- (crowd laughs)
- Anyone else?

621
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:37,042
Hey, Buck.
I remember you.

622
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,906
Thank you.

623
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,908
- Thank you for stopping.
- PERRAULT: Now we go!

624
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:44,540
Ready, Buck?

625
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,107
- (barks)
- And, mush!

626
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,775
- (crowd cheering)
- (dogs barking)

627
00:42:52,242 --> 00:42:53,342
PERRAULT: Line up!

628
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:55,376
Yep!

629
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:57,683
Nice, Buck!

630
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,317
Yeah, that's it!

631
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,113
Straight ahead!

632
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:10,151
- Yep!
- (crowd cheering)

633
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:26,017
2,400 miles in 80 days?

634
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:27,656
(laughs)

635
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:29,892
Buck is gonna
sleep till fall.

636
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:34,725
Perrault! One for you.
Looks official.

637
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:42,491
What's the news
from down south?

638
00:43:42,493 --> 00:43:43,792
Good work.

639
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,934
Perrault?

640
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,867
(dogs barking)

641
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,974
It's okay. It's okay.

642
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:12,874
It's okay.

643
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:15,373
You did nothing wrong.

644
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,942
- You all done good.
- (barking continues)

645
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:20,025
Okay?

646
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,292
I'm sorry, Buck.

647
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:27,259
They don't need me
and my sled anymore.

648
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,792
By summer,
the telegraph will reach here.

649
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:34,225
A new way
to send the mail.

650
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,158
It's your team now.

651
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:42,692
You still have
a mighty journey ahead.

652
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:48,682
(bids goodbye to dogs
in French)

653
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,046
(bids goodbye to Buck
in French)

654
00:44:54,371 --> 00:44:55,837
(whimpers)

655
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:24,817
MALE NARRATOR: <i>The ground
had shifted under him again.</i>

656
00:45:25,717 --> 00:45:28,284
<i>Buck had lost another master.</i>

657
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:33,917
<i>Now he would have to be
the leader himself.</i>

658
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:38,850
<i>Until a new master
came along.</i>

659
00:45:39,518 --> 00:45:41,251
(dogs barking)

660
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:45,059
(growls, barking)

661
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:47,558
(growls)

662
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,199
HAL: I promised you, didn't I?
And here we are.

663
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,732
MERCEDES:
You promised me gold.

664
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,698
Where is it?
In the dogs?

665
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,867
(laughing)

666
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:19,007
HAL: Get the sled loaded.

667
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,442
It's time to
stake our claim.

668
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:23,842
Let's go.

669
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:25,486
And...

670
00:46:27,176 --> 00:46:28,373
Mush!

671
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,542
(dogs barking)

672
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:33,550
HAL: Mush!

673
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:35,784
(crowd laughing)

674
00:46:36,183 --> 00:46:37,315
Are they broken?

675
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:39,749
HAL: No. They're just lazy.

676
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:40,882
Buck?

677
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,350
HAL: Mush!

678
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:45,815
Charles,
persuade the beast.

679
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:47,250
MERCEDES: Not the club.

680
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:49,724
Charles!

681
00:46:49,726 --> 00:46:51,090
Put that down or I'll...

682
00:46:51,092 --> 00:46:52,991
I won't go a step!

683
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:54,692
- Charles!
- (Buck whimpers)

684
00:46:58,926 --> 00:47:01,025
Remember me? (chuckles)

685
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,092
Yeah, I know.

686
00:47:11,634 --> 00:47:13,365
Your runners are frozen.

687
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,165
You'll help your dogs
a mighty lot

688
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,866
if you take the gee pole
and break 'em out.

689
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,467
HAL: Gee pole?

690
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:24,900
MERCEDES: What is he doing?

691
00:47:28,534 --> 00:47:30,265
- Sir! Watch the Victrola.
- (Mercedes gasps)

692
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:31,998
(crowd laughs)

693
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,599
Where are you
headed, mister?

694
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,332
It's none of your concern.

695
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:38,965
You didn't buy that map
in Skagway, did you?

696
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,933
- No.
- That old fairy tale.

697
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:42,616
Lost cabin.

698
00:47:42,618 --> 00:47:44,015
- (sled rattles)
- (Mercedes gasps)

699
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:45,748
River of gold?

700
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,648
You're setting off
too far into the spring.

701
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,215
Half that trail
is on the river.

702
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:51,415
Well, that leaves
half the trail fit for travel.

703
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:53,443
Oh, it means the ice
is gonna break up

704
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:56,124
with your companions
and the dogs on it.

705
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,457
Why don't you lay over
till the spring thaw?

706
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,441
Save your dogs

707
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,190
and your companions
the suffering.

708
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,190
And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?

709
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:04,186
I'm not a prospector.

710
00:48:04,188 --> 00:48:05,789
No, thank you.

711
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,874
I paid a fortune
for this team.

712
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,473
They'll pull my sled.

713
00:48:09,475 --> 00:48:12,776
They're good dogs, sir.
They'll pull your sled.

714
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:16,342
They'll pull your sled
till they die.

715
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,866
(slams on sled)

716
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,067
Thank you.

717
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,775
Let's go.

718
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:31,073
CHARLES: (taps on sled)
All right, let's go.

719
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,376
And...

720
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:33,873
Mush!

721
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:35,376
(dogs barking)

722
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:42,042
(crowd muttering)

723
00:48:51,592 --> 00:48:53,457
CHARLES: You lazy mutts!

724
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:55,349
MERCEDES: I'm not so sure
about those dogs.

725
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,079
Maybe you should've bought
a different team.

726
00:48:57,081 --> 00:48:58,540
CHARLES: Maybe
we should feed them.

727
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:00,810
We should've stayed
on the trail.

728
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,879
Mush!

729
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,504
(grunting)

730
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:05,690
(all gasping)

731
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,590
MERCEDES: Make it stop!

732
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:09,025
- (Hal grunting)
- (Mercedes screaming)

733
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:12,499
(groans)

734
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:14,900
(Hal yelling frustratedly)

735
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,499
(panting)

736
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:20,167
CHARLES: Maybe they need
a little encouragement.

737
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:23,298

MALE NARRATOR:
<i>For the first time,</i>

741
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:31,957
<i>Buck knew
more than his masters.</i>

743
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:34,558
- HAL: Mush!
- (whip cracks)

744
00:49:35,226 --> 00:49:37,424
MALE NARRATOR: <i>But the whip</i>

745
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:39,692
<i>offered him no choice.</i>

746
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:46,658
(branches rustling)

747
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,477
(icicles smashing)

748
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:09,969
(grunting)

749
00:50:13,168 --> 00:50:14,701
Son of a...

750
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,480
(dogs whimpering)

751
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:22,806
HAL: Well, now,

752
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:24,476
we're going across.

753
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:26,574
Move!

754
00:50:26,576 --> 00:50:28,073
(Hal grunting)

755
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:29,295
- (Buck whining)
- (both barking)

756
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:32,393
I say you go.

757
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,059
Hal, he can't.

758
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:35,859
Move.

759
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:37,241
(Hal grunts)

760
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,809
(dogs barking)

761
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:40,776
Don't you dare.

762
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:42,930
- Hey!
- (Mercedes gasps)

763
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:44,647
(dog barks)

764
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:49,141
That river ice is gonna
break up any minute!

765
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:50,473
You fool!

766
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:52,707
That dog is trying
to help you keep your life!

767
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:53,942
MERCEDES: Hal!

768
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:55,732
(Mercedes gasps)

769
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,132
Why are you so keen
to stop us?

770
00:50:58,134 --> 00:51:00,534
You know where
the gold is, don't you?

771
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:05,715
(gunshot)

772
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:09,017
You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs.

773
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:10,681
Hal.

774
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:12,516
(snarling)

775
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:13,950
(dogs barking)

776
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:35,507
Hal, he said
we shouldn't cross.

777
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,374
CHARLES: Hal, are you sure?
Maybe we just leave the dogs?

778
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:40,407
HAL: I know
what I'm doing.

779
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:41,808
Mush!

780
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,384
(grunts)

781
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:52,774

(Dub whimpers)

784
00:52:00,308 --> 00:52:02,207
Don't do this.

785
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:03,408
Not to them.

786
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,462
HAL: Mush!

787
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,423
(birds chirping)

788
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:02,551
(snoring)

789
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,434
What am I gonna
do with you?

790
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:33,634
(pants)

791
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:35,479
(whimpers)

792
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:00,486
(whimpering)

793
00:54:07,117 --> 00:54:08,817
They're not here.

794
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,581
They're gone.

795
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:19,625
You've been sleeping
for two days

796
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:21,563
in my bed.

797
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:33,726
I'll be back.

798
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:37,792
(bottle clinks)

799
00:54:38,926 --> 00:54:40,125
(blows)

800
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:47,192
Stay. Go.

801
00:54:50,673 --> 00:54:52,439
Do what you want.

802
00:54:57,438 --> 00:54:58,904
(whines)

803
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:03,427
(howling)

804
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,767
- (music playing)
- (laughter and chatter)

805
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:22,002
Whiskey.

806
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:24,767
(muffled music playing)

807
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,751
- (music continues)
- (crowd chattering)

808
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:50,151
I want the bottle.

809
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,984
(door opens)

810
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,226
- (grunting)
- (people exclaiming)

811
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,567
They're all gone!

812
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,934
My dogs ran off.

813
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,434
My fortune lost.

814
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:05,767
You called it a fairy tale.

815
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:07,698
(grunts)

816
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,032
You didn't want me
finding the gold.

817
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,498
(Buck growls)

818
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,734
- (Hal grunting)
- (barking)

819
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:21,759
Easy, Buck, easy.

820
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,757
Buck.

821
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,599
- Easy.
- HAL: Well, you all saw.

822
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:28,532
This man and I
had business

823
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:30,232
and the dog went
for my throat.

824
00:56:30,234 --> 00:56:31,501
- Probably rabid.
- (growls, barks)

825
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:34,232
(crowd gasps)

826
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:35,898
You leave
that dog alone!

827
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,465
- Buck, settle!
- (barking)

828
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:39,574
You see?

829
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:41,474
I say it gets put down
here and now.

830
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:43,607
- MAN: No. Come on, mister.
- You don't touch him!

831
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,942
MAN 2: No one puts
any creature down.

832
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,715
Until we hear
all the facts.

833
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:51,149
The man sucker punched me.

834
00:56:51,151 --> 00:56:52,048
(people exclaiming)

835
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,017
- (barking)
- (Hal whimpers)

836
00:56:54,336 --> 00:56:55,869
Buck, easy.

837
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,034
What might you have
on that belt, friend?

838
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:05,101
(growls)

839
00:57:09,183 --> 00:57:10,684
(people gasping
and exclaiming)

840
00:57:12,425 --> 00:57:13,323
(Hal grunting)

841
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:16,590
MAN 3: No guns
on the premises!

842
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:17,657
(grunts)

843
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:19,325
(indistinct chatter)

844
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:27,342
You okay,
John Thornton?

845
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:29,717
Yeah.

846
00:57:30,451 --> 00:57:32,117
I'm fine.

847
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,409
(sniffing)

848
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:51,509
JOHN: What?

849
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:54,709
What are you
looking at, huh?

850
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,025
You got something to say?

851
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:12,804
(sets glass down)

852
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:19,017
(grumbling)

853
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:23,317
Buck!

854
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:27,224
That's not very nice.

855
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:28,558
What did you do that for?

856
00:58:28,783 --> 00:58:30,281
Hey, Buck!

857
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:31,825
Buck, what...?

858
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:33,590
Buck?

859
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:35,126
Bring that back.

860
00:58:37,654 --> 00:58:40,088
Now what are you
gonna do, huh?

861
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:50,991
Buck? What are you doing?

862
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,590
Bring that back.

863
00:58:52,592 --> 00:58:54,423
Buck, don't do this.

864
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:55,726
That's mine.

865
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,898
I need that.

866
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,565
Don't do this to me.

867
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,332
What'd you do?
Where is it?

868
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,432
Just, would you...

869
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:05,432
(grunting) Get off.

870
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:07,033
Get off.

871
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:10,184
Buck.

872
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:20,767
Darn, you're big.

873
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:25,715
(sighs)

874
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:31,634
This was his birthday.

875
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:42,025
My son.

876
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,125
After he died,
his mom and I...

877
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:53,040
...we just grew apart.

878
00:59:53,042 --> 00:59:55,808
She didn't wanna
be around me...

879
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:00,442
I didn't wanna
be around anybody.

880
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,625
So, I came up here.

881
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,199
Then I met you.

882
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:15,634
(owl hooting)

883
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:24,891
Hell.

884
01:00:24,893 --> 01:00:26,759
- It's around here somewhere.
- (object thuds)

885
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,726
Good, you're awake.

886
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:33,325
- I put it...
- (yawning)

887
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,425
Here it is.

888
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:39,242
Something I want
to show ya.

889
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,009
Come here.

890
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:46,173
This is a map
of the Yukon.

891
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:51,476
My son was always reading
adventure stories,

892
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:54,016
and he was crazy
about the news

893
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,648
coming out of the Yukon.

894
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,315
It wasn't the gold.
He didn't care about that.

895
01:00:57,317 --> 01:00:58,781
It was the mountains.

896
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:00,715
He spent all day
looking at maps

897
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:02,249
and at pictures
of the mountains.

898
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:05,681
Dreaming about
what was on the other side.

899
01:01:05,683 --> 01:01:07,817
Places no one had been.

900
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:10,384
Wild places.

901
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,482
"Let's go," I said.

902
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:16,415
He said, "Yeah, Pop."

903
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:17,882
We'd start there,

904
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:21,082
but then
he grabbed a pencil

905
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:24,715
and he drew a line
off the map

906
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:27,582
and he said,
"But let's go there.

907
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:30,817
"Off the map.
Where no one's been."

908
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:36,556
It's... It's a trip
he would've loved.

909
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:38,558
A real adventure.

910
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:44,859
We could go.

911
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:48,558
You and me.

912
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:52,292
See what's out there.

913
01:01:53,851 --> 01:01:55,315
What do you think?

914
01:01:55,317 --> 01:01:58,784
It's a canoe, Buck.
We're gonna ride in it.

915
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,183
(exclaiming)

916
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:07,782
Settle. Sit. Sit.
Sit, Buck.

917
01:02:07,784 --> 01:02:10,250
(chuckles)
Good. Good boy.

918
01:02:34,692 --> 01:02:37,725
Ha. What are you doing?

919
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:40,750
Begging?

920
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:48,242
You're not my pet.

921
01:02:51,276 --> 01:02:52,875
(thunder rumbling)

922
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,315
Are you comin'?

923
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,516
(Buck whimpers)

924
01:03:01,518 --> 01:03:03,151
Get in here.

925
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:07,017
(birds squawking)

926
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:12,317
(barking)

927
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:17,717
JOHN: <i>♪ Row your boat ♪</i>

928
01:03:18,484 --> 01:03:21,649
<i>♪ Gently down the stream ♪</i>

929
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:24,082
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily ♪</i>

930
01:03:24,084 --> 01:03:25,215
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

931
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:28,617
Come on, Buck.
Give us a song.

932
01:03:29,484 --> 01:03:30,717
(baying)

933
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,782
Maybe not.

934
01:03:32,784 --> 01:03:34,784
(playing harmonica)

935
01:03:37,183 --> 01:03:38,484
(plays random note)

936
01:03:42,817 --> 01:03:44,450
(resumes playing)

937
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:47,851
(moose grunting)

938
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,508
(water rumbling)

939
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:03,999
(screaming)

940
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:05,465
(Buck grunts)

941
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,999
JOHN: Whoa!

942
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:08,567
(Buck barking)

943
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,232
Whoa! (grunts)

944
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:18,600
(barking)

945
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:23,015
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
(panting)

946
01:04:23,017 --> 01:04:24,151
(barking)

947
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,017
(John screams)

948
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:40,476
Oh, you like that, huh?

949
01:04:53,784 --> 01:04:55,784
I guess
we walk from here.

950
01:04:58,651 --> 01:04:59,917
(bird screeching)

951
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:10,832
(breathing heavily)

952
01:05:13,617 --> 01:05:14,884
(objects clattering)

953
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:53,242
JOHN: Your ancestors
used to roam here.

954
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,175
And mine.

955
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:58,040
Back when we were wild.

956
01:05:58,042 --> 01:06:00,142
(bird squawking in distance)

957
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:08,309
We come and go,
don't we?

958
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,634
This is always here.

959
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,532
(barking)

960
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:26,632
What?

961
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,699
I don't know. Which way?
You tell me.

962
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:30,601
Go on. You lead.

963
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:35,367
- (barking)
- (John chuckling)

964
01:06:38,634 --> 01:06:40,401
(sniffing)

965
01:06:42,734 --> 01:06:44,267
- (Buck barking)
- Buck?

966
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:47,401
(Buck barks)

967
01:06:57,634 --> 01:07:01,100
Ah. Look what you found.

968
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:04,200
(Buck barking)

969
01:07:05,308 --> 01:07:06,509
(John chuckles)

970
01:07:10,642 --> 01:07:11,876
(door bangs)

971
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:16,859
Boy...

972
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:22,290
- Look at this, Buck.
- (barks)

973
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:25,292
I don't think
we're off all maps.

974
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,259
(barking)

975
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:37,226
A prospector, I guess.

976
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:39,101
Trash.

977
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:41,965
- Trash.
- (grunting)

978
01:07:41,967 --> 01:07:43,400
Trash.

979
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:47,167
(John exclaims)

980
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:54,376
Treasure.

981
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:57,775
(Buck grunts)

982
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:05,940
This is mine. All right?

983
01:08:05,942 --> 01:08:07,542
Just leave it alone.
It's mine.

984
01:08:08,743 --> 01:08:09,942
(grumbles)

985
01:08:12,576 --> 01:08:14,109
(John grunting)

986
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:18,808
(barking)

987
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:28,042
(crickets chirping)

988
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:32,242
Good day.

989
01:08:37,276 --> 01:08:39,309
(howling in distance)

990
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:54,675
It's your ancestors.

991
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:58,009
Wolves.

992
01:08:59,275 --> 01:09:01,475
(wolves continue howling)

993
01:09:09,308 --> 01:09:10,909
(water splashing)

994
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:15,742
(barks)

995
01:09:16,176 --> 01:09:17,709
(panting)

996
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:20,290
(chuckling)

997
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:21,625
(barks)

998
01:09:51,059 --> 01:09:52,658
(panting)

999
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,000
(chuckles)
That's good, Buck,

1000
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:06,167
but more like this, huh?

1001
01:10:14,534 --> 01:10:16,501
Damn fairy tale's true.

1002
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:26,776
That's more like it, Buck.

1003
01:10:28,176 --> 01:10:29,742
Attaboy!

1004
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,776
(chuckling)

1005
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:39,308
(sniffing)

1006
01:10:41,509 --> 01:10:44,375
What?
What you looking at?

1007
01:10:49,243 --> 01:10:50,609
Go take a look.

1008
01:10:51,842 --> 01:10:52,909
Go on.

1009
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,184
Go on. (chuckles)

1010
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,817
Just be back before dark!

1011
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:17,401
(bear grunts)

1012
01:11:23,334 --> 01:11:25,134
(bear growling)

1013
01:12:02,243 --> 01:12:03,909
(sniffing)

1014
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,832
(snarling)

1015
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:22,467
(Buck whimpers)

1016
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,467
(wolf howling)

1017
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:41,682
(harmonica playing)

1018
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:57,484
(resumes playing harmonica)

1019
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:11,986
Buck!

1020
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:17,275
(sniffing)

1021
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:21,809
(snarls)

1022
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:25,776
(grunting)

1023
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,042
(whimpering)

1024
01:13:35,709 --> 01:13:36,709
(barks)

1025
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:40,042
(wolves barking)

1026
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:42,375
(barking)

1027
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:57,709
(whimpers)

1028
01:14:02,226 --> 01:14:03,625
(Buck barks)

1029
01:14:04,393 --> 01:14:05,592
(barks)

1030
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,658
(grunts)

1031
01:14:15,925 --> 01:14:17,523
(wolf whimpers)

1032
01:14:17,525 --> 01:14:18,892
(log creaking)

1033
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:33,398
(whines)

1034
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:36,150

(grunts)

1036
01:14:45,576 --> 01:14:47,242
(pants)

1037
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:53,342
(panting tiredly)

1038
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:07,067
JOHN: <i>Here,
so far from home...</i>

1039
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:11,001
<i>I can see a change
in Buck.</i>

1040
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:17,767
<i>Something's pulling him
into the forest.</i>

1041
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,737
<i>Into the hunt.</i>

1042
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,448
(birds chirping)

1043
01:15:32,701 --> 01:15:34,567
That's beautiful, Buck.

1044
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:36,933
Beautiful.

1045
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:41,641
<i>He's still the same dog
with me,</i>

1046
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:44,009
<i>but I find it hard
to imagine him</i>

1047
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:47,509
<i>back in civilization.</i>

1048
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:52,324
<i>Is there any house
big enough to hold him?</i>

1049
01:15:52,326 --> 01:15:53,625
(barks)

1050
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:00,384
(laughing)

1051
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:11,517
<i>This journey seems to be
leading Buck to his destiny.</i>

1052
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:23,100
<i>Where is it leading me?</i>

1053
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:48,532
(bear growls)

1054
01:16:51,626 --> 01:16:53,359
(growling)

1055
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:22,641
(sniffing)

1056
01:17:25,284 --> 01:17:26,683
Not this time.

1057
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,817
Long after dark.

1058
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:36,884
You've been staying out
later and later every day.

1059
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:41,665
Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore

1060
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,134
but world's
a dangerous place.

1061
01:17:44,817 --> 01:17:46,751
You never know
what's coming.

1062
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:51,492
(sighs) You never know.

1063
01:17:57,025 --> 01:18:01,125
Fever took Timmy
in two days.

1064
01:18:03,142 --> 01:18:04,342
(grunts softly)

1065
01:18:07,276 --> 01:18:08,476
(chuckles softly)

1066
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:11,908
Hell.

1067
01:18:14,676 --> 01:18:16,542
Okay, Buck.

1068
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,276
(chuckles softly)

1069
01:18:23,858 --> 01:18:25,125
(John sighing)

1070
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:29,667
(Buck grunts)

1071
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,776
It's been
a beautiful summer.

1072
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,717
You know what, Buck?

1073
01:18:46,217 --> 01:18:47,817
I've been thinking.

1074
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,832
I might buy myself
a railroad.

1075
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:52,998
Is that my hat?

1076
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,632
That's my hat.
Come on.

1077
01:18:54,634 --> 01:18:56,031
(chuckling)
Give me my hat.

1078
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:57,799
Give me my hat.

1079
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,267
(playfully) Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.

1080
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:02,434
Buck!

1081
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:03,868
Buck!

1082
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:05,098
Come on.

1083
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,534
(chuckling)
There you go.

1084
01:19:12,059 --> 01:19:13,092
Ooh.

1085
01:19:14,558 --> 01:19:16,126
Timber wolf.

1086
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:18,859
Beautiful.

1087
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:22,292
This is their domain.

1088
01:19:22,776 --> 01:19:24,642
They own these hills.

1089
01:19:31,759 --> 01:19:32,759
You wanna go?

1090
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:34,891
Go.

1091
01:19:34,893 --> 01:19:36,259
Just...

1092
01:19:38,526 --> 01:19:40,225
...be careful.

1093
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,025
(distant barking)

1094
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:33,067
<i>He had been
both spoiled</i>

1095
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:36,098
<i>and he'd suffered</i>

1096
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,100
<i>at the hand of man.</i>

1097
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:42,142
<i>Now, Buck found himself</i>

1098
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:45,184
<i>with his own kind.</i>

1099
01:20:46,618 --> 01:20:50,717
<i>How far he has traveled
to find his home.</i>

1100
01:20:53,184 --> 01:20:56,817
<i>How far I have traveled
from mine.</i>

1101
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:14,641
(John chuckling)

1102
01:21:15,567 --> 01:21:16,967
Here, look, Buck.

1103
01:21:17,334 --> 01:21:18,534
Groceries.

1104
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:22,033
For life.

1105
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:25,200
No man needs
more than that.

1106
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,084
It's time for me
to go, Buck.

1107
01:21:31,317 --> 01:21:32,783
Go home.

1108
01:21:33,317 --> 01:21:35,681
Whatever's left of it.

1109
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:36,950
Pick up the pieces,

1110
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:39,825
or at least try.

1111
01:21:40,259 --> 01:21:41,324
(barks)

1112
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:42,792
(whining)

1113
01:21:46,259 --> 01:21:47,259
No.

1114
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,725
I'm not asking you
to come with me, Buck.

1115
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:57,667
You got something here.

1116
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,475
Something important.

1117
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:03,609
Hang onto it.

1118
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:08,842
I'm leaving
in the morning.

1119
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:11,976
Come say bye.

1120
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:20,842
You're a good dog, Buck.

1121
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:34,675
You're a good dog.

1122
01:22:51,076 --> 01:22:53,308
(birds squawking)

1123
01:23:16,115 --> 01:23:17,715
(crickets chirping)

1124
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:31,215
(soft rustling)

1125
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:50,132
(gunshot)

1126
01:23:52,209 --> 01:23:54,342
(gunshot echoes in distance)

1127
01:24:00,126 --> 01:24:01,793
(objects clattering)

1128
01:24:03,283 --> 01:24:05,049
(panting)

1129
01:24:17,717 --> 01:24:19,050
(both grunting)

1130
01:24:29,243 --> 01:24:31,042
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

1131
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,332
(gasping)

1132
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,198
You came
all the way out here.

1133
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,232
You knew something,
didn't you?

1134
01:24:37,234 --> 01:24:38,098
Easy.

1135
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,100
You wanted it
all for yourself.

1136
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,898
Where is it?

1137
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,634
Where's the gold?

1138
01:24:54,284 --> 01:24:55,717
It's everywhere.

1139
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:01,616
Take it.

1140
01:25:01,618 --> 01:25:03,415
Take it all.

1141
01:25:03,417 --> 01:25:05,251
It won't change anything.

1142
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:08,658
It won't
bring back the dead.

1143
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:13,126
(barking)

1144
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,475
- (growling)
- (grunting)

1145
01:25:18,675 --> 01:25:20,375
(growling)

1146
01:25:24,742 --> 01:25:26,375
(panting)

1147
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:28,475
HAL: Ah.

1148
01:25:29,393 --> 01:25:30,823
You know this, do you?

1149
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,424
- Good.
- (whimpers)

1150
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:33,658
You see it, boy?

1151
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:36,057
You see it?

1152
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:37,658
- (whines)
- Good.

1153
01:25:39,349 --> 01:25:40,715
(Buck growling)

1154
01:25:44,268 --> 01:25:45,901
(Hal grunting)

1155
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:05,934
(John breathing laboriously)

1156
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:09,634
(Buck whines)

1157
01:26:12,817 --> 01:26:13,884
Buck.

1158
01:26:15,328 --> 01:26:16,527
Yeah.

1159
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,423
You came back.

1160
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:24,592
(John sighs)

1161
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:30,204
(breathing laboriously)

1162
01:26:38,972 --> 01:26:41,104
(Buck whining)

1163
01:27:38,594 --> 01:27:40,160
Wow, Buck.

1164
01:27:41,682 --> 01:27:43,082
(sucks teeth)

1165
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,200
What an adventure, huh?

1166
01:27:50,734 --> 01:27:52,167
(whines)

1167
01:28:00,933 --> 01:28:03,100
It's okay, boy.

1168
01:28:14,933 --> 01:28:16,567
(John breathing deeply)

1169
01:28:21,351 --> 01:28:23,117
You're home.

1170
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:55,884
(birds chirping)

1171
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,967
JOHN: <i>There is a place
in these mountains</i>

1172
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:13,101
<i>where a new breed
of timber wolf roams...</i>

1173
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:17,907
<i>wiser than man or wolf...</i>

1174
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:19,373
(puppies barking)

1175
01:30:19,375 --> 01:30:22,040
<i>...because of the dog</i>

1176
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,009
<i>that runs at the head
of the pack.</i>

1177
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:29,515
<i>Now they live
without fear,</i>

1178
01:30:29,517 --> 01:30:33,450
<i>raise their young,
and flourish.</i>

1179
01:30:36,325 --> 01:30:37,790
(growls)

1180
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:38,993
(roaring)

1181
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:46,459
(roars)

1182
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:51,325
(barks)

1183
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,492
(puppies barking)

1184
01:31:00,651 --> 01:31:04,684
<i>Some say
it's just a legend.</i>

1185
01:31:05,817 --> 01:31:07,415
<i>Not so.</i>

1186
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:11,250
<i>You see,
I knew him once</i>

1187
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:16,317
<i>when he was just a dog
at a man's side.</i>

1188
01:31:20,283 --> 01:31:23,283
<i>And even though
this land is his,</i>

1189
01:31:23,817 --> 01:31:25,582
<i>every summer</i>

1190
01:31:25,584 --> 01:31:28,632
<i>when he comes down
to the valley,</i>

1191
01:31:28,634 --> 01:31:31,998
<i>he remembers kind hands</i>

1192
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,967
<i>and old masters.</i>

1193
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:40,567
<i>Before he went
to his own,</i>

1194
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:44,567
<i>became his own master.</i>

1195
01:31:47,033 --> 01:31:48,933
<i>Before he heard</i>

1196
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:51,534
<i>the call.</i>

1197
01:31:53,734 --> 01:31:58,734
