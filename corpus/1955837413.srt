Unfortunately, yes.

368
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,359
And when I was
changing the dressing

369
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,361
last night and then
again this morning,

370
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,530
there was a definite odor.

371
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,031
Gangrene.

372
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,000
So if it is,

373
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,736
I will have
to amputate.

374
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,839
I will operate
on this side

375
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,042
with a nurse,
you, on my left.

376
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,751
You do not approve
of an amputation?

377
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:47,159

to lose a leg.

378
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,327
Ecco.

379
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,930
You see? I was right.

380
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,965
And how do you propose

381
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,835
that we shall not
have to amputate

382
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,237
this young boy's leg?

383
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,275
Well, in America,
we've had some success

384
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,278
with a treatment
that was developed
at Johns Hopkins hospital,

385
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,280
so I've been
irrigating the wound--

386
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,683
I know everything
about this notion
of irrigating.

387
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,420
Who is
this John Hopkins
of the hospital?

388
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,789
Is he a Saint?

389
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:23,261
It's Johns Hopkins,
and, no, it's not named
after a Saint.

390
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,498
Then it cannot be
much of a hospital,
can it?

391
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,903
Well, I will operate
tomorrow in the morning.

392
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,406
Please have the patient
ready at 8:30.

393
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,508
And, nurse...

394
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:41,313
Perhaps you would like
my permission for your
irrigation treatment.

never ask a lady

And after the war, you're
going to medical school.

I'm really not permitted

speak with the surgeon.

00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,745
Man: no!

545
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,713
Please!

546
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,748
Don't! ohh!

547
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,616
Jesus, what
happened to him?

548
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,652
Hit by a phosphorous shell

549
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:50,755
handing out candy bars
at the piave canteen.

550
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,256
Man: aah! Aah!

551
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,258
Jesus Christ!
Jimmy?

552
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,526
Man: aah! Aah!

553
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,395
We were there
together.

554
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,597
De long: Still!
Keep still, son!

555
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,798
Man: aah!

556
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,999
What is it?
What is it?

557
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,501
De long: We'll
leave the dressing

558
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,303
until we give you
something for the pain.

559
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,371
Burton: what's
happening to him?

560
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,386
Jimmy,
it's Ernie.

561
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,525
Ernie.

562
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,027
You're gonna
be all right.

563
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,562
You understand?

564
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,866
I promise you.

565
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,303
You'll be fine.

566
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,705
[Jimmy whimpers]

567
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,315
Buona sera.

568
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,817
Per lei.

569
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,252
Grazie.

570
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,127
[Footsteps running past]

571
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,874
You really shouldn't
be in here, kid.

572
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,877
Ernie.
my name's Ernie.

573
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,580
Whatever you say...
Kid.

574
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,083
"To Dr. James Paxton,
bellevue hospital."

575
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:34,892
"Dr. James Paxton,
bellevue hospital."

576
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,894
And I don't suppose
it ever occurred to you

577
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,063
that those
might be personal?

578
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,875
Last night, a bunch
of us were talking
about why we came here.

579
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,378
And I said that I came
here because I was
looking for something.

580
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,880
Hmm.

581
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,549
I'm not sure
what it is...

582
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,751
But I know
I'll find it here.

583
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:07,792
Somewhere about
6 miles from here
in the trenches,

584
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,027
that's where it is.

585
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,568
It never occurred
to me until now

586
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,937
that it might
be possible

587
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,873
to come here looking to
get away from something.

588
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,181
Touchá.

589
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,622
It's no use
him writing you,
you know.

590
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,123
Hmm.

591
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,125
'Cause you're
in love with me.

592
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,727
Oh. ha ha ha.

593
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,228
I am, am I?

594
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,730
Mmm.
yeah.

595
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,000
You just don't
know it yet.

596
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,604
Will you get out
of here, kid? Please?

597
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,824
Good morning,
miss Agnes.

598
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,825
Good morning.

599
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,460
Ag.

600
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,229
May I present
you my adjutant,

601
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,997
tenente alberti?

602
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,668
He will be
our chaperon.

603
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,414
[Speaking Italian]

604
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,916
Look at him.

605
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,085
He's good-looking.
He's Italian.

606
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,087
He's a doctor.

607
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,790
It's all over
for us.

608
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,792
It'll never work.

609
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,294
Take another look.
He's ancient.

610
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,296
He's got to be
close to 40.

611
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,764
Maybe more.

612
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,101
No wonder he wanted
to chop off my leg.

613
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,370
He might not
have stopped there.

614
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,780
Caracciolo: Von kurowsky?

615
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,850
My father's very
proud of that "Von."

616
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,186
He's from
konigsberg, Germany.

617
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,189
So you are...
Come si dice?

618
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,523
First generation?

619
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,526
On my father's side.
My mother's American.

620
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,863
And now you are nursing
young Americans in Italy,

621
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,333
where Austrians
and Germans are...

622
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,836
Fighting against us.

623
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,372
The red cross
doesn't take sides.

624
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,209
That's one of
the reasons I joined.

625
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,812
And, uh, the others?

626
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,317
Someone else
asked me that
just yesterday.

627
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,419
I hoped to be
assigned to one of
the surgical teams

628
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,354
operating on the front.

629
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,156
Me, too.

630
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,924
Sorry, Harry.

631
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,296
Thank you.

632
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,403
Thanks, partner.

633

Uh, per favore,

uh, can you get us
some--some alcohol?
Some Brandy?

638
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,993
Some bran-Brandy?
Brandy?

639
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,194
Acqua?

640
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,196
No, no, no,
Brandy, Brandy.

641
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,831
The--you know,
in a bottle?

642
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,166
Ah, latte.

643
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,667
No, no, no, Brandy.

644
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,669
Come on, Brandy.

645
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,004
Ah...

646

Yes, Brandy.

No. mi dispiace
ma non á possibile.

649
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,583
No, Emilia?
Scusi, scusi, scusi.

650
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,852
See, Emilia,

651
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,520
my leg...

652
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,023
It's very sick,
my leg.

653
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,925
Very sick.
You need to help me.

654
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,827
'Cause my mom
isn't here, see?

655
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,995
And--and you need
to be my mama.

656
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,065
Mama. mama, huh?

657
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,366
No.

658
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,736
Very sore.

659
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,672
It's very sore.

660
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,076
Va bene.

661
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,179
Va bene. Va bene.

Emilia.

665
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,064
I think
she likes me.

666
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,499
Ha ha ha ha.

667
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,802
Ah, come on, Harry.
You know what they say
about nurses.

668
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,671
Why--why don't you
just shut up,
you bunch of drunks?

669
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,673
They're always
seeing us naked,

670
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,909
washing
our private
parts for us.

671
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,410
It's bound
to affect them.

672
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,145
Especially
my private part.

673
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,747
You're way out
of line, kenyon.

674
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,283
I--i don't know
if it affects them,

675
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,852
but when i
first got here,

676
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,489
um, one of them,
of course I don't
know which one--

677
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,291
is there anybody
drinking here?

678
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,692
Here.

679
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,327
Anyway,

680
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,464
she was down there,
um, sudsing me up,

681
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,934
and it was pretty
damn embarrassing.

682
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,104
All our nurses seem
like nice girls to me.

683
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,972
Except maybe Rosie.

684
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,474
Larkin: thank god.

685
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,909
[Laughter]

686
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,410
Larkin:
whose bet is it?

687
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,079
Well, gentlemen,
have we all moved
our bowels today?

688
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,481
Mr. Larkin?

689
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,982
8:32, ma'am.

690
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,118
Good. mmm?

691
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,120
8:33, ma'am.

692
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,454
Mm-hmm.

693
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,224
8:34,
ma'am.

694
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,996
Now that we're
all so regular,

695
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,464
do you think we could
have our cocktails tonight

696
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,133
without the usual glob
at the bottom?

697
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:53,203
There will
be no cocktails
this evening, gentlemen.

698
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,939
Period.

699
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,110
It worked.

700
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,947
Playing cards,
gentlemen, or what?

701
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,182
Raise you 2 bits,
gentlemen.

702
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,052
Call.

703
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,388
Jimmy calls.
It's big trouble.

704
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,556
I fold.

705
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,825
Ernie...

706
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,427
Remember what I said...

707
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,829
Back at the canteen?

708
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:24,435
I always play the cards
I'm dealt.

709
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,502
Larkin: what are you
doing, villard?

710
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,570
Thinking.

711
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,473
I don't...

712
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,009
Think I can...

713
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,612
Play this hand.

714
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,682
Sure, you can.

715
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,886
Three 4s.

716
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,357
Three 9s.

717
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,358
Ernie?

718
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,826
Larkin: Ernie?

719
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,929
I folded.

720
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,699
That's, uh,
2 bucks to me, then.

721
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,335
Wait a minute, wait.
McBride called.

722
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,874
Straight, queen high.

723
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,542
Don't trust you, hem.

724
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,911
You trust me,
don't you, Joseph?

725
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,617
Mmm...

726
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,286
Straight,
queen of hearts high.

727
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,993
All right, boys,
why don't we let Jimmy
get some rest?

728
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,438
Mac: yeah,
that's better.

729
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,140
Not so fast.

730
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,109
Good.

731
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,812
Time for lunch, Mac.

732
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,013
I'll take over.

733
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,081
Thanks.

734
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,559
Mac: hey, kid,
take it easy.
It's not a race.

735
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,761
Why does everybody
keep calling me kid?

736
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,096
Why, indeed?

737
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,966
I'll be back
in a half an hour.

738
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,268
All right.

739
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,605
Well, look at you.

740
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,174
How we doing?

741
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,475
Pretty good.

742
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,680
Very impressive.

743
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,949
Let me try with one.

744
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,517
By all means.

745
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,155
Whoa, easy.

746
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,827
You have no Patience.

747
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,231
Slowly.

748
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,438
See?

749
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,309
Who's that fella
in New York,

750
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,878
keeps writing you
all those letters?

751
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,347
It's this way.

752
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,648
Well, he's...

753
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,017
None of your business.

754
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,321
What about caracciolo?

755
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,158
You got to be careful
about him.

756
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,895
You know,
he's old enough
to be your father.

757
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,096
Ahem.

758
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,732
He's also none
of your business.

759
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,234
All right...

760
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,569
But I meant everything
i said the other night.

761
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,438
Let's turn around.

762
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,106
Slowly.

763
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,341
Kid, you say
a lot of things.

764
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,444
I have trouble
keeping track
of all of them.

765
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,312
About you being
in love with me.

766
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,381
Oh.

767
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,250
Only not knowing it.

768
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,351
Right.

769
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,755
Well, what about you?

770
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:35,359
I mean, I would really
hate to be the only one
in love here.

771
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,361
Oh, I love you
all right.

772
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:42,733
Nobody will ever
love anybody as much
as I love you.

773
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,001
Ernest...

774
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,981
Agnes:
just a little bit. Just...

775
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,117
[Patient coughing]

776
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,620
Come on.

777
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,589
Just a little bit.

778
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,659
Just a little bit.
Here you go.

779
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,064
Jimmy, please.

780
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,867
Just a little bit.
You have to eat
something.

781
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,937
If you don't, Jimmy,
you won't make it.

782
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,873
Please.

783
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,041
Burnside: uh,
atta boy, Ernie.

784
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,976
Just, uh--
let me just, uh--

785
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,545
there. now, remember
to say cheese.

786
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,148
There you go.

787
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,717
"I give
this silver medal..."

788
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,321
"For your courage action

789
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,089
"on the piave river

of July..."

791
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,027
"1918.

792
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,231
"When you are much wounded,

00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,232
"you...

794

"And you do not accept
medical attention

until private zardini
is attended to first."

800
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,160
Uh, yes, now,
for this, could we--

801
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,962
uh, Ernie, could you just
come up here a bit,

802
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,064
and, you...Just turn.

803
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,299
Ah, yes, uh, good, good.

804
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,400
We'll--we'll do that
in just a minute.

805
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,369
Let's just
get this first,

806
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,004
and, uh--
yes, in closer.

807
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,940
Good, yes.
Ah, let's get one with
all the young gentlemen.

808
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,775
Now, just over against
this wall. If we--

809
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,610
Ernie, will you just, uh--

810
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,611
over here in the center.

811
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,913
And, yes, uh, nurse,

812
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,081
could you join him,
please? Right here.

813
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,983
That--that's fine.
If you'd rather
be there, that's ok.

814
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,718
And our--please.

815
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,719
And can we see heads
through there?

816
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,954
Stand up in the back
there, gentlemen.

817
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,555
There you go.

818
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,194
I suppose
congratulations
are in order.

819
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,329
Thanks.

820
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,069
Caracciolo:
your American troops

821
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,438
are to join us soon...

822
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,508
And there will be
a big push.

823
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,880
And I must leave
tomorrow

824
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,016
to set up a forward
surgical unit.

825
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,388
I was hoping...

826
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:22,192
We could have another drive
together before I go.

827
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,863
I'm sorry. I promised
two of the patients

828
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,167
that I would take them
on a small excursion.

829
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,170
Young Hemingway?

830
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,175
Maybe some other time.

831
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,511
I would like that.

832
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,783
[Counting quietly]

833
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,961
Can I talk to you?

834
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,397
Uhh.

835
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,366
I've lost count.

836
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,701
It's Harry.
I'm worried about him.

837
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,703
What is it?

838
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,973
He's a lot sicker
than he's letting on.

839
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,174
Oh, he is, is he?

840
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,175
Yeah.

841
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,311
1, 2, 3, 4...

842
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,813
In fact, I don't think
anybody realizes just...

843
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,517
How sick the poor fellow
really is.

844
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,386
And you do?

845
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,954
Mmm.

846
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,926
E-Ernie, don't--

847
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,361
please don't do that.

848
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:36,500
Sorry.
i just wanted to see
what it was made of.

849
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,069
Is it some kind
of cotton?

850
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,406
It's a chambray.

851
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,842
It must get warm
in the heat.

852
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,577
It does.

853
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,147
1, 2...

854
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,150
The thing I was
thinking is that...

855
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,518
It might not be
such a good idea

856
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,088
for him to come
on the picnic with us.

857
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,191
Ernie, please.

858
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,195
What are these, silk?

859
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,331
Cotton--cotton.

860
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,399
Ahem.

861
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,603
Anyways, I was--i was
thinking that if Harry
stayed here...

862
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,841
And we went on
without him, that...

863
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,142
He might be disappointed
for a while,

864
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,211
but, I think,
in the end,

865
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,712
it'd be best.

866
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,316
You do have
his best interests
at heart.

867
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,654
Believe me, I do.

868
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,031
Shall I tell him,
or will you?

869
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,166
Oh, i--i think...

870
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:46,937
Maybe you should--
you should leave that
up to me.

871
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,423
What's the matter, Ernie?
Cat got your tongue?

872
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,432
Andiamo.

873
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,500
Driver: su.

874
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,569
Teresa: fermo!

875
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,138
Fermo, per favore!

876
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,910
E' mio zio.

877
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,178
Questo e mio zio,

878
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,580
il padre di
Roberto zardini.

879
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,449
Vorrebbe dare
al signor Ernie

880
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,284
la mantella
di suo figlio.

881
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,821
Ernie, it's
Roberto zardini's father,

882
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,057
and--and that is
Roberto's cape.

883
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,026
Mia moglie ed io--

884
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,228
he wants me to have it?
Mm-hmm.

885
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,899
Mia moglie ed io la
ringraziamo per quello
che ha fatto.

886
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,967
Thank you,
signor zardini.

887
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,135
Grazie.

888
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,178
Please ask her if...

889
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,412
Uh--uh...

890
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,381
Roberto...

891
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,549
Lui...

892
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,984
E' morto.

893
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,390
Di--

894
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,625
di a tuo...

895
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,726
Uh...

896
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,196
Your uncle that...

897
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,131
Signor Ernie á, um,

898
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,265

899
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,668
Ernest: grazie.

900
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,036
H-honored...

901
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,504
Di--di ricevere...

902
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:28,838
Uh...

903
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:29,940
La mantella...

904
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,342
Di suo figlio.

905
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,278
E' molto onorato.

906
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,446
Grazie.

907
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,336
There's a hundred tiny
little fish down here

908
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,071
nibbling on my legs.

909
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,839
Lucky bastards.

910
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,576
If this was
walloon lake,
they'd be bass,

911
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,478
and I'd have reeled in
6 of them by now.

912
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,013
Agnes: walloon?

913
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,415
It's in Michigan.

914
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,451
Someday,
I'll take you there.

915
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,820
I'll catch 'em.
You'll clean 'em.

916
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,421
We'll both eat 'em.

917
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,257
The day I clean a bass
will be the day

918
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,558
a one-legged,
big-headed boy

919
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,027
swims himself
across this lake.

920
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,695
Right.

921
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,197
Harry: Ernie.
Ernie.

922
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,765
Ernie!
Ernie!

923
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,899
Ernest.

924
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,967
Ernie.

925
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,574
Ernie!

926
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:38,842
Can you swim?

927
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,810
I hope not.

928
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,079
Ernie, you--

929
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,080
[Ernest gasping
for breath]

930
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,348
Come on, Ernie--
ok, fine!

931
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,684
I'll clean--I'll clean--
I'll clean one fish.

932
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,786
Ernie?

933
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,588
Two!?

934
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,356
Fine, Ernie.
Ok, you win, Ernie.

935
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,059
I'll clean
all 6 stupid fish.

936
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,229
How many?

937
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,230
What?

938
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,298
How many?

939
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,566
6...

940
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:04,634
Fish.

941
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,570
All right.

942
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,314
[Ernest and Agnes laugh]

943
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:22,619
"I have a rendezvous
with death at some
disputed barricade.

When spring comes back
with rustling--"

945
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,823
et cetera, et cetera,
ad nauseam.

946
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,825
"I shall not fail
that rendezvous."

947
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,393
For god's sakes,
Ernie, every--

948
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,063
every freshman at Harvard
has that one memorized.

949
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,165
I can't imagine
what's sticking
in your craw.

950
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,168
Come on, you two.
You're both getting
on my nerves.

951
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,136
Harry: now, are you
going to prance around
all afternoon

952
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:44,641
in a dead man's cape
like some third-rate
shakespearean actor?

953
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,209
Pardon me, old man,
but I carried him

954
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,712
across the damn
battlefield on my back.

955
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:51,014
And every time you
tell the story, it gets
bigger and bigger.

956
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,716
First, it was
20 yards, and then 50,

957
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:53,817
and now it's
the whole battlefield?

958
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,919
I'm leaving
if this does not stop.

959
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,289
Too bad, Harry. It must
have been tough for you
these last few weeks.

960
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,124
The rest of us shot up
or, at least, injured,

961
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:04,294
and you in the hospital
because you turned yellow.

962
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,796
Ernie, that was a stupid
and thoughtless
thing to say.

963
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,598
Whose side are you on,
anyway?

964
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,701
Whoever will put an end
to this ridiculous
argument.

965
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,771
I will, Agnes,
but just for you.

966
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,079
Are you going to ride back
with us peacefully?

967
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,547
I'd rather walk.

968
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,217
Walk, then.
Come on, Harry.

969
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,952
Well, Ernie, it looks
as though the best man

970
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,454
has been granted
the lady's favor after all.

971
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,555
Oh, you're right, Harry,

972
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,090
and it was granted to me
the other night...

973
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,025
In her bed.

974
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,532
All right, girls,
lift it up.

975
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,578
De long: We're
trying to get it
straight, Rosie.

976
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,880

congratulate, Ernie!

977
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,615

I think so.

There.

991
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,791
There? there.

Jimmy, I'm terribly
sorry. The other--

I'm afraid the other
patients have arrived,

995
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,068
so I'm going
to have to leave.

Will...

Won't you?

1000
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:39,282
I promise. I'll be back
as soon as I can.

1001

We're getting more
than we thought.
Go get the doctor.

1002
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,353
We'll be using
all the beds.

1003
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,621
We need wheelchairs.

Kid, this is
not the time.

It's over, isn't it,
you and me?

1009
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,635
I made a mess out of it,
and now you're never
going to forgive me.

into bed carefully
but quickly, everyone,

out of here.

Jimmy was dictating.

of how to finish it.

dear mom and dad...

1042
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,406
The thing this war
has taught me...

1043
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:56,846
Is that it's important
to get things said
before it's too late.

1044
01:01:58,915 --> 01:01:59,982
First...

1045
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:08,057
You've been
the very best parents
a son could ever ask for.

1046
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,563
When I was a kid...

1047
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:19,135
And I used to get scared
of the dark,

1048
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,771
it was the thought
that you were there

1049
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,840
that got me through it.

1050
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:35,985
I think about that
a lot...

1051
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,324
Because I guess
I'm scared now.

1052
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,932
I don't know
if I can make it...

1053
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:52,702
And if I don't...

1054
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,808
Please understand
that sometimes...

to places alone.

1056
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,793
But whatever happens...

1057
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,230
Always know that...

to the front.

to do me a huge favor.

so hard to say good-bye.

Come on, look at these.
They're great.

1257
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,339
Ah, how about me
as a clown?

1258
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:05,673
Oh, why would
that be different?

1259
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:08,309
Yeah, I'm going to take
one of these home. Um...

1260
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,951
Domenico:
i would buy any mask
for you.

1261
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,691
But this is the one
i would choose.

1262
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,293
Just hold it right
there, Mr. Hemingway.

1263
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,128
Just a couple
of more questions,
Mr. Hemingway.

1264
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:29,330
How'd you feel about
being the first American--

1265
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,532
thank you, ma'am--

1266
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:34,335
about being
the first American
wounded in Italy?

1267
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,171
Well, I would have
much rather been
the last.

[Laughing]

1269
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:39,007
You must be very proud
of him, Mrs. Hemingway.

1270
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:42,444
Ernest was a hero
to this family long
before he went to war.

1271
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,679
How exactly
were you wounded?

1272
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,715
Like I said, I was
just fooling around
in the trenches.

1273
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:49,951
I'm sorry, folks,
that's enough.

1274
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,886
I have patients
scheduled.

1275
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:53,455
Just one more question,
Dr. Hemingway.

1276
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:56,057
Did you fall for any
of those Italian beauties,
Ernie?

1277
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,460
No, but I met just
about the best-looking
American girl

1278
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,161
you ever saw over there.

1279
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,297
Can we have her name?

1280
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:05,266
Mrs. Hemingway,
soon as the war ends.

for you, Charlotte.

1283
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,509
Ernest: so I told the folks
all about us.

1284
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:19,681
Just know you'll
win them round,
the moment you arrive.

01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:21,149
Once we're married,

let us live in his cabin

making the old place

1289
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,962
I haven't heard
from you in over a week,

1290
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:37,632
so I just hope that
you're safe and well.

1291

Hey, Ernie! Ernie!

1292
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,546

Hi, Joe.

1299
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,359
How many of them
went in you?

1300
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,493
227.

1301
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,363
Just like these.

1302
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:11,232
Nothing from Italy.
Sorry, Ernie.

1303
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,700
I can't complain.

1304

She sends me
a telegram practically
every other day.

First all I knew
was buon giorno,

but now, your poor brother
has to sit through
my conjugation of verbs.

only in the present.

the red cross will post
you back to America.

your future?

I can perform

without
the slightest fear,
and now...

1345

morendo di paura.

is...

to be my wife?

to know which transport

that it was.

just a fling.

i would marry him.

No. I liked him fine,

1386
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:43,504
and I think he's
as good-looking as sin,

1387
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:48,776
but, my god, aggie...
He is not a husband.

of you leaving.

And once again,
you are right.

1393

with my head.

1395

This is the most
difficult letter
I've ever had to write.

1396

And I'm afraid it's going
to hurt you a great deal.

1397
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,692
But Dr. caracciolo
has offered me
a wonderful opportunity

1398

to help him set up
a new hospital here.

1399
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,763
And he's also asked me
to marry him,

1400
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:46,501
and I have agreed
to consider this.

1401
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,102
What I do have
to recognize, though,

1402
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,004
is that you and i
are years apart,

1403
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,607
and it would be
so very wrong of me
to tie you down

1404

when there are so many
stories yet to write.

by myself,

that our relationship
must come to an end.

01:35:58,219 --> 01:35:59,220
Won't you...

1429
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,589
Thank you.
You look so grown up.

1430
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:05,593
I must say, a suit
looks much better on you

1431
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,727
than a pair of pajamas.

1432
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:09,697
You look
just as beautiful.

1433
01:36:11,165 --> 01:36:14,969
I, uh, I took the Liberty
of ordering a chianti

1434
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:16,437
for old times' sake.

1435
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,506
Uh, may I?

1436
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:29,383
For old times' sake.

1437
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,659
Feels more like
a hundred years than...

1438
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:41,996
8 months, is it, since
we saw each other last?

1439
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:43,597
Do you remember?

1440
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:45,533
Certainly. you were...

1441
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:49,170
Giving front-line advice
to the lovelorn.

1442
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:53,340
Which I, uh, understood
you didn't take.

1443
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:58,746
I'd, uh...I'd heard you'd
married the good doctor,

1444
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:01,682
but i--i don't see
a wedding ring.

1445
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:05,553
No, no, I didn't
marry domenico.

1446
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:10,090
I think I've made
a mess of things all
the way around, Harry.

1447
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,663
How did you hear
i was married?

1448
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,232
How do you think?

1449
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:22,069
I heard through an angry,
gin-soaked voice

1450
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,538
over the telephone
at 3:00 in the morning.

1451
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:30,778
Do you ever see him?

1452
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:32,813
No.

1453
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:37,451
But I get raging,
rambling letters from him,

1454
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:40,554
mostly about you.

1455
01:37:40,554 --> 01:37:42,756
He's very angry.

1456
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:46,961
He has every right
to be.

1457
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:54,101
Where is he?

1458
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:57,705
Well, he's at walloon lake.

1459
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,206
Trying his hand
at scribbling.

1460
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,842
Living off his old man,
if you ask me.

1461
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,116
Do you mind
if I ask you something?

1462
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:10,751
Hmm.

1463
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,290
Do you love him?

1464
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,836
Did you ever tell him?

1465
01:38:36,844 --> 01:38:38,913
Yes.

1466
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:44,618
But I don't think
he heard.

1467
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:57,097
Don't you think
it might be a good idea
to tell him now?

1468
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:19,847
Catch any bass?

1469
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:36,697
What are you
doing here?

1470
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,832
There are some things
that needed to be said.

1471
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:43,337
I just hope
it's not too late.

1472
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,968
Do you want a drink?

1473
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:19,640
[Ahem]
all right.

1474
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,910
In that case,
I'll have one, too.

1475
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,949
How's your leg?

1476
01:41:31,718 --> 01:41:35,456
Is that a personal or
a professional question?

1477
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:43,797
Ernie--

1478
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:45,799
absent friends.

1479
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,531
Do you remember dottie?

1480
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:22,069
She...she married
burnside...

1481
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:26,306
Of all people.

1482
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:28,275
And Rosie?

1483
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,043
Rosie ran off
with Larkin.

1484
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:36,717
Mac said
if I see you again,
i should say hello.

1485
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:39,520
As you'd expect,
she's still
with the red cross.

1486
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:44,158
It's, uh...

1487
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,727
She's nursing in Cuba.

1488
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:56,003
Birdseed. never liked him.

1489
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:59,306
Pompous ass.

1490
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:01,875
Are you in touch
with any of the boys?

1491
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:05,712
Harry sometimes.

1492
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:09,816
Yes, he says you've
been...Writing.

1493
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:13,687
Sold a few pieces.

1494
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:23,864
Jesus, it's stuffy
in here.

1495
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:54,828
Beautiful.

1496
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:57,898
Just as I'd imagined
it would be.

1497
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,669
My little palazzo
in the woods.

1498
01:44:08,942 --> 01:44:12,579
I heard you and, uh,
Dr. what's-his-name
didn't go through with it.

1499
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,516
Why not?

1500
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:18,385
Too old?

1501
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:22,689
It was a mistake.

1502
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:28,629
There was always
somebody else.

1503
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,199
Anyone I know?

1504
01:44:34,234 --> 01:44:36,937
Who else but you, Ernie?

1505
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:41,842
It still is. That's why
i had to come back here,

1506
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:43,343
and I had to tell you
how sorry I am.

1507
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:45,078
Sorry for what?

1508
01:44:45,078 --> 01:44:46,913
It was the war.

1509
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:49,549
Lot of things happen
in the war.

1510
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:52,953
What did either
of us know?

1511
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:54,288
No, we knew.

1512
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:57,557
We knew.
You can't deny that.

1513
01:44:57,557 --> 01:45:00,861
We had a fling...
Kid stuff.

1514
01:45:21,114 --> 01:45:24,017
There's still
a part of me that...

1515
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:28,655
Wants to take you
in my arms.

1516
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,525
Just like it used to be.

1517
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:35,996
But I've changed.

1518
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,964
Of course.
Things change.

1519
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,803
It wouldn't work.

1520
01:45:45,605 --> 01:45:47,307
Not now.

1521
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:52,279
Not this time.

1522
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,357
Oh, kid.

1523
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:08,929
Kid grew up, ag.

1524
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:11,732
Thanks to you.

1525
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:49,102
I love you.

1526
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:22,202
I'll love you
as long as I live.

1527
01:47:57,037 --> 01:48:02,342
Agnes: I never saw Ernie again
after walloon lake.

1528
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:06,179
I often wonder
what might have happened

1529
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:09,249
if he had taken me
in his arms.

1530
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:14,788
But I guess his pride
meant he wasn't able
to forgive me.

1531
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:20,126
Some say he lived
with the pain of it
all his life.

1532
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:23,396
The hurt boy became
the angry man,

1533
01:48:23,396 --> 01:48:28,101
a brilliant,
tough adventurer,

1534
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:32,806
who was the most famous
writer of his generation.

1535
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:35,909
And the kid he had been...

1536
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:44,584
Eager...idealistic...
and tender...

1537
01:48:44,584 --> 01:48:46,553
Lived on only in my heart.
