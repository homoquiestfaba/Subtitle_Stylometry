Okay, you guys,
it's just a competition.

Well, welcome to the world

Rejection,

I taught you well.

The judges are stupid
in my opinion,

34
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,766
because you're the best
pianist I've ever heard.
You're so--

35
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,550
No, we're sunk!

36

We're not sunk.

37
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,597
No, we're doomed, Claire.

38
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,642
Baby, that's not true.

39
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,427
You know that's not true.
Come on, we're okay.

40

We have useless degrees.

So what did you say?

47
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,014
[Claire] I didn't know
what to say.

My heart was just
pounding at
100 beats a minute,

I just froze.

Well?

This is big. I mean,
this is, like, magnormous.

52
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,328
So are you...
I mean, is it real?

53
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,069
Oh... Oh, God!

54
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,509
I love him. I mean,
I love him so much.

55
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,381
So are you gonna
accept his proposal?

you know what this means?

We're gonna be married
in the same year!

60
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:48,538
We can all vacation
in the Hamptons.

61

Our children can...

62
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,498
That lipstick's
awfully dark.

63
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,892
You look hot.

64
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,503
Now go get engaged.

65
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,736
Yes.

66
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,697

70
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,106
He doesn't
remember anything.

71
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,413
He blacked out
proposing to you?

72
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,110
Did you slap him?
What did you say?

73
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,591
[Claire]
Well, it gets worse.

74
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,115
He took my hand
and squeezed it.

75
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,205
And all of a sudden
he said to me,

76
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,469
"I think it's time
we give this a rest, hon."

77
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,123
He, um...

78
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:56,127
He... I guess
he broke up with me.

79
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,565
You should have
dumped the bastard
months ago.

80
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,226
He's not gonna call.

81
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:11,055
I know.

82
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,971
You know, I should really
just go over there.
I really should.

83
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,496
Oh, no, no.

84
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:17,888
If you go over there,
he's gonna be horny.

85
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,237
Guys are always horny
after a breakup.

86
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:20,761
So?

87
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,763
"So?"

88
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,722
So then you'll do him,
and you'll be mistaking it
for a reconciliation.

89
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,029
But in the morning
he's gonna need
his space again.

90
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,161
I don't smoke.

91
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,250

leave Claire alone.

Oh, no, no.
I'm fine.

96
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,870
I'm fine. I'm just gonna
take a little nap.

97

Five days!
You've been sleeping
for five days!

98

I haven't been sleeping
the whole time.

on occasion.

Well, honey, you won't
always feel this way.

101

Well, how long is it
gonna take?

102

I don't know.
I can't tell you exactly.

103
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,196
It took me about
four months to
get over Bo.

104
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,981
Oh, please.
You're not over Bo now.

105
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,113

all the way over here,

111

and we're not gonna leave
till you come out.

to break in,
no questions asked.

Go ahead and say it, Ma.
I look like shit.

118
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,587
You look like shit.

119
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:51,242
You know,
when Grandpa Alvie, the louse,
left Grandma Bitburg,

120
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,637
he left her with
three children to raise,

121
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,552
and a butcher shop to run.

122
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,294
The very next day,
she was smiling

123
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:03,167
as she sold a rump roast
to an old widow.

124
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:07,650
And the widow asked her,
"How can you be smiling?
You just lost your man."

125
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:12,089
And she said, "A woman's life
is like a plate of spaghetti.

126
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,615
A man, he's just
a meatball.

127
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,617
Does the meatball make
the spaghetti taste better?

128
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,314
Yes.

129
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,751
Does the spaghetti
need the meatball?

130
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:22,709
No."

131
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:24,711
You hear what I'm saying?

132
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,369
Welcome to the land
of the perpetually
depressed.

133
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,677
I'll be your tour guide.

134
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,074
That's a lot of rejection
for one week.

135
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,553
First a fiancee,

136
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,294
then a career-making
competition like
the Tchaikovsky.

137
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,383
But you know
what you've got

138
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,255
that no one can
take away from you?

139
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,953
Great skin.

140
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,781
[Aunt Velva]
It gets better, bubbala.

141
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,827
When my Sully died,

142
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:59,093
it went from a severe,
sharp, stabbing pain,

143
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,836
to a severe
long-lasting ache.

144

145
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,199
[Sabrina] <i>I made a list</i><i>
of dateable men for you.</i>

146
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,983
First is Kenny Pratt.

147
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,116
Actually, I always
wanted Kenny Pratt.
That would be weird.

148
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,813
But there's Alan Myers.

149
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,076
Mmm. He's a podiatrist.

150
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,689
He can do things
with his feet that you
never thought possible.

151
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,908
So what you gotta do
is pull up them britches,

152
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,344
strap on that helmet,

153
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,303
and jump back
in the game.

154
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,697
Halftime's over, baby.

155
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,394
Now, I want you
to put on your bra,

156
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,048
get back to practice,

157
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,876
and just forget about
seeing that schmuck.

158
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,753
Mmm. His bathroom
light is on.

159
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:53,321
Do you see that?
Isn't that weird?

160
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,975
Why do you think
his bathroom light
would be on?

161
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,238
[Sabrina] Probably because
he's in the bathroom.

162
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,674
Claire, darling,
what you need to do

163
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:01,068
is have some
good old-fashioned
American fun.

164
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,373
Now, come on,
let's get drunk.

165
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,332
Drunk?

166
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,291
Is that what you think?

167
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,772
You think I have to
start drinking just because
my life is falling apart?

168
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,209
-Yeah.
-I'll have you know
I'm fine.

169
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,345
You know what
I need to do?

170
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,694
I need to just
clear the air with him
once and for all.

171
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:19,869
You think I should
go over there?

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,784
-No.
-No.

173
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,004
You guys don't understand.

174
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,701
-You've got Alice.
-Yeah.

175
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:29,357
And you've got guys
lined up in a row,
and you've got Rudy.

around the world

177
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:34,188
and not gonna be home
for three more months.

178
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,886
Listen to you.
You sound serious.

179
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,322
Yeah. Well, we've been
talking about

180
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,021
moving things
to the next level
when he gets out.

181
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,892
I miss the hairy
son of a bitch.

182
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,157
So I've ended
the incessant masturbation.

183
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,463
-Good.
-Yeah.

184
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,161
Hi.

185
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,164
Yeah, just once or twice
per day now
in the stock room.

186
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,297
Which I like to believe
is a sign that I'm mastering

187
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,256
the art of not
thinking about Alice
every second of every day.

188
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,128
Do her already!

189
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:04,087
That girl's so hot for you
she's practically laid out
runway lights.

190
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,915
Have you seen
these two play <i>Scrabble?</i>

191
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,875
[sighs]
It's like foreplay.

192
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,921
We happen to share
a love for words, that's all.

193
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,489
-Yeah.
-It would never, ever work.

194
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:15,838
Why not?

195
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,448
[Arthur] We rented videos.

196
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,799
I wanted <i>
Prophecies of the Millennium,</i>

197
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,844
a speculative hour
on impending doom,

198
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,933
and she wanted <i>
Pretty in Pink.</i>

199
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,807
Claire.

200
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,243
Since you're finally
out of bed tonight,

201
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,461
does that mean
that you're gonna
come to the party?

202
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,942
With no detours
to the bastard's house.

203
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:35,727
Did I tell you
that I might have found

204
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,773
a healthy way to satisfy
my sexual frustration?

205
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,862
You're not
calling the lawyer.

206
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,824
She met this cute lawyer
in the fish market
who wanted phone sex.

207
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,217
Actually he wanted
phone sex or cybersex,

208
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,479
but I'm not online.

209
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,266
I said no.

210
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,443
You didn't say no.

211
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,489
I know you.
You're a liar.

212
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,187
[Sabrina chuckles] I'm not.

213
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:03,364
Anyway, I think phone sex
is kind of...
It's kind of skanky.

214
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,368
You're so strong.

215
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:10,110
[exhales] Ah, it feels
so good right there.

216
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,374
Oh, you're so good.

217
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,855
You're such a good boy.

218
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,182
[door unlocking]

219
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:42,055
Claire?

220
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:45,885
Hey.

221
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,323
It's not that I don't
want to make love to you.

222
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,628
You understand?
It's just that I...

223
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,630
I might mistake it
for a reconciliation,

224
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,284
whereas you might
just be horny,

225
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:55,851
and then in the morning
you're gonna need
your space again.

226
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,505
You know what I mean?

227
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,464
So I... I think that
we should really
talk first, you know?

228
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,250
Just clear everything up
emotionally so there's no
confusion about anything.

229
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,209
[stutters] So, yeah,
it's really, really,
really good

230
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,559
that you're gonna call
me at 7:30. Right?

231
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,475
You'll call me at 7:30?
Yeah?

232
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:14,435
Hey, I've been
screwing up my auditions.
Can I get my shoe back?

233
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,568
His shoe?

234
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,007
Last year we went
to see Jeremy's idol,
Andre Watts' at the symphony.

235
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,313
And when Andre comes out,

236
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,533
he practically gets
mobbed by fans

237
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,362
and he loses
a scarf and a shoe.

238
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,364
Some Japanese cellist
got the scarf

239
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,019
and Jeremy got the shoe.

240
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,238
Anyway, so now
he takes it with him
to all his auditions

241
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,500
like a good luck charm.

242
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,589
And he wanted it back.

243
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,592
[Sabrina] Okay,
that's really creepy.

244
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,420
At least you didn't let
him touch you, did you?

245
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,466
Did you?

246
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,078
He said the sweetest thing
to me last night.

247
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,560
He said, "The thought
of hurting you

248
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,388
keeps me up at night."

249
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,479
[sighs]

250
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,917
I mean, it really looks like
he wants to work things out.

251
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,440
We even set up
a time to talk.

252
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,616
7:30, Friday night.

253
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,663
I say give back
the freaky shoe
and be done with him.

254
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:11,666
Look, for the first time
in days I'm starting to
feel a little hopeful here.

255
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:13,929
You know?

256
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,453
Like, maybe my life
won't be one long string
of impending disasters

257
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,064
and inescapable doom.

258
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,286
[loud rumbling]

259
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,461
-[glass shatters]
-[objects clatter]

260
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:29,989
[car alarm blaring]

261
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:35,646
Jeremy?

262
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,083
[dogs barking]

263
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,128
[siren wailing]

264
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,565
What do you mean
my building's condemned?

265
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,480
That building's fine,
and that building's fine.

266
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,439
So mine can't
be condemned.

267
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:48,224
I'm sorry, miss,
you have to vacate
within 24 hours.

268
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,444
There's no way I can
possibly move right now.

269
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,533
I mean, where am I
supposed to go?

270
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,536
-You're home!
-Hi, Mom.

271
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,320
Look who's home.

272
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,628
Unscathed by
the earthquake
and looking just...

273
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,500
Well, looking just fine.
Oh, you look fine.

274
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,503
-Oh, hey Sabrina.
-Hey, Aunt Sheila.

275
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,027
-Thanks, Arthur.
-[Arthur mutters]

276
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,506
-Bennett called.
-Oh.

277
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,378
The NYU audition
is on for this Thursday.

278
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,293
That's good, Ma.

279
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,469
The important thing is,
I've got both my girls
under one roof.

280
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,037
Claire!
[squeals excitedly]

281
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,647
I'm just so glad
that you're up and about.

282
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,132
My old room.

283
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,439
I'm gonna puke.

284
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:34,749
Hey. Mom says to tell you
that dinner will be ready
in an hour.

285
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,534
Oh, and a word
of warning. [chuckles]

286
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:41,234
She's, uh, experimenting
with Grandma Bitburg's
recipes.

287
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,670
-[sighs]
-And you remember
what happened the last time

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,672
that she tried
to make Jewish food.

289
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:47,675
Oh, look at you.

290
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,546
Sitting on the bed
all depressed.

291
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,157
It's just like old times.

292
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,510
I have made
my first matzah ball soup.

293
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,816
I'm so excited about this.

294
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,296
Been working on it all day.

295
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,124
I want you
to try it first.

296
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,301
I had a great idea.

297
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,695
How about we have
Jenine's engagement party

298
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,349
right here in our living room?

299
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,264
We can decorate everything,

300
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,397
and by that time I'll have
Grandma Bitburg's recipes
singing with life.

301
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,530
Ma, we've been
through this.

302
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,228
I told you
that it would need
a major atmosphere makeover,

303
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,274
-and you yawned
in my ear.
-[dial tone]

304
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,103
Oh, but Barry and I
did decide on
our color palette.

305
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:24,886
Coral and bisque.

306
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:26,888
What's bisque?

307
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,542
[Jenine] Yellowish pink.

308
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,327
If you drink all that,

309
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,155
you're gonna have
a hard time going
to work tomorrow.

310
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:34,765
Maybe I don't wanna
go to work tomorrow.

311
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,681
The coordinator thought
that cream was out
as a color.

312
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,030
Did you have a fight
with Morty?

313
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,772
I'm just taking some
time off work, that's all.

314
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,513
I heard you're
hoarding ding-dongs.

315
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,211
[Jenine] Do you think
I'm making a mistake?

316
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:46,734
Do you think it should
be coral and cream?

317
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,692
[Sheila]
Well, fight or no fight,
you have to go to work.

318
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:50,085
I mean, if I didn't
go to work every time
I had a fight with someone,

319
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,347
if I worked, I'd be fired.

320
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,740
[Jenine] Because if
I'm making a mistake,

321
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,089
I wish someone
would tell me.

322
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,916
[stutters]
Did you hear something?

323
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,526
Was that a ring?

324
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,835
[dial tone]

325
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,794
Am I gonna have to
start crushing Prozac
in the mashed potatoes?

326
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:05,709
[music playing on stereo]

327
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,667
[Claire] Hey, Jeremy.

328
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,148
Hey.

329
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,628
Hey, you.
What's going on?

330
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,196
Jeremy, hi.

331
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,285
[cheerfully] Jeremy, hi.

332
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,338
[dialing]

333
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,300
Hello?

334
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,521
Uh, yeah,
is Jeremy there?

335
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:38,786
This is Claire.

336
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,310
Claire Goldstein.

337
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,269
Who is this?

338
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,276
[panting]

339
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,152
-Whoa!
-Oh!

340
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,371
Hello, there.

341
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,503
-Hi.
-Hi.

342
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,635
[sobbing]

343
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:04,681
Are you okay?

344
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,212
Hey, those are
great shoes.

345
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,346
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
I'm Eddie.

346
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:18,304
Oh.

347
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:19,479
Hi.

348
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,829
I'm, uh... [sniffling]

349
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,745
I'm... I'm late for a party.

350
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,791
[Latin music playing]

351
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,406
Halle-fucking-lujah!

352
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,494
It's about time.

353
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,669
[people whooping and cheering]

354
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,803
[laughs]

355
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,284
Yay! Look, my love is here.

356
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:43,416
Oh, my God,
look who's here!

357
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,548
Oh, my God!

358
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,767
-Wait a minute.
-What are you wearing?

359
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,247
You have to take those off.

360
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,639
[all clamoring]

361
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,340
Hi, Claire.

362
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,255
[music continues]

363
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:06,874
...8:20 and he
hadn't called me,
and so I decided to call him.

364
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:09,529
And big-nosed
Bella Butski answered
the phone,

365
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,749
and she had this...
She had this little
flitty, happy voice.

366
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,403
Stay.

367
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,926
He can't be
dating her, right?

368
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,667
He can't be.

369
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,278
I mean, the thought
of hurting me

370
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,627
is supposed to be
keeping him up at night.

371
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,281
[Sabrina] The boy
is a schnauzer.

372
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,413
Oh, did I tell you
who wants to date me?

373
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:26,372
Who, the phone sex guy?

374
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,938
I thought you weren't
gonna date him.

375
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,768
[Sabrina]
Well, it's just one date
at Ray's on the hill.

376
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,771
Ray's?
$100 a plate Ray's?

377
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,950
Manny. Honey,
this is not a lab.

378
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:43,345
I've noticed that lately
he'll answer to
the name Sheldon.

379
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,129
You guys, be careful
what you eat.

380
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,828
Lately, little Sheldon here
has been putting acid
in the food.

381
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,440
Yesterday I found
a couple of tabs he put
in my Cocoa Puffs.

382
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:54,443
Yeah, and I spent
the rest of the day
barking at a potato bug.

383
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,448
-Put that on.
That's the one.
-Yeah.

384
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,625
-[Sabrina] What do you think?
-It's fantastic.

385
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,584
You're just in time
to meet Alan.
Put this on.

386
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:06,063
Who's Alan?

387
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,804
Who's Alan?

388
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,023
[music continues]

389
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,944
So, this, uh...
This is a great party.

390
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:19,033
You know,
it's Sabrina's place.

391
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:20,426
It's amazing.

392
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,732
What does Sabrina do
for a living?

393
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:24,473
She calls her father.

394
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:26,432
[chuckles]

395
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,742
You seem to really
like the guacamole.

396
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,353
Mmm. Mmm.

397
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,355
I do, I do.
It's really good.

398
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,403
Yeah. [stutters]
It's got, uh...
It's got lemon,

399
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,797
and, um, cilantro, right?

400
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:45,929
Which I do like.

401
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,931
Except when I was little...
I was, like, eight, I think,

402
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,325
cilantro made me
break out into
this rash.

403
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,761
It was like itchy hives.

404
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:54,634
And other spices,
I had reactions
to them also.

405
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,074
Is my hand
in the guacamole?

406
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,381
Yeah.

407
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,776
[all vocalizing]

408
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,387
[playing upbeat music]

409
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:14,393
I only work at
the video store part-time.

410
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,090
At night I'm working
on my first novel

411
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,657
called <i>I Hate People.</i>

412
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,009
What am I
even doing here?

413
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:24,054
I've always been
terrible at this

414
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,840
happy, peppy,
party person thing.

415
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,537
You're fine.

416
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:31,018
Just relax and try to
keep your body parts
out of the food.

417
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:34,717
-Hey.
-Hey.

418
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,416
So, you're ready?

419
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:38,808
-Just been waiting
on you.
-Good.

420
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,681
Let the games begin.

421
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,118
[music continues]

422
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,557
Oh, I guess
one sip won't kill me.

423
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:55,738
Manny, you are the only one
who really understands me.

424
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:56,957
Thank you.

425
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,046
-Thank you for that.
Really.
-Yeah.

426
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,702
Do you ever wonder
why sheep don't shrink
when it rains?

427
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,053
You are in worse shape
than I thought.

428
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,840
Dinophobia?
That's not a word.

429
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,973
Fear of dining
and dinner conversations.

430
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,018
I don't believe you.

431
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,020
No? I don't
believe "nacket."

432
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,892
What the hell's a nacket?

433
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,938
It's a person who
picks up stray tennis balls
during a tennis match.

434
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:26,465
-You...
-Yeah.

435
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,469
Are so challenged.

436
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:32,993
[Claire] Well, it doesn't
make any difference

437
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:36,431
because I'm completely
and officially done

438
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:37,911
with love.

439
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,216
I'm gonna be celibate.

440
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,088
Love don't
live here anymore.

441
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:42,916
Come here, babe.

442
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,573
Stay. Oh, here.

443
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,620
The time has come.

444
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:53,753
All right, you ready?

445
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,062
Who is this?

446
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,543
I have no idea.

447
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,111
It's the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

448
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,895
[Claire]
That's the <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

449
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:09,812
Believe it or not,
but she is your key
to getting men.

450
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,118
Mmm-hmm.

451
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,599

452

-[snoring]
-[people speaking indistinctly]

453
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,913
Damn it! She won again!

454
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,915
How... Hey.

455
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,614
Hey, have you ever
heard of a... a nacket?

456
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,355
[Sabrina] Why do you think

457
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:34,750
that the whole world
is so obsessed
with the <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

458
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:38,058
Because no one knows
what she's thinking.

459
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,713
I mean, is she sneering?
Is she smiling?

460
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:41,801
Is she smirking?

461
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:47,850
That's why whenever
a guy comes towards you

462
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,243
that you want,

463
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,202
you have to think like Mona.

464
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,204
-[glass shattering]
-You just have
to be like Mona.

465
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:57,120
-Be like Mona.
-[thudding]

466

[siren wailing]

469
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,003
[groaning]

[jackhammers drilling]

471
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,581
[jackhammer drilling]

472
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,688
[Eddie] Hey.

473
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:46,735
Hey.

474
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:51,174
Hey. Found new shoes.

475
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,089
-Hmm?
-New shoes.

476
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,743
Oh. Oh, my God.

477
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,659
If you can call them shoes.

478
00:26:59,313 --> 00:27:00,619
Oh.

479
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,752
You okay? You don't
look too good.

480
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,101
Yeah, well, that's because

481
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,756
my head is about to
implode at any second.

482
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:09,062
[chuckles]

483
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:11,978
I can fix that.

484
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:13,980
Hey.

485
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,160
Are you sure about this?

486
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,076
This can't be
your first hangover.

487
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,295
It is.

488
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,080
Well...

489
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:28,995
[crossdresser] Smile!

490
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,656
[laughs] Ow!

491
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,658
Let me see this.

492
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,664
Yeah. I think
that these two people
should go out for pizza.

493
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,367
[Sheila] Does anybody
know where Claire is?

494
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,064
She didn't come home
last night.

495
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:57,327
[Ida] Maybe she left early
to get a good practice room.

496
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,807
No. Her bed
wasn't slept in.

497
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,766
Hello, hello.
Don't you get it?

498
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,985
Barry hates
multi-colored hydrangea.

499
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,683
You know,
I just don't get it.

500
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,336
For 15 years,
the piano's her life.

501
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,862
Now, one schmuck dumps her
and she just loses it.

502
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:11,777
-[oven timer dings]
-Oh, Christ, my latkes.

503
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,692
[Jenine] And with
escrow closing now,

504
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,432
Barry will be back
from Boston any day.

505
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,870
Why do you have
to move to Boston?

506
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,959
Do you have any idea
how cold it gets there?

507
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:22,091
As a partner,
his salary will triple.

508
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,354
In a couple years,
he'll be able to start
his own practice.

509
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:27,270
Did I ever tell you about
Marion Brickmeyer's cousin?

510
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,925
He moved to Boston,
got caught in a winter storm,

511
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,188
and lost a pinky toe.
True story.

512
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,973
Ma, I'm really not up
for one of your stories
right now.

513
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,149
Excuse me.

514
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:43,460
Well, good morning,
sunshine.

515
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,900
[Sheila] So...
where were you all night?

516
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,729
We were worried
you'd been killed or worse.

517
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,819
Well, I was, um...

518
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:57,170
out... with friends.

519
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,000
Doing yoga.

520
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:02,741
[softly] Yoga?

521
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,482
Lots and lots
of yoga.

522
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,096
Morning.

523
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:56,403
Hey, Dad.

524
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,024
Your mom's a little
worried about you.

525
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,810
She says you're not eating
and you're not sleeping.

526
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,815
I think I may have done
a really stupid thing.

527
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,992
I accepted a date.

528
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,124
Well, the important thing is,
is he Jewish?

529
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,300
[giggles]

530
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,346
What's the big deal?
It's just a date.

531
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,914
I know, but what
if Jeremy sees us?

532
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,959
I mean, he'll think
I'm dating someone else.

533
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,309
And not to mention the fact
that I don't get

534
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,138
this whole poker-face <i>
Mona Lisa</i>thing.

535
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:39,359
I mean,
what do I talk about?

536
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:40,969
First dates are simple.

537
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,884
Just don't talk
about former boyfriends

538
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:46,540
or kids or marriage
or breakups.

539
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,324
Fears, insecurities.

540
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,152
Oh, dieting or religion.

541
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,459
Religion's a...
You know what?

542
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:56,289
Just talk about... him.

543
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,336
You know what? Men love
to talk about themselves.

544
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,121
Oh, and make sure
somewhere in the date,

545
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:05,341
you slip in that you slept
with women, okay?

546
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,343
Tell him I've slept
with women?

547
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,518
[thunderclap]

548
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,006
-Hey.
-Hey!

549
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,139
-[laughs]
-Are we in the right place?

550
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,531
I thought you said
we were meeting for pizza.

551
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:24,012
Yeah. We are.
Should be here.

552
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,187
[motorbike approaching]

553
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:26,885
Right about now.

554
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,894
-[laughs]
-Excuse me.

555
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,200
Are you sure
we're allowed to do this?

556
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,593
I am...

557
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,030
sure we're not allowed
to do it.

558
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,336
[Claire giggles]

559
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,511
<i>Madame.</i>

560
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,252
[thunderclap]

561
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,557
Nice weather, huh?

562
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,037
[Claire] Yeah, beautiful.

563
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:51,561
I used to come here
all the time.

564
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,128
They closed this place
a couple of years ago.

565
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,260
Huh.

566
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,522
I don't know why.

567
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,525
[Claire] Wow!

568
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,007
Look at this!
This is beautiful!

569
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,313
-Yeah. Had my first date
here, too.
-You did?

570
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:06,359
Tamara Beth Bachama.

571
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:07,882
Actually,
it was a field trip,

572
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,494
-But I did hold her hand.
Let's go! Now!
-[laughing]

573
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,062
I stole cars,
I stole car parts...

574
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,325
I stole an ambulance.

575
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,023
[laughs] Why?

576
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,894
I don't know.
I was bored.

577
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,591
I was an idiot.

578
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,942
I mean, things only started
to change when my dad died.

579
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,552
Left me and my brothers
the market.

580
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,554
-Market?
-The fish market.

581
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,687
Wait a minute!

582
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:32,733
You're Eddie Marblatt
of Marblatt's?

583
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,258
[laughs]

584
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,391
So, I mean, it was
only like a year
after my dad kicked it,

585
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,653
my mom's health
is failing.

586
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,047
The business was...
Well, it was going down.

587
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,136
So what happened?

588
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,268
I mean, it's like a big
successful chain now.

589
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,967
My brother.
He thought up our mascot,
Terry the Tuna.

590
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,577
[Claire chuckles]

591
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:51,708
Yeah. You know,
we got those commercials

592
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,710
where the tuna's
tap-dancing and singing.

593
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,364
-You don't know that?
-Mmm.

594
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:59,281
<i>♪ Tuna, swordfish</i><i>
Salmon filet ♪</i>

595
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:02,676

Catch of the day ♪</i>

596
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:05,984
I just sang to you.
I can't believe I just
sang to you. [laughs]

597
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,073
I feel like I'm yapping, too.
Am I talking too much?

598
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,727
Tell me about you.
You play piano. What else?

599
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:14,253
Um... well,
I'm a Sagittarius.

600
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,297
Scorpio.

601
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:19,084
[laughs] Um, I like overalls.

602
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,129
And...

603
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,091
I like women.

604
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,186
Why would you tell him
you like women?

605
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,188
-I don't know.
I panicked, okay?
-[video game beeping]

606
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,320
How am I supposed
to just slip it in there
that I slept with women?

607
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,670
I mean, there I am,
smiling my goofy-ass smile,

608
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,237
careful not
to reveal too much,

609
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:43,630
and then,
"Oh, by the way,
I'm a lesbian"?

610
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,197
[chuckles]
You got it all wrong.

611
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,982
No, you're not a lesbian.
You just slept with women.

612
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,070
But you also have
to let them know

613
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,116
that nothing
compares to a penis.

614
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:53,074
This is insane.
I can't keep up.

615
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,163
All right. Come here.

616
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,905
What?

617
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,342
There's an unwritten rule
that men are turned on
by women

618
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,083
who've had sexual liaisons
with other women.

619
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,998
Okay.

620
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,392
But in order to
keep their egos
and their libidos intact,

621
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,307
you have to let them know
it was a worthwhile experience,

622
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:12,050
but there is nothing
that compares to a penis.

623
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,055
-[chuckles]
-Why do you have
that look on your face?

624
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,056
What? I don't.

625
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,188
You do, too.

626
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,712
Oh, my God.
[gasps] You didn't?

627
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:25,063
-No!
-You totally did!

628
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,152
I know you did it
with phone sex guy!

629
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:30,633
I had a three-minute orgasm.

630
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:34,681
Three-minute orgasm!

631
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,379
Oh, my God!
That's so amazing!

632
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,424
Oh, my God.

633
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,339
[bell tolling]

634
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,081
[Claire] So, what's this whole
Marseilles thing all about?

635
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,518
It's nothing.
Just an opportunity to perform

636
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,520
and take home a shitload
of foreign money.

637
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,565
But I don't understand.
How come you turned it down?

638
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,177
Because I'm happy here.
I don't feel like taking

639
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,266
my whole godforsaken
existence off to France.

640
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,919
Yeah, that's good.

641
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,271
[chuckles] Excuse me?
Hello, this is me
you're talking to.

642
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,621
You've always wanted to
get back to performing.

643
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,580
[chuckles]
And aren't you the guy
that named your dog Mitterrand?

644
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,191
[both chuckle]

645
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,236
You practically
dream in French.

646
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,108
Yeah, well, that's why
they're dreams, huh?

647
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:16,244
[sighs]

648
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,768
Man, I used to come in here
and daydream for hours.

649
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,292
I know.

650
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,729
That's why I used to leave
the door unlocked for you.

651
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,515
You did?

652
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,561
Come on. We'll come back
to rehearse later.

653
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:33,522
Ah, forget Tchaikovsky.
Dead son of a bitch.

654
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,176
[Claire laughs]

655
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,180
[Claire] Okay, so why
do you guys always meet
at a hotel?

656
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,617
Oh, 'cause he's married.

657
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,793
Uh, you didn't tell me
this one was married.

658
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,144
Yeah. That's
the total best part.

659
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:48,363
How? How is that
the total best part?

660
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:51,149
Because so am I,
practically.

661
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,759
I mean, when Rudy
comes home next year,

662
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,761
I love him,
and then we'll probably
get engaged.

663
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:57,720
-Where are you going?
-Come on, Arthur!

664
00:35:57,851 --> 00:35:59,809
Well, emotionally,
I'm stable,

665
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,596
it's just,
physically I'm deficient.

666
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,293
It's like I need
a vitamin or something.

667
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:07,817
Just a little vitamin
from time to time.

668
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,646
How often do you
take your vitamin?

669
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,648
Not very often.

670
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:15,303
He spends a lot of time
with his family,
which I respect.

671
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,393
He has kids?

672
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,440
Yes. He has two.
One with
his first wife, Laura

673
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,659
and one with
his second wife, Mimi.

674
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,184
-So he was married before?
-He's still married.

675
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:29,274
So your new boyfriend's
a bigamist?

676
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:32,320
Well, I love Rudy,
and Carl's emotionally
invested elsewhere,

677
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:33,843
which leaves me
the only part I want...

678
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,932
his bellybutton,
where I can stick my--

679
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,412
[Claire] Are you
hearing yourself?

680
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,850
You're dating
a married bigamist.

681
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,852
Hey, do I judge
your fish man?

682
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,725
Okay, I'm outta here.

683
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:49,163
Hey, wait. Oh, no.
Don't tell me you're gonna
go see Bennett.

684
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,209
All he's gonna do
is nag, nag, nag!

685
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,384
[playing piano]

686
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,911
It's one breath.

687
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,830
You know, I feel like...

688
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,702
I feel like I'm in such
a great place right now.

689
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,704
I feel like I'm just
in charge of my life.

690
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:12,621
And it's great 'cause
I've let go of Jeremy,
you know?

691
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:14,319
Wow. It's amazing.

692
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,454
It really is.
I mean, hardly ever

693
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:21,978
do I stand outside
his window anymore,

694
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,329
hoping I'll just
bump into him.

695
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,722
Which is good.

696
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:27,897
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

697
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,815
The audition?
NYU? Tomorrow?

698
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:35,383
Oh, yeah.
Tough competition.

699
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,692
You're not concentrating.
Listen to me.

700
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:42,521
The judge, Mohammed,
hardly ever smiles.

701
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:45,524
Bad teeth.
Hit by an oboe.
Long story.

702
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,743
-I just don't want that
to throw you, okay?
-Okay.

703
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:50,616
Okay, how about
we take the final passage
once through.

704
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:52,400
One breath, okay?

705
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:06,936
You know, I feel really good
about this, so I'm...

706
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,851
So I'm all set.
I'll just see you tomorrow.

707
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,331
Okay. So, um,
let me guess.

708
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,290
You're running off
to Sabrina's.

709
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,509
You know, I swear
that girl is a vampire.

710
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,076
What?

711
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,120
You ever see
a picture of her?
How about a reflection?

712
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,861
She got that
little fangy thing.

713
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:21,299
[giggles] I'll see you later.

714
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,909
So, I'm standing there
in the doorway,

715
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,477
and I'm like, "Yes!
Of course I want
to marry you!"

716
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,957
-And I go, "Yes."
And he goes, "Yes what?"
-Oh!

717
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,482
We kind of realized
the romance was dead

718
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:33,311
when he started doing tricks
with his penis.

719
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,878
-[laughter]
-Guys, I once dated a guy

720
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,576
who had to talk to
his penis during sex.

721
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,404
What did he say?

722
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:41,449
"Come on, Pepe.
You can do it, Pepe."

723
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,538
-[whooping]
-[all laughing]

724
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:47,455
-[speaking indistinctly]
-Most of the time.

725
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,674
Pepe couldn't do it.

726
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,415
[all laughing]

727
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,942
[Claire] Marijuana
doesn't work on me.

728
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,422
It just doesn't work on me.

729
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:21,663
-Oh, my God!
I have to go home.
-[woman laughing]

730
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:24,362
-No! No!
-I have to go home! I do!

731
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,451
I have
an audition tomorrow.

732
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,644
[panting]

733
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:50,649
[exhales]

734
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,441
I told them you were
covering a class for me.

735
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,706
They just so happen to have
a second round tomorrow.

736
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,406
Do you think
you can make it?

737
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,066
[Claire] I'm not ready.

738
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:20,069
You're ready.
The piece is beautiful.

739
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,550
I'm rusty.
My hands are cold.

740
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,639
I have a...
I have a cramp
in my wrist.

741
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,901
I... I...

742
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,773
My hairstyle is old.

743
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:29,818
I haven't been practicing.

744
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,690
Really? I like your hair.

745
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,128
[both laughing]

746
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,391
Come on. You ready?

747
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,784
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

748
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,003
[both laughing]

749
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,056
[gasps]

750
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,149
Oh, Holy Mother Mary.

751
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:00,545
[gasps]

752
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,027
I just don't know
how comfortable I am

753
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:07,639
with this whole
Christmas vibe thing.

754
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,902
-Come on, it's just--
-No, it's cool.

755
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,601
-Claire!
-[Claire] Make me over, baby.

756
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,864
Head to toe.

757
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:19,172
[gasps] Jeremy's
dating somebody.

758
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,961
Oh, girl, it is time
to have some fun!
Let's go!

759
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,615
[hip-hop music playing]

760
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:32,490
[indistinct chatter]

761
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:45,764
So, who do you want
to dance with?

762
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,766
[both rapping]

763
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:54,642
So, who do you want
to come up to us?

764
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,035
Um...

765
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,821
Those two over there
are kind of cute.

766
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:00,779
At the table.

767
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:04,522
Okay.

768
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,803
[Claire] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,
they're coming over.

769
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,413
What did you do?

770
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,633
Okay, whatever you do,
do not leave my side,
all right?

771
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:29,547
Okay.

772
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:30,809
-Okay, promise.
-Uh-huh.

773
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:34,987
-Hey.
-Hey.

774
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:36,641
Hey.

775
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:37,903
Hey.

776
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,297
Do you want to dance?

777
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:44,562
Absolutely.

778
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,876
You know, my friend told me
I wouldn't have
a chance with you

779
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,966
since you remind us
of that sexy new girl
on <i>Baywatch.</i>

780
00:42:58,097 --> 00:43:01,753
You know,
the one with the pouty eyes
and smoldering lips.

781
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,711
You know, that can do
sign language underwater.

782
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,192
Um...

783
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:08,498
excuse me.

784
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:10,588
Oh, it's all right.
You want to dance?
No. Okay.

785
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:17,638
Okay. Okay.
When you see
somebody that you like,

786
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:19,205
you look at them,
then you look away.

787
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:20,554
Then you wait five seconds,
you look back

788
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:23,035
and you think...
anything, okay?

789
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,689
Be like Mona.

790
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,692
Okay, so I look at them,
I look away,

791
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:28,823
I look back at them...

792
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,609
-Be like Mona.
-Like Mona, okay.

793
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,654
[rapping]

794
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:47,815
[thuds]

795
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,036
Is that a pretzel
in her hair?

796
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,255
Claire, sweetheart,
you have to eat something.

797
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:56,868
You cannot stay up all night
and then not eat anything.

798
00:44:56,998 --> 00:45:00,175
You're gonna
wind up anorexic
like Wilma Rizucchi.

799
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,221
She got so skinny,
her mother wanted

800
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,918
to send her to Italy
to fatten her up,

801
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,833
but she stayed in New York
and she became a model.

802
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,183
True story. Bernie,
bring me some dry toast.

803
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:11,056
Bernie? Bernie?

804
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:12,405
Bernie,
what are you looking at?

805
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,016
Great-aunt Wanda.
She had beautiful hair.

806
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,197
What is he talking about?
Aunt Wanda's been dead
for 12 years.

807
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:23,808
He's going out of his mind.

808
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:26,332
Oh, no. It's just
a mid-life crisis.

809
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:29,988
My Maury, rest his soul,
went through the same thing.

810
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:32,686
Every morning,
he'd touch his bald spot

811
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,122
and relive the moment

812
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:37,691
that he sang with
The Andrews Sisters.

813
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:40,694
Didn't touch me
for six months.

814
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:43,349
Ma, that's too much
information.

815
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:46,874
[Claire] Hey,
can I ask you something?

816
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:48,223
Sure.

817
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:53,881
Do you ever wonder
whether Barry's the one?

818
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,449
You know?
If you're doing
the right thing?

819
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,191
No. Not really.

820
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,976
Well, once, maybe.

821
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:07,373
Early on, when we were,
um, dating,

822
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:11,943
we were meeting
some friends at that, uh...
That gay bar on 12th,

823
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:15,990
and... [chuckles]
the bartender knew
what Barry drank

824
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,036
before he ordered.

825
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:22,257
Wh... What are you saying?
You think that Barry's gay?

826
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:26,392
No. No, that he drinks.

827
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,961
I don't want to
raise children in a house
with alcohol,

828
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:34,008
so we, we talked it over
and... and he agreed
with me.

829
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:35,314
It's all
about communication.

830
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:42,016
Now why do people complain
about bridesmaids' dresses?

831
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:44,410
You look like a blooming
wildflower of the desert.

832
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,500
-Right over here!
Perfect! Perfect!
-[buzzer sounds]

833
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,850
Oh, it's him!
I can't believe you guys

834
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:51,547
are finally getting
to meet Carl!

835
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:54,246
You're gonna love him.
Come in!

836
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:57,031
Ah, I have this
amazing ability
to keep things separate.

837
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:59,773
It's like I can
compartmentalize my men.

838
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:00,992
-[chuckles]
-Compartmentalize?

839
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:03,255
So, like, Rudy's in
the love compartment

840
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,909
and Carl's in
the sex compartment?

841
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,041
Yes. Separate but equal.

842
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,303
How do I look?

843
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:10,044
-You look amazing.
-Ah!

844
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:14,048
-[dance music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

845
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,190
<i>Enchante,</i>darling!

846
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,018
Hey, darling!

847
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:30,412
<i>C'est si bon,</i>darling.
How's it going?

848
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,327
I feel ridiculous
in this getup.

849
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,026
What? You look so hot!

850
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:38,986
-Really?
-Mmm. Only the most
wicked guy at the party

851
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,074
is looking at you right now.

852
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,033
-Where?
-Three o'clock.

853
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,167
[Sabrina] Oh, my God.
He's coming over.

854
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:47,952
You are running the show.

855
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:50,563
Have a chip.

856
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,307
Tonight you're Mona, baby.

857
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,919
[sighs] I'm Mona, baby.

858
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,882
-[man] Hi.
-Hey.

859
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:09,190
How's the, uh, guacamole?

860
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:12,063
I've had better.

861
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,983
-[man] Big time!
-[all cheering]

862
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:21,159
I'm not saying that
"exogamy" isn't a word,

863
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,856
I'm just saying that
you spelled it with a "J."

864
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,206
[clears throat] Fine.
You...

865
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,034
Great. Your luck prevails.

866
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,341
Congratulations.

867
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,910
Okay. I get it.

868
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:34,999
Get what?
What's there to get?

869
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:37,479
You're just angry because
you're some genius

870
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,134
with an enormous IQ,
and I'm just a cheerleader...

871
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:42,571
Whatever.

872
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:45,183
...who wins every game.

873
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,011
As if I take these games

874
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,578
as anything more than
a minor amusement.

875
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:52,364
Arthur, I think that
you and I both know

876
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:55,323
that we've been contemplating
a lot more than <i>Scrabble.</i>

877
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,543
Uh, I don't...

878
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:01,503
I really... I don't...
[laughs nervously]

879
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,288
I don't know what
you're talking about.

880
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,245
[scoffs]

881
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:10,382
Idiot.

882
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:12,950
[all cheering]

883
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:20,000
He's gonna call.

884
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:22,655
Any minute now.

885
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,092
Let's just say...

886
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:27,355
I'm an equal
opportunity employer.

887
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:31,403
What do you mean?

888
00:49:32,317 --> 00:49:33,361
Women?

889
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,321
Occasionally.

890
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,323
For spice.

891
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:41,674
[Arthur] I had
this other dream...

892
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:43,241
We're running
towards each other

893
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:45,112
on this white sandy beach

894
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:47,462
and the kiss lasts
for hours, man.

895
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,290
Then we break away
and I open my eyes

896
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,989
and she's Gidget
and I'm Stephen Hawking.

897
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,643
It'll never work, Sheldon.

898
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:56,428
She's a...
a cheerleader.

899
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,256
The girl is a leader
of cheers.

900
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:00,693
No, it'll totally
work, man.

901
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:02,564
Just shut up
and kiss her!

902
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,305
You want Goldfish?

903
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:05,698
Get away from me.

904
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:08,222
But have any of you
ever had

905
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,747
two women on a tractor?

906
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:14,141
[Arthur] Tell me why again.

907
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:17,318
I don't think that
I can compartmentalize.

908
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:19,233
-[sighs]
-What does that mean?

909
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:22,062
-I have to break up with Rudy.
-Hmm.

910
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:24,064
I think I love Carl.

911
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,241
Oh.

912
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:29,069
We are so great together.

913
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,333
What do men want?
[sighs]

914
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:34,422
My girlfriend, Ashley,
she's right over there

915
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:35,989
-at the poker table.
-Mmm.

916
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,209
She is really into threeways.

917
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,428
We could use a back bedroom.

918
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,388
Uh...

919
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,522
I... [stutters]

920
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:50,047
I have no idea what Mona
would do right now.

921
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,669
[Sheila] You did what?

922
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,714
You heard me,
I quit my job.

923
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:08,369
Why do you make me
repeat myself

924
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,285
over and over
when you heard me
the first time?

925
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,679
But, that's crazy.

926
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:17,248
I mean, you and Morty
have been partners
for 25 years.

927
00:51:17,378 --> 00:51:19,032
You just go in there right now
and call him.

928
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,642
I'm sure he'll take you back.

929
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:22,818
Sheila, I have to
talk with you.

930
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,472
Now is as good
a time as any.

931
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:27,214
What makes you think
now is a good time?

932
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:29,216
The Harpers have influenza.

933
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:31,305
Half the guests
are lactose-intolerant.

934
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:32,741
And on top
of everything else,

935
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,830
I've got company coming
for dinner tomorrow night.

936
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:36,397
Those freaking recipes
aren't working.

937
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:38,617
And all I've got
is a pot full of soggy kishkas.

938
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,366
So what's going on
with you and Dad?

939
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,194
[sighs]

940
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,717
You know,
when you were 11 years old,

941
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:54,415
you used to fall asleep
at the piano.

942
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:57,505
The only person
I've ever known that
had that much passion

943
00:51:57,636 --> 00:52:00,117
was Uncle Max Raymond.

944
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,120
He started in burlesque
at the Minsky Theatre
in Newark, New Jersey.

945
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,339
Went right all the way
to Las Vegas.

946
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,429
Almost went on tour with
Sammy Davis Jr., but he...

947
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,867
He drank too much,
and he ended up an organ
grinder on 43rd Street,

948
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:15,262
shot by a Jewish gangster.
True story.

949
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,438
Why don't you just
write down all these stories
of yours somewhere.

950
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

951
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:20,876
Don't try to
change the subject.

952
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:22,661
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

953
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,750
You know what?
I'm not going to become
an organ grinder, okay?

954
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,534
-It's not going to happen.
-Uh-huh.

955
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:27,796
I'm just having
a little fun, that's all.

956
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:29,146
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:31,278
You do realize
you're dressed like a hooker.

958
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,759
You know what?

959
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,804
This isn't a hooker outfit,
this is a showgirl outfit.

960
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:38,285
There's actually
quite a distinct difference.

961
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:40,157
Uh-huh.

962
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,897
[Claire] What do you mean
you want to meet my family?

963
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,421
Just that,
I wanna meet 'em.

964
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:47,164
-I want them to know me,
love me, embrace me.
-[laughs]

965
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:50,471
But my mom is
experimenting with
this food you can't chew.

966
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:53,735
My dad's obsessing
over some dead aunt, and...

967
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:57,348
-[snorts]
-My sister's gonna
coordinate your socks

968
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:00,481
to match her wedding palette.
Coral and bisque.

969
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:03,615
-[chuckling]
-How's next Friday?

970
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:06,487
What? What's so wrong?
I want 'em to know

971
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,272
that I'm not one
of these guys
at your parties.

972
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:10,491
Oh, come on.
Give me your best pickup line.

973
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,841
-No. I'm not like that.
-[laughs]

974
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:14,626
I mean, Nora,
the last girl that I dated,

975
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,323
-we were like almost--
-I thought you said
her name was Marla.

976
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,326
It is Marla.

977
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:21,676
It is Marla.
Nora's the girl
I just hired.

978
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,812
I'm sorry, I got, like,
a Swiss cheese brain
for, like, names and dates,

979
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,422
and it's like...
[whooshes]

980
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:30,946
Marla's the last girl
I dated, and...

981
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:33,819
-Yeah, well,
we almost got married.
-Hmm.

982
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,516
And my mom
is yelling at me,

983
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:38,171
"She left you.
Now you'll never get married.

984
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,781
You're gonna live
and die alone,

985
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:41,435
like a lizard in the desert."

986
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:44,308
-[chuckling]
-I was like, "Yeah."

987
00:53:44,438 --> 00:53:46,832
Good old Mom.
She was a cheerful woman.

988
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:48,268
Was?

989
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,531
Yeah.

990
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:53,578
-Yeah, she died last year.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

991
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:55,362
Yeah.

992
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:57,538
Well, she kinda
drove me nuts.

993
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:00,324
[chuckles] No.

994
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,891
I... I mean, I wish
she was still around.

995
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,372
Then I'd bring you home
for dinner.

996
00:54:05,503 --> 00:54:07,809
I'd be like, "See, Ma,
I can do something right."

997
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,550
[slow song playing]

998
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,342
Do you wanna
walk through the park?

999
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,345
Yeah.

1000
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,892
[music distorts]

1001
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,720
[Claire] <i>And then</i><i>
he touched my breasts.</i>

1002
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,678
I let another man
touch my breasts.

1003
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:53,290
What... What was I thinking?
What am I doing?

1004
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,466
You're moving on, Claire.

1005
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,946
Oh, my God.
That is exactly
what I'm doing.

1006
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,296
I'm moving on.
That's it.

1007
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:00,949
I mean...
I mean, actually, I...

1008
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,300
I hardly even think about
that kiss anymore.

1009
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,432
That kiss that's
tattooed in my brain,

1010
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,608
where Jeremy's shoving
his tongue down her throat.

1011
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,045
Claire, I've got
a class to teach.

1012
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:11,786
Bennett, please.
I'm really sorry.

1013
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,048
I screwed up big time.

1014
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:14,093
I... I should've walked
through that door.

1015
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:15,660
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1016
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,315
I was in shock.
[stammering]
That was really stupid.

1017
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:20,969
I screwed up badly.
I'm really sorry. Please?

1018
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:24,669
Bibi's in town.

1019
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,410
She's on the committee
for the Liszt Competition,

1020
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,889
and she asked about you.

1021
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,892
[inhales] I'll know by 8:00
if I got you an audition.

1022
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:34,026
-I'll let you know.
-Thank you. Thank you.

1023
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:37,508
But, Claire,
this is the last rabbit
I'm pulling out of the hat.

1024
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,336
So, please don't screw it up.

1025
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:46,038
So, Claire tells us
you've been to Bosnia.

1026
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:48,040
Yes, I was in the Peace Corps.

1027
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,824
And that you
never went to college,

1028
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:52,479
you weep at operas,
and that you own
a chain of fish markets.

1029
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,438
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh, my God.

1030
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:03,360
Uh, we also have a fine

01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:12,969
[Bennett] Jesus, Claire.

1197
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:18,235
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm so, so sorry.

1198
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:20,367
-I'm so sorry about--
-Don't.

1199
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:23,457
Just save it
for somebody else, okay?

1200
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:25,677
'Cause I just
need to congratulate you

1201
01:06:25,807 --> 01:06:28,593
'cause you had us
all fooled.

1202
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:30,203
I really thought
you knew what you wanted.

1203
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,162
I thought you'd
do anything.

1204
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:34,338
Well, anything. I guess
I was right about that.

1205
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:36,731
She mentioned Jeremy,
and I... I was not prepared--

1206
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:39,299
To hell with Jeremy.
I don't care about Jeremy.

1207
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,563
How long are you gonna
hide behind Jeremy?

1208
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:44,391
It's not about Jeremy.

1209
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:46,089
I would've done
anything for you, Claire.

1210
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:48,482
I'm through with you, okay?

1211
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:50,223
That's it.

1212
01:06:56,273 --> 01:06:58,014
Why don't you
take your pants off, baby?

1213
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:03,193
[Barry] Oh, the house has
five walk-in closets.

1214
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:06,152
-Yeah. Four for Jenine,
one for me.
-No, stop.

1215
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:07,806
-Excuse us for one second.
-[chuckles]

1216
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:10,461
Honey, I want to...
I want to talk to you
about something.

1217
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,290
-Now, let's say we go with
the peach tablecloths, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

1218
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,248
-We add the soft heather
as an accent...
-Yeah.

1219
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:18,338
The multi-colored hydrangea
just might work.

1220
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:20,688
-Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
-See?

1221
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,778
Oh. Oh, it is
all going so well.

1222
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:25,519
-They're eating everything.
-[giggles]

1223
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:29,175
-Connie, honey.
-Claire.

1224
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,134
Oh. Oh, whatever.

1225
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:35,094
Anyway,
now that I got
to really look at you...

1226
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:38,445
You never really
did grow breasts, did you?

1227
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,666
-[woman] Oh, Velva.
-What did I say that was wrong?

1228
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,711
-It's the truth.
-Honey, really?

1229
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,540
-It's a mushroom.
-[chuckles]
I don't think so, man.

1230
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:48,281
No, trust me on this one.

1231
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:49,804
Look. Hey, don't stress.

1232
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:52,155
-I'll hook you up. I got--
-Look, don't...

1233
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:55,201
Oh. Your coat smells
like a dead horse.

1234
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:58,161
Go put it upstairs,
or burn it, or somethin'.

1235
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:02,121
Honey, at my age,
I'll take the soup.

1236
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:03,688
-[all laughing]
-[knocking at door]

1237
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,081
I'll get it.

1238
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:06,386
[accordion playing]

1239
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:22,533
Oh, wow.
Somebody sure loves pink.

1240
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:24,143
Coral.

1241
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:25,536
They call it coral.

1242
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:35,372
You really hurt her,
you know?

1243
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:38,114
As if you've been anything
but a fog on her brain.

1244
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:40,377
Oh, please.
I've been nothing
but a breath of fresh air

1245
01:08:40,507 --> 01:08:42,030
for that girl.

1246
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,207
She was so locked up,
she needed a key
just to take a piss.

1247
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:45,686
You know, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

1248
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:47,514
You have no idea
of the chances she had.

1249
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:49,603
[doorbell rings]

1250
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,434
Hey. Oh, thank you.

1251
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,655
-You look perfect.
-Aw. [chuckles]

1252
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,316
-[chuckles nervously]
-I love this suit.
Wow, look at you.

1253
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,274
-Oh, yeah. You, too.
-[chuckles]

1254
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,150
[exhales]

1255
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:18,545
Hi!

1256
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:21,505
-Hi. Hello.
-I'm Velva.

1257
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:24,899
You know, I buy salmon
in your store
every other Thursday.

1258
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,641
-Oh, good, good.
-Sometimes it's a little dry.

1259
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,557
Is there a bathroom upstairs?

1260
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,472
-Yeah.
-I have to use the facilities.

1261
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:33,691
I'll be right back.

1262
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,475
-I'll see you later.
-Oh, yes, you will.

1263
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:37,347
Oh, he's gorgeous.

1264
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,831
-Okay, now don't drink
too much champagne.
-All right. All right.

1265
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,572
-It makes you gassy.
-Go, go, go.

1266
01:09:47,748 --> 01:09:49,185
-Hey, Claire.
-Hey.

1267
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,807
Claire, look.

1268
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,504
I've known you
a really long time.

1269
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:07,333
I know how rare
your talent is.

1270
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,857
But I'd be the first one
to admit that it's not easy.

1271
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:12,860
Not everyone's
cut out for it.

1272
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,688
You're saying
I'm not cut out for it?

1273
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,691
I've been busting my ass
for this since I was
seven years old.

1274
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:19,432
Fine.

1275
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:22,348
You know that.

1276
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,222
What I know is it gets
really tiring hearing about
your potential.

1277
01:10:26,352 --> 01:10:28,702
Sooner or later,
you gotta deliver the goods.

1278
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:32,184
But you'd rather be
off playing Sabrina's
drunken orgy girl

1279
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:33,403
than starting a career.

1280
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,318
Is that what
I'd rather be doing?

1281
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,364
Maybe you should start
taking a little responsibility
for your own life

1282
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:40,192
-and stop telling me
what's best for mine.
-Me?

1283
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,238
-Yeah.
-[scoffs] Fine. Just fine.

1284
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,589
You know, at least
I am trying.

1285
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,982
At least I'm not stupid enough
to throw away my own dreams

1286
01:10:48,113 --> 01:10:49,419
and then hide behind
one of my students.

1287
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:54,250
Oh, well, isn't that sweet.
Well, thank you very much.

1288
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,817
But how the hell
could anyone

1289
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:59,603
hide behind
a misguided 23-year-old

1290
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:01,387
who can't even
get through an audition?

1291
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,262
Well, I think
that calls for a cocktail.

1292
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,745
Claire, would you just be
the best maid of honor

1293
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,225
and model the dress
for Alexa?

1294
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,835
It's just impossible
to describe

1295
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,882
that rose-lined
v-scoop neck, you know,
without it on.

1296
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:21,799
Don't forget the headpiece.

1297
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:23,409
What's wrong with her?

1298
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,715
Oh, what's not wrong with her?

1299
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:32,418
I'm not cut out for it.

1300
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:35,291
Oh, this is good.
I've become one of those
soap opera characters

1301
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:36,683
that talks to themselves
all the time.

1302
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:38,294
[sighs]

1303
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:43,734
[accordion continues playing]

1304
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:58,401
Oh!

1305
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:03,710
[Barry chuckles]

1306
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:07,671
-Uh, Bennett.
-Bo. [chuckles]

1307
01:12:08,585 --> 01:12:09,499
Hey.

1308
01:12:11,675 --> 01:12:14,460
"Congratulations,
Jenine and Barry."

1309
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,334
-Oh, my God.
-I'm...

1310
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:23,339
Uh, no. Alice, you don't
put the horseradish

1311
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:25,384
directly on
the gefilte fish.

1312
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:27,821
[scoffs] Yes, you do.
It's a garnish.

1313
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,997
Yes, which means to,
uh, accompany,

1314
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:34,567
to enhance the natural flavor
of the fish, not to smother.

1315
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:37,353
You obviously know
very little about Jewish food.

1316
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:42,488
So...

1317
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:46,057
where's that husband
of yours?

1318
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,540
-Excuse me.
-Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:12:53,978 --> 01:12:55,806
I was about to
put on my suit.

1320
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:58,330
You're smoking?

1321
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,680
You haven't smoked
for 20 years.

1322
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:02,726
Honey, what are you doing?

1323
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:05,076
What's going on with you?

1324
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:07,557
We've got a house
full of people.

1325
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:09,123
Christ! Claire?

1326
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:10,951
Claire?

1327
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:13,345
Jenine?

1328
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,608
-You and Jenine?
-I don't... Shh.

1329
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,567
Just keep your voice down.

1330
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:19,743
Okay? Please. Please.

1331
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:23,573
I was gonna call you.

1332
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,575
Hang on. Just hang on.

1333
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:44,985
-Did I say something wrong?
-Forget it.

1334
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:47,161
No point in talkin' about
what's really up your craw.

1335
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,163
You wanna know
what's really up my craw?

1336
01:13:50,817 --> 01:13:51,775
Yeah.

1337
01:13:52,602 --> 01:13:53,777
Yeah, lay it on me.

1338
01:13:54,865 --> 01:13:56,780
-Look at you.
-[chuckles]

1339
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:58,782
You cut your hair.

1340
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:00,914
You haven't used
the name Barry in years.

1341
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:03,177
You know, "Bo..."

1342
01:14:03,308 --> 01:14:05,441
It's not very fitting
for a dental practice.

1343
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:09,445
You know, uh...

1344
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:11,751
you look good.

1345
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:13,927
You know, uh,
I took up racquetball.

1346
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:19,890
-I think I've been visited.
-Visited?

1347
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,021
By whom?

1348
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:22,806
The spirits.

1349
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:26,113
Oh, good.
Oh, this is constructive.

1350
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:27,593
Will you please
just get dressed

1351
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:29,116
and put on some clothes
and come downstairs?

1352
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,205
Oh, never mind.
I didn't want to
talk about it anyway.

1353
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:38,474
[Sabrina]
She thinks that you own
this chain of fish markets.

1354
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,476
[chuckles]

1355
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,825
Technically,
my brother's the owner.

1356
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:44,915
I'm a sales rep
for Nieman Marcus.

1357
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:49,615
Oh, so you're
not even a lawyer.

1358
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,225
Carl? Eddie?

1359
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:52,662
No.

1360
01:14:56,013 --> 01:14:57,536
What the hell
is your name, anyway?

1361
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,146
Ben.

1362
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:00,626
[indistinct chatter]

1363
01:15:04,151 --> 01:15:06,980
It would be so much easier
to talk to you if you
just stop smiling at me.

1364
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:08,939
What do you
want me to do, Arthur?

1365
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:11,724
You want me to
walk around, sulking?
Would that make you happy?

1366
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:14,161
Yes, at least
that would be honest.

1367
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,034
Has it ever occurred to you
that not everyone is depressed?

1368
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:20,603
I think that not everyone
admits that they're depressed.

1369
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:27,523
[upbeat music playing]

1370
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:41,667
Ow! Ow!

1371
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:43,669
Ow.

1372
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:48,979
But a couple of weeks ago,
I had a minor heart problem.

1373
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:50,546
A heart problem?

1374
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:52,722
I was at Morty's,
he took me to the doctor's,

1375
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:54,767
but everything was okay,
so they sent me home.

1376
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:58,641
Anyway, I was driving home,
and all of a sudden

1377
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:00,643
-I couldn't breathe.
-Oh, God.

1378
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:02,209
I had a little heart attack.

1379
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,689
-Oh, my God...
-Let me finish.

1380
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,083
-Is it a heart problem?
-Let me finish.

1381
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:08,781
So, I was having
a problem breathing,
and I pulled the car over

1382
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:10,609
and I laid down
in the back seat.

1383
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,133
And that's when I started
to see this

1384
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:16,136
white hot indigo light.

1385
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:19,226
I saw this winding path,

1386
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:24,710
and at the end,
the face of Aunt Wanda.

1387
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:29,149
My God! That is exactly
what happened
to Shirley MacLaine.

1388
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,718
I want you to know that
I thought about you a lot.

1389
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:34,067
You should have called.

1390
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:39,072
Bo, why are you doing this?

1391
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:41,031
You know why.

1392
01:16:42,162 --> 01:16:43,816
People don't go
to gay dentists,

1393
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,601
and mothers don't go
to gay weddings.

1394
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:52,782
[door opens]

1395
01:16:57,003 --> 01:16:57,917
Oh...

1396
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:01,747
Honey... hi. Hi.

1397
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:03,096
Um...

1398
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:05,925
Did you know that Bennett and I
know each other?

1399
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:09,755
[all singing "Hava Nagila"]

1400
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:15,369
You live in a sad world,
Arthur Capp.

1401
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,635
And I suppose
your world is just
so much more fulfilling

1402
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:23,682
with all that "ra-ra"
shake my boobs,
"Go, Raiders, go" bullshit?

1403
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:26,816
I'll have you know
that as a Raiderette,

1404
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:30,820
I choreograph, practice, and
prepare gymnastics routines

1405
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,648
-from eight to ten
hours a day...
-[thud]

1406
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:37,304
...which is more than I can say
for jerking off
in the storage room,

1407
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:40,177
and then crying
myself to sleep
with Camus every night.

1408
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:42,788
I don't read Camus...

1409
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:43,833
every night.

1410
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,924
[Alice moaning loudly]

1411
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:53,712
-[cutlery clattering]
-[muffled] Arthur!

1412
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:01,807
[singing continues]

1413
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:21,697
I'm gonna tell her
what scum she's been dating.

1414
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:24,656
Look. Okay, wait, I know
that I don't have the right
to ask you for anything,

1415
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:25,918
but for Claire, okay?

1416
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:28,312
I mean, you don't
want her to be...

1417
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:30,706
humiliated in front of
her whole family.

1418
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:33,709
Right?

1419
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:36,189
Okay, honey, just think
about this. It's not
what it looks like, okay?

1420
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,713
It's...

1421
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:39,279
We've been friends
for a long time...

1422
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,672
My party's ruined.

1423
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,805
-You ruined my party.
-[stutters]

1424
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:45,198
You saw the white light, right?

1425
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:48,854
And then you left your body,
and you saw
some dead relatives?

1426
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,247
Yeah. Yeah.

1427
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:52,379
It's a classic
out-of-body experience.

1428
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,078
I just wanted to tell you
that you're really special
to me, okay?

1429
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,949
You're really...

1430
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,429
You're so special to me.

1431
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:02,215
Your hands
aren't that great.

1432
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:03,477
-[thud]
-[groans]

1433
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,176
What was that?

1434
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:08,831
I will give you one day
with Claire to break it off,

1435
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,137
and if you're not
out of our lives in two days,

1436
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:13,226
first I will
tell her everything,

1437
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,098
then I will bite off
what's left of your penis.

1438
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:16,316
[groaning]

1439
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:17,796
[coughing]

1440
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:30,722
[gasps]

1441
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,855
What happened to her?

1442
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:35,553
She used to be
such a nice girl.

1443
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:38,121
[exhales]

1444
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:55,791
Thank you.

1445
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:02,885
We Goldsteins certainly know
how to give a party, huh?

1446
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:06,497
I was remembering this day,

1447
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,761
you were seven years old.

1448
01:20:09,892 --> 01:20:11,502
It was your
second competition,

1449
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:14,461
and Mom bought you
this very shiny,

1450
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,899
-slippery pair of shoes.
-Oh, yeah.

1451
01:20:17,029 --> 01:20:20,990
The brand-new
black patent leather
with the big silver bows?

1452
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,210
And as you walked
on the stage
toward the piano,

1453
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:27,083
you fell splat
right on your back,

1454
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:29,825
and the whole audience gasped.

1455
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,436
The other kids giggled,
and Mom was about to
run on stage

1456
01:20:32,566 --> 01:20:34,133
and take you home,
and you...

1457
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,266
very calmly

1458
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:38,311
picked yourself up,

1459
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,881
took a breath,
walked to the piano,

1460
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:46,145
and played so beautifully.

1461
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,495
Like an angel.

1462
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:51,324
And you won first prize.

1463
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:54,371
Later on, we were sitting
right here, sipping cocoa,

1464
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:57,374
and we talked about
what it felt like to fall
splat on your back

1465
01:20:57,504 --> 01:20:59,855
in front of the whole audience.
And you know what you said?

1466
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:02,335
You said, "Yes.

1467
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:06,905
But something
really great happened

1468
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,386
right after splat."

1469
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:15,871
[Claire playing the piano]

1470
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:33,976
[Bernie] Should we keep
the rest of the cake?

1471
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,891
[Sheila] You know,
why don't you wrap it
and put it in the fridge?

1472
01:21:38,328 --> 01:21:39,242
The dishes.

1473
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:46,205
Oh, nobody ate the mushrooms.

1474
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,381
Oh, is it good?

1475
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:52,385
Mmm.

1476
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:54,910
It tastes a little strange.
Here, try some.

1477
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:12,536
Do you realize we've been
staring at this tablecloth
for a very long time?

1478
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:14,451
Yeah.

1479
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:18,020
So, what are you saying?

1480
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,153
I'm saying I never knew
this was so interesting.

1481
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:22,633
[echoing]

1482
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:25,941
My teeth are sweating.

1483
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,379
I'm definitely seeing things.

1484
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:33,426
Oh, my God.

1485
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:36,255
Oh, my God!

1486
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:38,040
Look at this.

1487
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:44,437
Bernie, there's a giant
can opener in the ceiling.

1488
01:22:44,568 --> 01:22:45,961
I better get a bucket.

1489
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:47,440
A bucket from Nantucket?

1490
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:49,268
Nantucket...

1491
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:50,443
[distorted echoing]

1492
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:52,228
I love saying that word.

1493
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,623
Manny.

1494
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:59,235
-The hair.
-Sabrina's druggie friend.

1495
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:01,150
We gotta get
our stomachs pumped.

1496
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,108
-Please, let's go get
our stomachs pumped.
-No, no. No, Sheila...

1497
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,632
Sheila, we never went to Egypt,

1498
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:08,287
we never drank water
in Mexico,

1499
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,551
we never burnt our bras,
we never protested Vietnam.

1500
01:23:11,682 --> 01:23:13,597
We never even went to see
The Rolling Stones

1501
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:15,991
because we were afraid
to go into a bad neighborhood.

1502
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:18,210
Oh, he...

1503
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,691
he must have...

1504
01:23:20,821 --> 01:23:23,999
-The mushrooms.
-...he must have...

1505
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:27,045
I say we enjoy it.

1506
01:23:59,469 --> 01:24:01,166
[snickers]

1507
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:04,517
Outta all the gin joints
in the world,
you had to pick this one.

1508
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:09,435
You going somewhere?

1509
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:11,481
Well, how's this
for romantic?

1510
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:14,092
A midnight plane
to Marseille.

1511
01:24:14,223 --> 01:24:15,137
-[thuds]
-[chuckles]

1512
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:21,578
[both chuckle]

1513
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:26,191
Oh, I can't believe I wasted
the last three years
kicking myself...

1514
01:24:26,322 --> 01:24:28,324
[sighs] wondering what
I did wrong with Bo.

1515
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:29,542
[chuckles]

1516
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:31,109
Marrying your sister...

1517
01:24:32,415 --> 01:24:33,677
is punishment enough,
don't you think?

1518
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:35,113
[both laughing]

1519
01:24:37,637 --> 01:24:39,465
They're moving
and I'm moving with them,

1520
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,554
-but where am I going?
-[Sheila laughing]

1521
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:43,208
Sit down... [laughing]

1522
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:47,386
I love this floor.

1523
01:24:47,517 --> 01:24:48,735
[Sheila talking incoherently]

1524
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:52,174
[talking incoherently]

1525
01:24:56,526 --> 01:25:00,356
I feel just like
Fred Astaire,
so light and airy.

1526
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:03,750
Oh, Bernie, look.
Look, there's a fish
in the carpet.

1527
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:07,102
Oi. One fish,
two fish, red fish...

1528
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:09,147
-Red fish? [laughing]
-Gefilte fish.

1529
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,592
-There is one thing
I have to ask you.
-What?

1530
01:25:20,593 --> 01:25:21,812
Why did you lie?

1531
01:25:22,943 --> 01:25:25,337
About the Tchaikovsky
Competition.

1532
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:30,690
Honey, you left the letter
on your mirror.

1533
01:25:31,735 --> 01:25:33,215
I read it at the party.

1534
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,218
You got it!

1535
01:25:37,654 --> 01:25:38,394
Why'd you lie?

1536
01:25:38,524 --> 01:25:39,525
[Claire sighs]

1537
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:42,137
[snickers] I don't know.

1538
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:45,618
Jeremy didn't get in.

1539
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:49,796
No one did. I guess I...

1540
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,844
I guess I was afraid
that I couldn't pull it off.

1541
01:25:54,975 --> 01:25:57,369
You know, I once heard
someone say...

1542
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:03,636
"When you dim your light
so someone else can shine,

1543
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,335
the whole world
gets darker."

1544
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:14,952
I'm gonna miss you.

1545
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:18,260
[Bennett patting] Okay.

1546
01:26:22,002 --> 01:26:24,266
It's not too late.

1547
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:26,442
The semi-finals
are this Friday.

1548
01:26:28,444 --> 01:26:29,967
[piano music]

1549
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:45,504
[Bernie] <i>Remember our wedding?</i>

1550
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:46,897
[Sheila] <i>Your father</i><i>
came up to me and he said,</i>

1551
01:26:47,027 --> 01:26:49,378
"You look like a shiksa."

1552
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:50,857
Because your hair
was so red.

1553
01:26:50,988 --> 01:26:53,251
I even remember
how you wore it.

1554
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:55,775
You had it up,
and to the side.

1555
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,648
Bernie...

1556
01:27:00,998 --> 01:27:02,217
tell me
what the doctor said.

1557
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:05,263
Tell me the truth.

1558
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:07,222
Did I tell you
I burnt the office down?

1559
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:09,354
Bernie...

1560
01:27:10,312 --> 01:27:11,356
what did he say?

1561
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:18,929
Oh, I've been so busy
worrying about the florist
and the caterers, and...

1562
01:27:19,059 --> 01:27:22,715
Claire,
and the soggy kishkas,

1563
01:27:22,846 --> 01:27:25,283
I didn't once notice
what was happening with you.

1564
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:31,246
I couldn't live without you.
I really couldn't, Bernie.

1565
01:27:33,857 --> 01:27:37,252
Remember how Grandpa Alvie
left Grandma Bitburg

1566
01:27:37,382 --> 01:27:39,341
with three kids to raise
and a butcher shop to run?

1567
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:41,081
Oh.

1568
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:45,216
She said, "A woman's life
is like a plate of spaghetti.

1569
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:49,002
A man,
he's just a meatball.

1570
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:52,484
Does a meatball make
a spaghetti taste better?

1571
01:27:52,615 --> 01:27:53,572
Yeah.

1572
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:55,313
Do you need the meatball?

1573
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:57,402
No."

1574
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:59,839
That is such a stupid story.

1575
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:01,754
I'm nothing without you.

1576
01:28:01,885 --> 01:28:05,541
Sheila, you and I both know

1577
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:08,326
you're a whole world
all by yourself.

1578
01:28:08,457 --> 01:28:09,893
Oh, I don't know.

1579
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:20,730
It's a beautiful night.

1580
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,906
Wanna look at the stars?

1581
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:25,300
And then we could
maybe make love...

1582
01:28:26,475 --> 01:28:27,389
outside.

1583
01:28:27,867 --> 01:28:28,999
Like we used to.

1584
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:30,479
Yes.

1585
01:28:30,914 --> 01:28:32,045
[whispers] Yes.

1586
01:28:36,789 --> 01:28:39,662
[Claire] The possibility
of failure in the world
of a classical musician

1587
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,794
is so much higher
than in any other field.

1588
01:28:41,925 --> 01:28:44,667
And if I did fail,
I have no idea in the world
what I would do.

1589
01:28:44,797 --> 01:28:46,451
[Sabrina chuckles]

1590
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:49,454
Claire, you've been
playing piano since
you were five years old.

1591
01:28:49,585 --> 01:28:51,456
Glued to the bench. I...

1592
01:28:51,587 --> 01:28:53,806
I remember, you would play
when things were good,

1593
01:28:53,937 --> 01:28:55,852
you'd play
when things were bad.

1594
01:28:55,982 --> 01:28:58,507
-I don't think not playing
is an option for you.
-[chuckles]

1595
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:00,987
Yeah, but I've always had
everyone around me.

1596
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:04,426
I don't know
if I could do it,
you know, all by myself.

1597
01:29:04,817 --> 01:29:06,558
Leap...

1598
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:08,517
the net will follow.

1599
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:10,519
[both chuckle]

1600
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,911
Okay, Manny.

1601
01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:14,523
Have some more.

1602
01:29:14,653 --> 01:29:16,351
He's a freak.
Where did you find him?

1603
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:17,961
He doesn't count
as a guy, does he?

1604
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:30,974
Hey.

1605
01:29:31,104 --> 01:29:32,845
-Hey.
-Hello.

1606
01:29:32,976 --> 01:29:36,109
Wow, you look perfect.

1607
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,068
How do you...
I love the way
your hair curls up

1608
01:29:38,198 --> 01:29:39,939
into your face like that.

1609
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:42,420
Listen, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

1610
01:29:43,726 --> 01:29:44,553
Oh.

1611
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,774
I think you're wonderful,
and I really like you a lot,

1612
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:52,125
but I feel like
I really rushed into this.

1613
01:29:54,171 --> 01:29:59,132
It's just that there are
some things I have to do
by myself right now.

1614
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:02,397
And so I can't let
our relationship
go any further.

1615
01:30:06,966 --> 01:30:07,750
You can't?

1616
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,925
[sighs]

1617
01:30:13,059 --> 01:30:14,104
[sighs]

1618
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,062
So, uh...

1619
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:20,676
what are these things
you gotta do?

1620
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:28,510
I have to find out
what's after splat.

1621
01:30:32,775 --> 01:30:33,558
[Jenine] Morning.

1622
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:36,474
Hey.

1623
01:30:36,605 --> 01:30:39,738
-Everything all right?
-Sure. Why not?

1624
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:43,525
We finally decided on
rose blush for the canopy.

1625
01:30:43,655 --> 01:30:45,918
And last night,
total epiphany.

1626
01:30:46,049 --> 01:30:47,354
Really?

1627
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:51,489
Barry came round
to the idea
of ice sculptures.

1628
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:54,666
[chuckles] Oh, I have to
call Juan Carlos.

1629
01:30:54,797 --> 01:30:58,061
He's the only one who
can create a flurry of doves
out of a block of ice.

1630
01:30:58,191 --> 01:30:59,192
[music playing faintly]

1631
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:03,458
Do you hear that?
Is that music?

1632
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:05,547
Where's that coming from?

1633
01:31:06,896 --> 01:31:08,071
[Ida] Oy!

1634
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:09,899
-Grandma?
-[stammering] Your...

1635
01:31:10,595 --> 01:31:12,597
your mother...
[stammering]

1636
01:31:12,728 --> 01:31:13,511
Oy!

1637
01:31:13,642 --> 01:31:14,773
[music grows more distinct]

1638
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:18,473
[Claire] What?

1639
01:31:19,561 --> 01:31:20,475
[chuckling] What?

1640
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:23,608
What the...

1641
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:26,481
Oh, my God.

1642
01:31:29,962 --> 01:31:31,137
[music continues playing]

1643
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:47,632
Why don't you
just shoot me now?

1644
01:31:47,763 --> 01:31:49,504
My big day,
not two months away,

1645
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:51,114
and our parents
have completely lost it.

1646
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:13,528
[airplane engine roaring]

1647
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,617
[traffic noise]

1648
01:32:43,122 --> 01:32:44,210
[piano music]

1649
01:32:45,124 --> 01:32:46,648
Claire Goldstein?

1650
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:50,913
You're next.

1651
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,221
This way.

1652
01:32:58,224 --> 01:32:59,748
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

1653
01:33:07,973 --> 01:33:08,931
[exhales]

1654
01:33:22,248 --> 01:33:23,902
[upbeat pop music playing]

1655
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:22,134
[jaunty music playing]

1656
01:35:28,418 --> 01:35:29,767
[gentle piano music]
