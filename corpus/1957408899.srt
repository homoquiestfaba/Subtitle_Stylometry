Fine.

32
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,627
I'm here to change a 20.

33
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,297
I like a man with money.

34
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,464
Yeah?

00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,835
Freeze, everybody! (All gasping)

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,904
This here is a bank robbery.

38
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,006
(Grunting)

39
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,743
Sam: See what happens
when you try to get cute?

40
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,912
Stick around,
kid. Watch the fun.

41
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,256
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,981
this is a real bank
robbery. Trust me.

43
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,184
Now, everybody but the
tellers, down on the floor.

44
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,752
All fine.

45
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,479
Here, son, you're
gonna help me collect.

46
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,122
Open that bag wide.

47
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,066
You can start by putting
your own money in there.

48
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,092
My 20? Absolutely,
set a good example.

49
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,295
Are you gonna contribute
to our little venture? Huh?

50
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,796
It's a worthy cause.

51
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,599
Uh-uh-uh-uh! Where's big bills?

52
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,668
I haven't any larger bills.

53
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,770
Oh, no large bills.

54
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:50,938
Now, do you believe her?

55
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,773
Nelson: Please, lady.

56
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,276
Sam: Come on. Come on.

57
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,311
Atta girl. Atta girl.

58
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,446
What's your name, boy?

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Ron, sir.

60
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,115
Lilly: Ronsir, you hear that?

61
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,643
You wouldn't want Ronsir here
to die a virgin now, would you?

62
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,820
Sam: Faster. Faster, honey.
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

63
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,822
That's it, girl, move fast.

64
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,392
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,894
Bunsy, oh, what
a beautiful name.

66
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,397
You ever get tired of the
same old dull routine, bunsy?

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,730
'Cause I'm gonna need some
help spending this here money.

68
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,868
Keep your mind on the business.

69
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,575
All right. Now, I want
everybody to sing

70
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,710
on top of old smokey, okay?

71
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,011
It's one of my favorites.

72
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,980
Now, sing it loud
and sing it clear.

73
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,416
And don't anybody stop
until you're all the way through.

74
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,652
And don't think about getting
up till you're done. Go ahead.

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,588
All: ♪♪ on top of old smokey

76
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,490
no, on key, for Christ's sake.

77
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,693
♪♪ all covered with snow... ♪

78
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,400
let me hear that
familiar refrain.

79
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,937
What took you so long, huh?

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,376
Come on! Come on! Why
did you ask them to sing again?

81
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,678
I'm driving. Push over.

82
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,683
Lilly: Come on, Sam. Let's go!

83
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,686
Tony: Go. Go.

84
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,722

85
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,357
(Sirens wailing)

86
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,793
Can you make the cops sing, too?

87
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,428
Where are you going?

88
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,796
(Tires screeching)

89
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,901
(Tony yelps)

90
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,208
(Horn honking)

91
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,045
Yeah!

92
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,819
They're closing in on us.

93
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,656
(Car horn blaring)

94
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,400
Look out, they're
sandwiching us!

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,734
(Lilly yells)

96
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,003
(Police cars crashing)

97
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,174
Sam: Yeah, so much
for them. Let's go.

98
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,986
Tony: Come on! Come on! Go!

99
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,192
You're not losing them.
What kind of driver are you?

100
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,292
Every cop in the
county's after us.

101
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,330
Come on! Move it. Move it!

102
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,043
You want me to
take over? Come on.

103
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,654
Come on. Come on. Go!

104
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,222
Don't you have a plan?

105
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,957
(Truck horn blaring)

106
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,826
(All screaming)

107
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,735
Lilly: Ha-ha! This is great.

108
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,337
(Laughing)

109
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,973
Nice move, pop. Real nice move.

110
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,375
(Horn honking)

111
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,044
Tony: Ahhh!

112
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,081
Sam: I gotta find
another line of work.

113
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,550
Ohh...

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,059
Hey, Lilly, what's this crap
about me dying a virgin?

115
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,327
Well, you are. Yeah,
but it's embarrassing.

116
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,432
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off.

117
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,601
I was only playing with
him, for Christ's sake.

118
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,537
You slammed the hell out
of him. You call that playing?

119
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,482
I mean, Lilly, you gotta
knock off this ninja stuff

120
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:46,850
before you end up
killing somebody.

121
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,842
Well, hey, I gotta practice.

122
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,929
We're in it for the money, honey, not
so you show off your damn black belt.

123
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,016
(Sirens wailing)

124
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,385
Ah-ha. Here they are, pops.

125
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,719
Plan a?

126
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,121
Definitely plan a.

127
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,191
Look, dad, 385 east
intersects one mile up the road,

128
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,627
and just beyond that are
the dirt roads we need, okay?

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,929
I got you. Buckle up, team.

130
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,138
Oh, pop, uh, they're gaining.

131
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,973
Oh, yeah? I hadn't noticed.

132
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,500
Tony: What are you laughing
about? They're right on our tail.

133
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,931
Okay, dad, here it is, here.
Right past this junction.

134
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,214
It's that road we want.

135
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,954
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

136
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,288
A thing of beauty.

137
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,957
(Whooping)

138
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,259
(Fast-paced music plays)

139
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,094
This is how fast
you're gonna go, huh?

140
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,930
Excuse me for
interrupting, Tony, pop,

141
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,432
but they're like gaining
and they're after us again.

142
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,667
(Lilly whoops)

143
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,502
Tony: We're trapped! (Laughing)

144
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,740
Hey, dad. Dad, dad,
dad. Now hit the junkyard.

145
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,241
Got it.

146
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,243
You see, me and Nelson,
we scouted this place.

147
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,779
Tony, learn the value
of preparation, my man.

148
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,247
The value of preparation.

149
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,654
Dad, the manure. Go
to the manure, pop.

150
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,021
(Whooping)

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,491
All right, hang on.

152
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,659
Hang on.

153
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,094
(Screams)

154
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,496
Lilly: (Whoops) Yeah!

155
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,165
(Whoops)

156
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,671
Dad, remember, stay to
the right. Stay to the right.

157
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,837
You gonna hit the shit?

158
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,306
Sam: No, he is, butthead.

159
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,108
Lilly: Yes. Yes!

160
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,846
(All whooping and laughing)

161
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,147
Okay. Good.

162
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,384
Dad, we're surrounded.

163
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,552
Oh, my god.

164
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,457
All right, pop. Plan b.

165
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,393
Now, stay to the right
of the ladder, okay?

166
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
Lilly: Look out!

167
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,333

169
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,838
All right, pop. Plan c.

170
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,707
Pass the dogs,
through the fence.

171
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,041
Sam: Piece of cake.

172
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,179
(Whoops)

173
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,181
(Dogs barking)

174
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,589
Nelson: All right,
dad. Dad, stay left.

175
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,857
Stay left to the ramp, pop.

176
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,259
Tony: Oh no, not again!

177
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,729
Lilly: Yes. Yes!

178
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,497
Sam: Airborne. (Whoops)

179
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,035
Yeah!

180
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,003
Touchdown!

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,550
(Laughs) Look at that, pop.

182
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,552
I need a picture of this.

183
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,420
Tony: That's
brilliant. Just brilliant.

184
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,389
Ha-ha. Suckers!

185
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,522
Lilly: Suckers!

186
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
Tony: Suckers!

187
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,263
Hey, I could have done
the same if I had the chance.

188
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,232
Butthead.

189
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,868
Nelson: Butthead.

190
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,436
Yeah. I just don't
get the chance.

191
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,956
I sure hate to ditch this
baby. It did all right by us.

192
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,591
Yeah.

193
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,593
Oh, go get your baby shoe.

194
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,797
That's embarrassing, okay?

195
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,099
Brings us good luck. Go get it.

196
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,410
Hi.

197
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,478
Hey.

198
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,288
Wow.

199
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,027
You wanna give us a minute here?

200
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,694
Can you swear
you're gonna make it?

201
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,705
Lilly: No, you know
how I get after a job.

202
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,141
I know. You know
I'm good for it, right?

203
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,874
I just got a couple
of things I gotta do.

204
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,610
Okay?

205
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,279
Later, right?

206
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,448
Yeah. A little later.

207
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,485
You know, and how
could anybody get it on

208
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,298
with the goddamned
kid around all the time?

209
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,457
I know he's your kid,
Sam, but enough's enough.

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,161
He's really starting
to get on my nerves.

211
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,806
Well, you better get used to it,
because he's part of the package.

212
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,366
Well, maybe it's time we
exchanged that package.

213
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,801
What's that supposed to mean?

214
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:45,806
It means, I thought maybe
just you and me alone.

215
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,377
He's my son.

216
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,715
You know, I think
you're goin' soft

217
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:56,850
in all the wrong places.

218
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,251
(Punches) (Groans)

219
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,321
(Grunts)

220
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:04,924
Hey!

221
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:05,992
Hey, pop.

222
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,260
So, what's next?

223
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,362
(Sighs) Webster.

224
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,998
Webster? Webster. Yeah.

225
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:11,999
You know, the bank I've
been telling you about.

226
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,500
It's in Webster.

227
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,344
Nah. No, that's one
bank we don't need to see.

228
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,370
I don't wanna see it,
dad, I wanna Rob it.

229
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,272
Forget Webster.

230
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,741
Nelson, look...

231
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,443
Lilly, all she's been saying...

232
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,046
Ignore her.

233
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,082
See, she's got certain
physical attributes...

234
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,251
Hooters, Hooters,
call 'em Hooters.

235
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,752
Yeah...

236
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,087
You got it.

237
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,555
But she got nothing upstairs.

238
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,424
So you're calling Lilly a moron?

239
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,226
Not to her face, I'm not.

240
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,961
(Both chuckling)

241
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,263
Not me. Uh-uh.

242
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,234
So, how much we rake in?

243
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,137
Uh, let's see...

244
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,439
Just over $12,000.

245
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,276
Okay, so that
makes four for you.

246
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,545
Four for me.

247
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,914
And four for Sam.

248
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:02,883
Ho.

249
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,386
Since when?

250
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,555
We always split it four ways.

251
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,057
Since now.

252
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,968
I'm not giving no snot-nosed
kid an equal share.

253
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,992
Pop?

254
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,494
Split it four ways.

255
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,664
Make me.

256
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,834
This isn't about the
money now, is it?

257
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,403
No.

258
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,106
No.

259
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,674
It's not about the money.

260
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,344
(Grunts) (Groans)

261
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,583
Tony, it's mine.

262
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,927
It's mine, Tony, hands
off. Leave it alone.

263
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,953
I'm such a short
fuse. I'm sorry, Sam.

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,955
You're just short, period.

265
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,658
Hey, I was just kidding.

266
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,428
Come on, get over here.

267
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,598
(Grunting)

268
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,102
(Ripping)

269
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,670
Ohhh!

270
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,308
Tony: Kick him in the head, lil!

271
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,842
Lilly...

272
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,180
Tony: Money,
money. Money, money.

273
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,982
Sam: Losing my Patience, Lilly.

274
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,650
Tony: More. More, I need more.

275
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,818
Got enough.

276
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,820
Ho, good shot.

277
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,558
(Tony laughing)

278
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,194
Go. Go stand on top of him.

279
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,529
(Gunshot)

280
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,697
Tony: Oh, shit.

281
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,832
Hey, Lilly.

282
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,468
Hey, pop.

283
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,404
You wanna get the
hell off him, please?

284
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,739
Yeah, right.

285
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,373
(Cocks gun)

286
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,642
Get off, Lilly.

287
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
Phew.

288
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,183
Hey, pop, how are you?

289
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,418
I've been better, boy.

290
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,587
Okay, you two, this
partnership is now dissolved.

291
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,156
Get the hell out of here, okay?

292
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,490
Let's go.

293
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,196
How you doing?

294
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,598
Women, boy, women.

295
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,767
You got your ass
kicked is what happened.

296
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,702
(Car engine rumbling)

297
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,372
Lilly: Watch out for your dad.

298
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,574
Looks like he's having
a tough time of it.

299
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,413
(Toots horn)

300
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,286
I guess that's what's
called a property settlement.

301
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,887
(Laughing)

302
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,523
With Lilly's brains and
Tony's sense of direction,

303
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,258
they deserve each other.

304
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,893
(Chuckling)

305
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,129
She kicked my ass.

306
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,765
Oh, pop, you get your ass
kicked all the time, it's unbelievable.

307
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,499
Nelson: Hey, dad, dad.
Someone's pulling in right here.

308
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,417
Sam: Nah, Japanese.

309
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,119
Japanese.

310
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,989
What about this gray one?

311
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,490
But it's another Japanese job.

312
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,826
So, what? What is it with
you and these Japanese cars?

313
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,262
I'm not getting behind the
wheel of a Japanese car.

314
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,563
Why not?

315
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,465
Because if you
steal a Japanese car,

316
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,334
the owner goes to the
insurance company,

317
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,860
he gets the money, he goes
out, he buys another Japanese car.

318
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,404
So?

319
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,549
If you steal American, the owner
goes out and he buys American,

320
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,742
and if you steal American,
you help the economy.

321
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,178
Ah-ha.

322
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,013
Yeah. Here.

323
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,414
That's the one. Nuh-uh.

324
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,683
Let's go. Aw, come on, dad.

325
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,796
So I heard about this
new store they just opened.

326
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,923
They have these great
shirts on sale, 50% off.

327
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,502
(Both whistling)

328
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,512
(Engine starting)

329
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,514
(Laughs) Whoo!

330
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,852
(Music playing on radio)

331
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,959
Slide over.

332
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,027
I wanna drive.

333
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,463
Slide over.

334
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,835
Nelson, I've been thinking.

335
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,871
You're 16 years old, you
can't Rob banks forever.

336
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
Come on, dad.
Look... Look at you.

337
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,875
No, I mean it.

338
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,353
Soon as we get the money, it's
gonna be high school, college,

339
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,454
and you're gonna get your MBA.

340
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,147
My MBA?

341
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,557
Where do you think the best
criminals make their killing?

342
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,050
The backwoods of Colorado? No!

343
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,184
It's wall street.

344
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,886
Wall street?

345
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,498
That's where the best and
the brightest criminals are.

346
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:36,732
(Chuckles) Where
did you read this?

347
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,658
You may laugh now,

348
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,370
but someday when you're sitting
on park Avenue, sipping your Martini,

349
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,194
you're gonna thank your
old man for that. Okay.

350
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,398
Yeah, I'll call you from
my jacuzzi, pop. (Laughs)

351
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,843
We're gonna get the money, you're
out of the business. That's fine with me.

352
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,436
It really is, you know?

353
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,082
And then you can stop dating
women who beat the shit out of you.

354
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,108
(Both chuckling)

355
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,611
Nelson: Uh-oh.
Sam: Now, stay cool.

356
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,448
Ooh, look at that.

357
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,017
Ticket?

358
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,520
Ticket?

359
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,390
I must have lost my ticket.

360
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,026
Oh, you lost your ticket,
you gotta pay for a full day.

361
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,296
Oh, what would that
set me back, little lady?

362
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,630
6 bucks.

363
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,566
6 bucks? Yeah.

364
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,768
You got any money on you?

365
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,572
(Unzipping)

366
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,275
Here you go, sweetness.

367
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,542
Keep the change.

368
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,077
100 bucks?

369
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,450
That was thoughtful.

370
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,951
Didn't you have
anything smaller?

371
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,198
Ah, look, come on, dad, did
you see how cute she was?

372
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,089
Look, this way she'll
never forget me.

373
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:47,427
Besides all that, that's $100
Harvard will never see, okay?

374
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,762
Is that right?
That's right, pop.

375
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,131
How about one of
these? Oh, pop, no.

376
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,933
What are you doing?

377
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,586
You know, I like it better this
way, pop. Just the two of us.

378
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,778
Me too, Nelson. Me too.

379
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,112
Dad, can I ask you a question?

380
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,181
Yeah, sure.

381
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,951
You know, if
mom was still alive,

382
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,254
do you think she'd be
robbing banks with us?

383
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,956
I don't know. Uh...

384
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,092
I think she'd want
us to be happy.

385
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,261
Yeah? Yeah.

386
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,530
Yeah.

387
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,131
Does Lilly remind you of mom?

388
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,866
No way. No?

389
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:28,701
Your mom...

390
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,603
She was...

391
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,473
And Lilly is, uh...

392
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,107
Am I on the hot
seat here, Nelson?

393
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,444
Oh, no. Nothing like that, pop.

394
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,122
It's just, you know, Lilly has these
guzans things, you know, on her chest,

395
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,382
and I know you weren't
after her mind, you know?

396
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,716
Come on, pop.

397
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,985
Come on, pop.

398
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,597
You date a woman like Lilly when
you don't know what you're looking for.

399
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,323
All right. But

400
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,850
you treat her like a lady with
respect and you don't use her.

401
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,395
Dad, if you don't use
'em how do you get laid?

402
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,697
That's exactly why you're
gonna go to law school.

403
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,070
To learn the answers to
important questions like that one.

404
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,039
Dad, first of all, I'm
not going to law school.

405
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,237
Second of all, no one gets
laid at law school, okay?

406
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,905
They all end up yuppies.

407
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,740
You got a one-track mind, boy.

408
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,141
Thank you. I'm like you, pop.

409
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,543
Like father, like son.

410
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,078

411
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,646
Amen.

412

Amen.

413
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,584

417

Now, pop, don't
you like my music?

418
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,559
I love it, Nelson, I love it.

419
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,406
Look at that horse
taking a dump out there.

420
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,829

421
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,374
(Country music playing)
Now, what is this?

422
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,400
It's some guy wearing
a cowboy hat, pop.

423
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,436
That's music, boy.

424
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,737
I don't listen to country.

425
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:38,904

Now, pop, get into the
groove with this for a minute.

428
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,024
Well, let me see it.
Let me see the groove.

429
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,780
What's the groove?
The groove, pop.

430
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,181
Just the mellow...

431
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,759

00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,860
There you go.

439
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,695
See, see how nice that is?

440
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,795
Just relax.

Okay.

okay? It's a piece of cake.

536
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,732
Come on.

537
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,472
(Laughing)

538
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,408
(Tires screech)

539
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,645
Nice going, pop.

540
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,182
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
We're all clear.

541
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,517
(Sirens wailing)

542
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,650
Whoops.

543
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,320
Excuse me. My mistake.

544
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,022
Yeah, you spoke too fast, son.

545
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,589
Well, lose 'em.

546
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,159
Would you put your
damn foot on the floor?

547
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,928
In an event like this,

548
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,163
we would take plan b.

549
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,798
B it is. Okay.

550
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,333
Ready, pop? Yeah.

551
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,335
All right, let's see
what he's got, okay?

552
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,137
Hold tight!

553
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,671
Stay with me, baby.

554
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,041
(Both whooping)

555
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:56,776
Here we go.

556
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:58,543
Oh, yeah.

557
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,779
Now, step on it.

558
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,115
(Yelling)

559
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,450
Come on!

560
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,354
Whoo-hoo! Here,
watch it. Watch it.

561
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,124
It's like the derby again, boy.

562
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,061
Parking structure, there it is.

563
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,362
I got it.

564
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,733
That way. That way.

565
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,388
Brace yourself, pop.
We're goin' for a ride.

566
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,072
Sam: Hold on to your wig!

567
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,207
Whoa!

568
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,187
Whoo!

569
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,554
That's my pops!

570
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,323
Whoo-hoo!

571
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,327
Well, I tell you, boy, plan a definitely
would have been easier on my kidneys.

572
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,252
You and me, dad,
you and me. The team!

573
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,221
Like always, kid, like always.

574
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,956
Piece of cake, pop.

575
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,724
Whoo! We got a bundle. Ha-ha!

576
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,229
Oh, shit.

577
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,697
Oh, dad.

578
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,533
How did they get a
roadblock so quick?

579
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,268
Stay cool. All right.

580
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,803
Yeah, we can beat this rap.

581
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:33,539
Cop: Stop your vehicle.

582
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,207
Get out of your vehicle and...

583
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,476
Yeah, all right, dad,
you're doing good.

584
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,445
Ain't no big thing,
kid. All right, dad.

585
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,913
Damn it. What?

586
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,585
We have you
surrounded. Shit, dad.

587
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,622
Hey, dad, that thing
right there, the winch.

588
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,758
What? Come on,
just get out, get out.

589
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:53,893
Trust me.

590
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,396
Dad.

591
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:58,997
Cop: Put down your gun.

592
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,566
Dad, the gun. Put it on me.

593
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,101
Release the hostage.

594
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,735
Give me the binoculars.

595
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,275
Hey, what's going on?

596
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,010
Dad, put the gun on me.

597
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,778
Dad, the gun. Yeah, good.

598
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,180
Let the girl go.

599
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,015
All right. Good. Put
your weapon down

600
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,917
and let the girl go.

601
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,652
All right. Dad, dad, below
you there's a belt, a harness.

602
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,621
Tell me to go down and get it.

603
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,832
Tell me to go down... Yeah, that's
good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

604
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,856
That's good.

605
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,124
All right. Put this around you.

606
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,493
We have you surrounded.

607
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,304
All right, dad. Please
release the hostage.

608
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,406
Over here. Over here, dad.
There's one. Tell me to go get this.

609
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,831
Here.

610
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,334
Thanks a lot. You've
been a really big help here.

611
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,468
Real convincing, pop.

612
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,037
All right, step back here.

613
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,705
Let's go. Move back.
Come on. Come on.

614
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,208
Oh, dad, don't look down.

615
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,609
Sorry. Don't look down.

616
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,855
So, we're going over, okay?

617
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,278
Oh! You don't have to look down.

618
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,881
Oh! I told you. Are you ready?

619
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,183
I can't.

620
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,485
You got no choice.
Okay, we can do this.

621
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,022
Remember, hold your fire.
He's got someone with him.

622
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,357
Please release the hostage
now. Come on, let's go.

623
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,858
I repeat...

624
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,861
Put your weapon
down and let the girl go.

625
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,830
We have you surrounded.
Now, come on. Breathe.

626
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,299
Yeah. Yeah.

627
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,301
Come on. Come on.

628
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,403
Please, put down your weapon.

629
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,340
Oh, shit. Oh, pop,
that was our weapon.

630
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,579
Holy moley.

631
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,681
You ready? No.

632
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,316
Good.

633
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,553
Here we go. Hold on.

634
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,688
All right. That's it. That's it.

635
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,723
All right. Yeah.

636
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,326
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

637
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,261
Oh, I'm getting queasy.

638
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,563
Don't puke on me!

639
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,141
Puke over there,
there's plenty of room.

640
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,400
Cop: Move in,
men. Move in. Unit 7.

641
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,235
Move in. Move in.
Come on. Let's go.

642
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,369
Unit 8.

643
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,437
Come on, dad. Yeah.

644
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,939
Hurry. You're doing good.

645
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,843
You all right? Yeah.

646
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,545
All right.

647
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,781
Piece of cake. Piece of cake.

648
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,440
(Wind whistling)

649
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:29,281
You all right? Yeah.

650
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,716
(Tires screeching)

651
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,085
(Both screaming)

652
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,254
Oh, dad! Oh, shit!

653
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,389
(Both screaming)

654
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,839
(Screaming continues)

655
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,854
Dad!

656
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,588
Are we dead?

657
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,024
I don't think so, man.

658
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,160
Oh, good. I don't want
to die a virgin, pop!

659
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,327
Oh, god!

660
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,695
Sam: You all right? Yeah.

661
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,342
That was beautiful.
Yeah. What a ride.

662
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:19,698
Hey!

663
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,633
(Both cheering)

664
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,135
This thing works!

665
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,770
(Whooping and laughing)

666
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,438
(Laughing)

667
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:30,042
All right, boys.
Let's reel 'em in.

668
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,511
Whoo!

669
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,980
Oh, dad... Oh, it's
all over, Nelson.

670
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,349
No, dad, dad, it's
never over, okay?

671
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,385
Unhook us. What?

672
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,187
Come on, dad, unhook us.

673
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,622
Unhook us. The higher we
get, the longer the drop, pop.

674
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,124
Do I have a choice?

675
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,225
Both: No.

676
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:47,859
(Laughing) Got 'em.

677
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,730
(Screaming) Oh, dad! Dad!

678
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,899
Oh, no.

679
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,867
(Both screaming)

680
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,981
(Gasping)

681
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,692
They're getting away.

682
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,503
Nelson!

683
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,540
Nelson!

684
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,042
Nelson!

685
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:38,910
Nelson!

686
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,546
Nelson!

687
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,614
Nelson!

688
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,250
Where are you, boy?

689
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,118
Dad! Dad!

690
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,853
Dad! Dad!

691
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,955
Dad, I got the money!
Dad, I got the money!

692
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,191
(Yells indistinctly)

693
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,093
Come here, boy. Come on.

694
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,562
We made it!

695
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,963
Come here. Come here!

696
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,266
Come on. We did it, boy.

697
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,801
Dad, we did it! And we're alive.

698
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,102
Come on.

699
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,405
We did it!

700
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:07,806
And we're fine!

701
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,475
Are you all right? I'm okay.

702
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,210
Are you okay? You okay? Yeah.

703
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:12,411
We made it, dad.

704
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,112
Dad, we were flying!

705
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,449
Me and you, we're gonna
revolutionize the way people Rob banks!

706
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,784
You and me!

707
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,319
Dad, where's our next bust, huh?

708
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,896
Ain't gonna be one,
Nelson. We're out of stealing.

709
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,755
No, no, no, no, dad! Webster!

710
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,957
Yeah, Webster. No, dad,
the vault's gonna be loaded!

711
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,560
It's over!

712
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,830
Oh, dad...

713
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,099
Where to?

714
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,767
Respectability, boy.

715
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,408
Mmm. Mmm.

716
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,576
Mmm. Hurry up
and eat that thing.

717
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,145
I'm hungry.

718
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:50,949
Come on, Lilly, we just did
it two hours ago! I'm pooped.

719
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,151
What's the matter?

720
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,520
You didn't like it?

721
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,022
No, of course I did.

722
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,859
It's just... I don't
think I'll be able...

723
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,695
(Exclaims)

724
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:05,864
(Panting)

725
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,334
So, how long do we
have to stay here?

726
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,137
I told you. Till Sam and
his little shit son show up.

727
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,972
And so, why do
we need them, huh?

728
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,975
I'm smart. We can
do the bank ourselves.

729
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,812
(Tony moans)

730
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,715
What's our room number, Tony?

731
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,284
Uh...

732
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,655
So, how do you know
they're gonna be here?

733
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,158
Because the kid said Webster.

734
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,496
And when they show...

735
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,331
I'll grab the little snot.

736
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,400
(Exclaims)

737
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,835
(Moaning) Then
he'll make us rich.

738
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,509
Come here, my stallion.

739
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,644
(Imitating neighing)

740
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:53,979
Lilly: Hyah!

741
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,147
I don't believe this.

742
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,317
I'll show you how
serious I am, Nelson.

743
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,852
Come on, boy.

744
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,871
Can I help you, sir?

745
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,676
Uh, how much for this one?

746
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,044
The Pontiac?

747
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,013
Your lucky day.
This one's on special.

748
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,849
A steal. $3,600, it's yours.

749
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,784
How much for cash?

750
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,421
Cash, I can give it to you, and
I'm practically giving it away,

751
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,088
for $3,300.

752
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,724
$3,200.

753
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,726
A deal. Deal.

754
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,363
Pay the man, son.

755
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,064
(Scoffs)

756
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,873
You wanna drive?

757
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,742
Yeah, I wanna drive.

758
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,043
Wanna have some fun?

759
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,379
Yeah, I wanna have
some fun. Pop, I'm bored.

760
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,448
You go high, I go low.

761
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,581
I take high.

762
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:04,816
All right, ready?

763
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,227
All right, I'm gonna
let go. Grab the wheel.

764
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,451
I got the wheel, pop. Whoo-hoo!

765
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,655
(Chuckling) Whoo-hoo!

766
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,289
Let's get 'em,
pop. I got the gas.

767
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:13,463
Yeah. You gotta cut down
on the hamburger meat, pop.

768
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,226
(Laughing) Keep
your foot on the gas.

769
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,462
(Whooping)

770
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,039
All right, let me get
the gas. Let me get...

771
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,798
You got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

772
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,401
(Laughing)

773
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:25,771
All right. You know, pop, I still
say we should've stolen this vehicle.

774
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,840
Aw, get used to it, Nelson.

775
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,309
Dad, what's so big about
saddle river, anyway?

776
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,445
I'll tell you when we get there.

777
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,256
Could I have some change or
something? May I get a soda up ahead?

778
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,958
Boy, there is no rest
for the weary, is there?

779
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,617
Look, pop, I only
have hundreds, okay?

780
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,085
Take it all.

781
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,422
(Laughing) You're giving
me like $8 in change.

782
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,090
Where did you get this stuff?

783
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,426
I'm sorry. Go to sleep, pop.

784
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,801
Slow down, Nelson.

785
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,301
Slow down.

Okay.

811
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,899
Exactly where are we, Nelson?

812
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,067
Uh... we're at a diner.

813
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,136
A diner, where?

814
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:41,940
Uh...

815
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,643
We're at a diner in Utah.

816
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,311
You drove us to Webster.

817
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,246
We are in Webster,
boy, and that's dirty pool.

818
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,882
Yeah, yeah, dad, it's
dirty pool, it's dirty as hell.

819
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,383
I figure that'd mean we're even.

820
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,085
What?

821
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,798
All right, dad, you know how a couple
of miles back we stopped for soda pop?

822
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:59,400
There was a clerk hanging out, you know,
so, I go up and I start talking to him,

823
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,961
and I find out one very
ugly fact about saddle river.

824
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,163
An all-boys prep school?

825
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,434
(Scoffs) Nice
try, pop. Nice try.

826
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,937
Dad, what do you have
against Webster anyway?

827
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,939
Why are you frowning?

828
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,074
I mean, look
outside that window.

829
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,509
Look outside this window.

830
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:21,580
Look at that, dad.
That's one hell of a bank!

831
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,450
Dad, look. Look, dad,
it's like taking out sheep.

832
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,018
You know, it just keeps coming.

833
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,187
Look at this. Right
on schedule, pop.

834
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,488
It's a piece of cake.

835
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,125
No.

836
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,194
Yeah.

837
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:43,301
All right, deposit everything in
the bag, and nobody gets hurt.

838
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,271
Not even this scrawny
little kid here! (Laughs)

839
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,774
I tell you, you got
beautiful decor in this bank.

840

(Electric toothbrush buzzing)

841
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:59,317
I'd like to report a
robbery in progress.

(Electric toothbrush buzzing)

843
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,290
All right, time to move
back down on the line.

844
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,893
Hello, Mrs. Gates, how
are you this morning?

845
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,527
All right, little
faster, please.

846

Hi, young lady, how are you?

850
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:19,705
Okay, everybody. We're
moving right along here.

851
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,909
Do you want to wake up,
son, or do I have to shoot you?

852
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,244
Is that it? Come
on, a little faster.

853
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:27,913
Thank you.

854
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,048
That's it. Let's go.

855
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,883
All right, kid.
All right, now...

856
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,251
One more little favor.

857
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,054
I want everybody to
sing deck the halls.

858
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:39,024
Don't stick your nose out the
door or junior here is going to get it!

859
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,325

We wait.

882
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,561

as his sister and legal guardian.

883

By that time, he'll
be glad to see me.

You'll see.

885
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,008

like nobody's sister.

newsreader: The entire town
of Webster was in shock today

904
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,702
by the daring daylight robbery
at the Webster national bank.

905
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:08,706
The alleged bank robber has
been identified as one Sam Potter,

906
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,541
formerly of Denver, Colorado.

907
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,378
The young boy who
refuses to identify himself,

908
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,147
and who the police
believe to be a runaway...

909
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,183
Jesus!

910
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:26,557
Cop: Come on, son, at least you
could tell us where you're from.

911
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:28,393
Does it matter?

912
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,229
There might be a
reward coming to you.

913
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,099
But your folks would have
to show up to sign for it.

914
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,174
Cop 2: Excuse me
for a moment, sheriff.

915
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,750
(Whispering indistinctly)

916
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,926
Hi, Nelson.

917
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,676
Who the hell is that
with him? Who knows?

918
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,819
Let's go. Come on.

919
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:04,589
So who are you?

920
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,357
I'm an old friend of your dad's.

921
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,692
Where do you know my dad from?

922
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,827
We were in the
demolition derby together.

923
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:12,964
Oh, shit!

924
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:14,099
What? What?

925
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,433
I left my iron on.

926
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,268
Oh. That's not good, is it?

927
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,769
It certainly isn't.

928
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,771
Uh-uh. Sorry!

929
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,541
(Tires screeching)

930
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,613
Come on. Keep up. Yeah, yeah.

931
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,122
Come on, get off
the road! (Screams)

932
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,990
Man: Learn to
drive you... Shmuck!

933
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,659
Road hog!

934
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:44,529
(Car horn honking) (Screaming)

935
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:46,898
Jerk!

936
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:54,472
(Crashing)

937
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,577
She got a faster car.

938
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,547
You drive just like my dad.

939
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,149
Who do you think taught me?

940
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:05,750
My dad taught you how to drive?

941
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,186
I told you, we were
in the derby together.

942
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,720
What's your name?

943
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,888
Lorraine.

944
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,558
Lorraine, huh? Yeah.

945
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,725
(Mouthing)

946
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,928
No, sorry, I haven't
heard of any Lorraine.

947
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,740
You know, me and my dad, we're
like this. He tells me about everybody.

948
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,266
Oh, yeah? Uh-huh.

949
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,334
How many everybodys
have there been?

950
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:25,703
About 2,000.

951
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,388
Look, Lorraine, relax. Okay?
It's not like there's a fire.

952
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,191
I don't see any smoke.

953
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,059
Hi, Lorraine. I
got to get my iron.

954
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,560
I've already got it.

955
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,963
Oh, thanks.

956
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,098
Who's this?

957
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,202
Nelson. Nelson's going to
be staying with me for a while.

958
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:58,703
Hi, Nelson.

959
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:01,205
Hi.

960
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,240
Woman: Honey?

961
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,042
That's my mom, I got to go.

962
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,210
Bye, Lorraine. Bye-bye.

963
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:06,711
Bye, Nelson. Bye.

964
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,448
Lorraine: Nelson?

965
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,284
Who is that?

966
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,785
That was my
neighbor's kid, honey.

967
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,454
I'm teaching her
how to drive a stick.

968
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,956
Honey? Yeah, honey.

969
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,559
I could teach her, I
could drive anything.

970
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:23,794
What's this?

971
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,931
Oh, that was... when I played
at the salt lake amphitheater.

972
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,399
I'm a singer.

973
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,068
You played there? Yeah.

974
00:49:30,235 --> 00:49:31,669
How many does that seat?

975
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,073
Oh, about 8,000.

976
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,075
8,000? Uh-huh.

977
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:40,411
Oh, 8,000, $15 a ticket...

978
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,347
That's pretty major,
Lorraine. Ooh.

979
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,950
Don't you think that maybe it's
just a little out of your league?

980
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:49,754
Yeah, well, Lorraine, look, I
wanna thank you very much, okay?

981
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,090
Thank you. But me and
my dad, we have a pact...

982
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,492
One of us gets captured,
the other gets him out.

983
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,194
What if you can't get him out?

984
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:58,096
Have you even thought of that?

985
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:01,666
You know, you can't go on
robbing banks for the rest of your life.

986
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,135
One day everyone gets caught.

987
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,147
Lorraine, now you're starting
to sound like my pop, all right?

988
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,173
Look, let me explain
something to you, all right?

989
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,826
Me and my dad, we need the open
roads. We need to roam, you know?

990
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,211
Whenever, wherever
we want to. It's...

991
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,424
Look, Lorraine, all I'm trying to say is
Webster town jail ain't gonna stop us,

992
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,116
no how, no way. All right?

993
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:19,384
All right.

994
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,885
(Door clattering)

995
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,353
I'm back.

996
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:23,997
Lorraine: Okay. Here we
go. Nelson: Okay, okay, okay.

997
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,023
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Okay, okay. No, no, no.

998
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,169
What you wanna do, you wanna
easily let your foot off the clutch.

999
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,936
Honey: Okay. Nelson: No, no,
no. No, don't touch the brake.

1000
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,962
Don't touch the brake. Oh, god.

1001
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,998
Take your right foot
and put it on the gas.

1002
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,167
No, don't hit the brake anymore.

1003
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,735
All right. See? See?

1004
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,646
I'm good at this. Yeah,
I'm good at this. All right.

1005
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,872
See. Never drive
like that. Ever. Okay.

1006
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,509
It's kind of like this. It's
in and out and then...

1007
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:46,177
It's up, over, up. Up?

1008
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:47,812
Nelson: Just do that.

1009
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,556
Take your left foot off.
Good. Smooth, smooth. Good.

1010
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,082
There you go. Whoo! (Laughing)

1011
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,818
Nicely done, honey.
All right! (Laughs)

1012
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,154
All right! You're ready
for the big time, honey.

1013
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:58,632
Yeah, you're ready for the big
time. You're a fabulous teacher.

1014
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,525
I love it. Yeah!

1015
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,992
Oh, this is great.

1016
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:03,894
(Brakes squealing)

1017
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:06,840
Just stop right here. Stop
right here. Stop right here.

1018
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,733
Right here, okay? Stop.

1019
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,067
I'll be right back, okay?

1020
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:11,669
Okay.

1021
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:12,770
Wait for me?

1022
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,772
No, I'm going to leave.

1023
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,213
Yo.

1024
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:23,448
(Chuckles) You're back.

1025
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,054
I'm back. Did you
miss me? Of course.

1026
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,051
Do you love me?
Get in. Let's go.

1027
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,622
What's that?

1028
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:35,229
Oh, these are maps and things of the city. I
like to know where everything is, you know?

1029
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:47,605
Hi! (Laughing)

1030
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,973
Hi.

1031
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:54,078
Did you miss me?
You're driving me crazy.

1032
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,752
The salt lake city amphitheater?

1033
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:05,055
It's nothing. It's a future consideration
school project thingamagjiger.

1034
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:07,558
Yeah... Pull over here
again. Yeah. Stop right here.

1035
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,060
Stop right here. I'll be right
back. Okay? My last stop.

1036
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,762
I promise. I swear.

1037
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,172
Okay, the first
right you see, pull in.

1038
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,474
You're looking at everything
else but my driving!

1039
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:24,942
Oh, you're doing fine, honey.

1040
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,255
Pull up here. Pull up here.

1041
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,623
Yeah, that's good.

1042
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,302
Nelson. Yeah, yeah.

1043
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,937
I've never met anybody

1044
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,673
so into maps before.

1045
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,208
Thank you very much.

1046
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,509
Yeah? Yeah, thank you.

1047
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,977
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1048
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,523
Uh, honey...

1049
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,991
Uh, we should go.

1050
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,527
You wanna go?
Yeah, we should go.

1051
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,195
Okay. Well...

1052
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,064
Wait.

1053
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:22,367
Let me make sure that I
have everything right first.

1054
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,569
Oh, that's great. Now, go
ahead. Go ahead first gear,

1055
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,070
second, third, and reverse.

1056
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,238
This is first...

1057
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,176
And this is second...

1058
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,414
(Exhales shakily)

1059
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,083
And... this is third.

1060
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,100
Wait, you know, I've always
wanted to know, what's fourth?

1061
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,723
What's fourth?
Yeah. What's fourth?

1062
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,558
This. (Chuckles)

1063
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,503
Are you kidding me? There
could be people watching this.

1064
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:50,761
No one's watching. (Laughs)

1065
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,763
Oh, god!

1066
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:11,048
Thanks for the lessons.

1067
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,183
No, thank you for the lesson.

1068
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,185
I got to tell you, third gear...

1069
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,421
Oh, third gear.

1070
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:17,955
Third gear was major.

1071
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,124
Great. Good. Yeah.

1072
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,627
Am I gonna see you again?

1073
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,695
Maybe. Okay. Go home.

1074
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,306
Oh, I got the feeling!

1075
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,308
(Whistles)

1076
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,777
Lorraine! Hello.

1077
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,148
(Whistling tune)

1078
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,487
(Ain't nobody like you playing)

1079
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:55,926
♪♪ well, there
ain't nobody like you

1080
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:04,168

1081
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:09,774

00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,844

00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:36,000
♪♪ no, nobody loves

1086
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,267
(knocking at door)

1087
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:38,436
Yeah?

1088
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,540
Planning your next heist?

1089
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,375
(Sighs) Yeah, maybe.

1090
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,512
Before you wear yourself out, why
don't you come help me with dinner?

1091
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,146
Okay. I'll be right there.

1092
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,856
Mmm. Not bad for a woman.

1093
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,691
Yeah? Wait'll you taste it.

1094
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,226
Do you like to cook?

1095
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:05,530
Yeah, when there's someone
to cook for, I like to cook.

1096
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,398
It's fun. Yeah.

1097
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:08,699
I'm a good cook.

1098
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,201
I cook spaghettios, cold cereal.

1099
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,171
Lorraine, can I
ask you a question?

1100
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,305
Sure.

1101
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,341
In these pictures,
is this your boy?

1102
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,411
Lorraine?

1103
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,347
Hmm? Your boy.

1104
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:24,749
Is that him?

1105
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:26,851
Yeah. Yeah.

1106
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,185
Yeah, that's my son.

1107
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:30,488
Yeah, I figured, but
where... I mean...

1108
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:32,322
I haven't seen him or anything.

1109
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:35,159
(Clears throat)

1110
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,995
Why don't we just say I
lost him a long time ago.

1111
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,599
I'm sorry. It's okay.

1112
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:45,335
I know what it's like to lose
someone, I lost my dad for

1113
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,104
eight hours now.

1114
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:49,406
No, really.

1115
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,685
Anyway, I checked the place
out today, it's no problem.

1116
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,211
I'm gonna get dad
out, bust in, bust out,

1117
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,681
piece of cake, just
like that. No problem.

1118
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:59,016
Who know? Maybe you can.

1119
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:00,851
Yeah, there's just two things.

1120
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,362
Now, Lorraine, just
hear me out, okay?

1121
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:03,946
Before you freak
out, just listen to me.

1122
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,623
Okay, all right? Please? Okay.

1123
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,425
Okay, look, I need a getaway
car and I need a getaway driver.

1124
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,861
All right? Look, you can
drive really well, Lorraine.

1125
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:12,863
My dad taught you in
the derby, you know?

1126
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,632
And you have a car.

1127
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,067
We're gonna eat dinner
together, I'll be all fueled up,

1128
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,536
I'll be energized,
it'll be great.

1129
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:20,738
Me and you, we can
do this. I need your help.

1130
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,373
Please?

1131
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,309
Sit down and eat.

1132
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,377
That's not a no.

1133
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,613
Sit. That's not a no.

1134
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,549
Sit. That wasn't a no.

1135
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:33,383
(Both chuckle)

1136
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,059
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.

1137
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,846
(Engine starting)

1138
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,484
(Exhales)

1139
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,093
(Crashing)

1140
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:18,495
Oh, Jesus!

1141
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,130
(Alarm ringing)

1142
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,700
Pop!

1143
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,001
You crazy boy. Come on.

1144
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,636
Go, go! (Sam whooping)

1145
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,138
You all right? Yeah!

1146
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,308
I'll pull you right
up, pop. Real easy.

1147
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,443
Okay. Nelson, I love you, boy!

1148
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:35,212
I love you, pop.
(Laughs joyfully)

1149
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,150
Sam: Wait for your old man.

1150
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,186
Come on, pop, let's go, come on.

1151
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,854
You outdid yourself this time.

1152
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,355
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

1153
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,492
Come on, dad.
This way, this way.

1154
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,568
(Grunts)

1155
00:58:57,735 --> 00:58:59,704
Come on, pop.
Let's go. Let's go!

1156
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,005
(Grunts) You all right?

1157
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,506
You all right? Come on. Come on.

1158
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,008
Up and over, dad.

1159
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,043
(Grunting)

1160
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,084
Come on, dad.
This way, this way.

1161
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,686
Pop, come on, hurry up!

1162
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,097
(Sighs)

1163
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,502
(Grunts)

1164
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,038
Pop, come on, hurry up!

1165
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,073
(Yells)

1166
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,680
(Screams)

1167
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,787
Hey, pop, can you handle this?

1168
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:51,288
Hey, after the bridge...

1169
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:53,290
It ain't shit.

1170
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,961
(Both yelling)

1171
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,029
Nelson: Dad! Dad!

1172
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:00,631
(Grunting)

1173
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:01,966
You all right?

1174
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:03,267
Come on, dad. Come on.

1175
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,735
Let's go, pop. Let's go. Whoa!

1176
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,106
Let's go. Come on.

1177
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,577
Jesus!

1178
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,079
Don't look down, pop.

1179
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,086
Yeah, come on.

1180
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,254
Lorraine: Come on!

1181
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,725
Get in and get down.

1182
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:30,394
(Tires screeching)

1183
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,503
Hey. Thanks for
helping out, Lorraine.

1184
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,806
Still got that same old
Japanese bomb, huh?

1185
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:45,575
Good cars. Damn good cars.

1186
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:46,844
What?

1187
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,946
I better stay out of sight.

1188
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:50,114
(Sighs)

1189
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,481
Yeah.

1190
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,501
Hey, pop, how come you
never told me about her?

1191
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:12,635
Oh, didn't I?

1192
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,504
Huh. It must have
slipped my mind.

1193
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:15,639
Come on.

1194
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,342
Come on, pop.

1195
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,146
Ooh.

1196
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:26,283
Whoo. So, this is home, huh?

1197
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,653
You shouldn't use four-letters
words in front of your son.

1198
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:30,821
(Chuckles)

1199
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,791
Well, I like it.

1200
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,560
Don't like it too much, you
won't be staying very long.

1201
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:38,695
Nelson. Yeah.

1202
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,998
You think your dad and I
could have a minute alone?

1203
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,299
Sure. Oh, no, no.

1204
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,734
Why doesn't he stick around?

1205
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,581
No, no, pop, listen, I
got a new game plan.

1206
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,947
We'll talk about it later.
You guys talk, okay?

1207
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:48,005
Nelson. Nelson. What?

1208
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,007
Look, I just got
back from jail, man!

1209
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,142
I want to see all the
friendly faces I can.

1210
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,514
Tell me, Sam,

1211
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,684
is this what you've been
up to for the last 12 years?

1212
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:01,919
Robbing banks?

1213
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:03,988
Of course not.

1214
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:05,655
I mean, not the whole time.

1215
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,091
Yeah.

1216
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,693
I guess the rest of the
time you spent in jail.

1217
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:11,661
Before this, we
never got caught.

1218
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,563
Ever. Oh, Jesus.

1219
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,169
Mmm, you still
look good, Lorraine.

1220
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,442
I knew this town was
going to bring us bad luck.

1221
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:29,279
Luck? This has
nothing to do with luck!

1222
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:31,748
You left me, Sam.

1223
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:33,851
Did you ever think that
maybe I did this for you?

1224
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:35,018
Oh, please.

1225
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,220
I mean, you were good.

1226
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,355
You had a shot
at a singing career.

1227
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,834
How're you gonna get that running
from town to town with a four-year-old son?

1228
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,527
I want you to listen to me, Sam.

1229
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:47,798
The only reason that I
helped get you out of jail

1230
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:53,037
is because I know that you are
the only one that boy will listen to.

1231
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:56,406
You have had 12 years with him,

1232
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,143
and it's my turn.

1233
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,777
I'm keeping him.

1234
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,114
(Sighs)

1235
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:09,153
Now I know that you probably
did the best that you could.

1236
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:13,323
But any kid

1237
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,927
who hasn't been taught anything
but how to heat up a can of spaghettios

1238
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:21,165
and Rob a bank is not gonna
end up anything but a bum.

1239
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,668
Or a dead bum.

1240
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:28,805
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1241
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:32,476
Neither am I, Lorraine.

1242
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,816
Hyah!

1243
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,452
(Karate yells)

1244
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:49,026
(Thuds) (Groans)

1245
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,194
Oh, it's you.

1246
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,661
Sorry.

1247
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:53,363
You have a funny
way of showin' it.

1248
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,499
I was just practicing.

1249
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,667
(Karate yells)

1250
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,503
(Mumbles in fear)

1251
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,439
So?

1252
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:03,874
Did you find her?

1253
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,210
I found her.

1254
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:07,711
Yeah, and?

1255
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:09,947
She's singing at the
canyon bar and grill.

1256
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:11,215
Perfect.

1257
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,625
You know, since
we got some time,

1258
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,318
maybe we could play...

1259
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,321
(Karate yell)

1260
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,956
I'm gonna go floss.

1261
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:25,395
(Knocking)

1262
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:26,897
Nelson: Password?

1263
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:31,368
"No buttheads allowed."
Perfect. Come on in, pop.

1264
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,903
Hey.

1265
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,804
Dad, dad. Come here,
come here. Come here.

1266
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:37,407
She beats the hell out
of bazooka-tits, you know.

1267
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,941
All right, pop, I
gotta talk to you.

1268
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:41,045
There's been a major
change in my life. Major.

1269
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:43,680
I look different, too. My eyes
look a little glazy or something?

1270
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,183
No, no. Why? Ah, come on, pop.

1271
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,851
(Sighs) Hmm?

1272
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:50,754
I got laid!

1273
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,698
(Chuckling) That's right,
baby. I got the power.

1274
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,559
I did it, dad. I broke the
cherry. I leaped the canyon!

1275
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,028
And it was good. Yeah, yeah.

1276
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:00,264
Yeah. Whoo!

1277
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,831
You got the feeling, right?

1278
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,434
Oh! Did I get the
feeling, pop. (Laughing)

1279
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,370
I'm proud of you. Thanks, pop.

1280
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:08,405
Hey, I got some news for you.

1281
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:09,673
What's wrong?

1282
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,675
I was just talking
to Lorraine...

1283
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,010
Yeah?

1284
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:16,880
And, um... she wants you
to stay with her for a while.

1285
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:20,017
And I thought
about it, and I agree.

1286
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:22,419
Pop, why did you agree?

1287
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,522
I thought it was
the right thing.

1288
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:28,692
That's a shitty thing to
do, dad. Watch your mouth.

1289
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,536
No, I'm serous, pop.
Now, you watch my mouth.

1290
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,396
What's wrong with you, pop?

1291
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:34,098
Man, I break
your ass out of jail,

1292
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,933
you turn your back on me all of
a sudden, man, what's going on?

1293
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:40,304
And this chick, Lorraine.
Who is Lorraine?

1294
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,206
Pop, she's not
like us, you know?

1295
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,373
She is like us.

1296
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:44,975
No, she's not, dad.

1297
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:46,443
She's your mother.

1298
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,712
What?

1299
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:50,480
Nelson...

1300
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:53,550
I just wanted you to be with me.

1301
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,586
Are you telling me
Lorraine's my mom?

1302
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:59,923
My real mom? I have a mom?

1303
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:07,897
And you lied to me.

1304
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,068
You lied to me...

1305
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,906
How do I trust you now, pop?

1306
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:21,511
I can't trust you now.

1307
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,418
Do you mind getting
out of my room?

1308
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:31,821
A stutter, pop?

1309
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:43,667
What?

1310
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,270
You know where
the money is buried.

1311
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,138
(Scoffs)

1312
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:50,274
Great.

1313
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,708
Thanks.

1314
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,885
(Door closes)

1315
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,460
(Country music
playing in distance)

1316
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,696
Tony: There she is.

1317
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,706
I told you she
gets off at 10:00.

1318
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:26,210
Lilly: Lead us
to that little shit.

1319
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,977
(Chuckling)

1320
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:53,002
Nelson? Hi.

1321
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:55,372
What are you lookin' at?

1322
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,374
Oh, I'm just
looking at pictures.

1323
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,742
(Chuckling)

1324
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:00,710
(Door rattling)

1325
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,746
Dad's back?

1326
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,581
Sam?

1327
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,082
(Grunting)

1328
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,352
Come on, buddy, let's
go. Come on, move it!

1329
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:09,618
Out!

1330
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,188
Nelson! (Cries out)

1331
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,893
(Groans)

1332
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,672
Don't hang up, don't hang up. I'm just
calling to find out how Nelson's doing.

1333
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,198
Nelson is gone, Sam.

1334
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:22,418
What do you mean, he's gone?

1335
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:23,967
Two people came
in here with guns,

1336
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,270
she kicked me in the
stomach and they took him.

1337
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,104
I couldn't stop them!

1338
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:30,783
(Breathing heavily) I couldn't very
well call the police now, could I?

1339
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,685
How long would it take
to get to salt lake city?

1340
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,478
I don't know, two hours.

1341
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,947
Good. Then do it. I want you to bring
Nelson's notes, maps, atlas, everything.

1342
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,084
You know that little cafe
on main and south temple?

1343
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,552
Yeah. You meet me there.

1344
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:43,719
And Lorraine? What?

1345
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:45,088
Drive like I taught you.

1346
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,625
Right down...

1347
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:52,962
That's got to be it.

1348
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,066
No, Nelson would never do that.

1349
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:00,670
Maybe 10...

1350
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,072
10...

1351
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,277
No, bridge.

1352
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,646
We don't do Bridges.

1353
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,151
Thank you. You're welcome.

1354
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:18,955
Are you sure this is what
he was working on yesterday?

1355
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,590
This is the stuff
that was on top.

1356
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,526
I'd assume that's what
he was working on.

1357
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,161
Well, it doesn't make any
sense, 'cause it's not his style.

1358
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:26,330
His style?

1359
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,631
Look, Nelson is very careful.

1360
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,633
He always planned
everything we got into.

1361
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:31,635
But I don't know these places.

1362
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:36,540
Are you trying to tell me that you
let Nelson plan your robberies?

1363
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,041
Yeah, sort of.

1364
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,176
I can't believe
you're for real, Sam.

1365
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,879
Lorraine, these two
people, Lilly and Tony...

1366
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:44,714
Yeah. They're dumb.

1367
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,283
So that makes them dangerous.

1368
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,428
We gotta find where Nelson's
gonna be and get there.

1369
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:50,354
He's got val verda,

1370
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:52,856
woods cross, Taylorsville,

1371
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,325
and a thing for the
salt lake amphitheater.

1372
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:56,460
What?

1373
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,562
(Chuckles)

1374
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,197
Here it is.

1375
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,566
Salt lake amphitheater.

1376
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,301
Concert today. Huh?

1377
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:08,071
The salt lake city amphitheater
seats 8,000 people.

1378
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,374
At $15 a head,
that's quite a haul.

1379
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:13,176
We don't do concerts,
we're bank robbers.

1380
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:16,813
(Sighs)

1381
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,651
(Rock music playing)

1382
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:37,367
You know, plaque is a leading
cause of gum disease in adults today.

1383
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,375
Me and Lilly are doing it.

1384
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:47,844
Where is my kid?

1385
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:51,080
Oh! Well, he's
working for us now.

1386
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:53,683
But with just one
small difference.

1387
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,519
Money in the bag, boys.

1388
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,086
Or I'll blow us all up.

1389
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,363
Tony: Here comes your
walking firebomb now.

1390
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,254
How you doin', pop?

1391
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,424
Lilly: Get in.

1392
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,160
Get in.

1393
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,270
Now, back up.

1394
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:48,505
The kid's loaded.

1395
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,106
You know I'll do it.

1396
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,274
Back up!

1397
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:58,448
Use it if Sam
tries to be a hero.

1398
01:11:58,582 --> 01:11:59,683
I don't want this.

1399
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,184
Now, move it!

1400
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,186
(Car engine starting)

1401
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:15,699
(Sirens wailing)

1402
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,377
It's my fault, Lorraine.

1403
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,145
I know it's your fault, Sam.

1404
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,456
And they're going to kill him.

1405
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:41,625
No, they can't set
off that dynamite.

1406
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:42,805
They'll blow themselves up.

1407
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,127
Yeah, then they'll toss him.

1408
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,029
He's their protection
from the police.

1409
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:47,697
When did you get so logical?

1410
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,365
Nelson taught me good.

1411
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
Move it!

1412
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:53,002
What?

1413
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:01,878
You still got the
kid's road atlas?

1414
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,680
Yeah, I got it right down here.

1415
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,049
Good. We're gonna try to
figure out his escape route.

1416
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,217
His escape route?

1417
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,295
Yeah, it's a bunch of lines
marked with a red marker.

1418
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,356
Okay. Oh. Here's the salt lake
amphitheater. He circled that,

1419
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,323
north on 107,

1420
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:16,660
and then south on old sole...

1421
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:18,327
I got it. Old sole
road. Right, right.

1422
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,413
Lorraine: You think you can
get around them and cut 'em off?

1423
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,505
Piece of cake.

1424
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,221
(Gunshot)

1425
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,428
(Gunshot)

1426
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,298
Where in the hell are they?

1427
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,066
(Gunshots)

1428
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,535
Man: Jesus Christ!

1429
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,946
(Both cheering)

1430
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,484
Sam!

1431
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,820
Sam: Right on time.

1432
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,130
Shit.

1433
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,232
Move it!

1434
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,500
I'm going!

1435
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:31,635
She's crazy!

1436
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:32,768
Come here, you brat!

1437
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:33,903
Sam!

1438
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,238
Dad!

1439
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,506
(Yells)

1440
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:38,107
Shit! Dad!

1441
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:41,110
I'll give you your dad,
kid. I'll blow you both up!

1442
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,413
Look, Lilly...

1443
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:51,588
I'm gonna pull up.

1444
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,092
Oh!

1445
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,126
Oh!

1446
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,095
Sam: Hold on, Nelson!

1447
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:00,797
Nelson: Oh, god! No, dad!

1448
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,131
Hold on, boy!

1449
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,167
Come on!

1450
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,370
Nelson: Whoa!

1451
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:08,972
Oh, my...

1452
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,607
(Screaming)

1453
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,543
Hold on, Nelson!

1454
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,313
Watch out!

1455
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:19,649
(Gunshot)

1456
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,518
(Gunshot)

1457
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:24,353
All right, I'm gonna
make the move now.

1458
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,556
Yeah, dad!

1459
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,491
You're with me like
the old days, right?

1460
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:29,626
(Gunshot)

1461
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:30,994
All right now, take it.

1462
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,071
(Gunshots)

1463
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:47,310
(Gunshot)

1464
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,680
(Grunting)

1465
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:52,649
Nelson: Yeah!

1466
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:54,417
(Groaning)

1467
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:57,520
(Horn blaring)

1468
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:58,688
(Screaming)

1469
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,490
(Grunting)

1470
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:04,093
Come on, Sam.

1471
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,365
(Screaming)

1472
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,513
Whoa!

1473
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,795
Ah, no!

1474
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,363
Yes!

1475
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:41,530
Yeah!

1476
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:42,699
(Groaning)

1477
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:43,900
Lilly!

1478
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,534
(Tires screeching)

1479
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:48,137
Lilly: Tony!

1480
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:50,539
Nelson!

1481
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,275
Dad! Hold on!

1482
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:53,576
Dad!

1483
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,313
Give me the dynamite, boy.

1484
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,481
Hold on!

1485
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,983
Hang on, baby!

1486
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,319
(Yelling) No!

1487
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:08,892
God...

1488
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,094
Sam: Lorraine!

1489
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,067
Come on.

1490
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:20,469
Leave me alone!

1491
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:23,239
Come on, Sam.

1492
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,742
(Yelling)

1493
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:36,686
(Yells indistinctly)

1494
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,524
(Nelson yelling)

1495
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:42,759
Lorraine!

1496
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:45,261
(Screaming)

1497
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,539
(Screaming)

1498
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,795
Sam: Don't let go, boy!

1499
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:27,503
The dynamite, Nelson!

1500
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:28,671
The dynamite.

1501
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:33,242
Dad, I got it!

1502
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:34,744
Sam: Move!

1503
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:38,414
Nelson: Get him, dad!

1504
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:16,185
Oh, Lorraine.

1505
01:19:21,024 --> 01:19:22,258
Are you alive?

1506
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,559
I don't know. Am I moving?

1507
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,261
Only when you bleed.
Where's Nelson?

1508
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,428
Oh, Jesus.

1509
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:27,730
Baby, are you all right?

1510
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:29,032
Come here, boy.

1511
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:30,399
She broke my rib, pop.

1512
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:31,767
Take it easy, take it easy.

1513
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,569
You got him? Yeah.

1514
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,776
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1515
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:42,378
(Nelson groaning)

1516
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:44,413
You'll be okay.

1517
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:46,883
You're all right now.

1518
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:55,224
Tony: Wait,
guys, I'm still here!

1519
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,894
I'm down here, don't leave!

1520
01:19:58,327 --> 01:19:59,595
Help!

1521
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:01,564
Oh, come on!

1522
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,100
It was Lilly's idea.
She's the bad one.

1523
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:05,434
(Sirens wailing)

1524
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,937
Oh, no... I'm going,
I’m... The cops!

1525
01:20:08,104 --> 01:20:09,805
We're family!

1526
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,941
(Screaming)

1527
01:20:12,075 --> 01:20:13,609
Come on... fire!

1528
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:14,978
Help!

1529
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,512
Please!

1530
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,615
Oh, no!

1531
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,587
Nelson: You know, I always
wanted to see Canada, pop.

1532
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:27,023
Sam: You know, Nelson,
they don't have cops here.

1533
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,357
They got mounties.

1534
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,825
What's a Mountie?

1535
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,765
(Country music playing on radio)

1536
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:41,437
How am I suppose to...

1537
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:43,772
(Rock music playing)

1538
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:48,177
That's right. It
has a little beat...

1539
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,688
(Country music playing)
What are you doing?

1540
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,981
Dad, your stuff has no
rhythm, it has nothing.

1541
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:53,282
It has no meaning.

1542
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:54,850
Ask your mom what
she wants to hear.

1543
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,695
Mom, you don't wanna
hear this, right? I'm out of this.

1544
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,297
(Rock music playing)
This right here, see?

1545
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1546
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,491
(Sighs)

1547
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:04,493
Got a problem with this, pop?

1548
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,463
I love it, I love it.

1549
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,864
You should love it, you know?

1550
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:10,033
Right. Mmm-hmm.

1551
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:12,035
Gives me constipation.

1552
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,536
(Laughing)

1553
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:17,740
Then pull up and buy something.
What do you want me to do?

1554
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:19,976
(Stations changing)

1555
01:21:24,147 --> 01:21:25,147
(Country music playing)

1556
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,415
No, no, boy!

1557
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,084
Don't do it!

1558
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:29,585
(Laughing)

1559
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:31,754
(Rock music playing)

1560
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:32,921
Yeah.

1561
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:34,390
Nelson. Yeah.

1562
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:37,260
Nelson, did you bring those,
uh, did you bring any maps,

1563
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,228
or atlases for Canada?

1564
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:40,863
Uh, you guys.

1565
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:43,866
From now on, I'm calling
the shots around here, okay?

1566
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:46,902
You guys are going straight
while you can still breathe.

1567
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,172
You're absolutely right,
Lorraine. I know I am.

1568
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,274
We outgrew the business
anyway, right, Nelson?

1569
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,009
Oh, yeah, right, pop.

1570
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,087
You see, robberies, they're just
not as easy as they used to be.

1571
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:56,922
Did you see that helicopter,
how quick it was there?

1572
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,681
Damn computers. Computers.

1573
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,183
Computers. Computers.

1574
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:03,752
Crooks don't stand a fair
chance in a modern world.

1575
01:22:08,024 --> 01:22:10,459
But in a less
sophisticated society,

1576
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,361
that'll be a... Hey!

1577
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,765
