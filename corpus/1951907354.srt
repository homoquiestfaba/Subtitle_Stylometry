- Oh, a subspecies. Wonderful!

is older, which is a little weird.

I'm riding my bike down this steep hill,

691
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,966
Yeah. The <i>WildCatter</i> wanted that,
but I gave it to the yearbook.

what to do!

00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:12,800
Me?

854
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:15,287
I'm not the one
with the attitude problem around here.

855
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:17,150
- Excuse me?
- Hey, why don't you announce

856
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,738
the Sara and Josh club meeting
in the darkroom?

857
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,143
- That would be great.
- What is going on?

858
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,276
Maybe you should just go
to the dance by yourself.

859
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:29,177
Look, I thought we were
on the same wavelength here, but...

860
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,777
Same wavelength?

861
00:52:32,578 --> 00:52:34,782
I guess I was wrong.

862
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,759
I'm gonna go do some stuff.

863
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:42,107
Like what?
Hang out in your janky darkroom

864
00:52:42,178 --> 00:52:44,545
and play with your stupid puzzles?

865
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:53,239
GIRL 1: Get the ball. Go!

866
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:54,720
Right behind you. Come on!

867
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:57,306
GIRL 2: Here. Regina!

868
00:52:57,378 --> 00:52:58,752
- Here. Here, here!
- GIRL 3: Sara!

869
00:52:58,817 --> 00:52:59,897
Sara!

870
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:08,893
LORI: Lexi, in for Sara. Sara, over here.

871
00:53:09,985 --> 00:53:11,840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

872
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:14,585
We need to talk.

873
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,653
So, what's going on?

874
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:22,431
I'm just tired. Been training with my dad.

875
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:27,358
I played four years for your father at Cal.
He pushed us hard.

876
00:53:27,425 --> 00:53:30,393
But I was 20 years old
and I knew what I wanted.

877
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,379
Meaning?

878
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,283
You need to think about
where you want to be with this sport,

879
00:53:36,353 --> 00:53:37,629
what you want out of it.

880
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,258
My dad does that.

881
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:41,469
Maybe you should be in on it.

882
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:44,767
Lori, my dad's training can get me
on the National Team.

883
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:47,649
But if you really want to play at that level,
it can't be to please your dad.

884
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:50,299
This is what I want, Lori.

885
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,857
Look, I'll train harder, okay?

886
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,482
You still don't know how good you are.

887
00:53:57,441 --> 00:54:00,441
There comes a time
when you have to lead your life, Sara,

888
00:54:00,513 --> 00:54:02,171
not just follow it.

889
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:18,778
- Hey, kiddo, what's up?
- The usual.

890
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:21,238
Hey, I got something for you.
The shoe rep dropped off a load today.

891
00:54:21,314 --> 00:54:23,288
- What do you think?
- Sweet.

892
00:54:24,225 --> 00:54:26,048
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

893
00:54:36,578 --> 00:54:37,920
Right at me!

894
00:54:38,113 --> 00:54:39,095
(EXCLAIMS)

895
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,024
Nice shot. Right at me!

896
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,143
Not much of a goalkeeper.

897
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:48,895
Yeah. Regina says he's the only Brazilian
who can't play soccer.

898
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,383
See how she keeps her head down low?

899
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:53,371
(GROANS)

900
00:54:56,865 --> 00:55:00,608
So, when did you know you wanted
to make soccer your whole life?

901
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:05,725
I don't know. Junior year in high school.
Quit football, found soccer.

902
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:09,464
I cared more about soccer
than anything else.

903
00:55:09,537 --> 00:55:10,552
You still do.

904
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:15,165
Well, I like to think there's some things
I care about more, like my daughter.

905
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:17,303
And Mom?

906
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:21,174
Sara, it's not like we're running out
to get a divorce, okay?

907
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:24,118
We just need some time to sort things out.

908
00:55:24,193 --> 00:55:25,240
Okay.

909
00:55:27,713 --> 00:55:29,371
(REGINA EXCLAIMING)

910
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,704
So, high school, soccer...

911
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:34,843
Great players back then,
Pel, Maradona, Beckenbauer.

912
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:38,175
They were gods on the field.

913
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:41,303
And you were a god, too, right?

914
00:55:41,377 --> 00:55:43,352
Well, it was pretty cool.

915
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,230
I know.

916
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,247
When I'm on the field,
I don't even have to think.

917
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:51,071
- I just go.
- I know.

918
00:55:51,137 --> 00:55:52,315
But you gave it up.

919
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:55,582
Well, not much choice there, kiddo.

920
00:55:58,081 --> 00:55:59,804
REGINA'S FATHER: Come on. Right at me.

921
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:04,282
Dad, there are other things
we can talk about besides soccer, right?

922
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:07,320
- Of course.
- Like things happening in the world?

923
00:56:08,578 --> 00:56:10,171
- Sure.
- Like what?

924
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:14,170
Like... Like everything. Like... I don't know.

925
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:17,537
Manchester United may trade
Wayne Rooney to Juventus.

926
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:20,568
- Lame, Dad. Lame.
- Well, okay. Hang on. Hang on.

927
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,814
- Come on. Come on, you can get it.
- REGINA'S FATHER: Come on, right at me.

928
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:28,191
Oh, man.
Her arms are flailing all over the place.

929
00:56:28,257 --> 00:56:29,784
She's got to keep her upper body quiet...

930
00:56:29,858 --> 00:56:31,199
- Dad!
- What?

931
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:42,871
Hey, forgetting something?

932
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:46,173
- Later, dude.
- Love you, kiddo.

933
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:07,226
What do you mean, Florida?

934
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,948
I thought you said that the National Team
trains right here in California.

935
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:12,254
It's a brand-new training center,
just for women.

936
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:15,038
State of the art facilities,
sports medicine, everything she needs.

937
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:16,763
Everything she needs, 3,000 miles away.

938
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,768
- Okay, it's a bit of a challenge.
- As if we need more challenges right now!

939
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:22,459
- But it is such an opportunity!
- For who?

940
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:25,759
She's been playing soccer
since she could walk, Gil.

941
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:29,022
- Why can't you just give it a couple years?
- Who knows where she'll be then?

942
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:32,701
Julia, she can play with the best players
in the country right now.

943
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:35,486
Great. And then we'll all be living alone.

944
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,658
Don't blame soccer for that.

945
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:38,939
I don't.

946
00:57:40,097 --> 00:57:42,715
I just wanna know where this is headed.

947
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:48,797
I gotta get back to work.

948
00:57:55,329 --> 00:57:59,388
You are looking so fine today, babe.
Like you could be a supermodel!

949
00:58:01,185 --> 00:58:05,015
- What is that about?
- It's just the Doogster. He's harmless.

950
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:09,752
So what's up with photo boy?
You've been suspiciously silent.

951
00:58:09,825 --> 00:58:10,905
I don't even know.

952
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:14,938
He asked me to the dance
and then totally ditched me.

953
00:58:15,009 --> 00:58:18,205
- Well, some guys are just whack.
- Not me, doll.

954
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:21,819
No way I'd treat major babes like you
with such disrespect.

955
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:25,337
Do you mind?
This is a private conversation, junior.

956
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:30,456
You have to go to the dance.
I did the decorations!

957
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:33,398
No guy wants to dance
with a jock, or jock-ette.

958
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:35,895
Sara, you're not just a jock-ette.

959
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:39,998
It would be complete poetic justice
if you showed up at the dance

960
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:43,381
and Josh would see
all these guys checking you out.

961
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:44,918
'Cause that'll happen.

962
00:58:44,993 --> 00:58:46,881
You don't have a clue, do you?

963
00:58:46,945 --> 00:58:49,400
Just let the Tutster work her magic.

964
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,272
I don't know about this, Tuts.

965
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:00,825
Don't freak out. This color is so you.

966
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:02,588
Hey. What's going on?

967
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:05,024
Just making your daughter
drop-dead gorgeous, Mrs. Davis.

968
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:07,707
- Mission impossible, right, Mom?
- Not at all.

969
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,500
Hey, can I help?

970
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,352
All right, I may be your mom,
but I still know a few tricks.

971
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:15,417
Well, actually, we could use some help
on some clothes.

972
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:17,344
Yeah, I got some ideas.

973
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:24,063
(INAUDIBLE)

974
00:59:39,873 --> 00:59:42,808
- And they said it couldn't be done.
- Mom, what do you think?

975
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:45,183
You know, I used to wear that skirt
when I went out with your father.

976
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,256
You know what, Mrs. Davis,
you had some style.

977
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:49,631
Well, Sara's dad noticed me.

978
00:59:49,697 --> 00:59:52,958
And you're gonna get noticed plenty, too.
Believe me.

979
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:56,214
(MUSIC PLAYING)

980
01:00:01,729 --> 01:00:03,965
That's my babe. Awesome, huh?

981
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:05,692
Come on.

982
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:07,577
DOOGIE: Sara!

983
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:10,814
Hey, I was just chilling with my posse.

984
01:00:10,881 --> 01:00:13,783
Didn't expect to see
you fine ladies here tonight.

985
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:15,384
You are not talking to us.

986
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:18,970
Come on, just do me this one little favor.
Walk in with me.

987
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,830
You can't be serious.

988
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:24,246
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, just let me walk in with you,

989
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,361
and I'll disappear from your lives forever.

990
01:00:26,433 --> 01:00:29,182
And, you know,
we don't have to dance much.

991
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:30,973
It can't hurt.

992
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:34,205
Sweet! Yes! All right, come on.

993
01:00:34,273 --> 01:00:35,996
So what's your sign?

994
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:39,798
<i>(SINGING) Another way to like you</i>
<i>Another way to love you</i>

995
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:41,400
<i>Uh-huh</i>

996
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:45,306
<i>And I still can't say the words</i>

997
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:48,410
<i>I still can't find the words</i>
<i>Oh, no</i>

998
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:54,044
Okay, Be Kind to Geek Day is now over.

999
01:00:57,249 --> 01:01:00,478
Tutti, this is so cool.

1000
01:01:00,545 --> 01:01:03,065
Yeah, just call me the dancing queen.

1001
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:10,010
Oh, don't look now,
but tamale boys are drooling with regret.

1002
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:19,034

01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:34,396
<i>Let you know</i>

1006
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:38,528
Hi.

1007
01:01:38,593 --> 01:01:41,113
Who's this? She's cute.

1008
01:01:41,185 --> 01:01:42,843
Sara, from the soccer team.

1009
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:44,855
- No way.
- Yes, way.

1010
01:01:44,929 --> 01:01:48,158
I can't believe it. Where's your boyfriend?

1011
01:01:48,224 --> 01:01:49,785
You know,
the one who takes all the pictures

1012
01:01:49,857 --> 01:01:52,061
and kisses like a dead squid.

1013
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,656
What are you talking about?

1014
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:57,112
Ask your friend.
I heard it from her. Come on.

1015
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:03,930
- What?
- What did you tell her?

1016
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:05,408
What do you mean? How should I know?

1017
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:07,098
Tutti, that information was private!

1018
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:09,079
- You promised!
- But I didn't...

1019
01:02:09,153 --> 01:02:12,830
That's why Josh won't even talk to me.

Come in.

01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:42,230
Hi.

1361
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,202
Congratulations.

01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:47,449
Thanks.

1363
01:32:49,056 --> 01:32:51,259
What's going on around here?

1364
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,913
Just moving on a little.

1365
01:32:55,743 --> 01:32:58,165
So do you think I made the right decision?

1366
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,287
Yeah.

1367
01:33:01,087 --> 01:33:02,516

Well, I thought you'd be packing your bags

01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:11,028
No, but I might help Regina.

01:33:12,096 --> 01:33:13,918
Wait. What do you mean?

1371
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:17,815
Didn't you see? She made the final goal.
It's her ticket to Florida.

1372
01:33:17,887 --> 01:33:20,156
Wait. Regina made the goal?

1373
01:33:20,223 --> 01:33:23,639
So that means she's gonna...
So you'll be staying...

1374
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:25,915
I'll be taking my camera out of its box,

1375
01:33:25,983 --> 01:33:28,951
doing some dancing,
going to school, and just...
