1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,865
So Mr. Harrington...

2
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,698
Uh, wait a minute.
Dr. Nourmand?

3
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,135
Yes?

4
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,934
Can you just call me Solo?

5
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,302
Why?

6
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,437
Well, a-aside from the fact
that it's my name, I've...

7
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,811
I've just been coming
here for almost a year now

8
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,181
and, uh, frankly, this could be...

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,446
this could be it for us.

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,044
So I was just wondering
if we could just end

11
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,885
on a less formal note, you know?

12
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,583
Oh. Uh...

13
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,626
Yeah.

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,787
Sure.

15
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,228
- Well...
- Yeah, I... I can call you Solo.

16
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,026
Great.
Okay, good, good.

17
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,199
And you are...

18
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,865
I'm still Dr. Nourmand.

19
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:16,942
Okay.

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,349
I, uh, I got...
I got you this jacket.

21
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,147
Oh... Well...

22
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,618
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,211
I can't accept it, uh...

24
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,188
but it is a very nice gesture, nonetheless.

25
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,623
Thank you.

26
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,992
I... I think you should just take the jacket.

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,065
W-why?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,991
Because I bought it for you.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,695
Well, do you do that often?

30
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,862
I mean, do you buy gifts...

31
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,939
No.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,098
For your... for your friends...

33
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,175
- No.
- Family?

34
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,242
- No. No, no, no.
- No?

35
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,367
Just this.

36
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,840
What about this being it?

37
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,447
Well, I... you know, I just...

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,487
I just spend a very large
portion of my time here.

39
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,887
And, uh, you know, to be honest,

40
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,980
I was just walking down the street

41
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,150
and I saw the jacket in...

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,227
in the window and...
- Oh, no.

43
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,317
I thought it would look nice on you

44
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,691
I don't know,
I think you just take the jacket.

45
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,059
No, no, no, I...
I... I am.

46
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,792
I'm considering that.
But I meant...

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,629
I meant "this", as in our time here.

48
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,362
Oh!
Oh, oh.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,665
Well, yeah, I've just run out of money.

50
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,137
I'm broke.

51
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,306
Five days a week here for almost a year

52
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,241
just added up a lot quicker
than I thought it would and...

53
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,143
Yeah.
How do you feel about that?

54
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,374
Fucked.
I feel fucked.

55
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,449
I mean... No, I feel... no, I feel...
- Fucked?

56
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,348
- I feel better than I did, right?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,047
But... but now what, right?

58
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,089
Well, what do you think?

59
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,729
Uh, well, you know, I... I mean, I...

60
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,802
I... I could...

61
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,667
I'm going to start writing again.

62
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,966
Try to make a little money.

63
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,040
Well, that's good.

64
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,506
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's very good.

65
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,837
Yeah.

66
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,211
Yeah, I'll call you when that happens.

67
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,288
Do you ever consider getting a pet, Solo?

68
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,757
What?

69
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,402
Out of the way, jerk-off!

70
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,608
You know, pal, uh...

71
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,513
The best thing about buying a dog

72
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,177
is that, uh, you can always get rid of it.

73
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,312
I mean, if you don't like it.

74
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,983
The dog, I mean.

75
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,018
When'd you get that jacket?

76
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,263
This is Jonesy.

77
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,600
You're listening to Jonesy's Jukebox.

78
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,435
It's a beautiful day in L.A.

79
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,065
Fucking hell.

80
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,710
Why are there so many people here, man?

81
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,509
Well, that's the thing about these places:

82
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,583
a lot of people, you know?

83
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,346
Some good, some not so good,

84
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,752
and some just pure fantasia.
Jesus Christ!

85
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,552
That never happens to me... ever.

86
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,523
Oh, my God!
Hello.

87
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,495
Wait a minute.
She might have been the one.

88
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,064
- I think I need to go back.
- What?

89
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,154
That was the one.
That was the one.

90
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,528
I got to go grab her.
I got to get her.

91
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,623
- I do.
- No, you got to be kidding me.

92
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,702
- Come on.
- Listen, you don't need me.

93
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,100
You don't need me, okay?

94
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,398
Just grab the first one
that looks at you funny.

95
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,133
You ever heard the term
"puppy dog eyes"?

96
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,469
It comes from a place.

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,542
That's the place.

98
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,803
I'll be right back.

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,878
I love you. You're good.

100
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:53,946
You're <i>good.</i>

101
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,889
Mom!
You said you were going to get it for me.

102
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,883
All right, here's the thing, Brad.

103
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,616
I just need a... a simple dog, you know?

104
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,659
One that doesn't require a
whole lot of maintenance.

105
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,629
Uh, low energy, uh,
doesn't need a lot of stuff.

106
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,755
You know, I have a balcony,

107
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,493
so one that can use the balcony

108
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,398
to use the bathroom would be great.

109
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,471
Uh, you know, just a...

110
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,006
a dog that doesn't need to
go outside too much. Or ever.

111
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,369
That would be great, too.

112
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,102
Okay, Brad?

113
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,577
What do you say, Brad?

114
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,378
I really should have come in with you.

115
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,318
What's that supposed to mean?

116
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,944
Nothing.
It means nothing.

117
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,147
What?
You don't like the dog?

118
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,020
Oh no, it's a cool dog.

119
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,820
It's cool.

120
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,124
Seems calm enough.

121
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,664
It's just really little.

122
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,357
Well, it's a puppy.
I mean...

123
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,094
No.
I... I know.

124
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,191
No, no, no.
Hey...

125
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,292
Hey, you know what?

126
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,167
It's about... you like her, I like her.

127
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,297
It's a he.
It's a boy dog.

128
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,500
He. Boy. Dog.

129
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,004
Pal, I just want you to be happy.

130
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,079
Okay.

131
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,272
Are you happy?

132
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,848
Look, he likes you.

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,076
I... can you hold the dog?

134
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,379
- But he likes you.
- I'm driving the car.

135
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,647
But he wants to go to Daddy.
What's wrong with that?

136
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,779
He doesn't want to be on...

137
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,222
on... on uncle's lap.
He wants to go...

138
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,758
He wants to go in the back, apparently.
Okay.

139
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,361
Is he going to shit?

140
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,660
Okay, you've got to be kidding me.

141
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,289
No! No!

142
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,766
Hi, Brad.
It's Solo.

143
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,361
Uh, yeah, the Tongan terrier.

144
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,736
Well, uh, yeah, you know,
I tried that crate thing

145
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,433
that you told me about

146
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,477
and he just went to the
bathroom all over the bathroom.

147
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,773
Well, yeah, see, that's the thing.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,972
I didn't have a crate so I just...

149
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,446
I thought the bathroom would suffice.

150
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,244
Uh, no, I don't want to buy a crate.

151
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,685
Well, just because I don't
have room for a crate.

152
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,289
Okay, well, I'm sure the crates

153
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,619
are very decorative, Brad, but...

154
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,750
Brad, I don't want to buy a crate.

155
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,884
Stop trying to sell me a crate.

156
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,223
Okay, give me the shoe.

157
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,388
Put the shoe down.

158
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,464
Put the...

159
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,055
Yeah, hi, is this Brad?

160
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,828
Well, Brad, you fucked me, pal.

161
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,869
This little thing is driving me crazy, man.

162
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,063
I mean, I... you know...

163
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,968
Hello? Hello?

164
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,543
Okay, Brad,
he's peeing on the carpet right now.

165
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,972
What the fuck is a wee-wee pad?

166
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,911
No.
I just want him to go on the balcony, man.

167
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,175
Look, you know what?

168
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,545
We talked about this and... and I just...

169
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,640
I don't think this is going to work.

170
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,844
I just...

171
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,420
Well, I don't know.
That's a good question.

172
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,488
What the hell do you want me to do?

173
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,557
I mean, can I just bring him back?

174
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,922
Hello? Hello, Brad?

175
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,585
Brad?

176
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,795
What the hell are you looking at, man?

177
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,832
Casper.

178
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,261
Casper, are you awake?

179
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,499
You up?

180
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,234
I don't know.

181
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:47,142
Pal, the dog shit all over my house.

182
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,645
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

183
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,443
Yeah, I don't... I don't know what to do.

184
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,675
I hate him.
I just...

185
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,718
I don't know what to do.

186
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,912
You want to take him back?

187
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,055
No.
I can't take him back.

188
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,123
There's no refunds.

189
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,589
Well...

190
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,895
I know this girl...

191
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,233
Did I wake you up?

192
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,631
No, no, no.

193
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,067
I just been reading and stuff.

194
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,333
So... I used to date her.

195
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,739
I used to fuck her.

196
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,969
- What?
- I don't know what I did.

197
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,375
I shot her once.
We fucked... something.

198
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,605
Man, what am I doing?

199
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,841
I can't give the dog away.
What am I doing, man?

200
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,416
You're driving the car up to the thing.

201
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,951
Come on.
Don't... don't... don't do this.

202
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,748
This is fine.
This girl does this.

203
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,980
This is what she does.

204
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,784
What do you mean?
Like, for a living?

205
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,156
Yes. No, I mean,
she doesn't make money doing it,

206
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,455
but it's what she does.

207
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,689
Right up here.
Right up here.

208
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,163
- Pull up to the thingy.
- I am!

209
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,597
- Go to the thingy.
- I don't want to hit it.

210
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,498
You're not going to hit it.
Go to the thingy.

211
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,728
Well, what does she make money doing?

212
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,429
Jesus Christ.

213
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,837
Well, her father, um, owns the rights

214
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,932
to, like,
every great rock 'n' roll song ever written,

215
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,135
among other things.

216
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,007
The guy was, like,
a major pimp in the '70s.

217
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,205
Killed people and shit.

218
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,804
- Okay, he didn't kill people.
- Yes, he did.

219
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,110
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

220
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,651
Okay, you're just making that up.

221
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,017
Okay, somehow this
man ended up owning

222
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,350
a lot of valuable stuff.

223
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,482
- Well, that's obvious.
- Thank you.

224
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,150
I got a train set once.

225
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,091
Oh, he lives here too.
He's just never around.

226
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,323
He's got a place in, what do you call it?

227
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,955
Europe or some shit... Asia.
I don't know.

228
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,033
Would you push the button, please?

229
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,226
- Let's go.
- Push the button.

230
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,700
- Let's just go.
- Push the button.

231
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,464
I don't know.

232
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,008
I'm so bored, I could kill myself.

233
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,842
I don't know, bitch.

234
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,742
Yeah, well, holler later.

235
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,612
I'm supposed to look at
this guy's dog right now.

236
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,446
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

237
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,588
Hey, bitch!

238
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,656
Hey, Jules.

239
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,724
How you been?

240
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,655
Misery.
My life's impossible.

241
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,160
I bet it is impossible.

242
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,330
What's really good, mama?

243
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,399
Come on.

244
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,467
Nothing is good.

245
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,727
You're lying.

246
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,072
So how'd those pictures turn out?

247
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,266
They are very good.

248
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,467
They're not raunchy, are they?

249
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,770
No, not at all.

250
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,937
You guys want a bevvy?

251
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,537
You want a bevvy?

252
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,412
Uh, what have you... what have you got?

253
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,008
Oh, whatever you want.

254
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,381
Well, do you have any scotch?

255
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,545
I don't know.

256
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,418
Oh.

257
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,116
Hey, are all these dogs your dogs?

258
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,249
That's right, bitch.

259
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,952
Until they get older, they are.

260
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,494
I take care of them
until they're old enough

261
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,564
they don't need caring and
then I give them away.

262
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,064
- Very noble.
- Thank you.

263
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,431
- Uh, who do you...
who do you give them to? - Whomever.

264
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,128
Well, what if you can't get rid of them?

265
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,898
Everybody wants them
when I'm done, bitch.

266
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,071
Hey, can you stop calling me bitch?

267
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,474
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

268
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,806
No, it's just I have a name.

269
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,574
Yeah, but pal... pal...

270
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,875
- She's not... she doesn't mean it...
- No, I know.

271
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,347
- ...like, "Hey, what's up, bitch?"
- I know.

272
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,077
- Or, "Where's my money, bitch?"
- I know.

273
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,483
You know what I mean?
It's like, you know...

274
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,747
- What's it like?
- I don't know.

275
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,822
Endearing.

276
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,288
Okay, well, my name is Solo.

277
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,358
Just in case...

278
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,823
Like Han Solo.

279
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,087
Not, not like Han Solo.

280
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,162
Just like Solo.

281
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,657
Where's the dog, Solo?

282
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,994
Uh, he's at home.

283
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,192
- What do you mean?
- Well, we did make an error.

284
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,269
We didn't bring her.

285
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,336
- Him.
- Him.

286
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,404
Why not?

287
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,062
- Well...
- Well, I... I don't know.

288
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,663
I just figured, you know,

289
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,106
I didn't want to bring him out
of the house for no reason.

290
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,336
I figured you'd have some questions.

291
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,570
Is he cute?

292
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,646
Yeah.
I think so. Yeah.

293
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,213
Maybe not cute so much.

294
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,339
Well...

295
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,416
What does he go with?

296
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,506
What?

297
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,585
Colours.

298
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,119
You... you mean what colour is he?

299
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,279
Yeah, sure.

300
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,618
Did you just ask,
"What does he go with"?

301
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,691
I think so.

302
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,460
I'll be in the car.

303
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,555
One second... pal.
Pal.

304
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,654
I don't know, man.

305
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,994
It just doesn't seem right.

306
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,399
You know, life is a delicate negotiation.

307
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,563
Do you understand that?

308
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,601
So...

309
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,042
What do you want to do?

310
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,703
I mean, seriously, what do you want to do?

311
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,784
All right.

312
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,716
Seriously, what do you want to do?

313
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,258
You want...
you want to give this thing a shot or what?

314
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,760
You... or do you want to end
up in some rich lady's house

315
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,524
with a bunch of other spoiled little dogs?

316
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,759
'Cause, you know, I mean,
if that's what you want, I...

317
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,129
I got you, you know.

318
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,328
I mean, you know,
do you want to shit the house

319
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,563
or do you want to let me love you?

320
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,696
Do you want to let me
learn how to love you

321
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,773
or do you want to shit the house?

322
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,898
Do you want to shit the house?

323
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,976
Do you want to nibble on sneakers?

324
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,202
I got the place for you.

325
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,938
You know what I'm saying?

326
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,651
You're a dog.

327
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,692
Yo, fucko!

328
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,785
Shh!

329
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,125
- Shh!
- Open the door!

330
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,530
Oh...

331
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,604
What the fuck is that?

332
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,570
Thanks a lot, asshole.

333
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,904
Ow! Fuck!

334
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,645
You know, Benny,
I really don't think it's appropriate,

335
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,716
you showing up at my house in
the middle of the night like this.

336
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,875
Shut the fuck up.

337
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,952
Okay, I just wanted to say it

338
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,850
just to keep my side of the street clean.

339
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,219
Can I ask you a question?

340
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,791
- What?
- Who's that?

341
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,723
That's Frank.

342
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,591
Oh, uh, Frank,
can I help you with anything?

343
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,664
Don't talk to Frank, all right.

344
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,925
Frank doesn't even speak English, okay?

345
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,523
Frank doesn't speak English?

346
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,626
Yeah, Frank...
Who else would I be talking about?

347
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,897
Well, I don't know.
Frank just seems

348
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,370
like a very common American name.

349
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,599
Oh, yeah.

350
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,573
Where's he from?

351
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,643
Ireland.

352
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,575
Frank?

353
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,478
Benny, can you just tell
him not to drink that...

354
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,050
- 'Cause it's my last one...
- Well, what is it?

355
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,277
Well, it's just a Snapple,

356
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,512
but that's not the point.

357
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,087
Get outta here.
When did you get this dog?

358
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,451
A couple days ago.

359
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,751
- And how much did it cost?
- Well, he was on sale.

360
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,950
On sale? What sale?

361
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,321
A fucking dog sale?

362
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,019
Yeah, I guess so.

363
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,289
Here's the point, jag-off.

364
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,388
Sale or no sale, you're spending money.

365
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,796
My money!

366
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,867
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

367
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,026
No, that's not one way of looking at it.

368
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,763
That's the way it looks.
That's the way it is.

369
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,498
It's not like the colour fucking blue-green,

370
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,767
where some asshole sees blue
and the other guy sees green.

371
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,139
In order for things to have
an option of appearance,

372
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,610
they have to have a fucking
option of appearance!

373
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,237
You know, this is the way it is.

374
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,838
You did this, and that's that.

375
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,077
And why does that dog
keep looking at me funny?

376
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,452
It's a funny-looking dog.

377
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,294
What's her name?

378
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,362
He. It's a he.

379
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,157
Oh, sorry.
Excu-use me.

380
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,231
What's his name?

381
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,594
Uh, he doesn't have a name yet.

382
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,190
He doesn't have a name.
Oh, so I'll name him.

383
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,632
I'd kind of like to be the
one that names the dog.

384
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,964
And I'd kind of like you to get to work

385
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,538
so you can pay me the
fucking money I lent you.

386
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,573
I'm taking this dog.
Frank, grab the dog.

387
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,107
You're not gonna take the dog.
Don't take the...

388
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,540
- You can't take the dog.
- Yes, I can.

389
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,770
Oh, come on.
What would you do with him?

390
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,005
I'm going to eat him.
What difference does it make?

391
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,307
All right... imagine it like this.

392
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,404
I owe you the money, right?

393
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,744
I don't need to imagine it.

394
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,317
Okay, well, just imagine the rest.

395
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,477
In order for me to pay
you the money I owe you,

396
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,610
I have to get an advance.

397
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,813
And in order for me to get an advance

398
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,082
I have to write something.

399
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,714
And... and you're here and you're...

400
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,190
you're taking dogs and stuff.

401
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,624
And, Benny, I can't do that.

402
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,956
All right?

403
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,557
That... that dog, that little, fragile dog...

404
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,261
that Frank's holding onto
just a little too tightly...

405
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,337
Could you just... ow!

406
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,837
Okay, that's not necessary.

407
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,473
Well, uh,
could you just not squeeze him so tightly?

408
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,908
Maybe... maybe just...

409
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,979
Are you squeezing him?

410
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,411
All right, Frank, give him the dog.

411
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,572
Just give it to him.

412
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,842
Thanks, Frank.

413
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,781
One week you got,
and then I'm gonna come

414
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,852
and I'm gonna take the dog.

415
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,443
I find out you buy any more animals

416
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,749
or see any more fucking doctors,

417
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,118
I'm gonna break your legs.

418
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,623
Okay, Benny, don't say that.
I hate it when you say that.

419
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,987
I'm gonna break your legs, okay?

420
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,254
One week.
Frank, let's go.

421
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,996
Why didn't you just give him the dog?

422
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,260
I knew you'd say that.

423
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,800
Well, that's 'cause it's
the logical thing to say.

424
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,369
There's a reason people say things.

425
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,564
Granted, stupid people just
shout shit for no reason.

426
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,664
Smart people use logic.

427
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,799
Two days ago you were going to
give the dog to what's-her-name.

428
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,876
- What's-her-name?
- Jules.

429
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,171
Look, can we just chalk it up to growth?

430
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,370
Can we just do that?
That's good, right?

431
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,447
Let's just chalk it up to growth.

432
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,844
Life is a delicate negotiation.

433
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,007
What the fuck does that mean?

434
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,084
I've got to keep the dog.

435
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,208
- Why?
- I don't know.

436
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,411
Good.
Keep the dog.

437
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,078
- You really don't understand, do you?
- No, no clue.

438
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,622
Look, I was a very unhappy
person not too long ago.

439
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,419
Hence the 100 or so
thousand on the couch.

440
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,050
Ew!
Are you being shitty?

441
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,128
What?
No.

442
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,355
- No.
- I know how much money I spent.

443
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,452
Was it really that much, though?

444
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,531
- I'm kidding.
- Don't be shitty.

445
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,599
- I'm kidding.
- You're an asshole.

446
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,167
Come on.

447
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,031
Look, I'm just trying to do
the right thing here, all right?

448
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,729
That's cool.
That's cool.

449
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,362
And all I'm saying is,
you don't got to kill yourself.

450
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,531
Yeah, but you're busting my balls.

451
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,802
I'm not.
Hey, hey, hey.

452
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,073
- A little bit. - Listen, in that very
"unhappy time", you sold a book.

453
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,477
- In my opinion, a very good book.
- Don't do that.

454
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,481
I like the book.
I like the book.

455
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,050
Yeah, because it's the
only book you ever read.

456
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,881
Wow!
Now who's being shitty, okay?

457
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,852
Stop that.
Listen, you had money,

458
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,388
you had lots of girls around.

459
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,424
I was miserable.
I was miserable!

460
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,187
I enjoyed it.

461
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,194
Cas, don't you want to be loved?

462
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,453
- Yeah...
- Wait.

463
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,623
You know, give and receive?

464
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,598
I do.
Almost every single night.

465
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,929
I have nothing.

466
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,697
And then I give the dog
away and then I have...

467
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:33,771
I have negative nothing.

468
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,032
A clean carpet, maybe?

469
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,199
I... I know.
I don't understand.

470
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,708
- Hey, babe.
- Loser.

471
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,834
Can I have some ketch...

472
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,969
Ketchup?

473
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,207
Wow.

474
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,304
What's with her?

475
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,611
I-I don't know.
Um...

476
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,242
I, uh, I took some shots of her,

477
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,650
some nudes, and, uh...

478
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,279
and she's crazy.

479
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,379
I don't... I don't know.

480
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,083
You know what I need?

481
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,820
- Ketchup?
- No, I need a plan.

482
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,486
Everybody has a plan.
We all need plans.

483
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,563
A plan, huh?

484
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,631
Yeah, what's your plan?

485
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,959
I, uh... I have a plan.

486
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,431
Well, what is it?

487
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,664
It's to, um...

488
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,069
It's to sleep with lots of girls,

489
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,370
take pictures of them,
eat three times a day.

490
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,534
Stuff like that.

491
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,181
I need more therapy.

492
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,771
You are a good writer.

493
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,214
No, don't do...
You know, I'm going to do the thing.

494
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,580
La-la-la...

495
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,812
Don't be a child.
Don't be a child.

496
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,887
Stop it.

497
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,456
Okay, fine.

498
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,524
What's your plan?

499
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,649
I have a plan.

500
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,726
What is it?

501
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,727
Uh... I-I, uh...

502
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,855
Love the dog, have the dog love me.

503
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,161
Meet a woman, do the same thing.

504
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,758
Get married.

505
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,438
Kids.

506
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,540
It's a plan.

507
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,608
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

508
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,040
Pig.

509
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,509
I did not sell the fucking pictures, okay?

510
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,274
They were stolen from me.

511
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,008
You sold naked pictures of her?

512
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,140
What did I just say?

513
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,218
Cas!

514
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,625
Okay, come on.

515
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,957
Come on.
Go play.

516
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,053
Come on, man, we drove all the way here.

517
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,631
Go play.

518
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,496
What?
You don't want to go play?

519
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,590
Here.
Here.

520
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,602
Look, I got the ball.
I got the ball.

521
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,671
Okay?
Oh!

522
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,928
Ah!

523
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,466
Come on.
Those are your friends.

524
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,477
Go out there.
Come on.

525
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,546
Go get the ball.

526
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,171
Get the ball.

527
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,210
Okay, I'm going to go that way

528
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,786
and you go that way, all right?

529
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:29,945
Come on, we're here, man.

530
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,283
Come on, man up.

531
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,243
Hi.

532
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,677
Hi.

533
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,714
Do you mind...
Do you mind if I sit down?

534
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,351
Yeah, fine.
Just don't hit on me.

535
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,578
- What's that?
- I don't want to flirt.

536
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,712
I didn't come here to flirt.

537
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,312
So if that's why you want to sit down, no.

538
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,857
But if you're really just looking

539
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,425
for a place to sit, then, fine.

540
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,290
Oh, no...
Yeah, I just wanted to sit down.

541
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:15,833
Okay.

542
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,400
Oh, man, I need some exercise.

543
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,946
I'm Solo.

544
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,383
What?

545
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,454
Sorry.

546
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,122
Did you just tell me you were Solo?

547
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,385
Yeah, I did.

548
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,585
W-why?

549
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,457
Well, I... I just felt uncomfortable

550
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,962
sitting here next to you
and not saying anything

551
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,294
and I didn't want you to
think that I was flirting so I...

552
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,760
Solo's my name, by the way.

553
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,929
Oh.
Okay.

554
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,939
- See, that's where I got confused.
- Oh yeah.

555
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,838
Yeah, see?
That's how wars get started.

556
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

557
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,778
Miscommunication.

558
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,477
Right.
That's how wars get started.

559
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,713
Yeah, I didn't get that at first

560
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,914
and then I just got it, so then I said it.

561
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:12,990
Sorry.

562
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,421
Yeah...

563
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,193
It's kind of weird sitting here

564
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,426
not saying anything, though, right?

565
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,264
Then get up.

566
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,395
- Okay.
- No!

567
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,473
Sit down.

568
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,541
Okay.

569
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,373
Hah!
You're kind of crazy, huh?

570
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,673
No, no, no, no, no.

571
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,839
I'm not crazy at all.
No.

572
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,916
I've just had a very long run indoors.

573
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,780
Haven't done a whole lot of socializing

574
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:41,910
in the last year, so...

575
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,180
Right.
Solo, huh?

576
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,516
- Yeah.
Mm -hmm.

577
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,352
- Your mom give you that name?
- Yes, she did.

578
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,016
- Yeah.
- Why?

579
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,060
Um, it's just a long story.

580
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,129
You want to make it short?

581
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,594
No.

582
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:53,664
All right.
Well...

583
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,232
- I'm Lola, Solo.
- Hi.

584
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,823
Nice to meet you, Lola.
I'm Solo.

585
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,835
- I know.
- All right.

586
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,905
Okay.
Well, I feel comfortable now.

587
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,132
So if you want to get
back to your book, I'll...

588
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,264
I'll be quiet.

589
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,741
You know, it's okay.
It's a bad book, so...

590
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,712
- Oh, really?
- Mmm -hm.

591
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,281
I wrote one of those once.

592
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,508
- You did?
- Yeah, I did.

593
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,913
Really?
A bad book?

594
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,542
- Yeah.
- I probably read it.

595
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,245
What's it called?

596
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,846
I'd rather not s...
I don't know, I don't know...

597
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,925
I... I don't know.
I'd rather not.

598
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,121
Okay.

599
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,131
Hey, there's a lot of dogs here, huh?

600
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,200
Dog park.

601
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,268
Yeah.

602
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,663
Which one's yours?

603
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,205
Oh, shit!

604
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,070
Vito! Off!

605
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,142
Off!

606
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,267
Oh, my God!

607
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,107
Look you know, I...
I really don't want

608
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,273
to make a big deal out of this.

609
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,349
Then why are you?

610
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,644
Well, under normal circumstances,

611
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,218
I wouldn't be, but here and now

612
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,015
with the financial state that I'm in and...

613
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,520
and, if truth be told,

614
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,920
I sort of feel like you're
responsible a little bit.

615
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,423
- Okay, how do you figure that?

616
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,790
Lady, your dog ate my dog.

617
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:57,884
He didn't eat him, he bit him.

618
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,088
Several times.

619
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,357
Look, I'm sure he's going to be fine.

620
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,591
Well, I hope so, you know...

621
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,667
No, don't be so dramatic about it.

622
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,893
It's just a couple of scratches.

623
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,629
He was bleeding all over the place.

624
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,897
Look, I'm not paying for this.

625
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,302
I feel like by bringing you here,

626
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,896
I fulfilled all my obligations.

627
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,635
I mean, I... I'm sorry.

628
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,938
I just... I don't feel responsible.

629
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,980
I mean, it... it's a dog park.

630
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,175
Shit happens.
And maybe your dog

631
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,774
just really isn't dog park material.

632
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,853
You know what I mean?

633
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,682
I couldn't agree with you more.

634
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,914
Good.

635
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,012
I'm glad.

636
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,883
Okay, so...

637
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,292
Well, I'm really sorry about her.

638
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,363
What...

639
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,522
He. It's a he.

640
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,065
His name? I...

641
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,430
That's still up in the air.

642
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,561
- You haven't named your dog?
- No, I haven't yet.

643
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,434
- Well, what do you call it?
- I don't call him anything.

644
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,303
Well, when it's over there and
you want it to come here,

645
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,035
- like, what do you say?
- Uh, "come"?

646
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,634
I don't know. I haven't really had
that problem yet, I just got him.

647
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,939
You should...

648
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,013
You should name your dog.

649
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,479
I know I should name my dog.

650
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,640
Okay. Well, Solo...

651
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,911
Once again, I am really sorry about this,

652
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,077
but you know...

653
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,920
I've got to go.

654
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,117
Vito's in the car

655
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,193
and I have to get him home.

656
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,420
Please help me.

657
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,552
Please.
I'm begging you.

658
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,130
Please don't leave me here.

659
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,927
Look, I know we just met and...

660
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,365
and... and there's no reason on earth

661
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,833
for you to trust me, but just do it.

662
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:12,961
Just... just lend me the money

663
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,060
and I swear to God,

664
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,503
if I have to sell my own body to do it,

665
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,097
I'll pay you back, very soon.

666
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,368
Please just help me.

667
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,681
Okay. I'll help you.

668
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,775
God, I don't know why.

669
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,354
But I'll help you.

670
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,515
They can bill me for the damages.

671
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,592
Uh! No!

672
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,091
- No touch.
- Sorry.

673
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,195
This is my work address.

674
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,858
I'm there every night till 2:00 a.m.

675
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,300
And by the way, I'm going to be taking

676
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,700
your license plate number on the way out.

677
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,170
You don't need to do that.

678
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,638
Nonetheless, that's what I'm going to do.

679
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,971
- Okay.
- Look, don't screw me here.

680
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,078
'Cause I can't afford this.

681
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,272
Okay.
You're a good lady.

682
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,348
Thank you.

683
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,400
You okay?

684
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,340
Tsk...

685
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,333
Excuse me, sir.

686
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,174
We don't allow dogs in the building.

687
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,804
Oh, come on.
You know me.

688
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,348
I'm... I'm just here to see Dr. Nourmand.

689
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,975
I've seen you, sir,
but that doesn't excuse the fact

690
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,986
that we have a "no dog"
policy in the building.

691
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,487
- Well, I...
- Some people are allergic.

692
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,489
I can't just leave him in the car.

693
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,751
Come on, I'll just be a second.

694
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,053
I'm afraid no can do.

695
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,958
Oh, come on, man.

696
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,724
Is that one of those Tongans?

697
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,266
Yeah.

698
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,801
My wife has a thing for those dogs.

699
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,837
You wouldn't want to sell it, would you?

700
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,235
No. No.

701
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,536
I'll tell you what.

702
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,270
I'll hold it for you while you go up.

703
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,504
No.
That's okay.

704
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,582
Okay? I'll wait.

705
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,741
Thank you.

706
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,943
Okay.

707
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,019
Have a good day.

708
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,321
How you doing?
You're hungry, aren't you?

709
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,655
Mr. Harrington.

710
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,629
Dr. Nourmand,
this guy tried to steal my dog.

711
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,429
I was trying to do you a favour,
you fucking nut-job.

712
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,129
Oh... hey, pal,
I saw how you looked at him.

713
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,262
- All right?
- Mr. Harrington, please.

714
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,532
He tried to bring the dog in the building.

715
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,937
- It's fine, Joe.
- Sorry about that.

716
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,009
It's fine.
Good night.

717
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,975
- Good night now.
- Asshole.

718
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,909
- What are you doing?
- No, I just want to...

719
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,981
I just want to talk to
you for just one second.

720
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,049
- No!
- Please? Please?

721
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,742
- No!
- Look, I...

722
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,012
No, Mr. Harrington.

723
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,178
- I just want to talk to you.
- No.

724
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,845
This is completely unorthodox.

725
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,218
I've been waiting for three hours, man.

726
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,313
How long have you been coming to me?

727
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,790
- Uh, almost a year.
- Almost a year.

728
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,258
So you understand the policy of the office.

729
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,623
It's not a big deal.
Don't worry...

730
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,024
It is a big deal, sir.
You're breaking protocol.

731
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,223
You don't need to call me "sir".

732
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,492
That's a little impersonal.

733
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,898
Look, man, I know this is way out of line

734
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,731
for the doctor/patient relationship,

735
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,997
but that's the thing,
I'm not your patient anymore.

736
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,231
Mr. Harrington, you do not...
Solo!

737
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,171
- Solo! Whatever!
- What's your first name?

738
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,708
That is not necessary.

739
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,038
Well, it is if we're going to be friends.

740
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,271
Look, okay, okay.
Look,

741
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,744
I know we can't be friends.

742
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,213
I'm not some nut-job.
I'm not stalking you.

743
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,409
I just... can we just talk for a second?
Please?

744
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,783
I swear to God,
I'm not going to make this into a habit.

745
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,150
Look, look.
I got the dog.

746
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,245
What happened to it?

747
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,154
It got into a fight with a pit bull.

748
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,018
Come on, man!

749
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,257
This can never happen again.

750
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,390
I mean, never.

751
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,990
- I understand.
- It is completely unorthodox

752
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,071
for our purposes here,
or upstairs, wherever.

753
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,639
- I understand.
- I mean, if you want to see me,

754
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,707
you have to make an appointment.

755
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,241
Okay.

756
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,435
I want to hear you say it.

757
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,714
If I want to see you,
I have to make an appointment.

758
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,079
- Thank you. - Look, under
normal circumstances, I would.

759
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,378
But I can't, I'm broke.

760
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,918
You know that.

761
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,581
Is he going to go to the
bathroom back there?

762
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,885
Uh, yeah.
He might.

763
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,084
Look, I'm just going to make this quick,
all right?

764
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,161
Please.

765
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,489
Did I buy this car for you?

766
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,325
- Mr. Harrington!
- Okay. I... just kidding.

767
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,455
I'm kidding.

768
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,535
Look, I'm in a really bad spot here, okay?

769
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,432
Now, you told me to get the dog, all right?

770
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,368
No.
I did not tell you to get that dog.

771
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,439
You kind of did.

772
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,768
I did not.

773
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:45,969
Okay, you said, "pet".

774
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,237
You weren't implying that I get a snake,
were you?

775
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,369
Listen, in order for what I do

776
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,503
to have any sort of relevance...

777
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,050
Do you have a biscuit or something?

778
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,141
- I mean, the...
- Quiet.

779
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,221
Quiet! Shh!

780
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,422
In order for what I do
to have any relevance,

781
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,857
I never tell anybody what to do

782
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,928
or what not to do.

783
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,154
Okay, fine, doctor.

784
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,423
I got the dog.

785
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,520
Yes.
I can see that.

786
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,929
And I think that's good.

787
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,662
Are you fucking with me?

788
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,202
No!
I would never do that.

789
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,362
Why is it good?

790
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:15,564
You tell me.

791
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,231
I almost got rid of it three times this week.

792
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,866
I have no idea why it was good.

793
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,205
Why didn't you get rid of it?

794
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,777
Because he's mine.
I don't know.

795
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,848
One second, he's just a dog,

796
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,040
and the next thing I know, he's mine.

797
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,049
I think that's progress.

798
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,142
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

799
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,483
Just tell me what's troubling you.

800
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,647
What's troubling me?

801
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,349
Well, let's see, I'm broke.

802
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,858
Like, food-stamp broke.

803
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,928
The... the dog's looking at me like,

804
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:38,859
"What the fuck are we going to do?"

805
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:39,952
I'm looking right back at him like,

806
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,156
"I have no fucking idea."

807
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,961
I... I just wanted something simple.

808
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,728
This... the whole thing back-fired.

809
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,100
This is the... the furthest thing
in the world from simple.

810
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,968
I... I can't write because
I'm scared to death

811
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,338
that I'm going to...
I'm going to be right back where I started.

812
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,740
But none of that mattered because I...

813
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,039
I was seeing you.

814
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,876
And now I don't even have
that and so I feel fucked.

815
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,815
Life is a delicate negotiation.

816
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,383
What the fuck does that mean, anyway?

817
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,253
Well, it means something
different for everybody.

818
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,848
Can you be more vague?

819
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:10,861
What do you want?

820
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,691
Man, I just want to be happy.

821
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,322
Can you be more vague?

822
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,404
What's he doing?

823
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,097
Look, sorry.

824
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,299
It's okay.
It's just a dog, man.

825
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,326
Are you robbing me?

826
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,867
Hey, bitch.

827
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,797
What...

828
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,897
What are you doing on my couch?

829
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,373
Chillin'.

830
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,807
How did you guys get in here?

831
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,139
This isn't exactly Fort Knox.

832
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,576
Ted's good with cheap doors.

833
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,045
Oh really?

834
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,116
Ted, did you know that breaking
into somebody's house is illegal?

835
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,184
Don't waste your time.

836
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,309
He doesn't speak any English.

837
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,386
Oh, sorry, Ted.

838
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,681
Now bring that little bean over here

839
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,755
and let me have a peak-a-boo.

840
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,256
What? No!

841
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,724
No, you guys have to leave right now.

842
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,762
Oh, look at the little bean!

843
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,457
Oh my God, to die.

844
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,624
- Okay, okay.
- Oh...

845
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,498
What happened, lil' bean?
Huh?

846
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,934
What's wrong with him?

847
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,233
Uh... n -nothing's wrong with him.

848
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,103
- He's fine.
- He doesn't look fine.

849
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,335
Does he have something?

850
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,774
What... have something?
What do you mean?

851
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,778
Like hives, scabies, rabies,

852
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,177
some undiagnosed disease.

853
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,248
No.
No, no.

854
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,509
- You sure?
- Yes, he...

855
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,244
he got into a fight.

856
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,410
Oh...

857
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,544
Okay, I'll take him.

858
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,087
No, no.
You're not going to take him.

859
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,281
He's no longer for the taking.

860
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,052
He belongs to me.
He's mine.

861
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,649
Look, I appreciate you coming by.

862
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,228
That's really nice.
Thank you, Ted.

863
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,387
But, really, you... you have to leave.

864
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,362
- How much?
- How much what?

865
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,659
How much for the dog, bitch?

866
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,564
- Now I'm gonna break your legs.
- Benny!

867
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,397
What?
Are you selling that fucking dog?

868
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,301
Benny!
No, I'm not selling the dog.

869
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,532
You better not be.

870
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,834
Wait, who's this?

871
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:04,908
Who's this?

872
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,499
Oh, great, a tough guy.
Ted!

873
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,078
Wait.
Ted, relax, all right?

874
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,874
Yeah, Ted, sit the fuck down.

875
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,347
No, Benny.
Ted doesn't speak any English.

876
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,678
Oh, good.
Neither does Frank.

877
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,480
- Frank!
- Okay, look, everything's fine here.

878
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,553
Jules, this is Benny.

879
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,712
Benny, this is Jules.

880
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,756
Ted, Frank, you guys have met.
That's great.

881
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,256
Everybody just relax, okay?

882
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,054
- All right, what the fuck. Jules?
- Yes, honey?

883
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,560
- You want to buy that dog?
- Yes, I do.

884
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,391
Are you selling this fucking dog?
You better not be.

885
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,657
I'm not selling the dog, all right?

886
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,732
The dog's not for sale.

887
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,993
Everything's for sale.

888
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,796
Not this dog.
That dog belongs to me.

889
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,768
Okay well, that's really not true, Benny.

890
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,997
Shut up, you.

891
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,801
Wait.
The dog belongs to you?

892
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,705
- That's right.
- Well, how much do you want for her?

893
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,868
First of all, it's a he dog.

894
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:40,944
Okay.
Can you just...

895
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,706
please not tell me to shut up?

896
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,111
I... you know,
I don't want to be rude or anything...

897
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,512
Then shut the fuck up.

898
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:46,583
Okay.

899
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,844
This guy owes me money.

900
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,510
I'm tired of waiting for it.

901
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,383
- You understand?
- Yeah, I do.

902
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,821
Now, just tell me the sum
of which he owes you,

903
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,790
I'll give it to him to give to you,

904
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,860
then he can give me the dog!

905
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,155
Everybody gets what they want.

906
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,490
You're a very smart lady.

907
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,030
You seem to have picked up

908
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,531
on everything that's going on here.

909
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,066
Oh, my God...

910
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,226
But you know what?
What you're not gathering

911
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,270
is that the money is
not the issue anymore.

912
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,034
A thing has developed
between me and the dog.

913
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,575
- Oh-h...
- I... I can't explain it.

914
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,837
Fortunately, I don't have to.

915
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,378
- I want the dog.
- So do I.

916
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,469
Well, so do I.

917
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,946
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

918
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,448
Okay.

919
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,040
I should warn you ahead of time,

920
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,450
Frank is an undefeated cage fighter.

921
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,216
Ted trained with the Gracies
in Brazil for eight years,

922
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,291
so we're not worried.

923
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,382
So, winner takes the dog?

924
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,461
Winner takes the dog.

925
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,126
Wait, wait, where's the fucking dog?

926
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,869
What the fuck?

927
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,476
My dog.

928
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,048
Fucking psychopaths.

929
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,155
This is Jonesy.

930
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,657
Wake up, you lazy fuckers.

931
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,456
It's time to take in that
miserable L.A. sunshine.

932
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,795
Get up, you fucking cunts.

933
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,029
So, um, what are you going to do?

934
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,505
I-I don't know.

935
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,937
- You need money?
- Yeah.

936
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,010
Yeah, you're fucked.

937
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,140
Hey.

938
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,217
Is it... is it all right if I stay here

939
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,876
for... just for a couple of days?

940
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,546
What do you mean?

941
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,215
What do you mean what do I mean?

942
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,624
Well...

943
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,160
Is the dog going to shit?

944
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,661
Well, not if we don't feed it.

945
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,359
Do we have to feed it?

946
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,804
Do you, uh,
want to go to this place with me tonight?

947
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:49,895
No, I can't.

948
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,201
I'm supposed to shoot this lesbian tonight

949
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,674
and I've really been looking forward to it.

950
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,108
I have to go here.

951
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,673
Do you know what this place is?

952
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,579
No.
It's just where this girl works

953
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,117
and I have to tell her that
I don't have the money

954
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,915
that I owe her and that I'm
just a complete asshole.

955
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,989
And you don't know this place?

956
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,148
No.

957
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,350
I do.
I better come with you.

958
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,983
No way.

959
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,922
No way.

960
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,088
What?

961
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,961
Okay, she's got to be a cocktail waitress.

962
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,364
No, I don't want to...

963
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,901
- I don't want to...
- Shh...

964
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,589
What can I get you guys?

965
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,030
Uh, yes,
I'd like a shrimp tempura hand roll, please.

966
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,101
What?

967
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,362
It was a joke.

968
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,596
- He was... he's kidding.
- Yeah, a beer.

969
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,501
Any beer would be great.
Thank you.

970
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,573
I don't see her.

971
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,641
I don't want to be here right now.

972
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,505
- Relax.
- Come with me, honey.

973
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,805
Really?
Like that?

974
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,277
This place is a'ight.

975
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,872
I just... no, I...

976
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,473
No, don't worry, this one's on the house.

977
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,552
I...
No, I know that's really nice,

978
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,813
but I'm just looking for somebody.

979
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,820
For real.
I... I... I'm really...

980
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:12,980
- Just relax.
- Wait!

981
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,751
- It's on the house.
- Oh my God...

982
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,318
- Breathe, baby.
- Stop!

983
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,369
Stop it!

984
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,443
Stop.

985
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,814
Stop! Stop!

986
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:21,980
Don't move.
Don't move.

987
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,855
Whoa, ho...

988
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,332
Oh... oh my God.

989
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,728
Did you just...

990
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,498
Okay, this is really awkward.

991
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,697
I... I...

992
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,570
All right, let's hear it for Margo.

993
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:39,870
All right, come on, guys.

994
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,445
If you liked her routine, let her know.

995
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,572
Oh, God.
Now I'm going to feel really dirty

996
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,911
asking for the money you owe me.

997
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,848
Yeah. Well, you can imagine
how dirty I'm going to feel

998
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,784
when I tell you I don't have it.

999
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,855
I'm s... I...

1000
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,923
What?

1001
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,627
Well, see, that's why I came here.

1002
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,891
I just didn't want you think
that I was going back on my word.

1003
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,591
Look, just come back when you have it.

1004
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,396
Well no, see, that's the thing.
I don't know when that's going to be.

1005
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,300
And I just want you to know
that I'm working on it, all right?

1006
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,872
Look, I'm here.

1007
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,270
Okay, wait.

1008
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,137
- Could you just hold on for just a sec?
- What?

1009
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,710
Well, I just feel a little stupid.

1010
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,778
What?
About that?

1011
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,073
Yeah, a little bit.
Yeah.

1012
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,511
Don't feel stupid, sweetie.

1013
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,446
It happens.
Not often, but it happens.

1014
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,539
What happened?

1015
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,380
- "Sweetie"?
- He got a little excited.

1016
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,249
- What do you mean?
- No. She means nothing.

1017
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,879
"Sweetie" makes it a little worse,
don't you think?

1018
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,979
Excited how, though?

1019
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,058
- Look, shut up!
- Okay.

1020
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,126
I see how that can be misconstrued,

1021
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,193
But that's not how I meant it.

1022
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,659
No, it's just a little condescending.

1023
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,888
I get it, but that's not how I meant it.

1024
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:33,964
I... I know.
But you know what I mean.

1025
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,031
Totally.
I...

1026
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,622
Okay, look.
Uh, you...

1027
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,259
you two seem like you have
a lot to talk about, right?

1028
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,031
This is clearly not the place.

1029
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,400
I say breakfast.

1030
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,473
Hi, I'm Casper.

1031
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,905
I'll be paying for breakfast.

1032
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,442
Um, I'll need a friend, too, though.

1033
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,944
So, um,
if you could grab one of your colleagues,

1034
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,344
preferably the one dancing
on stage right over there,

1035
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,416
that'd be great.
We'll grab a bite.

1036
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,483
What do you say, 2:00 a.m.?

1037
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,142
Here's your wig.

1038
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,027
Let's go.

1039
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,095
Shut up.

1040
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,464
Her?

1041
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,623
Okay.

1042
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,598
I'm a...
I'm a fantastic guy.

1043
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,999
I want you to know that.

1044
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,068
All right.

1045
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,204
I'm just going to get a couple of things.

1046
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,749
Wait, what?
Like, clean underwear and stuff?

1047
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,079
Okay, would you shut up?

1048
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,447
I just can't believe that!

1049
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,713
Shut up.
It's not funny.

1050
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,186
Really?
Like...

1051
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,216
Hurry.

1052
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,517
All right.

1053
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,174
Thank you.

1054
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,904
- So, Candy, um...
- Yes, hi.

1055
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,448
That's not your real name, is it?

1056
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,142
No.
That is my real name.

1057
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,718
Oh, so then what...

1058
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:36,786
what's your stripper name?

1059
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,184
- Pal!
- What?

1060
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,347
I don't know.
What?

1061
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,014
"Stage name"?
I apologize.

1062
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,092
But everybody's so touchy.

1063
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,159
Well...

1064
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,727
No, it's okay, um...

1065
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,264
My stripper name is Margo.

1066
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,300
Margo.

1067
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,528
That's great.

1068
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:53,864
Margo, that's good.

1069
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,098
And... and Candy would work too,

1070
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,730
for your, uh, stripper name.

1071
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,865
That's just an opinion.

1072
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,409
I'm sorry.

1073
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,671
Don't... for what?

1074
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,303
Don't you dare...

1075
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,506
Don't you dare be sorry.

1076
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,877
- Ever. About anything.
- What are you doing?

1077
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,211
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

1078
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,809
Sorry!
Don't... oh, my God, she feels so good.

1079
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,182
Everywhere.
It just feels good.

1080
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,755
What?
Pal, come on.

1081
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,982
What?
How do we look together?

1082
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,558
Seriously, give me an honest answer.
How do we look together?

1083
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,853
- Oh, my God.
- Amazing, right?

1084
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,690
Good, right?
Really... really good.

1085
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,763
Right?
Amazing.

1086
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,057
- Right.
- Oh, my God.

1087
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,132
Did you see the thing?

1088
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,166
- Babe, do you realize something?
- What?

1089
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,202
That I...
the puppy that we would have together.

1090
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,361
Un... can you imagine?
Can you imagine?

1091
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,995
- Really?
- Casper and Candy?

1092
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,073
Candy and Casper.

1093
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,573
Oh, my God.
It sounds right.

1094
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,937
It's like it makes sense.

1095
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,010
Right.

1096
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,203
It's logical almost!

1097
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,540
- You're crazy.
- I love you.

1098
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,238
- Stop it.
- It's true.

1099
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,943
- Stop.
- I have to show you something, right now.

1100
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,110
- Why?
- Well, come on.

1101
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,949
Oh, look a goose!

1102
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,350
Where'd that come from?

1103
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,695
Uh...

1104
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,258
Thanks for going along with this.

1105
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,629
It's okay.
I'm hungry.

1106
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,997
Oh, really?

1107
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,402
I hear the osso bucco's just amazing here.

1108
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,049
All right.

1109
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,642
What's the story?

1110
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,584
What, the whole story?
Or what... what...

1111
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,246
what story do you want to hear?

1112
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,586
No, I mean... we have some time here.

1113
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,752
So, let's start with your name.

1114
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,489
Why Solo?

1115
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,430
Oh...

1116
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,603
Well, uh, when I... when I was...

1117
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,765
when I was younger...
when I was born my, uh...

1118
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,811
my mother considered
giving me up for adoption...

1119
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,107
several times.
And then my father wasn't around

1120
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,011
and she figured I'd end up alone,

1121
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,641
one way or another, so she, uh...

1122
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,881
she named me Solo.

1123
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,657
That's it?

1124
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,160
Mm -hmm.

1125
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,230
Hippy shit.

1126
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,298
That wasn't a long story.

1127
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:05,163
I mean, the other day you
told me it was a long story.

1128
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,464
That wasn't.
That was...

1129
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,630
short.
It was nice,

1130
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,435
to the point.
I liked it.

1131
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,204
Well, I'm glad.

1132
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:16,746
So then what happened?

1133
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,747
Are you serious?

1134
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,249
Well, I'm hoping that at some point
we're going to get to the money

1135
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,511
that you owe me but you know,
- Oh, right, yeah.

1136
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,052
I don't want to rush you or anything.

1137
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,952
Yeah... is this making your
eyes cross a little bit?

1138
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,619
How long have you been a stripper?

1139
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,055
How long have you been a writer?

1140
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,189
Why are you a stripper?

1141
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,767
What's the name of your book?

1142
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:38,960
It just... it just doesn't seem

1143
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,502
like you're that kind of girl.

1144
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,936
Look, I make a lot of money
taking off my clothes.

1145
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,200
You're a writer and you're broke,

1146
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,367
so don't judge.
What's the name of your book?

1147
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,637
Do you really want to know?

1148
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,837
Mm -hmm.

1149
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,946
"The Naked Abyss."

1150
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,045
Piece of shit.

1151
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:01,784
Thank you.
You read it.

1152
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,621
Yeah.
I read it.

1153
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,251
Really bad.

1154
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,387
I mean, extraordinarily bad,
exceptionally bad.

1155
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,022
That was actually one
of the reasons why it...

1156
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,100
it stood out to me.

1157
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,792
Well, I'm glad I left a mark.

1158
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,563
No.
Actually, there's good news.

1159
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,433
Yeah, there is.
I'm no longer a writer,

1160
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,506
which is good news for you

1161
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,631
and the rest of the book-reading world.

1162
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:18,730
But bad news for me

1163
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,104
because I can't even
afford to buy dog food.

1164
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,041
No.
I remember reading it thinking:

1165
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,376
"God, this guy is actually
a really good writer.

1166
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,312
What is he doing writing
such a piece of shit?"

1167
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,077
Well, look at that, ladies and gentlemen,

1168
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,914
not only can she produce orgasm

1169
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,715
without taking a single
article of clothing off,

1170
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,949
but she's a critic as well, with insight.

1171
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,431
Wow, you're really a pervert.

1172
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:42,965
I know, I know.

1173
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,662
Hello!

1174
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,361
We just, uh, made out in the parking lot.

1175
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,438
He's a good kisser.

1176
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,904
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1177
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,235
How about that?
Let's go back to my place.

1178
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,365
Let's get the food to go.

1179
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,443
We'll go back and we'll take some pictures

1180
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,512
and do some fun stuff.

1181
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,636
What do you say, Solo?

1182
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,941
Solo?

1183
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,243
Like your... that's your name-name, Solo?

1184
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,612
No, honey you... you can't...

1185
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,117
Your name is Candy.

1186
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,585
You know, so, like, if you

1187
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,782
had a name like Pam or Ruth
or even Betsy,

1188
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:08,915
you could say that to him, but you can't

1189
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:09,993
because your name is Candy.

1190
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,287
Dude, you're soaking wet.

1191
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:32,740
I'm sorry.

1192
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,317
No, it's fine.

1193
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,609
You know what I find really boring?

1194
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,018
Besides my book?

1195
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,953
Yeah, besides your book.

1196
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,525
You know, the crazy thing

1197
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,686
is that I couldn't agree with you more.

1198
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,058
Every... every time

1199
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,256
somebody tells me they liked it,

1200
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,492
I feel sick to my stomach.

1201
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,201
It was a very successful novel,
for the record.

1202
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:57,205
All right.
Can we talk about me for a second?

1203
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,298
Okay, yeah.
Sorry.

1204
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,706
All these girls who I work with,

1205
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,210
they're always talking about

1206
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,542
what they're going to do
when they make enough money.

1207
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,172
I mean, one's a painter, one's a singer...

1208
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,614
Lots of artists.

1209
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,743
Open a boutique,
start their own clothing line.

1210
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,287
I mean, everybody has something.

1211
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,152
I... I don't know if they really believe it

1212
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,192
or if it's just some sort of excuse they have

1213
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,726
for justifying what they're
doing with their lives.

1214
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,955
But the point is...

1215
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,559
I don't have an excuse, Solo.

1216
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,397
It's what I do.

1217
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,561
It's my job.

1218
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,233
I was a hairdresser for six years,

1219
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,603
a really good one.

1220
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,473
And I make more money in one night

1221
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,548
than I made cutting hair for two weeks.

1222
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,709
So, I'm sorry about the water,

1223
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,651
but sometimes people
think differently than I do

1224
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,689
and...

1225
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,985
it makes me mad.
It bums me out.

1226
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,188
You know what?
I'm a loser.

1227
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,322
I... I'm... I'm...

1228
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,366
I'm no one to judge you.

1229
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,094
I...

1230
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,033
I watch war documentaries

1231
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,130
and I spend most of my
time in my apartment

1232
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,334
eating Domino's pizza.

1233
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,308
I... I...

1234
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,176
I spent an astronomical amount of money

1235
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,875
on therapy because I wrote a shitty book.

1236
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,082
I owe people money, including you.

1237
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,351
I... I... I'm lonely.

1238
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,516
I'm tired.

1239
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,355
And I'm just trying to figure it all out.

1240
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,997
You know, I spent almost a year

1241
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,534
in daily psychoanalysis

1242
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,299
and the grand, overwhelming conclusion

1243
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,374
is that I should buy a pet.

1244
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,567
So you bought a dog.

1245
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,507
Yeah.
I bought a dog.

1246
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,805
Well, I think that's commendable.

1247
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,175
Oh good.
Yeah.

1248
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,341
The... the highlight since buying him

1249
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,043
was when he shit all over the linoleum

1250
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,119
instead of the carpet.

1251
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,847
But I'm glad you think
that's commendable.

1252
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,547
No, I do.

1253
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,215
I think you're on the right track.

1254
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,986
Yeah well, you know.

1255
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,356
You have a dog.

1256
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,554
No.

1257
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,188
You got me.
I don't.

1258
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,391
Well, what about Vito?

1259
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,626
Vito belongs to a friend.

1260
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,260
I... walk him occasionally.

1261
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,568
I mean, I get lonely, too.

1262
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,372
See?
I got things, you got things.

1263
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,642
Life, it's a delicate...

1264
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,115
- Negotiation.
- Yes.

1265
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,716
Wait a minute.

1266
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,015
Wait.

1267
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,818
Is that what you were about to say?

1268
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,084
Yeah.

1269
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,887
Do you know a Dr. Nourmand?

1270
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,188
What's his first name?

1271
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,398
Oh...

1272
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,727
Pal!

1273
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,927
I'm sorry!
She was doing stuff!

1274
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,417
Oh, how are you?

1275
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,248
Little kibble and bit.

1276
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,219
Oh, look at her.
What's her name?

1277
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,289
It's a boy.

1278
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,550
That's not mine.

1279
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:02,625
Oh.

1280
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,693
What do you guys want to drink?

1281
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,261
Uh, whatever.

1282
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,920
Please tell me you've named the dog.

1283
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,498
Uh, yeah, I haven't really had time yet.

1284
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,969
I have to shoot pictures of her right now.

1285
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,095
You make them drinks, okay?

1286
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,172
Well, what do you have?

1287
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,934
Nothing, really.

1288
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,975
Hey, hey, I know.
He's a cute...

1289
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,567
He's so cute.

1290
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:28,918
So...

1291
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,283
you haven't had time?

1292
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,380
Uh, yeah, things have been really crazy.

1293
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,152
You know, he doesn't really have drinks

1294
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,954
or anything like that.
- I'm not thirsty.

1295
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,722
Oh, that's good.

1296
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,990
You should name your dog.

1297
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,725
Oh, I will.
I will.

1298
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,130
Hey, do you think she wants a drink?

1299
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,202
Well, I don't think it matters if there's,
you know...

1300
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,795
Right.
I guess not.

1301
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,874
Uh, maybe we should go
out and get some drinks.

1302
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:52,942
I mean, we just... you know, I mean...

1303
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,408
Well, it's 3:00 a.m.

1304
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,842
Yeah.

1305
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,538
Let me just go ask them really quickly.

1306
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,909
Okay.

1307
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,556
What are you doing?

1308
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:07,884
Get out of here.

1309
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,195
You know, I think I might
have some drinks at my house

1310
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,786
if you want to just go

1311
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,866
and maybe we could hang
out and talk and whatever

1312
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,956
and have some drinks.

1313
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,092
As long as you promise

1314
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:20,635
never, ever to say the word "drinks" again.

1315
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:21,931
- Yes, then...
- Right. Okay.

1316
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,005
I'd love to hang out with you.

1317
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,232
Yeah.
Okay, great.

1318
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,740
Okay.
All right.

1319
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,672
Don't look at that.

1320
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:32,805
Hey, baby, right here.

1321
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,850
Yes! Yes!

1322
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,681
Oh, holler at your boy!

1323
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,754
Yes!

1324
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,483
This is a sexy party and Candy's involved.

1325
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,218
Candy's involv...
Look at that.

1326
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,487
Oh my God!
Holler back!

1327
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,655
You know,
I've never actually liked small dogs.

1328
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,700
I mean, the constant yapping for nothing.

1329
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,827
But, I don't know,
he has a big dog disposition.

1330
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,998
You know,
he looks at you like he thinks he's tough.

1331
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,270
I think I like him.

1332
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,538
Uh, can you just give me one second?

1333
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,208
You know,
I don't care if your place is messy.

1334
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:10,218
It is.
And I...

1335
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,254
I... just give me one second, okay?

1336
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,322
Okay.

1337
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,152
Whew, your daddy has major issues.

1338
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,546
What the fuck?

1339
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,220
I don't have drinks.
I said "drinks".

1340
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,518
Yeah, you did.

1341
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,253
Hey, do you want to just go somewhere?

1342
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,057
You know, like,
go somewhere and talk and whatever.

1343
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,222
We can talk and...

1344
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,197
I'm sorry.
I'm being an idiot.

1345
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,392
You're not being an idiot.

1346
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,490
Oh, thanks.

1347
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,932
It's getting late.
Why don't we just call it a night?

1348
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,233
No, it's not getting late.

1349
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,467
Look...

1350
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,171
I've had a... time.

1351
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,372
Yeah, me too.

1352
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,006
But I think maybe I should just go home.

1353
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,846
Oh, okay, yeah.
Can I come?

1354
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,139
Man, that dog can eat.

1355
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,575
Yeah, it's been a while.

1356
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,646
What?

1357
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,044
I'm a terrible master.

1358
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,210
You don't feed your dog?

1359
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,150
No. I... I do.
I feed him.

1360
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,051
Uh, I tried to, you know,

1361
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,386
but then I had to go, and then
when I came back to get the food

1362
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,016
it spilled all over the place and then...

1363
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,152
and, uh... he...

1364
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,696
he doesn't like to, uh, eat peanut butter,

1365
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,493
and so, uh...

1366
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,229
I'm really tired right now.

1367
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,030
All right...

1368
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,100
Um...

1369
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,909
Why don't you relax?

1370
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,912
What?

1371
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,951
I don't know, like, take your shoes off...

1372
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,256
Okay.

1373
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,351
Make it comfy.

1374
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,064
Relax.

1375
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,394
Here, this is good for your
back if you put it betw...

1376
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,472
Yeah.

1377
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,243
Do you want to lay down next to me?

1378
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,510
Not so much.

1379
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,444
Hypothetically speaking?

1380
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,489
Not so much.

1381
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,958
How come?

1382
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,693
Let's just relax.

1383
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,400
Okay.

1384
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,474
I swore myself to celibacy.

1385
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,203
Well, I said lay down,
not take your clothes off.

1386
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,801
But I...

1387
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,379
I also said hypothetically speaking.

1388
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,176
I mean, would you like to is more...

1389
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,806
the question.

1390
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,282
And I said, not so much.

1391
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,648
I know. Twice.

1392
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,621
- Why?
- It's just not my thing.

1393
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,055
Well, it's not really my thing, either.

1394
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,889
And that's why I thought... it'd be nice.

1395
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,197
No, really.

1396
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,492
No, eat, sleep, therapy, repeat.

1397
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,295
That's... that's... that's me.

1398
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,403
I bet I haven't done the thing

1399
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,440
longer than you haven't done the thing.

1400
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,180
Two years.

1401
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:01,777
That's longer than me.

1402
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,917
Yeah.

1403
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,717
No, I mean, I used to see guys
who would come into the club

1404
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,657
and each one, I'd think, "Oh, God,
this is different."

1405
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,092
You know, "It's supposed to be."

1406
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,686
And, "It's meant to happen.
It's fate."

1407
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,856
And...

1408
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,633
nothing panned out.

1409
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,803
Wait, you'd go home with
guys from Cheetah's?

1410
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,341
- Don't judge me!
- Sorry.

1411
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,775
- You're here.
- That's different!

1412
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,210
Yeah.
See what I mean?

1413
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,906
Yeah.

1414
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,813
Hey...

1415
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,283
He really likes you.

1416
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,844
There's something that's
special about this dog.

1417
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,151
You know, it's funny you should say that.

1418
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,919
Not that I would, but I could have sold him

1419
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,961
for ten times the amount
of what I paid for him

1420
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,622
several times this week and it's only Friday.

1421
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,699
It's Thursday.

1422
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,893
Yeah.
See?

1423
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:00,268
There are people ready to pay big money

1424
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,367
for that little dog.

1425
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,446
Really?

1426
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,614
Yeah.

1427
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,948
You can come with me.

1428
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,564
Hello?

1429
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,440
Hello, Lola?

1430
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,227
Hello?

1431
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,940
Doggie?

1432
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,418
Casper!

1433
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,077
- Casper!
- Freeze!

1434
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,383
- Oh, sorry.
- Agh!

1435
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,457
I'm sorry.

1436
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,550
Don't ever fucking do that again, man!

1437
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:32,923
That was awful.

1438
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:33,996
Fuck!

1439
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,086
What is going on?

1440
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,256
Your friend's a thief.

1441
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,458
That's what's going on, all right?

1442
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,534
What?

1443
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,227
She's a dog thief.
She stole my dog.

1444
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,736
All right.
Please just relax for one second, okay?

1445
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,170
I still have a hard-on here.

1446
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,297
Tell me what happened.

1447
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,501
I went to sleep, I woke up,
the dog was gone.

1448
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,804
No Lola, no dog.

1449
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,879
Okay, why would she steal your dog?

1450
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,447
'Cause she's a thieving stripper!

1451
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,708
I wouldn't steal your dog.

1452
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,942
Oh, really?
What if you thought

1453
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,416
you could get a lot of money for him?

1454
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,315
Uh.
Well, then, yeah, I would.

1455
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:00,411
Yeah.
See? See?

1456
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:01,922
No, no, no, just wait.

1457
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:02,992
You woke up where?

1458
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,286
At her house.

1459
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,361
- Lola's?
- Yeah.

1460
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:06,428
Did you hit it?

1461
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:07,962
No, I did not hit it!

1462
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,031
Sorry.

1463
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,362
Oh, man, I can't believe this horseshit!

1464
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,525
All right,
all right, all right.

1465
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,398
Maybe... just throwing it out...

1466
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,495
maybe she just took the dog for a walk?

1467
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,574
That's interesting.

1468
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,802
Why don't you just go
back over there and see?

1469
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,571
Yeah, I'm just going to do that.

1470
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,147
I'm going to go back to her house,
you know.

1471
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,148
The dog's probably there just chilling

1472
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,275
and, you know, I'm making... going crazy.

1473
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,352
I'm going to go back there.

1474
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,442
She won't be there.

1475
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,714
What? She's not? Why?

1476
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,154
Because she has Legs 'N Eggs today.

1477
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,021
Okay.
What the fuck is Legs 'N Eggs?

1478
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,754
Legs 'N Eggs is the, uh, the day shift...

1479
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,352
at the club.

1480
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,863
Oh, so she's at the place?

1481
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:43,932
Yeah.

1482
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,523
Okay.
I'm going to the place.

1483
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:47,569
Good luck.

1484
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,899
Is that bad that I'd take the dog?

1485
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,908
Lola, will you toss me that top?

1486
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,611
Hey!

1487
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,248
Are you kidding me?

1488
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,618
Hi.

1489
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,922
Lola, where's my dog?

1490
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,189
I took him to your house.

1491
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,525
Okay.
I'm going to ask you one more time,

1492
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,724
and I sw...
Wait, why'd you do that?

1493
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,768
I woke up, I took him for a walk.

1494
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:20,927
When I got back, you weren't there

1495
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,902
so I had to go to work.
I...

1496
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,529
So I thought I'd just
take him to your house.

1497
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,232
And the door was open so I just let him in.

1498
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,309
I...

1499
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,377
What?
Is there a problem?

1500
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:29,706
No.
Was anybody there?

1501
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,245
- I don't know.
- Are you absolutely positive?

1502
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,473
No.
That's what I just said.

1503
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,549
I don't know.

1504
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,881
Right.

1505
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,784
What?
Did you think I stole him or something?

1506
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,481
- No. No, I was just...
- Okay.

1507
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,558
I'm not... I...

1508
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:43,647
I just didn't... I couldn't.

1509
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,284
- I don't know where he is.
- Are you okay?

1510
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:46,361
Yeah, I'm okay.
Sorry.

1511
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,994
Strange.

1512
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,496
Do you want to fuck with me?

1513
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:29,832
Now I'm pissed.

1514
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,237
Fuck with me now.

1515
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,603
I'm coming, little dog.

1516
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,162
Yes, may I help you?

1517
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,459
Yeah, I'm here to install the thing.

1518
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,742
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

1519
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,651
Excuse me.

1520
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,086
Jules!

1521
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,157
Hey, bitch?

1522
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,225
Can I help you, sir?

1523
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,850
Jules!

1524
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,155
Where's the dog?

1525
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,253
- Did you bring him?
- Where is he?

1526
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,592
This man would like to know where...

1527
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,360
- Go away, Jeffrey.
- Yes, madam.

1528
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,458
- Scotch rocks, Jeffrey.
- Right away, sir.

1529
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,627
All right, where is he?
And I swear to God

1530
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:35,704
I'm not playing around.

1531
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:37,670
Oh, look, he has testicles.

1532
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:38,865
Where's who, fuck-face?

1533
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,602
Okay, you know what?
Don't do that.

1534
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,041
Why don't... I... I just want my dog.

1535
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,611
I... I want my dog right now.

1536
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,873
Yeah, well, I wish I had him

1537
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,312
so I could tell you to go fuck yourself.

1538
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,316
What the hell is going on down here?

1539
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,851
What the hell is he doing...

1540
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:51,977
What are you doing here?

1541
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:53,953
I'll be asking the questions here, fuck-face!

1542
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,080
Where's the dog?

1543
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,317
All right, what's with the "fuck-face"?

1544
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,619
- I mean, really?
- He doesn't have him.

1545
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,194
All right, now I'm breaking your legs.

1546
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,262
That's it.

1547
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,797
All right, pal, put some clothes on.

1548
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,161
20-year Macallan, sir.

1549
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,461
Oh, thanks, Jeffrey.

1550
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,728
Hey, Jeffrey, can you set me up

1551
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,030
with one of those omelettes that you do?

1552
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,195
Um, I'm starving here.

1553
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:10,533
Right away, sir.
Madam?

1554
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,698
Go away, Jeffrey.

1555
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:12,933
Yes, madam.

1556
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,442
Hey, baby, be nice to Jeffrey.
He's a good guy.

1557
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:16,704
- Whatever.
- What, she's "baby" now?

1558
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:17,779
She's "baby"?

1559
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,211
I mean, give me a fucking break here.

1560
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,215
Well, if you must know,
you nosy little prick,

1561
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,545
We are now together.

1562
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,586
You know, it's difficult in life

1563
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:25,676
to find people with common interests.

1564
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,449
- Oh!
- Which is besides the point.

1565
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:28,545
Where's the fucking dog?

1566
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,489
He doesn't have the dog, stupid.

1567
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,821
He thinks we have the dog.

1568
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,259
We don't have the dog.

1569
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:34,727
You really don't have the dog?

1570
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,799
What did she just say, stupid?

1571
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,062
Hey, where are the bodyguards?

1572
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,136
Hospitalised.

1573
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,204
Oh.

1574
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,466
Oh! Uh!

1575
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,734
Uh! A-ah!

1576
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,500
- Ah!
- Oh, get up.

1577
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,142
I-I really want to apologize
to you for earlier.

1578
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,608
I was a complete asshole.

1579
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,373
But I had a little bit of a freak-out

1580
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,313
because last night when
we went back to my place

1581
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,646
and I walked in and there were two people

1582
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:30,719
sleeping in my bed...

1583
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,366
Do you mind if I sit down?

1584
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,972
I am so sorry.

1585
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,710
No, no, no, no.
It's not your fault.

1586
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,342
- No, it is.
- No, come on.

1587
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,011
I feel like I could kill myself.

1588
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,953
Don't do that.

1589
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,581
I think I'm going to cry.

1590
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,523
Okay, really, don't do that.
I'm bad with that.

1591
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,288
I... I would much rather you kill yourself.

1592
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,384
Don't you want to cry?

1593
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,158
I mean, maybe we should cry together.

1594
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,898
I just...
I just can't figure it out.

1595
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:05,133
No, I...
I shut the door.

1596
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,038
- I... I put him inside...
- No, no, it's not that.

1597
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,474
- and then I shut the door...
- No, I believe you.

1598
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:11,068
I just...
I just feel like somebody's laughing at me.

1599
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,978
Like I...
I'm just trying and trying

1600
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,448
and it's just impossible.

1601
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,883
And I... I don't... I...
I feel like I can't win.

1602
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:23,186
Yeah, it sucks to care about something.

1603
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,419
Every time you do,
it has a bad ending.

1604
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,189
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1605
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,770
Three new messages.

1606
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,706
First new mess...

1607
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,244
Yo.

1608
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,677
What's really good?
It's me.

1609
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,747
Tell him I said hi.

1610
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,008
Candy says hi.

1611
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:55,583
We're just, uh... we're just sitting here.

1612
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,912
I hope you're okay.

1613
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,247
Let me know if there's anything I can...

1614
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,321
Hey!

1615
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,581
Sorry, "we" can do.

1616
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,020
And call me right away
if you hear anything.

1617
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,819
Message erased.

1618
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,325
Next message, se...

1619
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,054
Hey, it's Jules.

1620
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,857
Yeah, we're just driving around right now

1621
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:09,931
looking for the bean.

1622
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,499
Do me a favour, call my cell

1623
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,295
and let us know if you
find him or hear anything.

1624
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,460
I'm gonna...

1625
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,265
What? Oh.

1626
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,396
Yeah.
Benny says he's going to fuck you up

1627
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,530
for breaking his nose.

1628
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:21,439
Anyway, 310-613-21...

1629
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,306
Message erased.

1630
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,209
Next message, sent on...

1631
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:28,477
Hey, this is Brad from Petlove.

1632
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,950
Look, I don't know what
kind of sick person you are.

1633
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,078
I mean,
from the few conversations we've had,

1634
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,849
I assumed there was
something wrong with you.

1635
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,118
But had I known you were
capable of something this low,

1636
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,558
I never would have sold you
the dog in the first place.

1637
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,426
You really should consider
some counselling, sicko.

1638
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,863
I mean, you don't want the dog, fine.

1639
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,901
There's millions of people
that would love to have him.

1640
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,026
Here's the deal.

1641
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,365
I'm calling the Humane Society.

1642
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,735
You want to talk?
I'm here till 8:00.

1643
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,740
Message saved.

1644
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:54,968
End of messages.

1645
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,408
What the fuck?

1646
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,548
Doggie?

1647
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,386
Are you trying to tell me that dog

1648
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,986
walked all the way over here by itself?

1649
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,065
That's what I'm telling you, Brad.

1650
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:15,728
You're listening to Jonesy's Jukebox.

1651
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:19,000
looks like it's going to rain today

1652
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:20,199
in this fuckin' hole.

1653
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,210
I am so fuckin' over
the moon it's not funny.

1654
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,348
Well, maybe it's better this way.

1655
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,017
Who knows?

1656
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,425
I think I might marry this girl.

1657
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,627
Candy.
I really like her.

1658
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,601
I'll kill you, pal.
I'll kill you.

1659
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,139
Oh, get the fuck outta here.

1660
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,281
Look at this.

1661
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:06,688
Bang!

1662
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:08,823
Hey!

1663
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:09,913
How'd he do that?

1664
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,854
How the fuck did he learn how to do that?

1665
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:14,929
I don't know.
I don't know.

1666
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,520
He does it when he hears a horn, too.

1667
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,690
I think that when he ran away

1668
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,027
he had a close call with
a car or something,

1669
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,692
and thought he was dead.

1670
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,769
Hey.
Hey you.

1671
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,497
- Hey!
- Hey.

1672
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,040
Bang!

1673
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,506
Not for me.
It's all right.

1674
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,634
It's good that you have it and I don't.

1675
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,337
Hello.

1676
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,413
Ugh!

1677
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,448
Really, lady, just relax, okay?

1678
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:35,743
It's just underwear.

1679
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,554
Well, I think you're
making the right decision.

1680
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,824
- You do?
- I do.

1681
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,866
It's not some sort of repeat
abandonment thing or anything?

1682
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,129
I don't know.
Is it?

1683
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:56,226
Okay, don't do that.

1684
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,305
Don't do what?

1685
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,533
Okay, you're still doing it.

1686
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,199
Why did you buy the dog?

1687
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:05,302
So... so I could love it.

1688
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,075
Okay.
Then why are you doing

1689
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,740
what you're doing now?

1690
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,750
Just because I think it's
the right thing to do.

1691
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,252
Good.
Now out of what place?

1692
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,950
Out of what place are you going to do it?

1693
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,893
I mean is it, what, fear?

1694
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,521
Uh, confusion?

1695
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:24,894
Is it frustration?

1696
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,992
I mean,
is just that you simply can't handle it?

1697
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:30,304
No.

1698
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,429
Then what is it?

1699
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,486
It's love.

1700
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,890
It's Howard, by the way.

1701
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,860
What?

1702
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,696
My name.

1703
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,133
Howard.

1704
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:00,655
- Hey.
- Hey.

1705
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,024
Oh, you're all wet.

1706
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,097
Come... come in.

1707
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,256
No, wait... you know,

1708
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,731
I wanted to show you
something really quickly.

1709
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,571
Oh, my God!
You found him.

1710
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,908
Where was he?

1711
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,915
Hi, little buddy.
Oh, where was he?

1712
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,575
Oh, it's a long story.

1713
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:25,152
Oh, come in.
I totally want to hear it.

1714
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:28,222
Well, uh, actually, I g... I got to go.

1715
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,286
I, uh... I'm...
I'm taking off for a little bit.

1716
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,491
A friend of mine just
bought a hotel up in...

1717
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,996
up in Needles, New Mexico,
and I...

1718
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,999
and I thought that, uh...
well, I...

1719
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:42,262
I kind like the way it sounded,
Needles, New Mexico.

1720
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,564
It has a nice alliteration.

1721
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,537
Anyway, I...
I thought it would be a good idea to...

1722
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,337
to, uh... to get away
and try to get some writing done.

1723
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,741
Right.

1724
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,041
And, uh...

1725
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,174
I just wanted to say goodbye and...

1726
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,911
thank you.
And, uh...

1727
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,353
And what?

1728
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,994
Well, I-I want you to have him.

1729
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,898
What?

1730
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:13,627
You're wrong.

1731
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,498
It's good to love something.

1732
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,130
Painful or not, it's worth it.

1733
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,108
I think...
I think the only thing worse

1734
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,111
than having something
and living with the fear of losing it

1735
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:29,081
is not having it and...
and looking back with regret.

1736
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:35,018
'Cause life is a...
is a delicate negotiation.

1737
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,023
And I know it's none of my business,

1738
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,789
but I think you should
go back to cutting hair.

1739
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,125
I... I...
It's just an opinion.

1740
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,425
You can take it or leave it.

1741
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,599
I can't take your dog, Solo.

1742
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:48,794
No, you need him.

1743
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,201
No.
Why not?

1744
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,272
Believe me, I...

1745
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,772
I want him but he think he's...

1746
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,466
he's much better off with you.

1747
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,838
He's safer, anyway.

1748
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,311
You can... you can have...
Do you want him?

1749
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:10,256
I do.
Yeah, I do.

1750
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,624
I do.

1751
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,490
Good.
Good.

1752
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,187
That's good.

1753
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:23,569
Well, I'm going to leave
before I start crying, okay?

1754
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,766
Okay.
Oh, I... I name...

1755
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,138
I named him, by the way.

1756
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,804
You can change it if you want,
but I named him Spot.

1757
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,381
Spot?
You named him Spot?

1758
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,473
Yeah, no, I just thought,
you know, something normal.

1759
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,246
Uh, solid dog name, you know.

1760
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,844
But he doesn't have any spots.

1761
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,947
I know.
Well, you can change it if you want.

1762
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,047
Really?
You won't mind?

1763
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,458
Uh, no, no, not really.
No.

1764
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,133
Thank you.

1765
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,861
No, thank you.

1766
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:58,970
I don't know what to say.

1767
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,599
No, that's okay.
All right, okay.

1768
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,302
I'm... I'm gonna...

1769
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,776
- Needles?
- Yeah.

1770
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:05,868
- New Mexico.
- Yeah.

1771
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:06,948
Right.

1772
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:10,779
Bye, Spot.

1773
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:11,874
I love you.

1774
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,421
You didn't walk here, did you?

1775
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,543
This is Jonesy here from Jonesy's Jukebox.

1776
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,055
My neighbour's got this fuckin' dog

1777
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,419
that don't stop barking.

1778
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,722
I'm thinking of ways to kill it.

1779
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:01,625
The best I could come up with

1780
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,562
was you get a bunch
of fuckin' rattlesnakes,

1781
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,031
you sling 'em over the yard.

1782
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,568
Baby ones, 'cause they really sting

1783
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,298
and they don't know
when to stop putting in the venom.

1784
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,340
And then one of them's
going to get the fuckin' dog,

1785
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:15,500
is going to kill it and no
one's going to get blamed

1786
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,441
'cause they're going think
it's a natural fuckin' thing.

1787
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:18,512
You know what I mean?
It's a snake.

1788
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,205
It's not like me going over there

1789
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,873
with poison and poisoning the bastard.

1790
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:23,746
I think that's the best one.

1791
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,012
I think that's what I'm gonna do.

1792
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,815
You're listening to Jonesy.

1793
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,616
Take it away, me old son.
