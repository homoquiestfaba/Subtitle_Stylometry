1
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,084
Hey, old man, you look at me.

2
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,438
I got something to say to you.

3
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,410
Every time we land
someplace new,

4
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:55,346
you say it's gonna be
different, but it ain't.

5
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:04,288
You mess up a lot,
then you leave a mess

6
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,957
for me and Mama and
Dorothy to clean up

7
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,127
and that ain't right.
That's all I'm saying.

8
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,596
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

9
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,164
You do whatever
the hell you want,

10
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,133
whatever you can
get away with.

11
00:01:19,604 --> 00:01:23,307
You're just a selfish old drunk.

12
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:26,576
Yeah, that's what you is.

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,448
This place is gonna be after us.

14
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,450
Hell, they'll be on you,

15
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:37,186
and they're gonna
beat your ass.

16
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:41,958
And I hate to see
you go down.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,193
I know you're my daddy.

18
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,897
You know you sure are,
ain't you?

19
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,132
I'm talking at you.

20
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:02,410
What you done this time,

21
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,246
they'll beat your ass to shit.

22
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:06,982
That's what they're gonna do.

23
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,151
You can count on it.

24
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,535
<i>...service but was looking</i>

25
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:44,207
<i>and it looked as if close
to three inches of rain fell</i>

26
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,509
<i>with a little thunderstorm
complex...</i>

27
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,993
Round 'em up, Junior.

28
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,396
<i>- Yo, it ain't lunchtime yet.
- Round 'em up.</i>

29
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:09,231
<i>Let's pack up
the gear, guys.</i>

30
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,466
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

31
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:26,247
One at a time,
one at a time.

32
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,416
<i>- Hey, hey, hey... one at a time.
- I'm trying to get situated.</i>

33
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:32,787
Go, go, go.

34
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,793
Why y'all moving so slow? Looks like
y'all goddamn turtles out there.

35
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,628
It's getting rained on!

36
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,608
<i>Damn, Joe, when you gonna
get that new truck, Joe?</i>

37
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,111
What's wrong with this one?

38
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:00,247
It's raggedy. You can't tell
what's wrong with it?

39
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,582
- You don't know?
- Yeah...

40
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:05,385
- think I'd get another one.
- Damn right.

41
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:08,187
Let me get a cigarette.

42
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,262
I'm gonna have to start taking
this out of your pay.

43
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,602
All right, then.

44
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,504
See you tomorrow
if the sun comes up.

45
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,373
<i>I'll holler at you in the morning.
Let me know.</i>

46
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,341
All right.

47
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,744
Which jersey now?
Pittsburgh yellow?

48
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:46,191
<i>All right!</i>

49
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,900
You can see the moisture
moving northward

50
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,503
out of Mexico and also out
into the Gulf of Mexico,

51
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,238
meeting up with
this frontal system,

52
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,306
which is slowly being...
been sagging southward.

53
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,876
As we look at temperatures
with the cloud cover,

54
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,777
<i>not as hot as what
we've been seeing,</i>

55
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,514
<i>but the cool-down isn't
related to Canadian air.</i>

56
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:48,483
<i>Here's some Canadian air over the
northeastern part of the country.</i>

57
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,619
<i>Very high dew points.</i>

58
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,188
<i>This represents a whole lot
of moisture available to us</i>

59
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,224
<i>and to those tall clouds
producing the heavy rains.</i>

60
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,527
<i>So the showers and thunderstorms
during tonight...</i>

61
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,430
<i>- Morning, Junior.
- Morning, Joe.</i>

62
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:41,467
<i>Shit, Joe. If it's gonna rain, call me.
I'll show up.</i>

63
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,369
What about Shorty?
He get drunk last night?

64
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,938
<i>- Shorty almost got arrested last night.
- What? He what?</i>

65
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,607
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

66
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:53,679
All right. Yeah, I'll be up at
Coleman's in 30 minutes.

67
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,549
<i>- Y'all be ready.
- Bye-bye!</i>

68
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:58,917
Ooh, Shorty, that was
a rough night last night.

69
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,986
Almost didn't make it to
work this morning, boy.

70
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:03,889
- I heard some stories.
- You'd be surprised.

71
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,490
Drinking and trying to touch
this lady on the butt.

72
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,735
<i>Here's Joe, y'all.
Here's Joe.</i>

73
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,537
Come on, Joe,
help a brother out, now.

74
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,305
- Good morning, Joe.
- Morning.

75
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,407
Y'all come go with me.

76
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:24,675
- All right.
- Don't know why, either.

77
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,544
Don't make no sense,
though, you know?

78
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,679
<i>- Morning, John.
- Hello, Joe.</i>

79
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,881
<i>- You want some coffee?
- No, I can get it.</i>

80
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:35,785
It ain't cold, is it?
It was cold yesterday.

81
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:40,357
<i>Now let's see,
you're Bill, right?</i>

82
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,691
I'm Shorty, he's Bill.

83
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,994
- Where's Sammy today?
- Sammy gone fishing, Joe.

84
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:46,263
Hell, Sammy told me
you fired him.

85
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:47,931
I fired his ass three
times already.

86
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,866
You tell Sammy I'm gonna
fire him for good

87
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,467
if he don't start
helping me out some.

88
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:53,936
- Y'all want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure, man.

89
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:56,805
<i>- See that ball game last night?
- Yeah.</i>

90
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:59,041
Them boys played
one hell of a game.

91
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:03,946
<i>- Shorty, you want some of
these wieners? - I'm good.</i>

92
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,448
Shorty, if you had one like this,
you'd be a bad boy, God damn.

93
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,051
Uh-huh, whatever.
You got one of these right here.

94
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,887
<i>That's a shriveled Slim Jim.</i>

95
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,389
<i>Act like you ain't got
nothing to do today.</i>

96
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:15,023
Y'all gonna quit pussyfooting
around me today.

97
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,759
You gonna get some work
out of me, Junior.

98
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,694
All right, you're gonna take
the east side over here.

99
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,962
Take the east side over there.

100
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:25,400
<i>I want you to take the west side
over here today, all right?</i>

101
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,768
Why you looking at me
like you retarded?

102
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,670
Get that thing on
and go with him.

103
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:31,306
<i>- Shorty, you all right today?
- Yeah, I'm good, man.</i>

104
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:33,741
Feeling pretty good? You look like
a goddamn Ghostbuster today.

105
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,410
You all right? You gonna fight
like one today?

106
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:38,912
- You gonna work like one?
- I work well, my man.

107
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,514
- Huh?
- I'm good.

108
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,683
- All right, don't trip on it.
- Yeah.

109
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:45,419
Huh? Yeah, you're gonna go bust
a move on me today, Shorty.

110
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,854
Yeah, bust them trees.

111
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:02,817
<i>A snake!</i>

112
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:05,519
Better watch it there, man.

113
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,922
I don't know. That cottonmouth's
pretty big.

114
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:10,491
Look here.

115
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,793
Look at that.
Don't know how big he is.

116
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,728
- Watch it there!
- Watch it, watch it!

117
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,798
- Watch it!
- Ooh!

118
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,234
Hey, Junior.

119
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,903
Whoo-hoo,
that's a big one now!

120
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:26,806
He can be known
as the snake god.

121
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,681
Joe, you got nuts
of a bear, Joe.

122
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,182
That's what that woman
told me last night...

123
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:40,252
"I need another snake. "
I've seen one today.

124
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:43,055
<i>Yeah.</i>

125
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,794
That's what that
fat woman said.

126
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,866
<i>We got company.</i>

127
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,136
Let me see that snake.

128
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,108
- Ain't he a nice one?
- Mm.

129
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,644
See those fangs?

130
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,180
You get bit by those,
you're gonna die.

131
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:11,649
You're gonna wanna die.

132
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:15,052
Y'all don't kill it.
It's my friend.

133
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,687
- Whoa!
- Damn!

134
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,289
<i>Almost throwed it
over by me!</i>

135
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,591
Get back to work, y'all.
The show is over with.

136
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,127
- I heard you screaming.
- I wasn't scared. I just move fast.

137
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:26,630
<i>Whatever.</i>

138
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,532
What y'all doing?
Y'all cutting these trees?

139
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,235
We're killing trees.

140
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:34,037
What for?

141
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,973
Nedermeyer land.

142
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:40,110
The owner hires us to
get rid of what's on it

143
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:44,547
so they can come in and
put strong pines on it.

144
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,116
<i>Nobody wants these trees.
These trees are weak.</i>

145
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,886
<i>They're not good
for anything.</i>

146
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,022
These boys will sit down if
I don't stay on their asses.

147
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,924
- Hey, mister.
- Yeah?

148
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:56,892
<i>I got a question
for you.</i>

149
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,160
You see, me and my daddy
just got into town.

150
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,796
I was wondering if you'd
give us a job.

151
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,933
We're looking for work.

152
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:09,771
- How old are you?
- 15.

153
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:13,141
Well, you got 45 seconds to tell
me why I should hire you.

154
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,009
I baled hay before,
I worked on a truck.

155
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:20,114
I picked tomatoes,
zucchini, cucumbers.

156
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,116
Uh, okra.
Squash.

157
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:25,253
All right. You're not afraid of work.
Good.

158
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,788
- What's your name?
- Gary Jones.

159
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,256
I'm Joe.

160
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:31,325
I pay a day's pay
for a day's work.

161
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,627
I pay on Fridays, so you get
a little something today.

162
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,730
<i>- Okay. - But your first real
payday is next Friday.</i>

163
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:39,166
We start about 6:00
in the morning,

164
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:41,868
<i>quit at 1:00 or 2:00.</i>

165
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,271
And if we work till dinner or get
rained out, I pay for the whole day.

166
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,273
- Does that sound fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

167
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:48,008
<i>All right.
Follow this line of trees...</i>

168
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,343
- Yes, sir. - Close to a half
mile back to my truck.

169
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:52,311
<i>- Juice hatchets are in
the back. - Yes, sir.</i>

170
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:54,780
You get yourself one,
fill it up with poison,

171
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:56,749
come on back same
way you went out.

172
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,284
- Yes, sir.
- And don't get lost.

173
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,353
- I won't.
- Hey!

174
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,157
Don't you want to know how
much you're getting paid?

175
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,926
- How you doing?
- Good.

176
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,260
Doing all right?
You ready to work today?

177
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,996
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Junior.

178
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,397
- Gary. - Well, Gary, I'm gonna
be over you today.

179
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,966
Raise your right hand. You're gonna have
to swear you're gonna work hard for me.

180
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:17,102
Not that hand, your right hand.
Your other right.

181
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:19,704
Your right hand.
There you go.

182
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,740
<i>Put your hand up.
You got to swear on something.</i>

183
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:24,743
Now you on the all-star team.

184
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,845
- You promise to work hard?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:30,281
I don't know why Joe chose you.
You must be a good man.

186
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,417
First thing we do is fill
these containers up,

187
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,151
so we just gonna put
it in there like that.

188
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,087
Once we get it filled up real good,
then we on.

189
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,189
- What's in the poison?
- Shit.

190
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:41,659
Shorty's grandmas make
this in they basement.

191
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,394
I don't know what's in it, but we
ain't gonna worry about it.

192
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,295
I know it works real good.

193
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,197
You thought that was easy pumping
that thing, didn't you?

194
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,400
I made it look easy
'cause I'm a man.

195
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:52,836
You're a little boy... you got to figure
it out. You see what I'm saying?

196
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:55,139
There you go.
See how you figured that out?

197
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:58,107
When you become a man, you gonna
have everything figured out too.

198
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:01,077
Be careful. Now this
stuff is real poisonous

199
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,746
and if it gets in your eyes, man,
you're out of there.

200
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:08,051
Just ask Junior.
Now... now here you go.

201
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,887
- Which hand you use?
- Uh, the right.

202
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,291
Prime it up a little bit,
keep striking it.

203
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:18,393
If you hit it hard enough, you only
have to hit it three or four times.

204
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,032
Gotta get angry at the tree, man.
Get mad at it.

205
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:27,102
Yeah, I like that. Get mad at it.
Keep on working it.

206
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,838
Mad. Work with it,
work with it!

207
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,008
Yes, sir. Get it!

208
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,242
Keep on with it, youngster.

209
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,278
I like that, man.

210
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,780
Joe's been around, he's been
around a little bit, man.

211
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:41,916
He's got some things up
under his belt, man.

212
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,485
So I advise you,
when you do go to Joe,

213
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,822
keep it real with Joe.
Don't lie to him about nothing.

214
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:50,491
And one thing Joe is real
particular about, man...

215
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,494
don't never look down at the ground.
Look him in the face.

216
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,997
He likes to see a man's eyes.
You... one-on-one.

217
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,034
- That's how Joe is, man.
- Where you from?

218
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:02,837
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

219
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,038
Being a little bitty boy,
you been everywhere, huh?

220
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,207
Was your daddy in the
military or something?

221
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,978
Oh, yeah? All right. You got
a family? All right, then.

222
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,214
You know we ain't gonna cut you
no slack out here, don't you?

223
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:15,882
Just 'cause you're young now,

224
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,250
you know we ain't
gonna cut no slack.

225
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,885
<i>Everybody pull
their own load, baby.</i>

226
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,854
Once we get this
filled up here,

227
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:24,023
we can kill us about a hundred
trees with this here.

228
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,191
Is killing trees against the law?

229
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:29,394
Well, the lumber company

230
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,163
can't cut 'em down
unless they dead,

231
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,232
and so the lumber
company hire us

232
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:35,834
to come in and poison the trees

233
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:38,437
so we can kill 'em and they'll
come in and die theyself.

234
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,372
Yeah, I've been doing this
for a little minute now.

235
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:42,474
- Welcome to the program.
- Thanks.

236
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:46,845
The machete crew is the one that
comes through and clears it out.

237
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,112
Chop down at the angles.

238
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,881
Try to get as low as you can.

239
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,917
You gotta clear the path
for your teammates.

240
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,821
Without you, none of
this is gonna happen.

241
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,490
Just keep hammering at it.
Nothing's stopping you.

242
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:00,992
You have to start out...
you'll probably be

243
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,860
the water man for a little
while, you know?

244
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:04,495
It's gonna look like you're doing
everything for everybody,

245
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:08,299
bringing 'em water. At the end,
you'll become a machete vet.

246
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,033
Samurai king, right here.

247
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,369
- Waa-ah!
- Waa-ah!

248
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,271
Welcome to the crew.
You're the youngest.

249
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,872
<i>Gotta crawl
'fore you walk.</i>

250
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,175
Got a lot of energy there.

251
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:21,144
- Hah!
- There you go.

252
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:26,249
- Samurai gods!
- Yah!

253
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,318
Crew! When y'all get through
this side over here,

254
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,586
we're going to the west side.

255
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,321
<i>All right.</i>

256
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:34,190
Hey, Gary, you're
getting too far ahead.

257
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,926
Come on back here.
Help these fellas out.

258
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:55,910
You know what? You, you and you,
y'all did a good job today.

259
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,478
Why don't y'all go ahead
and get paid,

260
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,181
and I'll see y'all
Monday, all right?

261
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,282
Bill.

262
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,318
- Allan.
- Thank you, sir.

263
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,989
- And Gary, right?
- Yes, sir.

264
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:10,859
Gary, Gary, Gary.

265
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:14,596
Come back Monday.

266
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:17,197
Bring your daddy
if he wants to work.

267
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,167
Yes, sir, I will.

268
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,436
We'll be there.
Thanks.

269
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:58,170
Mama!

270
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:01,140
Hey, Mama, guess what?

271
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:05,176
I got us jobs today.

272
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:09,281
- I got a job today.
- Good for you, baby.

273
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,524
<i>Dorothy!
Dorothy, guess what.</i>

274
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:22,627
<i>He got one.
That's good.</i>

275
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:38,409
Stop!
Sorry.

276
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:52,622
Got that asshole put away?

277
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:55,591
Yes, Joe, he's in the back.

278
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,661
That asshole bites me again...

279
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,496
Well, he's got the devil in him.

280
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:04,500
- Fuck that.
- Come on, baby.

281
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,342
Well, look at that.
What's that?

282
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:17,713
Come here.

283
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:21,350
A Mexican game show.
That's what I'm talking about.

284
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:25,654
<i>- Can I fix you something, baby?
- Coke, ice.</i>

285
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,532
Here you go, sweetie.

286
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:48,275
So what you got
the blues over, Joe?

287
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:51,612
I'm not so bad.

288
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:55,482
Want one of my girls?

289
00:21:55,484 --> 00:21:57,717
You want two of my girls?

290
00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:02,789
Not today.
Today is a special day.

291
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:07,627
- It is? - I only want
your company, Merle.

292
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,535
- Why, thank you.
- Come here.

293
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,538
<i>Mmm!</i>

294
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,476
Lace!

295
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,478
- Asshole!
- Lacy!

296
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,214
Put the dog in the back!

297
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:32,217
I got it. Come on.
I got it.

298
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,286
Come on.

299
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,757
You don't need that thing
to take care of you.

300
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,162
Where are you going, Joe?

301
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,171
Girl, get your ass off the floor.

302
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:57,075
Quit being stupid.

303
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:19,763
- You see who that was?
- Yes.

304
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,332
Was that World War I or II?
Where'd you get that hat?

305
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,333
- W-W-2.
- Oh, right.

306
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:26,268
Got it down there
at the Army-Navy.

307
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,238
Been making some money over at
Henry's house, throwing the dice.

308
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,207
Yeah, I know. I was gonna go
over there later, clean him out.

309
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,609
Maybe I'll see you there.

310
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,444
I've been doing pretty good
taking the money

311
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,581
from them old ladies that old
blind George hang out with.

312
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,384
<i>Take about 60 or 70%
of my winnings</i>

313
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,487
and donate it to the
diabetes research.

314
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:49,624
Then I take the rest of it
and buy war paraphernalia.

315
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,627
One of these days I'm gonna
be a regular GI Joe.

316
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,796
Pow.
Fistful of dollars!

317
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,565
Or something like that.

318
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,179
Henry.

319
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,248
In here, Joe!

320
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,152
Hey, Joe.
How you been doing?

321
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:22,256
<i>- Who's that? - Henry's just
making a damn mess here.</i>

322
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,525
- What are you trying to do, Henry?
- I don't know.

323
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:32,331
Yeah, well, I don't think
I'd cut it into a roast.

324
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,900
<i>No.</i>

325
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:35,334
You can do it any way
you want to,

326
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,903
but if it was mine,
I'd cut it into steaks.

327
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:39,238
Come over here and show
him how to do it, honey.

328
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,274
And Henry, you can
sit down there

329
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:43,376
and tell me a joke or sing
a song or something.

330
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,745
Shit, you might as well just
let Blind George cut it up.

331
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:49,849
I'm gonna sit down and have me
a cigarette in this wheelchair.

332
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:53,618
- Couldn't you, George? - I reckon I
could do better than he's doing it.

333
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,220
- Oh, no.
- No.

334
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:57,956
All right, I'll show you how
to make the steaks.

335
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,792
That'd be good, baby.
I love back scrapple.

336
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:04,296
That's good.
That's enough.

337
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,838
<i>Now look what happened
to the poor thing.</i>

338
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,374
<i>So much blood
on the floor.</i>

339
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,810
<i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

340
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,917
Where'd you get this deer?

341
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,887
It was hung up on the
fence over at Mr. Lee's,

342
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:33,524
<i>and Henry and I was
coming back from the IHOP,</i>

343
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:36,560
and I took out my .38
and shot her in the head.

344
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:41,698
<i>Honey, you use that knife
just like an artist's brush.</i>

345
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,968
<i>I mean, you know
what you're doing, Joe.</i>

346
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,805
<i>Man, look at that.
Oh, man.</i>

347
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:51,307
<i>- There's some good stuff here.
- Woman: That is some good stuff.</i>

348
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,577
Now look here.

349
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:58,948
<i>Man, that is pretty.</i>

350
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,818
Yeah, that's how you do it.
Butterfly steak.

351
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,920
<i>- Wonderful.
- You see how I did that?</i>

352
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:08,590
Now do it here, here and here.

353
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:10,359
Y'all can cut up the rest of it.

354
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,394
So, when you gonna have
another crap game?

355
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,731
Uh, tonight.
You wanna come by?

356
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,366
- What time?
- 10:00.

357
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,767
We're making
a birthday cake.

358
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,536
Joe, you know who's gonna
make the birthday cake.

359
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,306
<i>I'm gonna make a
birthday cake tonight.</i>

360
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:26,641
Are you, Stacy?

361
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,776
<i>I love you, Henry,
but you know what?</i>

362
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,778
I am the fucking
birthday girl here

363
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,813
and I have to make
my own damn cake?

364
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:35,049
<i>It's not my problem.</i>

365
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:41,622
<i>I'll make me a birthday cake,
no problem.</i>

366
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:42,990
I gotta go uptown.
y'all need anything?

367
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:45,392
Honey, I think I need
some freezer paper.

368
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,661
Bring me back some
damn freezer paper

369
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:50,430
<i>and another pack
of cigarettes.</i>

370
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:53,500
- Good stuff.
- We love you, baby.

371
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:55,335
<i>That back scrapple,
that's the part</i>

372
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:58,438
<i>that basically
I only eat.</i>

373
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,375
Hello, Joe!

374
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:10,349
<i>Hold on, boy!</i>

375
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,862
<i>Joe, you all right?</i>

376
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,801
<i>You know who did that,
that asshole Willie.</i>

377
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,402
<i>He's crazy.</i>

378
00:27:31,404 --> 00:27:34,539
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,974
ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

380
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:13,609
<i>Can we go now?</i>

381
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:15,778
<i>What you doing?</i>

382
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,515
Where you gonna go?

383
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,817
We're gonna go into town
and get some food. Come on.

384
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:23,419
Get something to eat with what?

385
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,421
We ain't got hardly nothing here.

386
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:27,890
Well, it ain't much,
but it's something.

387
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:31,694
- Come on.
- I ain't getting up.

388
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,063
Are you drunk?

389
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:37,031
No, I ain't drunk.

390
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,534
<i>- I know you drunk.
- No, I ain't drunk.</i>

391
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,403
You're like, "I ain't drunk. "

392
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,439
I ain't take my medicine today, boy.

393
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:49,110
- I didn't take my medicine today.
- "I'm just tired. "

394
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:51,880
"I ain't drunk. "

395
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:54,549
<i>- Come on, get up.
- Uh, no.</i>

396
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:55,784
Come on.

397
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:59,720
Come on, get up.

398
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,189
Come on, please?
You'll be all right.

399
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,791
Come on.
I'll help you up.

400
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,859
You can make it.

401
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:13,934
Yeah. No...
you know what?

402
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:17,604
I'm gonna sit right
here in the dirt.

403
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:20,073
I'm gonna teach you a little
about break dancing.

404
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:22,208
You ever see break
dancing before?

405
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,577
You know what "pop" and
you know what "locking" is?

406
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,112
Huh, do you, bud?

407
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:29,615
Take this hand right here,
pretend it's going over a wave

408
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,217
like you're out there
in the ocean.

409
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,985
You floating.
Come on, son.

410
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:34,520
<i>You floating
out in the ocean.</i>

411
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,458
Whoa. Tidal wave coming
across the other side.

412
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,627
Here we go. Oh, yeah.
We're waving now.

413
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,062
Bring it back up.
Here comes the big one.

414
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,667
Ow-oo! Yeah.
Here it is. Hey! Hey!

415
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:51,236
Oh, now, now. That shit
ain't funny right there.

416
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:52,637
That shit ain't
funny at all.

417
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:55,240
I'll come get it now.

418
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:58,610
You want it.
You want it?

419
00:29:58,612 --> 00:29:59,945
I'm not through
with my lesson.

420
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:02,714
Life's lesson. You only
learned about waving.

421
00:30:02,716 --> 00:30:04,483
<i>Popping.
You ever see popping?</i>

422
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:08,185
Pop. That's pop.
You know what locking is?

423
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:09,553
I really can't do a
whole lot of locking

424
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:12,990
unless I'm standing and...

425
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,258
Stand up.
Come on.

426
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,126
I don't see myself
doing much of that

427
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:19,530
in the near future there, son.

428
00:30:19,532 --> 00:30:20,798
I know you drunk 'cause
you about to spill it.

429
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,934
Oh, did I spill it?
I need a pillow.

430
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:26,904
Ah.
There we go.

431
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:28,838
<i>Yeah.</i>

432
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,575
One, two...

433
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,820
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

434
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,558
Hey, mister.

435
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,793
<i>Can you give me a ride?</i>

436
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,128
Say it again?

437
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,963
Me and my daddy
was wondering

438
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,199
if you could give us
a ride back to town.

439
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,834
He ain't feelin' too good.

440
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,704
Shit, yeah.

441
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:05,073
Yeah, I'll give you boys a ride.

442
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,276
Come on.
Where's your daddy at?

443
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,112
He's back that-away.

444
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:14,315
What you chunk that gun
off the bridge for?

445
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:20,721
I just threw it.

446
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:22,223
You know?

447
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,966
Weapons tend to make men
do violent things.

448
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:32,066
You know, guns...

449
00:31:32,068 --> 00:31:35,569
knives, cannonballs...

450
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:38,104
little sticks of dynamite.

451
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:43,276
Hell, even automobiles.

452
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:50,150
Hey.
Come here.

453
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:52,786
Look at my face.

454
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,589
You see that?

455
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:57,356
I see it.

456
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:59,959
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

457
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,962
and I don't give a fuck.

458
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,364
<i>Now, folks looking
for trouble</i>

459
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:07,800
<i>tend to find more
than they're after,</i>

460
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:11,370
and I'll kill his fucking ass
if he ever slaps me again.

461
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:15,140
- You understand me?
- Who you talking about?

462
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,876
If he ever...

463
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:22,380
slaps me...

464
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,248
again.

465
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:38,763
Oh.
You got any sisters?

466
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:43,166
- What?
- Sisters!

467
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:46,737
You got any sisters?

468
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:50,907
Is she pretty?

469
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:53,010
Mister, don't you talk
about my sister.

470
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,380
<i>Oh, well, shit.</i>

471
00:32:56,382 --> 00:33:00,183
You're a tough little
sumbitch, ain't you?

472
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:01,852
Who the fuck you
talking to, huh?

473
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,286
I'm talking to you, mister.

474
00:33:03,288 --> 00:33:05,655
Don't you disrespect my family.

475
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,091
You know what I think?

476
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:11,694
I think I'm gonna say whatever
the fuck I wanna say.

477
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:15,364
You get the hell off me, mister.
I ain't done nothing to you.

478
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:20,836
I don't think I want to give
you that ride no more.

479
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:23,839
Mm-mm. I think I'm
gonna take you

480
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:25,908
and I'm gonna throw
you off that bridge.

481
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,176
See how you like that, hmm?

482
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:30,178
Hmm?

483
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:35,083
Look at me, son.
Look at my face.

484
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,285
I went through a windshield
at 4:00 one morning,

485
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:38,987
and I don't give a fuck.

486
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,730
Look at me,
you son of a bitch!

487
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:52,366
You stupid motherfucker,
you think I'm a kid?

488
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:54,101
You think I'm a goddamn kid?

489
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:57,271
I'll beat your ass and now
you know it's true!

490
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:31,461
<i>Quiet!</i>

491
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,270
<i>Joe!</i>

492
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:49,178
Joe!
Is he gonna bite me?

493
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,879
God damn it,
would you shut up?

494
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,982
Shut up and get back under there!
Let these ladies alone.

495
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,984
Git!

496
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:59,955
Y'all come on.
Dog won't bite.

497
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,994
That dog's crazy.
What if you hadn't been here?

498
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:08,396
If I hadn't been here,

499
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:09,897
you wouldn't have had no
business in my goddamn yard.

500
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:11,999
Damn, what happened to you?

501
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:15,203
Oh, hang on a minute.

502
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,344
The place is a mess, Joe.

503
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:26,413
<i>I wasn't expecting company.</i>

504
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:29,216
Well, we was just driving around,

505
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,551
<i>looking for something to do.</i>

506
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:34,354
Didn't know if you'd
be home or not.

507
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,157
Open up!

508
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:13,892
Are you all right?

509
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:17,328
I gotta quit smoking.

510
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,331
What the hell happened to you?

511
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:25,036
I slapped some asshole the
other night at the bar.

512
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,404
He come back and he shot me.

513
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:28,973
Jesus, Joe.

514
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:31,376
What, you and Willie Russell
be running around,

515
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:33,143
acting like kids again?

516
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:35,012
It's ridiculous.
I don't even remember

517
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:37,147
what set you off
in the first place.

518
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:43,020
Neither do I.

519
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:46,290
So what was it you
wanted to talk about?

520
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,658
You need some money?

521
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,029
No, nothing like that.

522
00:37:56,601 --> 00:38:01,270
You know that guy Frank?
The guy?

523
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:03,139
He's back in town.

524
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:05,107
<i>And I don't want
to stay at my mama's.</i>

525
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,442
I thought she run him off.

526
00:38:06,444 --> 00:38:09,278
<i>She did.
Twice.</i>

527
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,248
But he called the other night.

528
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,218
Came back begging
for forgiveness.

529
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,620
<i>She said he could stay</i>

530
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:21,489
<i>as long as he promised
to leave me alone.</i>

531
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:24,326
And he promised.

532
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:29,097
Just like he always does,
but...

533
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,371
Still got your job
up at the cleaners?

534
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:44,511
<i>- Good. - I wouldn't
even hardly be here.</i>

535
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:48,749
I could take care of you...

536
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:52,086
<i>if you let me.</i>

537
00:38:53,421 --> 00:38:56,423
I promise I won't even
tell her where I'm at.

538
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:58,025
You won't have to.
She'll know.

539
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:01,762
She already called here
40 times looking for you.

540
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:10,169
You can stay with me
if you need to.

541
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:15,508
I can't promise you much,
but I'll try to be nice.

542
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:20,213
One, two, three, six, 11.

543
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:22,582
Get off your ass. You ain't
nothing but a number.

544
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,416
<i>Let's go, y'all.</i>

545
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:28,220
<i>Yo, Sam, where you been?
Haven't seen you around.</i>

546
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:30,288
You in those night school
classes or something?

547
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,690
Not yet.

548
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,226
Doing a little work
on the side.

549
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:37,062
Trying to make a little extra cash,
get my shit together.

550
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:39,464
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

551
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:42,567
I know. We're just not good enough
for you anymore, are we, Sam?

552
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:44,503
I didn't say that.

553
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:47,471
Who these white folks
you got working?

554
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:51,776
<i>Yeah, I'm not sure. They need
work and I need help.</i>

555
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:54,612
<i>Young, old, black,
white, red, yellow.</i>

556
00:39:54,614 --> 00:39:56,714
<i>I really don't
give a shit, Sammy.</i>

557
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:59,717
Water. Where's your
fucking water?

558
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:31,780
That's my water there.
why you drinking my water?

559
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:34,183
Thirsty, that's why.

560
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:36,518
That's my personal water.

561
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,755
Why you drinking my
water up like that?

562
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:43,525
We're gonna have a problem
outta you all day, huh?

563
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,829
If I catch you with
my water again,

564
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:49,598
<i>you're gonna have
a problem outta me.</i>

565
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,634
- Joe sent you down
here with me? - Yeah.

566
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,769
Let me help you with that pack.

567
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:57,138
The hell you use this thing for?

568
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,541
I'll show you how
to walk through it.

569
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,710
Man, this thing's heavy.

570
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:06,347
You use this lever right here
to pump out the poison.

571
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:09,217
You take this hatchet
and hit into the tree.

572
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:13,488
Let's see what you got.

573
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,623
Hit it right here.

574
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,190
Goddamn thing is
leaking all over.

575
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:18,658
It happens sometimes.
Let's get to work.

576
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Let's hit right here.

577
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:24,364
This is bullshit right here.

578
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:26,900
<i>Swing it.</i>

579
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,603
<i>You gotta swing it
harder than that.</i>

580
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:35,308
<i>Man, this is some
stupid-ass shit, man.</i>

581
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,511
You know he can't
even talk now.

582
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:40,312
Y'all niggas...
y'all niggas didn't eat it.

583
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:42,214
I am hungry.

584
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:43,916
<i>Ain't gonna kill you with
our greenback there.</i>

585
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:48,354
<i>I don't want to know about your king
cobra, okay? Or whatever you call it.</i>

586
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:49,889
"Go Go Gadget Tongue,"
that's what he got.

587
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,792
You ever notice that
about your girl, man,

588
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:58,497
- Wait a minute. - No, one sit up here
and the other one sit down here?

589
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:01,666
<i>No comment, no comment.</i>

590
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,704
<i>- Don't go head first.
- I don't.</i>

591
00:42:06,706 --> 00:42:11,409
<i>Tell the truth about them drips he had,
man, about that penicillin shot.</i>

592
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:13,912
<i>That's a lie! That's a damn lie!
That's a damn lie!</i>

593
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:18,683
Sure is a beautiful day
out here, ain't it?

594
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,218
It's all right.

595
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,619
Sitting here like the
angels sitting there

596
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,221
under this pretty sun.

597
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:25,889
Maybe I am an angel.

598
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:27,624
Yeah, but you gotta
go to work on my job.

599
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,260
You ain't on my job working.
Why you not working today?

600
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:32,296
What, did you come up here
to give me a hard time?

601
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:33,730
I been looking at you
all goddamn day,

602
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:34,865
and I see you up here smoking
a goddamn cigarette

603
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,433
watching the goddamn water.

604
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:38,202
You think you're a pretty
sumbitch out here,

605
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:39,603
and we gotta come
out here to work.

606
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,572
I don't know why you
ain't trying to work.

607
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:43,540
I done all the work
I'm gonna do today.

608
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,541
So you ain't did shit
all goddamn day.

609
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:46,943
You ain't done a motherfucking...

610
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:49,545
- And who are you to tell me?
- I'm your goddamn boss.

611
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:51,480
As long as you here,
I'm your boss.

612
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:52,848
You ain't my boss,
and obviously

613
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,483
you can't even watch
what people are doing,

614
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,319
'cause if you saw anything,

615
00:42:56,321 --> 00:42:57,720
you know I've been
working all day.

616
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,355
I've been working
all damn day!

617
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:03,526
Yeah... no, you been on your
ass all goddamn day!

618
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:04,894
Who's gonna argue with who?

619
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:05,995
You ain't did shit
all goddamn...

620
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:07,697
I'm trying to get you working!

621
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:08,763
Man, I worked my ass off!

622
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:10,732
You ain't did shit
all goddamn day!

623
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,768
You're gonna get your ass
off my motherfucking job!

624
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,770
Well, you go tell Joe right now!

625
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:19,774
Joe goddamn gonna get rid of
you or do something different.

626
00:43:19,776 --> 00:43:21,610
Something gonna change today

627
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:23,778
'cause tomorrow, we ain't
gonna have this bullshit.

628
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,880
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done with this bullshit.

629
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:27,549
Good, I'm glad you're done!

630
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:30,317
I'm glad you're done.
Stay done.

631
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,855
Look like you got a yeast infection
on your goddamn face,

632
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,590
you country motherfucker!

633
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:56,809
Can you make it out of there?

634
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:59,879
Yeah, I'll make it, I guess.

635
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:02,548
Goddamn assholes.

636
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,352
Come here, son.

637
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:07,854
Help me get over this tailgate.

638
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:09,555
So what time you need us
back in the morning?

639
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:12,492
I don't need you back
in the morning.

640
00:44:12,494 --> 00:44:13,960
What do you mean you
don't need us back?

641
00:44:13,962 --> 00:44:16,895
We got the job done, didn't we?

642
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:19,464
This is yours there, son.

643
00:44:24,003 --> 00:44:27,039
We got the job done.
Gary said we got the job.

644
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,640
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

645
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:32,811
Clear brush anytime, anywhere.
I can do it.

646
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:34,379
<i>Joe, I'd sure like
to work some more.</i>

647
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:37,815
Yeah, maybe later.
I'll let you know.

648
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,888
I don't know what you did

649
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,990
<i>that made that
man mad, son.</i>

650
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:48,426
You hear me?

651
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:57,368
The hell you looking at?

652
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:15,552
Just another day.

653
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:17,821
It ain't his fault.

654
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:22,558
He loves us.
Just...

655
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,961
He just goes through
a hard time.

656
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:38,407
Well, I ain't gonna
watch him sit there

657
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:40,876
and hit you like he
hits me, you hear me?

658
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:42,878
Okay, Mama?

659
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:48,950
Ain't supposed to do
that to no one.

660
00:45:54,823 --> 00:45:59,427
<i>You stay with
your family.</i>

661
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:01,963
<i>That's what you
need to do.</i>

662
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:05,566
You need to stay
with your family.

663
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:11,838
Your family's all you got.

664
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:28,655
What was that?

665
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,956
I don't know.

666
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:34,193
- Didn't hear no car drive up.
- Probably ain't nobody.

667
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:37,196
Ain't nobody with
any sense out in this.

668
00:46:37,198 --> 00:46:40,966
<i>- I'm just a medium.
- Can't taste that.</i>

669
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:48,441
<i>You want to
go out tonight?</i>

670
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:51,010
Not really.

671
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:56,581
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

672
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,616
Hmm...

673
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,887
I don't know.

674
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:04,923
I was just wondering

675
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,925
if we were gonna do something.

676
00:47:08,694 --> 00:47:11,796
I think you work too much.

677
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,899
You should get out.

678
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,569
Do something fun.

679
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:21,505
I hadn't planned on it.

680
00:47:21,507 --> 00:47:24,107
Unless you want to.

681
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:32,115
We don't have to.

682
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,587
<i>Ah...</i>

683
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:39,021
There's someone out there.

684
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:43,593
No. No, wait.
Hold this.

685
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,038
Hey, Joe, can you
put that dog up?

686
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,140
Oh, hell, I know who it is.

687
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:04,112
Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.

688
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,515
What'd you plan to do,
stand there all night?

689
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,783
He should get out
of them wet clothes.

690
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,519
- He'll get sick.
- I'm all right.

691
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:12,087
I just... I just wanted
to come by

692
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,589
- and talk to you about working
some more. - Work?

693
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,057
Don't you see what it's
doing out there?

694
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,760
Yes, sir.

695
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,262
Hey, where's my drink at?
You got any trousers he can wear?

696
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:22,663
What size waist you got?

697
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:25,866
I think I have some
cool pants he can wear.

698
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,771
I bet nobody come mess 'round
here with that dog out there.

699
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:32,206
<i>Well, that's why
I got the dog.</i>

700
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,775
The dog won't bother anybody
just walking down the road.

701
00:48:34,777 --> 00:48:36,544
Road ain't dogs.

702
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,811
<i>Dog knows what's dogs.</i>

703
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:39,079
<i>You could have
just walked on off,</i>

704
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:40,281
<i>the dog wouldn't
have done anything.</i>

705
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,683
All right, here.
Try these on.

706
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:45,151
I think they'll fit you.

707
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:48,288
The bathroom's this way.

708
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,023
<i>The dog is a good dog.</i>

709
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:53,660
Yeah. That dog scared the
hell out of me, though.

710
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:56,663
He's all beat up.

711
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:59,332
Mm-hmm.
His daddy.

712
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:01,801
Saw him do it.

713
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,804
You what?

714
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:07,706
What, you just sat there

715
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,975
and watched it, or what?

716
00:49:09,977 --> 00:49:12,978
He's a big kid.

717
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:18,951
I can't get my hands dirty
in every little thing.

718
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:20,652
You know how I get.

719
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:22,220
You're a grown man, Joe.

720
00:49:22,222 --> 00:49:24,590
What is that supposed to mean?

721
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:27,159
It can mean whatever
you want it to mean.

722
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:29,860
Don't fool yourself
too much about me.

723
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:37,902
<i>Hey, there you go.</i>

724
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:39,236
You look like a million bucks.

725
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:42,840
<i>Feel better now?</i>

726
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:45,610
I feel like a hundred bucks.

727
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:48,746
Come by 'cause I wanted to
talk to you about my job.

728
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:53,116
I wanna work.
I need a job.

729
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:56,152
My daddy don't care
if he gots a job, but I do.

730
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:59,122
You'd work in this rain,
wouldn't you?

731
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:02,659
If you need me to.

732
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:08,698
Let me slip my shoes on.
I'll run you back home.

733
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:18,407
Hey, we'll be there
in just a second, okay?

734
00:50:19,843 --> 00:50:22,044
Hey.

735
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:24,913
You know you don't have to take
no shit from nobody, right?

736
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:28,250
You know that, right?

737
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:30,252
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:34,423
Good.
Now let's go.

739
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:38,860
- How you been, Chris?
- Good, how about you?

740
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:41,195
You still doing the
mixed martial arts?

741
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:42,697
Yes, sir.

742
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:44,866
What you doing
out in the rain, Joe?

743
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,969
Oh, I need two pounds of ham

744
00:50:47,971 --> 00:50:50,905
- and a pound of Swiss cheese
sliced up. - All right.

745
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:52,106
Come on, you get the cheese,
I'll get the ham.

746
00:50:52,108 --> 00:50:56,778
I get a little ahead,
it starts in raining again.

747
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:06,219
Here you go.

748
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:08,388
Well, it's not much.
Now look here.

749
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,857
When it dries up,

750
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,293
you come down here early
in the morning, 'fore light,

751
00:51:13,295 --> 00:51:17,330
We got plenty to do when
the weather gets right.

752
00:51:17,332 --> 00:51:20,466
You got a clock?
No, you wouldn't.

753
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:23,069
All right, I'll find you a wind-up
clock or something.

754
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:24,370
All right, then.

755
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,971
Thank you, sir.

756
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:27,973
No, you don't need to call
me "sir" all the time.

757
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:31,877
I'm your friend,
you understand?

758
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:34,013
All right.
Hey, where's his ham?

759
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,382
<i>- Hang on, we're coming.
- All right.</i>

760
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,436
Ahem.

761
00:52:09,247 --> 00:52:12,249
What are you thinking, Joe?

762
00:52:14,252 --> 00:52:16,253
Nothing.

763
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:21,258
There's nothing I can do,
and I hate it.

764
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:25,896
That's not true.

765
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:29,265
Yeah, it is.

766
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:35,037
<i>You look at me like
I can make a move.</i>

767
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,273
<i>What are you thinking when
you look at me like that?</i>

768
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:40,943
<i>Don't you care?</i>

769
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:42,411
<i>I don't know who I am.</i>

770
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:50,410
<i>But I know what keeps
me alive is restraint.</i>

771
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:55,223
<i>It keeps me out of jail.</i>

772
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:57,926
<i>Keeps me from hurting people.</i>

773
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:07,903
Hey.

774
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:12,840
<i>The mark of some fucked-up
faith that there is a reason.</i>

775
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:13,974
Thank you.

776
00:53:13,976 --> 00:53:17,278
<i>A reason for all of this.</i>

777
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,282
<i>A reason in most moments I
shouldn't do what I want to do.</i>

778
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:26,320
<i>I do as I'm told.</i>

779
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:32,493
<i>These men who bust their
asses work like dogs.</i>

780
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:38,164
<i>I believe in them,
but every day, they hurt.</i>

781
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,535
<i>They get old,
they peel back.</i>

782
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:48,842
<i>There's no frontier
anymore.</i>

783
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:50,476
Allan.

784
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,912
Clark.

785
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:55,315
Gary.

786
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:58,517
<i>And I watch that boy,</i>

787
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:01,486
<i>and I see someone
who's nothing like me,</i>

788
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:06,558
<i>but he's a child
folks left behind...</i>

789
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,995
<i>with no defense.</i>

790
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:14,233
<i>Balanced right there.</i>

791
00:54:15,535 --> 00:54:17,903
What do you want?

792
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:28,379
<i>- What is it you want?
- Nothing.</i>

793
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:35,052
<i>Just tell me what I can do.</i>

794
00:54:37,556 --> 00:54:39,957
<i>I like you.</i>

795
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:45,495
<i>I like you too, but what's
the point in any of it?</i>

796
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:54,638
<i>Fuck to this day.</i>

797
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,941
<i>I mean, fuck to this day.</i>

798
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:06,482
<i>It's all just gonna boil up
and wash us away.</i>

799
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:15,090
<i>And he'll still be here.</i>

800
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:20,963
<i>Or maybe he won't.</i>

801
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:34,208
Damn, Joe, why do you keep loading
all these fools in this little truck?

802
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,643
Good to have you with
us again, Sammy.

803
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:37,111
You drop down any more,
we're gonna have to

804
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:38,713
get out and push,
and I ain't pushing shit.

805
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:41,182
I thought you had your eye
on a new truck, Joe.

806
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:42,951
I ain't getting no new truck.

807
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:45,453
- You need one.
- No, I don't.

808
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:47,988
If you get a new truck, how much
you want for this old one?

809
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,656
You mean this old piece of junk?

810
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:52,993
Smell like somebody done
died up in there. It's nasty.

811
00:55:52,995 --> 00:55:54,394
I don't mind the smell.
I like it.

812
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:56,296
It smells good to me.

813
00:55:56,298 --> 00:55:58,532
Yeah, but this thing...

814
00:55:58,534 --> 00:56:01,702
I spend as much time working
on it as I do driving it.

815
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:04,538
'Course there ain't nothing
major wrong with it.

816
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,040
Just little shit. You know,
it needs some brakes.

817
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,176
It needs a new...

818
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:13,379
Joe, come on.

819
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:15,247
I'll buy it from you.
I'll work my butt off.

820
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:17,550
I love the truck.
You have to give it to me now.

821
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:21,220
Well, I mean, it's got
a lot of miles on it.

822
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:23,122
You'd be better finding
one in town somewhere.

823
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:25,591
I don't want one in town.
I like that one.

824
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:30,029
Come on, Joe.

825
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:34,132
All right.
I'll take $900 for it...

826
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:36,201
if I get a new truck.

827
00:56:36,203 --> 00:56:37,535
All right.
Shake hands.

828
00:56:37,537 --> 00:56:39,571
That's what I'm talking about.
Heck, yeah.

829
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:41,539
<i>All right, hey, y'all,
let's go!</i>

830
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,637
Hey, what you got there?

831
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,594
Hey.

832
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:50,562
I was wondering if maybe
you could tell me

833
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:52,431
how to get down
to Water Valley.

834
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:55,834
<i>My wife, she's in the
hospital down there.</i>

835
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,403
<i>I just now got here.</i>

836
00:58:58,405 --> 00:59:01,240
<i>You know how far it is?</i>

837
00:59:03,676 --> 00:59:06,378
Is that the highway
that goes to it?

838
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,514
<i>Is it?</i>

839
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,182
What you drinking?

840
00:59:11,184 --> 00:59:15,186
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

841
00:59:18,323 --> 00:59:21,759
You ain't drinking
some wine, are you?

842
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:23,594
I may.

843
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:25,163
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

844
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:28,332
Some folks think a feller
ought not drink at all,

845
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:30,801
but a little drink
never hurt nobody.

846
00:59:30,803 --> 00:59:33,170
That's right.

847
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:34,671
I get me a little drink
every now and then

848
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:36,673
when I'm down at the house,

849
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:39,276
but the old lady, she raises
so much sand about it,

850
00:59:39,278 --> 00:59:41,945
I don't do a lot of
drinking down there.

851
00:59:41,947 --> 00:59:45,282
I usually wait till I get
uptown like I am now.

852
00:59:45,284 --> 00:59:47,617
Grab me a drink.

853
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,955
She all right?

854
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:53,822
Yeah, yeah.
She is today.

855
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,824
That's why I'm trying to get
down there to Water Valley,

856
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,227
go see about her.

857
00:59:58,229 --> 01:00:00,362
I was supposed
to have got paid today,

858
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,265
but the old fella,
he never showed up,

859
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:07,336
you know, so I think I'll go
get me a little drink,

860
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,639
go down to Water Valley
and go see how she's doing.

861
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,875
She in the hospital?

862
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:16,711
Yeah, she's in the hospital.
She got cancer.

863
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,547
Just eat up with it all over.

864
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,816
You know.

865
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,285
Damn thing, you know,
a person just don't know

866
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,954
from one day to the next

867
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,423
which one's gonna be their last.

868
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,297
Well, it's a beautiful
day out there.

869
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,899
Feeling a little
chill in my bones.

870
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,835
I think it's fixing to rain.

871
01:00:41,837 --> 01:00:44,605
<i>It's probably
fixing to rain some.</i>

872
01:02:26,103 --> 01:02:29,472
<i>Three African
painted dogs...</i>

873
01:02:29,474 --> 01:02:35,010
wild dogs... killed a
three-year-old in the zoo.

874
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:39,548
This toddler, he fell in,
hit his head,

875
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,851
and the dogs got him.

876
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:46,054
Where was everybody?

877
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,000
A little kid.

878
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:11,045
Hello, Joe.

879
01:03:11,047 --> 01:03:13,481
How you doing?

880
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:19,686
Oh.
Sumbitch.

881
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:24,624
I'll tell you what, buddy.

882
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:28,661
All this goddamn back and forth
and back and forth.

883
01:03:30,398 --> 01:03:33,032
I'm fucking over it.

884
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:35,535
Yeah, well...

885
01:03:38,471 --> 01:03:42,975
Maybe it's time we just...
bygones.

886
01:03:49,048 --> 01:03:51,884
You know I could have
killed you, right?

887
01:03:51,886 --> 01:03:53,819
I could have killed you,
but I didn't.

888
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:57,456
I licked you. I was aiming for
the trees, see?

889
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,991
That shot was meant
as a warning shot,

890
01:03:59,993 --> 01:04:02,460
'cause all you keep doing
is embarrassing me

891
01:04:02,462 --> 01:04:05,463
in front of my goddamn friends.

892
01:04:05,465 --> 01:04:07,565
I mean, hell, the last time
you slapped me,

893
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:11,536
there was ladies and
gentlemen present.

894
01:04:14,473 --> 01:04:15,807
So what's this shit I hear

895
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:19,644
about this kid you got
working for you, huh?

896
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:25,182
Little drifter kid,
about yea big, hmm?

897
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:27,617
I don't really give
a shit about him,

898
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:31,988
but I suspect you know
where he lives, don't you?

899
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,125
No.

900
01:04:35,127 --> 01:04:37,994
Huh.

901
01:04:37,996 --> 01:04:40,630
What's wrong, Spooky?

902
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:43,533
You still sore at me?

903
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:03,018
Christy, call the cops 'fore
somebody gets killed.

904
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,955
Would you do that
for me, honey?

905
01:05:26,008 --> 01:05:29,043
<i>Hold on.</i>

906
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:35,616
Get back. Hold it!
Hey, Joe.

907
01:05:35,618 --> 01:05:39,019
- Is Merle around?
- Merle ain't here.

908
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:42,289
- You all right?
- I want to get blown, but...

909
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,892
Oh, that's right,
you don't like dogs, do you?

910
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:47,761
<i>That's not true. I love dogs.
Just not that dog.</i>

911
01:05:47,763 --> 01:05:50,697
<i>- That dog is an asshole!
- I'm sorry, Joe.</i>

912
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:52,798
Y'all help me get this
fucking dog out of here!

913
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,537
Joe!

914
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:01,140
<i>Joe!</i>

915
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:00,964
<i>You busy?</i>

916
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:03,166
Come on.

917
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:25,854
<i>You got any pets?</i>

918
01:07:25,856 --> 01:07:28,757
- I mean, I had a cat.
- A cat? Wonderful.

919
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:30,626
- What's its name?
- Lucy.

920
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:33,261
- What'd you feed it?
- I don't know, fucking dry food.

921
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:36,298
- What's your favorite color?
- Red.

922
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,166
Blow me.

923
01:07:38,168 --> 01:07:40,168
All right.

924
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:43,105
Let me just focus
on the snowflake.

925
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:45,906
- Snowflake on the wall.
- All right, snowflake.

926
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:06,226
All right, all right, all right.

927
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:10,997
<i>- I beg your pardon.
- All right, baby.</i>

928
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:13,133
It's all right.

929
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:17,971
You don't have to run off.

930
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:20,306
I mean, you can stick
around if you want.

931
01:08:22,043 --> 01:08:23,443
Joe?

932
01:08:27,748 --> 01:08:30,049
Dog.

933
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:16,893
Pull over.
Pull over now!

934
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,323
- Come on. Come on, let's go!
- Freeze!

935
01:09:47,325 --> 01:09:49,458
<i>Don't move!</i>

936
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,993
<i>Freeze, Joe!</i>

937
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:54,063
What?
Put the gun down.

938
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,065
Be a man about it and
show me what you got.

939
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,900
- We got you surrounded, Joe.
- Hey, I'm just one dude.

940
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:01,269
Freeze, Joe. Put your hands
behind your head.

941
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:02,937
Come on,
what are you gonna do?

942
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:04,405
- Look, I don't have nothing
on me, man. - Freeze.

943
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:06,941
Why don't you guys
both be like big boys

944
01:10:06,943 --> 01:10:08,977
and put your guns down
and let's talk about it?

945
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:11,246
That's all I'm gonna do.
Just talk about it, all right?

946
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,348
Come on.
Who's gonna cuff me?

947
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,184
<i>What do you got?
I'm feeling real good today.</i>

948
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,887
<i>Hey, Joe.
You in there, Joe?</i>

949
01:10:24,058 --> 01:10:27,094
<i>Coming in, Joe.</i>

950
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,297
<i>Joe here?</i>

951
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:34,234
You seen Joe?
Huh?

952
01:10:34,236 --> 01:10:35,969
What you think, man?

953
01:10:35,971 --> 01:10:38,105
You think Joe is gonna
take care of you?

954
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:42,575
You think Joe's your daddy?
Is that what you think?

955
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:45,178
<i>Joe ain't your daddy.
I'm your daddy.</i>

956
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,148
I'm the one taking care of you.

957
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,917
You got some money?

958
01:10:50,919 --> 01:10:53,052
I know you got some
money hid around here.

959
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:54,554
Where's your money at?

960
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:57,390
I ain't got no damn money.
Joe didn't give me none today.

961
01:10:57,392 --> 01:10:59,292
Really?

962
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:01,160
Give me some money.

963
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:04,163
I just told you,
I ain't got no damn money.

964
01:11:09,068 --> 01:11:12,938
Ain't got no money, huh?

965
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,306
Got food.

966
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:16,341
Got food, goddamn it.

967
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,376
You got food, but you ain't
got no fucking money.

968
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,345
How did you get the food?

969
01:11:29,054 --> 01:11:30,321
What the hell you stumbling for?

970
01:11:30,323 --> 01:11:33,190
You can't even take care
of your damn self.

971
01:11:40,065 --> 01:11:42,032
Hey, that's my shit!

972
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:46,537
Knock your shit off, boy.

973
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:49,172
Knock your shit off.

974
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:54,510
Fuck.

975
01:11:54,512 --> 01:11:57,580
You ain't got no motherfucking
money, huh?

976
01:11:57,582 --> 01:12:00,350
Oh, hey.

977
01:12:00,352 --> 01:12:02,118
Look at that, huh?

978
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,354
What you... oh, yeah!

979
01:12:04,356 --> 01:12:08,157
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

980
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,460
That's kind of what
I fucking thought.

981
01:12:10,462 --> 01:12:14,463
- Bring it, motherfucker.
- Get the fuck back off me.

982
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:22,404
How's that, huh?

983
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:27,609
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

984
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:29,344
<i>Yeah.</i>

985
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,680
<i>What?
Don't seem to be talking...</i>

986
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:34,482
doing a whole lot
of talking right now.

987
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:37,418
Kinda look like
you in bad shape.

988
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,620
Who the hell you think you are?
You ain't my daddy, you motherfucker!

989
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:43,124
Look at me! You seen what I did to
that motherfucker on the bridge?

990
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,692
I'll beat your ass!

991
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,598
Son of a bitch!

992
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,567
I'm about through
messing with you!

993
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,569
I been out looking
for fucking money!

994
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,671
I been out looking
for a fucking job

995
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,006
to feed your worthless
fucking face!

996
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:04,177
Yeah. You stupid, little
piece of shit.

997
01:13:09,216 --> 01:13:12,052
Yeah.

998
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,521
<i>I know you got money
hid around here, boy.</i>

999
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,557
You know what?
I'm gonna come back.

1000
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,458
I'm gonna get it.

1001
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,628
I'm gonna find it
and I'm gonna get it.

1002
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:48,086
Hey, wake it up, wake it up.

1003
01:13:48,088 --> 01:13:50,521
Earl, please, give me
a goddamn cigarette, man.

1004
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:54,359
Please.
I'm begging you.

1005
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:56,060
You're on your way out
of here anyway, man.

1006
01:13:56,062 --> 01:13:57,762
All right.

1007
01:13:57,764 --> 01:14:00,231
- I called your bondsman for you.
- Thanks, buddy.

1008
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:01,632
How come he's
getting out of here?

1009
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:06,470
Aw, knock it off, Cokie!
Knock it off!

1010
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:09,306
Oh, man, thank you
so much, buddy.

1011
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:14,244
Thank you, buddy.

1012
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:25,688
- What do they got me charged with?
- Shit, a heap. DUI,

1013
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:29,158
assaulting an officer, resisting arrest.
You want some more shit?

1014
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,726
Oh, oh... you know where
they took my truck?

1015
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:33,095
There's a kid who
wants my truck.

1016
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:36,432
Wasn't here last night.
We can sure find out, though.

1017
01:14:38,135 --> 01:14:41,437
You were, 32 when you went
to the pen the first time.

1018
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:43,539
What are you now, 48, 49?

1019
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:47,243
- 48.
- Getting old, Joe.

1020
01:14:47,245 --> 01:14:51,246
Be a lot harder on you every
time from here on out.

1021
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:54,749
But who am I to tell you
how to live your life?

1022
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:58,319
Yeah.
That's a good one.

1023
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:01,222
Come on, man.
Come on, get it together.

1024
01:15:01,224 --> 01:15:03,725
Shit, man.
You kidding me?

1025
01:15:03,727 --> 01:15:05,760
Yeah, I'd like to get
a number on a...

1026
01:15:05,762 --> 01:15:09,230
like, a dog rescue, or...

1027
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:13,634
You don't have a number
on a dog rescue?

1028
01:15:13,636 --> 01:15:17,104
Well, I'm reporting
a lost dog.

1029
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:21,108
Yeah. It's an
American bulldog.

1030
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:23,343
Brown and white.
Female.

1031
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:25,679
90 pounds.

1032
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,455
What are you doing here?

1033
01:15:35,457 --> 01:15:38,357
Um...

1034
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:40,159
Mr. Coleman told me

1035
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:43,096
you got into a little trouble
with some cops.

1036
01:15:43,098 --> 01:15:45,465
That all you heard?

1037
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:50,203
They said you got put up
at that jail too.

1038
01:15:56,609 --> 01:15:58,710
You don't still want
my truck, do you?

1039
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,316
Yes, sir.

1040
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:06,318
You do?

1041
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:15,393
They said you got put up
at the big jail one time.

1042
01:16:15,395 --> 01:16:19,363
<i>- Coleman told you that?
- Yeah.</i>

1043
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:21,899
Yeah, I have.

1044
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:24,401
I did 29 months
in the penitentiary

1045
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,670
for assault on a police officer.

1046
01:16:30,775 --> 01:16:35,513
They pulled me over behind
a shopping center uptown.

1047
01:16:35,515 --> 01:16:37,648
This one officer...

1048
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,650
some pretty-boy type guy...
had some issue with me.

1049
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:42,752
He thought I had something to
do with one of the girls he knew.

1050
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:45,755
I didn't know what the hell
he was talking about.

1051
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:49,359
<i>Then they tried
to shoot me</i>

1052
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:52,195
<i>after I beat the shit
out of all three of them.</i>

1053
01:16:52,197 --> 01:16:55,665
Or one did.

1054
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,635
Deputy went for his gun
and I grabbed it.

1055
01:17:00,538 --> 01:17:03,172
And...

1056
01:17:03,174 --> 01:17:06,842
well, he was fixing to kill me.
He told me he was.

1057
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:13,382
All he did was blow
his kneecap off.

1058
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:15,484
Jackass.

1059
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:20,189
My dog run off last night.

1060
01:17:20,191 --> 01:17:21,657
You want to go look for her?

1061
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:23,559
Sure.

1062
01:17:28,263 --> 01:17:29,730
You want me to drive the truck?

1063
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:31,933
You gotta start sometime.

1064
01:17:31,935 --> 01:17:34,535
Don't look at them.
Don't wave to them,

1065
01:17:34,537 --> 01:17:36,537
<i>'cause they know you're guilty
of something when you wave.</i>

1066
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:41,342
<i>A cop can mess you up
if he wants to.</i>

1067
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:43,244
Yeah, I made the mistakes,

1068
01:17:43,246 --> 01:17:45,646
but they're the ones that won't
ever let me live it down.

1069
01:17:47,648 --> 01:17:49,849
Hey, can I buy one of
them beers off you?

1070
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:53,520
Oh, I don't know.
Uh...

1071
01:17:53,522 --> 01:17:55,255
<i>you can drink
one of these beers,</i>

1072
01:17:55,257 --> 01:17:57,357
but you cannot
buy one from me.

1073
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,460
Friends don't ever need
to buy things from me.

1074
01:18:01,896 --> 01:18:04,531
There you go.
Nice and cold.

1075
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:06,399
Keep your eyes peeled.

1076
01:18:06,401 --> 01:18:09,268
For the cops or the dog?

1077
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:13,272
Both.

1078
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:15,241
"Cops or the dog. "

1079
01:18:15,243 --> 01:18:17,443
You hear that?

1080
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:19,612
That's the sound that gets
the hookers excited

1081
01:18:19,614 --> 01:18:21,413
'cause they know
you got cash.

1082
01:18:21,415 --> 01:18:23,415
They hear that...

1083
01:18:26,853 --> 01:18:29,521
<i># You can stay just as
long as you like... #</i>

1084
01:18:29,523 --> 01:18:31,789
You want to learn
how to make a cool face?

1085
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,591
All right, anatomy
of a cool face.

1086
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:35,760
Make a face of pain.

1087
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:37,929
Now smile.

1088
01:18:37,931 --> 01:18:40,031
No, smile on top of the pain.

1089
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:42,467
Hold the pain.
Smile through it.

1090
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:43,968
You ain't drunk, are you?

1091
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,637
Shit, I better drive.

1092
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:48,339
You know what, Gary?
You got it made.

1093
01:18:48,341 --> 01:18:49,941
Just think about all
the beautiful girls

1094
01:18:49,943 --> 01:18:51,542
you're gonna fuck.

1095
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:54,278
Now, I used to know a girl
who lived around here.

1096
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,513
Shit.
Where's my dog?

1097
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:58,282
I raised that dog from a pup.

1098
01:19:01,586 --> 01:19:03,887
- Dog! - There's a lot
of construction here

1099
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:05,689
'cause they're building
that Hindu temple.

1100
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:08,692
Gonna have lots of
"Bombanese" kids.

1101
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:11,662
<i>Little red dots in the
center of their head...</i>

1102
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,597
<i>like a laser beam.</i>

1103
01:19:13,599 --> 01:19:16,666
<i>- Hey! - You better work
on that cool face.</i>

1104
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:19,468
You gotta stand like you
on land, all right?

1105
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:22,371
Now you make the
pain face, right?

1106
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:24,473
You got a lot on your mind.

1107
01:19:24,475 --> 01:19:28,911
Now smile.
Yeah, it's like...

1108
01:19:28,913 --> 01:19:31,013
"I got a lot on my mind,
but I can do it.

1109
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:33,582
<i>I can get through it. "
Yeah, there you go.</i>

1110
01:19:33,584 --> 01:19:35,017
Yeah, that's cool!

1111
01:19:35,019 --> 01:19:37,687
<i># Well, I'll be ready
in the morning, baby #</i>

1112
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,556
<i># Mmm, don't you
worry a bit #</i>

1113
01:19:41,558 --> 01:19:44,793
<i># I got a dry place here,
yes, indeed #</i>

1114
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,361
<i># And you can
have it all... #</i>

1115
01:19:46,363 --> 01:19:48,496
The dog weighs
a hundred pounds.

1116
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:50,899
Has long ears,
with a docked tail.

1117
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:52,634
What was that?

1118
01:19:52,636 --> 01:19:55,337
Yes, ma'am, I meant to
get around to doing that,

1119
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:58,073
but I did a halfway job
on my dog.

1120
01:19:58,075 --> 01:19:59,974
<i>- A halfway job?
- Halfway, ma'am.</i>

1121
01:19:59,976 --> 01:20:03,377
<i>- Well, halfway how?
- Halfway.</i>

1122
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:07,014
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

1123
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:09,550
So, I'm missing my dog,
and the dog is...

1124
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,386
No, uh-uh. That stuff will
make you crazy.

1125
01:20:12,388 --> 01:20:14,355
<i>Well, I'm a pretty
long way from crazy.</i>

1126
01:20:14,357 --> 01:20:17,024
<i>But my dog's about 100 pounds,
brown and white.</i>

1127
01:20:17,026 --> 01:20:19,960
- Looks like a cow.
- Looks like a cow?

1128
01:20:19,962 --> 01:20:21,495
- Right. - You have a dog
that looks like a cow?

1129
01:20:21,497 --> 01:20:22,930
Well, it's not that big a deal.

1130
01:20:22,932 --> 01:20:25,064
A lot of dogs look like cows.
But here's the thing.

1131
01:20:25,066 --> 01:20:26,833
If you happen to see my dog,

1132
01:20:26,835 --> 01:20:30,002
no matter what time, you call.

1133
01:20:30,004 --> 01:20:32,772
- Day or night. All right?
- Okay.

1134
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:33,940
Have we already drove
past that place

1135
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:35,475
where you last saw your dog?

1136
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:38,411
- No. Why?
- I think the dog will be there.

1137
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:41,381
No, the dog run off.

1138
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:43,649
If I was a dog, that's
where a dog would be.

1139
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:47,686
That's where I would go.

1140
01:20:47,688 --> 01:20:50,122
- You be careful with him, okay?
- All right.

1141
01:20:50,124 --> 01:20:52,624
- Be careful driving, baby.
- Call me.

1142
01:20:52,626 --> 01:20:54,593
<i>- Okay.
- All right.</i>

1143
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:03,135
<i># Look at me, amazed #</i>

1144
01:21:03,137 --> 01:21:05,036
<i># Like you got yourself
a soft touch #</i>

1145
01:21:05,038 --> 01:21:09,006
<i># A good deal
to keep a man #</i>

1146
01:21:09,008 --> 01:21:11,175
<i># Yes, you do. #</i>

1147
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:15,146
I'll be damned.

1148
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:27,758
No, wait.
Wait, don't.

1149
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:32,562
Huh?

1150
01:21:34,031 --> 01:21:36,933
Aw...

1151
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:40,470
- The dog likes you.
- She has a lot of scars.

1152
01:21:40,472 --> 01:21:42,972
<i>Yeah.
But all the others...</i>

1153
01:21:42,974 --> 01:21:45,975
all the others is dead.

1154
01:21:58,221 --> 01:22:00,956
Thanks for helping me
find my dog.

1155
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,025
<i>Yes, sir, no problem.</i>

1156
01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:05,594
You work hard.

1157
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:07,596
You got a good heart.

1158
01:22:07,598 --> 01:22:10,165
Anybody messes with you,

1159
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:12,568
you let me know.

1160
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,470
I'll fuck 'em up!

1161
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:17,004
Right.

1162
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:20,808
Hey...

1163
01:22:23,879 --> 01:22:25,746
Take it.

1164
01:22:26,982 --> 01:22:28,783
You're gonna need it.

1165
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:31,252
- No.
- To get girls.

1166
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:34,121
Huh? See?
There you go.

1167
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:36,090
<i>Okay.</i>

1168
01:22:40,661 --> 01:22:46,633
<i>That's it. You got it.</i>

1169
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:53,840
<i>- Thank you.
- It ain't anything. Go on.</i>

1170
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:59,713
I'm gonna take this one
to the opera.

1171
01:22:59,715 --> 01:23:03,749
To the opera, yeah.

1172
01:23:07,854 --> 01:23:10,055
Fuck.

1173
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:13,058
Aw, shit.
I don't have a lighter.

1174
01:23:15,663 --> 01:23:17,296
<i>...the numbers from yesterday.</i>

1175
01:23:17,298 --> 01:23:20,032
<i>We had a high of 92,
officially.</i>

1176
01:23:20,034 --> 01:23:24,202
<i>That's two degrees above the
average of 90 for the day.</i>

1177
01:23:24,204 --> 01:23:26,771
<i>68 was our low.</i>

1178
01:23:36,181 --> 01:23:38,316
<i>...temperatures
are concerned.</i>

1179
01:23:40,052 --> 01:23:42,687
You got a light?

1180
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:45,055
- Yeah.
- Hop in.

1181
01:24:03,107 --> 01:24:06,677
Your boy's a good worker.

1182
01:24:06,679 --> 01:24:09,312
That's the hardest fucking work
I ever done in my life.

1183
01:24:09,314 --> 01:24:12,014
Is it?

1184
01:24:12,016 --> 01:24:15,952
- Yeah. You paying my boy?
- What?

1185
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:18,588
- Are you paying my boy?
- Hell, yeah.

1186
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:20,723
I ain't seen he got paid none.

1187
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:22,992
<i>Probably saves it
'cause he's smart.</i>

1188
01:24:22,994 --> 01:24:25,027
Buying this GMC off of me.

1189
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:27,930
Doing what?

1190
01:24:27,932 --> 01:24:30,332
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

1191
01:24:30,334 --> 01:24:34,169
He ain't so smart.
He don't know nothing.

1192
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:38,073
<i>Hell, neither do you.</i>

1193
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:44,045
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

1194
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:51,319
That boy works his ass off!

1195
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:55,723
<i>He's earning money
and it's his!</i>

1196
01:24:55,725 --> 01:24:59,259
If this truck's a piece of shit,
you need to get out of it.

1197
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,996
And if I find out something's
happened to that boy,

1198
01:25:01,998 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass
had something to do with it.

1199
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:08,702
Now get the hell
away from me

1200
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:11,205
before I knock what's left
of your fucking teeth out.

1201
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,864
I had the funniest thought today.

1202
01:25:43,803 --> 01:25:46,204
I thought

1203
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:49,808
maybe you and I could
go out to dinner.

1204
01:25:52,078 --> 01:25:54,746
You know?

1205
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:57,182
Get all dressed up.

1206
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:02,420
Maybe you could...

1207
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:05,222
hold the door open for me.

1208
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,468
I think that would be nice.

1209
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:27,711
You pretend to be asleep, but...

1210
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:31,214
I know you'd cry if
I said the wrong thing.

1211
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:59,441
<i>You know this place is
condemned, right?</i>

1212
01:26:59,443 --> 01:27:01,510
<i>You can't just take
the boards off windows</i>

1213
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:04,079
<i>and call a place home.</i>

1214
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:11,385
Gary, why do you
stick around like this?

1215
01:27:11,387 --> 01:27:15,356
You're old enough, smart enough
to do your own thing.

1216
01:27:15,358 --> 01:27:17,091
What's most important right now

1217
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:20,361
is me taking care of
Dorothy and Mama,

1218
01:27:20,363 --> 01:27:25,767
'cause... we kind of got a
family problem right now.

1219
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,539
<i>Hey there.</i>

1220
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:35,075
Hey now.

1221
01:27:35,077 --> 01:27:37,410
Don't talk much, does she?

1222
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:41,181
- She don't talk at all.
- What do you mean?

1223
01:27:41,183 --> 01:27:44,885
I don't know. Nobody knows.
She just stopped one day.

1224
01:27:44,887 --> 01:27:48,288
I mean, she used to would, but...

1225
01:27:55,095 --> 01:27:58,030
<i>Well, hey, I'm ready to make
this deal if you are.</i>

1226
01:27:58,032 --> 01:28:01,167
- Yeah.
- I got my money.

1227
01:28:01,169 --> 01:28:05,237
Hey, "G-Daawg. "

1228
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,441
Don't you think
I forgot about it, bud.

1229
01:28:10,977 --> 01:28:14,846
I've been looking for you
and that kid.

1230
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,148
That boy of yours,

1231
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,818
he sure thinks he
knows something.

1232
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,519
I know you, mister.

1233
01:28:21,521 --> 01:28:24,355
You my friend?

1234
01:28:24,357 --> 01:28:26,991
I ain't your friend.

1235
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:30,094
Well, you like to make
all them funny faces.

1236
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,529
I said, are you my friend?

1237
01:28:31,531 --> 01:28:35,098
Listen, buddy.

1238
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,533
I think I know a way

1239
01:28:36,535 --> 01:28:39,536
that you and me can be friends.

1240
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,979
There it is.

1241
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:53,617
It looks just like your old one.

1242
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,552
It's periwinkle blue.
I like it.

1243
01:28:55,554 --> 01:28:59,155
I hope so.

1244
01:28:59,157 --> 01:29:02,024
Well, you got plenty
of gas to get home.

1245
01:29:02,026 --> 01:29:03,526
You might want to
stop at Coleman's

1246
01:29:03,528 --> 01:29:06,162
and put a little more in it
if you plan to ride around.

1247
01:29:06,164 --> 01:29:09,265
- Here.
- What's that?

1248
01:29:09,267 --> 01:29:10,466
It's the money for the truck.

1249
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:13,269
You just stick it back
in your pocket.

1250
01:29:13,271 --> 01:29:16,272
You're gonna need it
for insurance.

1251
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:18,975
- What's insurance?
- Well, yeah, it's the law.

1252
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:20,242
You can't drive
without insurance.

1253
01:29:20,244 --> 01:29:21,910
You're covered now,
but when I sign it over,

1254
01:29:21,912 --> 01:29:25,647
I'll tell you what. You come
out to the house before long,

1255
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:28,316
we'll get you fixed up.
I'm gonna go on.

1256
01:29:28,318 --> 01:29:29,584
- You gonna be all right?
- Yes, sir.

1257
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:31,052
<i>All right.</i>

1258
01:29:31,054 --> 01:29:34,422
Uh, you want me to follow you?

1259
01:29:34,424 --> 01:29:35,957
Nah, I'll be all right.

1260
01:29:38,394 --> 01:29:40,629
Hey, Joe.

1261
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:41,930
Thanks.

1262
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:09,280
- Nice truck.
- Thanks.

1263
01:31:09,282 --> 01:31:11,248
<i>You ain't got any tags on it.
You just get it?</i>

1264
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,415
Yeah.

1265
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:13,583
You want to breathe
into this for me?

1266
01:31:13,585 --> 01:31:15,118
No, I don't want to
breathe into that.

1267
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,586
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

1268
01:31:16,588 --> 01:31:19,189
<i>Hey!</i>

1269
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:20,991
Hey!

1270
01:31:50,653 --> 01:31:52,654
Pull over!

1271
01:31:54,024 --> 01:31:55,424
Pull over!

1272
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,268
God damn it!

1273
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,669
I ain't done a goddamn thing!

1274
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:10,538
<i>- Stay in your vehicle!
- I ain't drunk!</i>

1275
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,340
You better look for someone
else to mess with,

1276
01:32:12,342 --> 01:32:14,308
<i>- 'cause I did nothing!
- Put your hands behind your back!</i>

1277
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,711
keep messing around with me,
I'm going to hurt you!

1278
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:18,745
Put your hands
behind your back!

1279
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:19,746
Come here!

1280
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:23,817
I guess if I drive off now,
you're gonna get your shotgun

1281
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:25,218
out of the back
and shoot me, huh?

1282
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,353
- No.
- You gonna shoot me?

1283
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:28,555
- No!
- You can do it.

1284
01:33:07,226 --> 01:33:09,427
That was quick.

1285
01:33:09,429 --> 01:33:11,596
Still got that badass dog?

1286
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:13,798
Yeah.
'Round here somewhere.

1287
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,235
Hold on a minute.

1288
01:33:17,237 --> 01:33:18,603
Don't worry, okay?
Don't worry,

1289
01:33:18,605 --> 01:33:22,707
don't worry,
don't worry.

1290
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:24,776
All right.

1291
01:33:26,478 --> 01:33:30,147
Hear you got a new grandbaby.

1292
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:31,381
I do?

1293
01:33:31,383 --> 01:33:35,519
- Yeah, you didn't know?
- Not till now.

1294
01:33:35,521 --> 01:33:36,887
Huh. Yeah, a little boy.

1295
01:33:36,889 --> 01:33:39,790
Morrissey saw him in church.

1296
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:43,727
<i>Said he looked just like you'd
expect him to look.</i>

1297
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:49,232
<i>She said he's
got your eyes.</i>

1298
01:33:51,735 --> 01:33:53,269
You okay?

1299
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:56,205
Your son's all grown now,
ain't he?

1300
01:33:56,207 --> 01:33:57,673
Yeah. All grown up.

1301
01:33:57,675 --> 01:33:59,809
What's he going into,
law enforcement?

1302
01:33:59,811 --> 01:34:02,778
That's what I heard.

1303
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:06,516
You got a new man working
for you now, don't you?

1304
01:34:06,518 --> 01:34:09,752
Yes, I do.
Believe you've met him.

1305
01:34:09,754 --> 01:34:12,220
Gung-ho fella.
A little overeager.

1306
01:34:12,222 --> 01:34:16,258
<i>- He was looking for someone
to fuck with. - Yeah, maybe so.</i>

1307
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,426
<i>I'll have his ass shuffling
papers for a while</i>

1308
01:34:18,428 --> 01:34:21,363
till he learns to cool
down a little bit.

1309
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:24,799
But that ain't what
I'm worried about.

1310
01:34:24,801 --> 01:34:27,836
Can you pass the hot sauce?

1311
01:34:30,339 --> 01:34:31,606
Let me ask you
a question, Joe,

1312
01:34:31,608 --> 01:34:34,608
'cause I really want to know.

1313
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:36,710
Why do you want
to go back?

1314
01:34:36,712 --> 01:34:40,281
Why do you want to go back to
the damn penitentiary, man?

1315
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,521
<i>'Cause you can't keep
going to folks' houses,</i>

1316
01:34:47,523 --> 01:34:50,858
<i>killing their dogs, no matter
what else is going on.</i>

1317
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,894
And you can't keep
fistfighting the law.

1318
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:55,562
Judge won't put up with it.

1319
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:57,297
He don't have to put up with it.

1320
01:34:57,299 --> 01:34:59,766
That's why they built prisons.

1321
01:35:05,272 --> 01:35:08,241
Now you done got me back to
smoking, damn it.

1322
01:35:08,243 --> 01:35:09,776
<i>I been quit for three weeks.</i>

1323
01:35:13,215 --> 01:35:15,481
I haven't mistreated you, Joe.

1324
01:35:15,483 --> 01:35:18,483
Have I?
Tell the truth.

1325
01:35:18,485 --> 01:35:22,888
No, Earl. You stuck up for me
when you could.

1326
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:25,958
And I used to be
as bad as you.

1327
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,595
At one time,
you were worse.

1328
01:35:31,365 --> 01:35:34,766
Yeah, but I'm cool now.

1329
01:35:45,745 --> 01:35:48,546
Connie, where'd you go, baby?

1330
01:35:50,515 --> 01:35:53,417
Answer the phone next time.

1331
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,957
Hi.

1332
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:28,817
<i>Yo presiento
que Joe est aqui.</i>

1333
01:36:28,819 --> 01:36:32,821
<i>Joe, is that you?
Ests aqui?</i>

1334
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:56,077
Yeah, it's me.

1335
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,498
Oh, shit.

1336
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,367
What happened?

1337
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:22,803
I need to borrow the truck.

1338
01:37:22,805 --> 01:37:25,072
What happened to you?

1339
01:37:25,074 --> 01:37:26,640
I'm gonna kill him.

1340
01:37:26,642 --> 01:37:29,376
I'm gonna kill that
old son of a bitch.

1341
01:37:29,378 --> 01:37:31,811
You think I won't, but I will.

1342
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:36,449
And I'ma get mine back.

1343
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:39,652
I just need to borrow
that truck.

1344
01:37:39,654 --> 01:37:41,087
Come inside.

1345
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:52,398
Don't touch me.

1346
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,099
I should have given you
a boxing lesson.

1347
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:55,867
I don't need no goddamn
boxing lesson.

1348
01:37:55,869 --> 01:37:59,070
I know what to do. I'll pop him
right in the eye.

1349
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:03,742
He whupped my ass and
threw me out of the truck

1350
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:05,643
'cause he knew that
I were gonna kill him!

1351
01:38:09,648 --> 01:38:12,550
I can kill his ass.

1352
01:38:12,552 --> 01:38:14,786
I can kill him just as
good as you could.

1353
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:17,855
I know you could,
I know you could.

1354
01:38:17,857 --> 01:38:19,156
I know it.

1355
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:22,059
But you don't have to do that.

1356
01:38:22,061 --> 01:38:23,927
Okay, son?

1357
01:38:23,929 --> 01:38:26,964
Just stay here with me.

1358
01:38:26,966 --> 01:38:30,534
You'll be safe here.

1359
01:38:30,536 --> 01:38:32,436
Bring your mama
and your sister.

1360
01:38:32,438 --> 01:38:35,672
He gots Dorothy.

1361
01:38:35,674 --> 01:38:37,841
He done run off with her.

1362
01:38:37,843 --> 01:38:39,108
He met up with some bad men.

1363
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,644
I heard him talking about it.

1364
01:38:41,646 --> 01:38:44,514
That man with
the scarred-up face...

1365
01:38:44,516 --> 01:38:47,450
the one that I beat
down by the bridge?

1366
01:38:49,486 --> 01:38:52,655
He been looking for me
for what I done did to him.

1367
01:38:52,657 --> 01:38:56,426
She don't hurt nobody, Joe.

1368
01:38:56,428 --> 01:38:59,429
Should have been me.

1369
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:06,635
Do you know where
they took her?

1370
01:39:08,504 --> 01:39:11,473
Gary...

1371
01:39:11,475 --> 01:39:13,475
tell me.

1372
01:39:16,946 --> 01:39:20,215
- Mm-mm.
- Tell me.

1373
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:23,185
I just need the truck...

1374
01:39:23,187 --> 01:39:25,719
<i>to get me someplace.</i>

1375
01:39:34,496 --> 01:39:37,465
<i>I'm gonna make trouble.</i>

1376
01:39:43,839 --> 01:39:46,706
Meet me outside.

1377
01:40:52,037 --> 01:40:55,238
$30.

1378
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,974
$30 each.

1379
01:41:21,566 --> 01:41:24,667
Hi. Hi.

1380
01:41:24,669 --> 01:41:25,901
How you doing?

1381
01:41:28,306 --> 01:41:30,573
You okay?

1382
01:41:30,575 --> 01:41:32,808
Huh?

1383
01:41:34,344 --> 01:41:36,645
Tell me something.

1384
01:41:36,647 --> 01:41:38,913
You like funny faces?

1385
01:42:14,717 --> 01:42:16,249
<i>If anything
happens to me,</i>

1386
01:42:16,251 --> 01:42:18,785
you get your ass out of
the way, you hear?

1387
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:20,887
You take my truck
and get out.

1388
01:42:20,889 --> 01:42:23,322
<i>- Yeah.
- And go get Coleman.</i>

1389
01:42:23,324 --> 01:42:25,391
Yes, sir.

1390
01:42:25,393 --> 01:42:28,894
Tell him to call Earl.

1391
01:42:49,216 --> 01:42:50,382
Shit!

1392
01:42:50,384 --> 01:42:51,850
Oh, no!

1393
01:42:51,852 --> 01:42:54,352
No, no, no, no...

1394
01:43:00,893 --> 01:43:02,827
<i>- Don't move.
- God damn it!</i>

1395
01:43:02,829 --> 01:43:04,362
I'll kill you both if you move.

1396
01:43:04,364 --> 01:43:05,964
Joe, listen to me.
This...

1397
01:43:05,966 --> 01:43:07,264
it ain't what it looks like, man.

1398
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:08,799
I'm telling you.

1399
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:12,002
- Dorothy! Dorothy!
- Get her out, Gary.

1400
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:15,806
Take your sister
and go. Go! Go!

1401
01:43:15,808 --> 01:43:20,244
You. I don't know you.
Run, before I shoot you.

1402
01:43:20,246 --> 01:43:23,113
No, no, no, no!

1403
01:43:23,115 --> 01:43:25,416
Joe, listen to me.
Just listen to me, okay?

1404
01:43:27,185 --> 01:43:31,387
Gary! Gary!

1405
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,223
<i>- Gary!
- I'll get help, Joe!</i>

1406
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:38,761
Please.

1407
01:43:42,132 --> 01:43:46,369
God damn it.
That girl, she...

1408
01:43:46,371 --> 01:43:48,438
<i>she don't know shit
about shit, man.</i>

1409
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,840
She's just a piece of trash,
just like her daddy,

1410
01:43:50,842 --> 01:43:52,774
and she's gonna be
doing this shit in no time,

1411
01:43:52,776 --> 01:43:54,810
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, man.

1412
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:57,312
Look at the moon.

1413
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:21,902
God damn it!

1414
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:26,006
<i>Oh, shit!
Ah, fuck this shit!</i>

1415
01:44:28,177 --> 01:44:30,845
If you want to shoot me,
go ahead and shoot me.

1416
01:44:30,847 --> 01:44:32,947
I went through a windshield
and I don't give...

1417
01:45:51,355 --> 01:45:54,090
Are you my friend?

1418
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:51,069
What have you done, Joe?

1419
01:50:15,207 --> 01:50:17,208
<i>Here's what we do.</i>

1420
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:19,444
<i>We start a little late,
around 8:00 in the morning,</i>

1421
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,612
<i>and we go till 4:00.</i>

1422
01:50:21,614 --> 01:50:23,448
I pay by the week on Fridays.

1423
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:27,185
Some days we go long and we
run past 40 hours a week.

1424
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:29,187
I pay time and a half.

1425
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:31,289
It's hard work.

1426
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:33,391
I don't like a whole lot of
standing around.

1427
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:35,292
We'll probably bust our ass

1428
01:50:35,294 --> 01:50:37,561
and get this spread out
by the end of April,

1429
01:50:37,563 --> 01:50:40,097
get out all the bare
root seedlings,

1430
01:50:40,099 --> 01:50:41,431
and sometimes we stake 'em

1431
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:43,400
if we gotta keep the
little ones stable.

1432
01:50:43,402 --> 01:50:45,268
Most of the time,
we don't need to mess

1433
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:48,205
with them little piney
seedlings like that.

1434
01:50:48,207 --> 01:50:50,574
I'm gonna have you join
Donnell and his crew

1435
01:50:50,576 --> 01:50:53,110
on the west end of the farm.

1436
01:50:53,112 --> 01:50:55,245
Then, if everything goes
good on that acreage,

1437
01:50:55,247 --> 01:50:57,146
I'll have you help me supervise

1438
01:50:57,148 --> 01:50:59,615
the Monea project
next summer.

1439
01:50:59,617 --> 01:51:03,419
Bastards can be hard
to work for sometimes.

1440
01:51:03,421 --> 01:51:05,654
But, hell, if you
worked for Joe,

1441
01:51:05,656 --> 01:51:09,291
I think you'll do just fine.

1442
01:51:09,293 --> 01:51:10,826
You got any questions?

1443
01:51:10,828 --> 01:51:12,595
No, sir.
When can I start?

1444
01:51:12,597 --> 01:51:14,296
Right now
if you're ready.

1445
01:51:14,298 --> 01:51:17,833
Yes, sir.

1446
01:51:17,835 --> 01:51:21,136
- So you knew Joe?
- Yeah, I sure did.

1447
01:51:21,138 --> 01:51:22,904
Joe was a good man.

1448
01:51:22,906 --> 01:51:25,740
Good man to me, anyways.

1449
01:51:25,742 --> 01:51:28,610
He was a good man
to me, too.

1450
01:52:14,588 --> 01:52:19,425
<i># Some folks, they live

1451
01:52:19,427 --> 01:52:21,661
