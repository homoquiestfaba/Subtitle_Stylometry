1
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:34,727
TIME.

2
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,083
8.8.

3
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:40,643
IT'S NOT DARK YET.

4
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,334
LET'S RUN A COUPLE MORE.

5
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,101
HOW'S THAT
KNEE HOLDING UP?

6
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,852
UH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

7
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,435
IT'S A YOUNG MAN'S GAME.

8
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,810
GEORGE, I'M LOOKING
FOR A SPONSOR...

9
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,894
SOMEONE WHO WILL PAY
MY DUES AND ENTRY FEES

10
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:04,477
AND SOME OF MY EXPENSES.

11
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,393

00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,560
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

15
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,975

THAT ROPE OUT THERE, MAC

16
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,226

23
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:33,975
DEAL?

24
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:35,101
DEAL.

25
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,751
THANKS, GEORGE.
THAT A BOY.

26
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,435
MOM, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

27
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:43,876
LET'S SEE.

28
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,018
"THIS FILM
CONTAINS SCENES

29
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:49,852
OF VIOLENCE, NUDITY
AND STRONG LANGUAGE."

30
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,751
NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 18,
ESPECIALLY CHRIS McCLAIN.

31
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:57,435
GOOD-BYE, BRAD PITT.

32
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,852
MOM,SPECIES.

33
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,685
ISN'T THAT WHERE SHE
TURNS INTO THAT...?

34
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,685
YEAH.

35
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:02,768
AND KILLS THOSE...?

36
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,975
YEAH.

37
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,059
MOM.

38
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,975
OH, HERE WE ARE,SOUND OF MUSIC.

39
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,059
DON'T YOU LIKE US ANYMORE?

40
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,810
YOU HAVE A STRANGE
SENSE OF HUMOR, MOM.

41
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,975
VERY STRANGE.

42
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,975
I WAS KIDDING.

43
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,918
I WAS KIDDING.

44
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,751
(dog barking)

45
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:51,975
SOMEONE FORGOT
TO LET LEO OUT.

46
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,894
I LET HIM OUT BEFORE WE LEFT.

47
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,518
YOU MUST HAVE DREAMED YOU DID.

48
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,602
CAN YOU GET HIM, KEL?

49
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,999
I GOT HIM
BEFORE WE LEFT.

50
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,101
YOU KNOW, I SWEAR
I CHANGED THAT LIGHT...

51
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,393
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.

52
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,810
I KNOW I CHANGED IT.

53
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,226
I'M SURE I DID.

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,268
Woman:
CHRIS, READ IT
IN THE HOUSE.

55
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,999
(gunshots)

56
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,542
DON'T MOVE.

57
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,975
MOM?!

58
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,852
HELP!

59
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:39,685
HELP!

60
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,975
Man 1:
YOU HEAR
FROM THE HOSPITAL?

61
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,768
Man 2:
MOTHER DIED IN FRONT
OF THE HOUSE.

62
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,185
FIANCE'S STILL ALIVE.

63
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,768
THEY TOOK TWO BULLETS OUT.

64
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,894
WITNESSES?

65
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,975
JUST THE GIRL.

66
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,226
IS THERE A MOTIVE HERE?

67
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,975
CASH, CREDIT
CARDS, JEWELRY--

68
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,018
SHOOTER LEFT IT ALL.

69
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,975
THE GIRLS KNOW
ABOUT THEIR MOTHER?

70
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:56,975
THEY KNOW.

71
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,125
C.P.S. IS ON THE WAY.

72
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,852
THE SHOOTER
SPOKE TO HER.

73
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,042
SHE TOLD ME
AFTER IT HAPPENED.

74
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,975
WE WERE WAITING
FOR THE POLICE.

75
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,334
WHAT DID HE SAY?

76
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,685
HE SAID, "DON'T MOVE."

77
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,101
CHRIS.

78
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,435
WE WANT TO CATCH
WHOEVER DID THIS.

79
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:30,059
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL US.

80
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,059
IF HE WAS WHITE OR BLACK.

81
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,477
HOW TALL HE WAS.

82
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,894
WHAT HE
WAS WEARING.

83
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:36,292
IT WOULD REALLY HELP.

84
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,894
THAT'S OKAY.

85
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,310
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW.

86
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,727
ALL RIGHT.

87
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,226
FOR NOW, YOU'RE
GOING TO STAY

88
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,975
WITH CHILD
PROTECTIVE SERVICES

89
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,976
BUT WE CONTACTED
YOUR FAMILY IN CHICAGO.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,518
UH, MILLER.

91
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,975
GAYLE MILLER?

92
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:56,975
AUNT GAYLE.

93
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,435
AND YOUR FATHER
IN BECKETT.

94
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,894
WE'RE TRACKING
HIM DOWN.

95
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,334
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE.

96
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,975
YEAH.

97
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:07,310
HE MOVES AROUND A LOT.

98
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,375
WHAT'S HE DO?

99
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,976
HE'S A COWBOY.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,125
(country rock music playing)

101
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,226
ANY TIME YOU WANT
TO HAVE ANOTHER GO

102
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,268
JUST CALL ME.

103
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,501
YEAH, OKAY.

104
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,584
NOW, I'D BE INTERESTED
IN MAYBE SOME OTHER PLAYERS.

105
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:43,375
(music continues)

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,999
THAT'S GOT TO BE HIM.

107
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,685
CHARLIE McCLAIN?

108
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,185
DETECTIVE ROSS.

109
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,975
THIS IS DETECTIVE CORTEZ.

110
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,602
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN.

111
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,101
GLAD YOU FOUND IT OKAY.

112
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,975
WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?

113
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,810
THEY'RE WITH
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES--

114
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,768
PROBABLY ON THEIR WAY
TO COURT BY NOW.

115
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,477
YOU CAN'T JUST
HAVE THEM, CHARLIE.

116
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,976
THEY'RE
IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,918
YOU HAVE TO GO
BEFORE THE JUDGE.

118
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,018
Charlie:
WHO DID THIS?

119
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,310
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND OUT.

120
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,810
HOW'D YOU GET ALONG
WITH THE EX-WIFE?

121
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,393
WE DIDN'T TALK
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

122
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,143
DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS

123
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,975
GETTING
MARRIED AGAIN?

124
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,059
YEAH, I HEARD.

125
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,560
YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE
YOUR KIDS MUCH, DID YOU?

126
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,351
I MEAN, EVEN BEFORE SHE
GOT HOOKED UP WITH KALLEN.
NO.

127
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,768
ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE

128
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,768
AFTER SHE
MARRIED HIM.

129
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,768
I WAS 400 MILES FROM HERE
WHEN THIS HAPPENED...

130
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,643
SHOOTING POOL IN A BAR
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

131
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,792
NOW, I KNOW YOU BOYS ARE
JUST DOING YOUR JOB...

132
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,667
BUT DO IT ON SOMEONE ELSE,
WILL YOU?

133
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,101
OKAY, I KNOW
HE'S PRINTING
THE FRONT DOOR.

134
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,560
ALL RIGHT.

135
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,143
I GOT EVERYTHING
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

136
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,560
I'LL HEAD OUT.

137
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:43,876
OKAY.

138
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,417
YOU'RE CHARLIE?

139
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,059
I'M ANNA--

140
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,143
MR. KALLEN'S HOUSEKEEPER.

141
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,059
I'M VERY SORRY.

142
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,685
JESSE WAS SO KIND--

143
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,209
SUCH A GOOD MOTHER.

144
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,226
YOU RECOGNIZE THAT NECKLACE?

145
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,975
I GAVE IT TO HER.

146
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,083
TAKE IT.

147
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,310
NO, I DON'T THINK I SHOULD.

148
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,975
OH, SHE WOULD'VE WANTED YOU

149
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,226
TO HAVE IT.

150
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,999
PLEASE.

151
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,626
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

152
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,310
CHARLIE McCLAIN.

153
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,935
I'M THEIR FATHER.

154
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,351
LISA EVERSON.

155
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,975
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

156
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,626
I'LL SEE IF
WE'RE ON SCHEDULE.

157
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,351
HEY.

158
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,667
HI.

159
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,876
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN.

160
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,167
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

161
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,125
AUNT GAYLE'S COMING, TOO.

162
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,999
ALL RIGHT, MS. EVERSON.

163
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,143
THERE'S BEEN NO
ARREST, YOUR HONOR

164
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,810
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
TO GET THE GIRLS
OUT OF TOWN

165
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,268
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.

166
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,975
THANK YOU.

167
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,143
ALL RIGHT.

168
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,226
GIRLS...

169
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,602
LISTEN UP,
PLEASE.

170
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,018
THIS COURT LOOKS
AFTER YOUR SAFETY

171
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,935
AND WELFARE.

172
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,975
IF WE CAN

173
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,852
WE TRY TO KEEP THE
FAMILY TOGETHER

174
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,393
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT'S
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

175
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,727
SO, MR. McCLAIN

176
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:57,185
I AM GOING TO GIVE
YOU YOUR GIRLS

177
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,975
BUT IN LIGHT OF
MRS. MILLER'S PETITION

178
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,310
I'M GRANTING YOU
TEMPORARY CUSTODY.

179
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:03,975
NOW, YOU'LL BE ASSIGNED

180
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,101
A COUNSELOR FROM THE DEPARTMENT
OF FAMILY SERVICES IN BECKETT.

181
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,975
AND IN THREE MONTHS'
TIME, YOU'LL APPEAR

182
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,810
BEFORE THE BECKETT
COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT.

183
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:14,059
NOW, IF THE COUNSELOR'S
REPORTS ARE POSITIVE

184
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,894
AND, OF COURSE, IF THE GIRLS

185
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,268
WANTTO STAY WITH
YOU, THEY WILL.

186
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,477
IF NOT...

187
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,477
THE COURT WILL MAKE
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

188
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,292
NOW, IS THAT CLEAR, SIR?

189
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,727
UH, YES, MA'AM.

190
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,709
ALL RIGHT. NEXT CASE, PLEASE.

191
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,959
OKAY.

192
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,935
THIS IS YOUR TRUCK?

193
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
YEP.

194
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,042
SHE'S GOT 400,000 MILES ON HER.

195
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,709
OKAY.

196
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,125
COME ON.

197
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,999
(horn honks)

198
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,810
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
CHARLIE?

199
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,518
YOU NEVER WANTED
TO BE A FATHER

200
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,935
TO THOSE KIDS.

201
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,727
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO GO ABOUT IT.

202
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,042
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
TO THE GIRLS.

203
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,292
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
HAVE THEM.

204
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,918
(limousine engine starting)

205
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,501
SECOND-HAND SMOKE KILLS,
YOU KNOW.

206
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,501
(coughing)

207
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,999
YEAH, WELL, I'M
TRYING TO QUIT.

208
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:33,975
HEY, GIRLS,
THIS IS IT.

209
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,999
COME ON OUT.

210
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,935
HEY, CARL.

211
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,143
GOOD-LOOKING GIRLS, MAC.

212
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,685

213
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,018
Carl:
RECKON IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME GETTING USED TO.

214
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:49,727
RECKON SO.

215
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,351
STILL THINK YOU SHOULD
STAY AT MY PLACE

216
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,643
TILL WE KNOW
IT'S SAFE HERE.
YEAH, WELL...

217
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,975
WE BEEN ALL OVER THE RANCH;
I'LL LEAVE ONE OF MY BOYS

218
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,226
HERE FOR A WHILE.

219
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,226
CARL, NOW, I DON'T...
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE.

220
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,501
(cows mooing)

221
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,268
COME ON...

222
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,975
GIRLS, THIS IS
SHERIFF DEWITT.

223
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,852
THIS IS KELLY,

224
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:17,101
NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.

226
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,768
OKAY, THANKS A LOT.

227
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,975
(whistling)

228
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,727
(dogs barking)

229
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,727
COME ON!
COME ON!

230
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,268
THAT'S IT!

231
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,477
THIS IS DENVER

232
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,975
AND THAT'S DALLAS.

233
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:31,975
COME ON IN.

234
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,852
LET'S GET YOU

235
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:35,876
(car engine starts)

236
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
(cows mooing)

237
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,975
THIS IS IT?

238
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,975
YEP.

239
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,101
IT'S SO SMALL.

240
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,143
YEAH, WELL...

241
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,310
YOU GET USED TO IT.

242
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,935
THERE'S NO TV?

243
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,018
NOPE.

244
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,167
(scoffs):
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

245
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,975
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

246
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,393
YOU TAKE THE BED.

247
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,999
I'LL TAKE THE COUCH.

248
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,727
STAY OFF THE BED.

249
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,518
NO,YOUTAKE THE BED.

250
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:24,000
WE'LL SLEEP IN CHICAGO.

251
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,999
(sighs)

252
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,852
MR. McCLAIN?

253
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,226
I'M SUSAN SHAW.

254
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,167
I'M A COUNSELOR WITH THE
DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY SERVICES.

255
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,975
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS?

256
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,226
(sighs)

257
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,975
INSIDE.

258
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,975
HOW ARE THEY?

259
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,894
ALL RIGHT, CONSIDERING.

260
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:12,393
THE YOUNGEST, CHRIS,
IS STILL PRETTY SHOOK UP.

261
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,584
SHE SAW IT HAPPEN.

262
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,059
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD.

263
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,101
I'M SORRY.

264
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,999
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW
HARD THIS IS FOR YOU.

265
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,999
THAT'S MY CARD.

266
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:32,975
COUNSELING IS
A CONDITION OF
YOUR CUSTODY

267
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,727
SO YOU NEED TO COME INTO MY
OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

268
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,602
I'VE SCHEDULED 10:00

OTHER THAN THAT,

272
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,975
NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE

273
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,999
YOU HAVE TO START BEING
THEIR FATHER AGAIN.

274
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:02,226
YEAH, WELL...

275
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,375
HOW THE HELL DO I DO THAT?

276
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,751
(birds chirping)

277
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:20,975
(Chris whimpering)

278
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,351

279
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,059
Kelly:
IT'S OKAY,

280
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,059

00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,083
(Chris sobbing)

282
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,975
KELLY?

283
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,185
Kelly:

284
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,185
(Chris sobbing)

285
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:39,268
Kelly:
IT'S OKAY.

286
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,417
DON'T CRY.

287
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,768
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

288
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:45,727
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE SAFE.

289
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,185
IS SHE OKAY?

290
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,810
SHE'LL BE FINE.

291
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,250
COME ON.

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,250
YOU WANT ME TO GET
A GLASS OF WATER OR SOMETHING?

293
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:58,918
NO.

294
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,935
IT'S OKAY.

295
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,042
COME ON.

296
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,999
COME ON.

297
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,768
Charlie:FROM NOW ON

298
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,894
I GOT TO GET THE FIRST SHOWER
IN THE MORNING.

299
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:18,975
Kelly:
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

300
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:21,792
Charlie:
IT ONLY TAKES ME
FIVE MINUTES.

301
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,975
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

302
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,018
I GOT TO GET TO WORK
IN THE MORNING.

303
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,268
IT ONLY TAKES ME FIVE...

304
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,083
WHAT IS THIS?

305
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,975
LAUNDRY.

306
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,560
DIRTY LAUNDRY DOES NOT GO

307
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,417
ON MY ALLMAN BROTHERS
RECORDS.

308
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:42,894
IT HAS TO BE WASHED.

309
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,834
AND WHO IS SUPPOSED TO WASH IT?

310
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,894
DON'T KNOW HOW.

311
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:52,560
YOU PUT IT IN THE SINK

312
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,975
YOU PUT IT IN SOME WATER
AND SOAP, WASH IT

313
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,834
AND HANG IT UP TO DRY, OKAY?

314
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,999
(frustrated sigh)

315
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,751
OKAY, THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

316
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,792
MOM BRAIDS IT.

317
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:27,626
OKAY...

318
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,209
WE'LL BRAID IT.

319
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:36,768
THAT'S A PONYTAIL

320
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,125
NOT A BRAID.

321
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,918
(dog barking)

322
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:14,852
Woman:
WHERE'S MY COWBOY?

323
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,042

328
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,727

00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:29,894
WHERE'S YOUR GIRLS?

KELLY!

332
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,268

333
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,685

334
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,709
THERE'S SOMEONE

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,226
HELLO.

336
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,059
I'M DOTTY CLAYTON...

337
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,477
AND THIS IS MY RANCH.

338
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:49,976
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS KELLY?

339
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,477
I AM.

340
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:56,975
I KNOW YOUR FATHER
DON'T HAVE NO SODA OR JUNK FOOD

341
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,185
IN THE HOUSE

342
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,935
BUT I'VE GOT A FRIDGE
FULL OF ROOT BEER

343
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,727
AND BOXES
OF CANDY BARS

344
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,518
AND YOU JUST COME AROUND
WHENEVER YOU LIKE

345
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,975
AND HELP YOURSELVES.

346
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:10,226
OH, DOTTY'S GOING TO TAKE
REAL GOOD CARE OF YOU.

347
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,768
ALL RIGHT?

348
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:14,602
TAKE IT EASY, GIRLS.

349
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,709
THINGS AIN'T NEVER AS BAD
AS THEY SEEM RIGHT OFF.

350
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,059
COME ON, GET UP THERE.

351
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,459
GET UP.

352
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:59,560
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MOM LIVED LIKE THIS.

353
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,834
I CAN'T BELIEVEWE'RELIVING LIKE THIS.

354
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,852
HEY, COW. HEY, COW.

355
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,417
HEY, HEY.

356
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,310
IT'S GOING TO
BE A LONG DAY.

357
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,643
I'VE HAD WORSE.

358
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,185
WELL, THAT WAS
JUST THE FIRST TRUCK.

359
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,976
OH, NO. MORE TRUCKS?

360
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,143
OH, YOU'RE TALKING NOW.

361
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,435
WHEN THE LAST
COW IS DONE

362
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,975
AND IT'S, OH, SOMEWHERE
WAY AFTER DARK

363
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,518
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO FALL DOWN ON A BED

364
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,976
AND SLEEP
FOR THREE DAYS.

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,685
SINCE YOU BROUGHT THAT UP...

366
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,602
THAT PART ABOUT
FALLING DOWN IN A BED.

367
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,059
OH, HERE IT COMES--
ANYTIME A COWBOY
STARTS A SENTENCE

368
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,935
WITH, "SINCE YOU
BROUGHT THAT UP"

369
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,393
YOU KNOW YOU'RE

370
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,852
IN FOR A WORLD
OF TROUBLE.

371
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:55,975
I NEED TO BUILD
A NEW BEDROOM FOR THE GIRLS.

372
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,268
THE BUNKHOUSE HAS A BEDROOM.

373
00:23:58,292 --> 00:23:59,975
YEP, THAT'S RIGHT,
AND I WANT IT BACK.

374
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,975
THE GIRLS NEED
TO HAVE THEIR OWN ROOM.

375
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:02,975
WE'RE OPPOSITE SEXES.

376
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,935
WE CAN'T BE BARGING IN
ON EACH OTHER.

377
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:05,975
OH, AND WHO'S SUPPOSED

378
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:08,727
TO PAY FOR ALL THIS
NEW CONSTRUCTION?

379
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,894
WELL, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

380
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:13,976
AND, LOU, HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT MONEY IS.

381
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,976
HE'S RIGHT
ABOUT THAT, BOSS.

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,518
I GUESS THAT MEANS YOU.

383
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,975
ARE THEY INSIDE?

384
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,975
YEAH.

385
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,810
THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO COME OUT.

386
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:23,976
HOW'S MY LITTLE ONE?

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,975
UH, SHE'S STILL
PRETTY SHOOK UP.

388
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,768
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S BECAUSE, UH...

389
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:31,018
SHE'S SCARED THE GUY WHO SHOT
JESSE'S GOING TO COME AFTER HER

390
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,975
OR BECAUSE SHE SAW
THE WHOLE THING.

391
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,083
OR BOTH.

392
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,727
OH, HELL, MAN

393
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,975
GO ON, BUILD IT.

394
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,975
JUST GET IT RIGHT.

395
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:51,059
MAKE IT PRETTY, HUH?

396
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,518
PRETTY.

397
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,685
OKAY?

398
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:55,727
YEP.

399
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,518
HEY! COME ON, COW!

400
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,226
HEY, HEY!

401
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,018
Kelly:I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MY FEELINGS AGAIN.

402
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,975
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

403
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,310
WE HAVE
TO GO SHOPPING.

404
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:10,852
WE'VE ALREADY
BEEN THROUGH THIS.

405
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,310
NO, WE HAVEN'T.

406
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:14,935
YOU SAID THAT WE CAN'T LEAVE
THE RANCH AND THAT WAS IT.

407
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,976
CARL DOESN'T WANT
YOU GIRLS WALKING
AROUND TOWN.

408
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,477
IT'S NOT FAIR.

409
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,810
WELL, NOT
EVERYTHING IS.

410
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,975
WE NEED TO GO TO A DRUG STORE.

411
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,351
FOR WHAT?

412
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,975
TAMPAX

413
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,894
SOAP, SHAMPOO

414
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:27,976
TOOTHPASTE.

415
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,894
I DON'T WANT TO USE
YOUR CRUDDY STUFF

416
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:30,975
AND NEITHER DOES CHRIS.

417
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,393
AND BESIDES, WE HAVE
NOTHING TO WEAR.

418
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,975
OKAY.

419
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,894
I KNOW YOU AND YOUR SISTER
ARE TRYING

420
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:41,268
TO GET USED
TO THE WAY THINGS...

421
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,894
THE WAY THINGS ARE SUCK...

422
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,417
DAD.

423
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,976
"THE WAY THINGS ARE SUCK, DAD."

424
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,894
THEY'RE NOT COWBOYS.

425
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:03,143
THEY'RE GIRLS
FROM LOS ANGELES.

426
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,975
WELL, THEY'RE PART
OF MY LIFE NOW.

427
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,250
WELL, THEN, YOUR LIFE
HAS TO CHANGE PERHAPS.

428
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,310
DID CARL REACH YOU?

429
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,727
ABOUT WHAT?

430
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:30,518
ROSS AND CORTEZ.

431
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,935
THEY PICKED UP A GUY
FOR QUESTIONING

432
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,852
AND HELD HIM
FOR A FEW DAYS.

433
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,975
BUT IT WASN'T HIM.

434
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:42,810
ALSO, KALLEN'S
GOING TO LIVE.

435
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:43,935
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

436
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:47,226
HE SENDS HIS CONDOLENCES
AND WISHES THE GIRLS GOOD LUCK.

437
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,643
HE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THEIR THINGS?

438
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,935
HE SAID HE'D HAVE THEM PACKED UP

439
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,185
AND SHIPPED IN THE FALL.

440
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,351
HE'S SENDING THEM
TO ME OR TO GAYLE?

441
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,999
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT SENT?

442
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,602
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

443
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:24,999
WE HAVE TO BUY OUR
CLOTHES IN THERE?

444
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:29,999
I DO.

445
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,250
THERE SHE IS.

446
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:46,727
OKAY.

447
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:50,975
HELLO.

448
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:51,975
HELLO.

449
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:52,975
HELLO.

450
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,727
GAYLE MILLER CALLED
MY OFFICE.

451
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,226
SHE CALLED
JUDGE MORGAN, TOO.

452
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,393
SHE'S LOOKING FOR
A LOCAL ATTORNEY

453
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,975
WHO DOES CUSTODY CASES.

454
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,000
SHE'S DETERMINED
TO GET THE GIRLS.

455
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:10,310
IF I'M GOING TO HELP,
I NEED HISTORY ON THIS.

456
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:13,999
GAYLE, UH...

457
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,975
SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO BREAK US UP

458
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,685
RIGHT FROM THE START.

459
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:21,810
BUT, JESS, SHE DIDN'T CARE.

460
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,268
SHE WAS ALWAYS
BUCKING THE FAMILY.

461
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,226
SO YOU MARRIED ANYWAY?

462
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,226
WE WERE IN LOVE.

463
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,042
NOBODY WAS GOING TO BREAK US
APART, NOT EVEN GAYLE.

464
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:42,250
MAC, THAT...

465
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,876
LET ME SEE THAT.

466
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:57,935
YOU CAN'T WEAR THIS;
I CAN SEE THROUGH IT.

467
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:58,999
NO.

468
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,975
UM, JESSE AND GAYLE--

469
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,059
HOW'D THEY GROW UP?

470
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,810
WHAT WAS THEIR UPBRINGING?

471
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:12,727
THEY GREW UP IN PASADENA.

472
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,143
THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY.

473
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,975
THEIR FATHER WAS A BANKER.

474
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,226
AND I WAS, UH,
I WAS A REAL STEP DOWN

475
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,975
FOR THE FAMILY AS FAR
GAYLE WAS CONCERNED.

476
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,685
BUT SHE MARRIED WISELY?

477
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,268
OH, YEAH.

478
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,351
SOME BIG SURGEON IN CHICAGO.

479
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,185
HE RUNS A HOSPITAL THERE.

480
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,643
THEY HAVE TWO KIDS,
BIG HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS--

481
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,310
ANOTHER ONE IN FLORIDA.

482
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:34,727
NOW SHE WANTS THE GIRLS.

483
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,894
YEAH. I GUESS SHE DOESN'T THINK

484
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,083
I'LL MAKE
MUCH OF A FATHER EITHER.

485
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:47,101
WHERE'S CHRIS?

486
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,810
I DON'T KNOW.

487
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,792
CHRIS?

488
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,167
CHRIS?

489
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,459
CHRIS?

490
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,894
CHRIS?

491
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:11,185
(door opening)

492
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,810
WHERE THE HELL...?

493
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,292
IS THIS OKAY?

494
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:19,226
YEAH.

495
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,667
LOOKS REAL NICE, DARLING.

496
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,393
Charlie:NOW, THIS PRETTY GIRL
IS NAMED GEORGIA.

497
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,976
WE'VE ROPED A LOT
OF CALVES TOGETHER.

498
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,810
IN FACT, SHE'S THE MOTHER OF
THE COLT I'M RIDING RIGHT NOW.

499
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,018
SHE'S PREGNANT.

500
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,393
SHE'S HAVING A
ROUGH GO OF IT.

501
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,935
WE'VE GOT THE VET
WATCHING HER.

502
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,268
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED.

503
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,810
COME ON-- LET'S GET HER
CLEANED UP AND FED.

504
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,000
THEN I'M TEACHING YOU TWO
HOW TO RIDE.

505
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,768
DID MOM RIDE?

506
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,768
ALL THE TIME.

507
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,975
SHE NEVER RODE WITH US...

508
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,834
NEVER EVEN
TALKED ABOUT IT.

509
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:11,999
HOW'D YOU MEET?

510
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,852
YOUR MOTHER NEVER TOLD YOU?

511
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,876
WE NEVER ASKED.

512
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,810
HOW DID WE MEET?

513
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,393
WELL...

514
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,709
I'D JUST FINISHED
THIS RODEO UP IN TUCSON AND...

515
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,667
I DECIDED TO KICK BACK FOR A FEW
DAYS BEFORE HEADING UP NORTH.

516
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,975
YOUR MOTHER, SHE'D, UH,
SHE'D LEFT HOME.

517
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,975
SHE HAD TO WORK
AS A WAITRESS

518
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,125
IN THIS BURGER JOINT
I JUST HAPPENED TO WALK INTO.

519
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:51,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR MOTHER
AS A WAITRESS?

520
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,143
OH...

521
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,083
SHE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT
IN A DARK ROOM.

522
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:06,834
AND WE FELL
HEAD-OVER-HEELS IN LOVE.

523
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,226
AND IN THE BEGINNING,
SHE LOVED THIS LIFE--

524
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,768
THE RODEOS
AND THE TRAVELING AND...

525
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:17,518
AND THEN WE
GOT MARRIED

526
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,310
AND THEN
YOU WERE BORN.

527
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:21,727
IT GOT HARDER
FOR YOUR MOTHER

528
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:24,560
LIVING ON THE ROAD
TEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR

529
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,351
AND WHEN CHRIS CAME ALONG

530
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:30,643
IT SEEMED TOUGH
TO STAY TOGETHER.

531
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,792
SHE WANTED MORE FOR YOU GIRLS.

532
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,059
HELL, I WANTED
MORE FOR YOU, TOO.

533
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,435
WE JUST SEEMED

534
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:41,643
TO DRIFT FURTHER
AND FURTHER APART.

535
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,975
WE ENDED UP GOING
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

536
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,935
YOU LET US GO.

537
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:49,518
I JUST DID
THE BEST I THOUGHT I COULD.

538
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,667
IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

539
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,852
WE'RE WORKING AS
HARD AS WE CAN
TO FIND THE MAN

540
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,310
WHO KILLED
YOUR MOTHER...

541
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,143
BUT WE NEED
YOUR HELP NOW.

542
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,810
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO SAW IT HAPPEN.

543
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,810
TRY TO REMEMBER.

544
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,643
IT WAS DARK.

545
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,351
THE DOG WAS BARKING
IN THE BACKYARD.

546
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:36,975
(barking)

547
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:38,768
THE LIGHT BY THE FRONT

548
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,310
OF THE HOUSE WAS OUT.

549
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:42,810
YOUR SISTER WENT
TO GET THE DOG.

550
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,643
YOUR MOTHER
AND MR. KALLEN

551
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,935
WERE WALKING
TOWARDS THE HOUSE.

552
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,101
A MAN JUMPED OUT
OF THE SHADOWS.

553
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,501
HE HAD A GUN; HE
SHOT YOUR MOTHER
AND MR. KALLEN.

554
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,351
YOU SAW HIM
SHOOT HER.

555
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,975
HE TURNED
TO YOU.
NO.

556
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,602
HE SAID,
"DON'T MOVE."

557
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,975
DON'T MOVE.

558
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,685
Kelly:MOM?!

559
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:03,501
HELP!

560
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,667
HE LOOKED AT YOU,
DIDN'T HE, CHRIS?

561
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:12,393
YOU WERE GETTING OUT OF THE CAR

562
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,975
AND HE LOOKED
RIGHT AT YOU.

563
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:14,975
EASY.

564
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,059
(crying )

565
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,310
HELP US, CHRIS.

566
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:20,268
TELL US WHAT
HE LOOKED LIKE.

567
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,918
COME ON. YOU SAW HIM, CHRIS.

568
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:24,852
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

569
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:25,935
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

570
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:28,000
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH.

571
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,560
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

572
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,935
WE WEREN'T TRYING
TO UPSET HER.

573
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,268
WELL, YOU DID.

574
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,685
LISTEN, KALLEN DIDN'T
SEE THE SHOOTER.

575
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,059
HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
HE CAN'T HELP US.

576
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,000
AS FAR AS I.D.ing THE KILLER,
IT'S UP TO CHRIS.

577
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:50,643
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER LEADS, DO YOU?

578
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,351
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

579
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,185
WE'VE BEEN ASKING
AROUND ABOUT KALLEN.

580
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,059
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF FRIENDS

581
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,435
IN THE CONCRETE BUSINESS.

582
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:00,143
HE BACKED OUT OF
A BIG CONTRACT--

583
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,560
COST THE UNION A
COUPLE HUNDRED JOBS.

584
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:04,602
LOTS OF BAD BLOOD
ON BOTH SIDES.

585
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:07,935
LOOKS LIKE YOUR EX-WIFE
WAS JUST IN THE WRONG PLACE

586
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,185
AT THE WRONG TIME.

587
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,709
COME ON.

588
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,976
OKAY, KEEP ONE LEG
ON EACH SIDE

589
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,810
AND YOUR MIND
IN THE MIDDLE.

590
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,268
THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

591
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,768
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

592
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:32,143
I JUST WANT TO GET THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL.

593
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,810
NOTHING IS
NORMAL ANYMORE.

594
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:36,935
YOU LIVE ON A RANCH,
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW HOW TO RIDE.

595
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:40,310
NOW PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE STIRRUP
AND SWING YOUR LEG OVER.

596
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,268
I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

597
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,975
WHAT?

598
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,059
I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

599
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,351
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
HE WAS GONE.

600
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,143
NOT NOW, KEL.

601
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,101
WHY CAN'T SHE TELL THEM
ANYTHING?

602
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,477
SHE JUST CAN'T.

603
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,935
HE LOOKED
RIGHT AT HER.

604
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,975
GET ON THE HORSE.
SHE SAW HIM!

605
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,143
GET ON THE DAMN HORSE.

606
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,143
WHY CAN'T SHE GO FIRST?!

607
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,185
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A HELL OF A LOT.

608
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,018
IT DIDN'T JUST
HAPPEN TO HER!

609
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:04,768
KELLY...

610
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,268
SHE WAS MY MOTHER, TOO!

611
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,685
COME BACK HERE.

612
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:08,975
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?

613
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:09,976
COME BACK HERE.

614
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,059
I HATE THIS!
I HATE YOU!

615
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,059
I HATE YOU!

616
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,685
OH, YOU HATE THIS?

617
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:18,560
YOU THINK I LIKE
SEEING SOME DAMN
SHRINK TWO TIMES A WEEK?

618
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:19,894
YOU HATE THIS.

619
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:22,602
I WASH YOUR CLOTHES;
I CLEAN UP AFTER YOU.

620
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:25,935
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU COMPLAIN
EVERY DAMN DAY!

621
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:26,975
HUH?

622
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,876
I GOTTA LISTEN TO YOU COMPLAIN
EVERY DAMN DAY!

623
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:36,935
"I HATE YOU."

624
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,209
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

625
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,226
Chris:THERE'S NO SHERIFF TONIGHT.

626
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,268
WHERE'S DAD?

627
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:57,477
WHO CARES?

628
00:36:57,501 --> 00:37:00,477
WHAT IF HE NEVER COMES BACK?

629
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,643
HE'LL COME BACK.

630
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,935
HE HAS TO.

631
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:07,810
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

632
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,685
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO?

633
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,101
WHO CARES?

634
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,459
ANYWHERE.

635
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,375
I WANT TO GO HOME.

636
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,417
(up-tempo country music
playing)

637
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,894
I BEEN, UH,
WATCHING YOU ALL NIGHT.

638
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,975
YOU'RE CHARLIE McCLAIN,
AIN'T YOU?

639
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,518
I ROPED AGAINST YOU ONCE
UP IN OKLAHOMA CITY.

640
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,018
NAME'S MACEY.

641
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,643
KYLE MACEY.

642
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,975
REMEMBER ME?

643
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,918
YOU KICKED MY ASS.

644
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,975
TOLD YOU IT WAS HIM.

645
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,393
GOT OFF RODES
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

646
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,727
COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

647
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,852
HEARD HE WAS GOING TO TRY
SOME KIND OF COMEBACK

648
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:07,810
BUT DON'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME.

649
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,935
HE'S JUST A SORRY-ASS, HAS-BEEN.

650
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:12,226
HE AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK.

651
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,143
LET IT GO, MAC.

652
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,667
NOT TODAY.

653
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:18,768
Macey:
COME ON, MAC.

654
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,918
I SAID, NOT TODAY.

655
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
HEY, SUE.

656
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:52,959
HEY!

657
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,602
LET'S GO.

658
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,143
NO, NO.
I GOT TO GO HOME.

659
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,975
CHARLIE, YOU'RE
NOT GOING HOME.

660
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:08,059
YOU'RE GOING
TO JAIL.

661
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,975
NO. NO!

662
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,292
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND;
I GOT TO GO HOME.

663
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,025
(door closes)

664
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:27,109
I GOT TO TAKE A SHOWER.

665
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:31,918
Kelly:
WE HAVE A MEETING WITH SUSAN

666
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,441
IN HALF AN HOUR.

667
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,167
DO YOU WANT
TO TELL THE GIRLS

668
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:42,025
WHERE YOU WERE
LAST NIGHT?

669
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:45,793
MAC?

670
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,817
I WENT TO A BAR.

671
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:53,292
I GOT INTO A FIGHT, AND, UH...

672
00:39:53,316 --> 00:39:55,166
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL.

673
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,793
KELLY?

674
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:58,584
I WANT TO GO BACK TO L.A.

675
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:00,417
I WANT TO TALK
TO MY FRIENDS.

676
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,334
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PHONE.

677
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,109
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE HERE
WITH HIM.

678
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:10,584
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

679
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,126
AT THE END OF THE SUMMER

680
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,001
HE WON'T BE OUR FATHER
ANYWAY.

681
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,274
HEY.

682
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,043
I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FATHER.

683
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:21,817
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING A FATHER.

684
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,668
CHRIS, DO YOU FEEL
THE SAME WAY AS KELLY?

685
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,167
OUR MOTHER IS DEAD

686
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:30,166
AND WE HAVE TO LIVE
WITH HIM.

687
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,166
HOW DO YOU THINK
WE'RE FEELING?

688
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,709
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ISN'T FAIR

689
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,501
AND IT'S VERY,
VERY COMPLICATED.

690
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:38,793
YOU HAVE TO GRIEVE
YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH

691
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:41,085
WHILE TRYING TO BUILD
A LIFE WITH YOUR FATHER.

692
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:42,608
FORGET IT.

693
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:47,166
MY LIFE IS GONE.

694
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,167
YEAH, WELL, SO IS MINE.

695
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:52,501
I NEED A SMOKE.

696
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:55,441
(scoffs)

697
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:14,608
OKAY.

698
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,542
YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT.

699
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:19,167
YOU SPENT THE
NIGHT IN JAIL.

700
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,459
THE GIRLS HAD NO
IDEA WHERE YOU WERE

701
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,085
AND NO WAY TO REACH YOU.

702
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:25,025
HOW DID YOU THINK
THEY'D REACT?

703
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:28,834
THE GUY HAD IT COMING

704
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:31,709
AND THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A COP WATCHING THEM.

705
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:33,166
CARL HAD TO
PULL HIM AWAY

706
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,166
AND BESIDES, THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

707
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,793
IT'S NOT CARL'S
RESPONSIBILITY

708
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,542
TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR DAUGHTERS.

709
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,043
IT'S YOURS.

710
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,166
YOU HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THIS.

711
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,166
THAT'S WHAT TEMPORARY
CUSTODY IS ALL ABOUT.

712
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,166
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TOO HARD,
AND I CAN'T DO IT.

713
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,584
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME

714
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,834
THAT THE GIRLS NEEDED SOMEBODY
THEY COULD TALK TO ABOUT THINGS

715
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:56,167
SOMEBODY THEY'D BE COMFORTABLE
TALKING TO.

716
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:58,959
WELL, IT'S NOT ME,
AND IT'S NOT EVER GOING TO BE.

717
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,167
PUT DOWN IN YOUR REPORT

718
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:04,959
THAT AT THE END OF THE SUMMER,
THOSE GIRLS GO BACK TO CHICAGO.

719
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,668
THAT'S SAD.

720
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,376
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

721
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,668
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOSING
THE GIRLS TO GAYLE.

722
00:42:12,692 --> 00:42:15,751
YOU'RE LOSING THE CHANCE
TO BE THEIR FATHER.

723
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,166
YOU ARE GIVING
UP A LIFE

724
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,209
YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE WITHOUT THEM.

725
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:21,584
JESSE IS DEAD.

726
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,166
YOU'RE ALL THEY HAVE

727
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,751
AND THEY NEED YOU.

728
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,358
PLEASE DO NOT
GIVE UP ON THIS.

729
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:46,166
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO A RODEO, HAVE YOU?

730
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,608
NO.

731
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,233
CALF'S IN THE SHOOT.

732
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,190
YOU'RE ON THE HORSE
IN THE BOX...

733
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,459
AND THEN...

734
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,358
THE GATE OPENS AND...

735
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,190
BANG.

736
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:18,292
OF COURSE,
IN A RODEO,
THE DAMN CALF'S

737
00:43:18,316 --> 00:43:20,959
JUMPING AROUND
LIKE A RABBIT.

738
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:23,959
Chris:

00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,292

740
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:28,292
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

741
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:30,001
IT'S GEORGIA.

(whinnying)

768
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:30,126
SHE'S GETTING WEAKER.

00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:36,209
THAT'S IT.
(foal whinnying)

801
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,166
(dogs whining)

802
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,001

803
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:43,166
OKAY, NOW, I WANT YOU

805
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,126

THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT, COME ON.

807
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:49,167
CLEAN HER UP.

THAT'S IT.
LET HER FEEL YOU.

809
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,209
LET HER SMELL YOU.

810
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:53,209
THEN SHE'LL BE GOOD.

811
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:54,918
SHE'LL LET PEOPLE TOUCH HER.

812
00:45:54,942 --> 00:45:58,166
OKAY, NOW, SHE'S GOING TO NEED
SOMEONE SPECIAL TO FEED HER.

813
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,417
ALMOST EVERY HOUR, SOMEONE'S
GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AFTER HER.

814
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,584
OKAY, YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT, CHRIS?

815
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,668
OKAY.
YOU WANT THAT JOB?

816
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:07,001
YEAH.

817
00:46:07,025 --> 00:46:09,167
OKAY. SHE'S GOING TO BE
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

818
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:11,043
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

819
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,190
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

820
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:23,191
(whistling)

821
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:26,959
HI, SUSAN.

822
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:28,316
HI, DEB.

823
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:33,166
CHARLIE McCLAIN STOPPED BY
THIS MORNING.

824
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,166
YEAH, I HAVE A SESSION
WITH HIM TODAY.

825
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,668
HE WANTS
TO RESCHEDULE IT.

826
00:46:36,692 --> 00:46:39,166
HE'S, UM, PUTTING IN A PHONE
FOR THE GIRLS.

827
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,166
OH. UH, DID HE SAY WHEN?

828
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,668
HE SAID HE'D CALL YOU.

829
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:48,166
HE WAS COVERED WITH DIRT,
RIGHT OFF THE RANCH.

830
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,166
WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF GUYS
SAY THAT THEY'RE COWBOYS

831
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,876
BUT HE'S THE REAL THING.

832
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,501
THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
AT HIS HOUSE

833
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,751
I THOUGHT HE WAS GARY COOPER.

834
00:46:58,775 --> 00:46:59,834
GARY COOPER.

835
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,250
VERY INTERESTING.

836
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:03,001
DEB... PLEASE.

837
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,334
HE'S A CLIENT.

838
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,334
I'M NOT GETTING PERSONALLY
INVOLVED WITH HIM.

839
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:08,292
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE.

840
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:10,376
NO, BUT YOU WERE THINKING IT.

841
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,166
REALLY, SUSAN.

842
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,334
AREN'T YOU?

843
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:16,209
(laughs)

844
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,441
OKAY.

845
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,209
OKAY, EVERYTHING FOUR
FOOT AND DOWN IS CHRIS.

846
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:26,918
EVERYTHING FOUR FOOT
AND UP IS YOU, KELLY.

847
00:47:26,942 --> 00:47:28,166
I'LL GET THE CEILING

848
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,025
WHEN I'M DONE
WITH THE PHONE.

849
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:33,166
IS IT GOING TO WORK?

850
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,166
IT SHOULD.

851
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,043
DOTTY PUT IN A LINE
A LONG TIME AGO.

852
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,626
I JUST NEVER USED IT.

853
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,250
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO ALL THIS?

854
00:47:41,274 --> 00:47:42,668
IN THE ARMY.

855
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:46,166
DID SOME CARPENTRY,
PLUMBING, ELECTRIC

856
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,190
A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING.

857
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:58,459
GIRLS, THE ROOM'S
NOT GOING TO PAINT ITSELF.

858
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:01,775
UM, WE'VE NEVER PAINTED
A ROOM BEFORE.

859
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:05,417
OKAY.

860
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:06,834
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

861
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:09,001
PUT A LITTLE PAINT
ON THE BRUSH

862
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:11,584
AND THEN YOU PUT
THE PAINT ON THE WALL.

863
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:13,334
THAT'S ALL
THERE IS TO IT.

864
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:15,209
LET'S GO...
OH, NOT SO MUCH.

865
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:18,085
UH, TRY TO GET
JUST THE TIP, OKAY?

866
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:19,250
LIKE THAT.

867
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:23,085
WE'LL COAT THE CORNERS
FIRST, THEN THE EDGES

868
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,626
AND THEN WE'LL COME
BACK AND DO THE MIDDLE.

869
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,166
JUST LIKE THIS.

870
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,334
OKAY?

871
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:31,876
YOU KNOW, WHEN
I WAS A LITTLE BOY

872
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,166
MY MOTHER HIRED
SOME LOCAL KIDS

873
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,959
TO PAINT THE HOUSE
DURING THE SUMMER.

874
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:39,166
SHE TOLD ME I
HAD TO HELP THEM.

875
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,459
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

876
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,126
BUT BY THE END
OF THE SUMMER

877
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,166
I COULD PAINT
A WHOLE ROOM BY MYSELF.

878
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,190
HERE, YOU TRY.

879
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,733
OH, THAT'S GOOD, KELLY.

880
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:57,709
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

881
00:48:57,733 --> 00:49:00,292
SO HOW MUCH
DID YOUR MOM PAY YOU?

882
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:02,334
NOTHING.

883
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:06,166
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE,
UH, PAINT-THE-HOUSE-

884
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,626
AND-I'LL-LET-
YOU-LIVE DEALS.

885
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,109
SORT OF LIKE THIS?

886
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:13,025
SORT OF.

887
00:49:16,316 --> 00:49:18,166
IS THE PHONE DONE YET?

888
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,626
OH, THE PHONE.

889
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,191
LET'S SEE.

890
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:29,166
JUST PUT THE JACK IN.

891
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,608
YOU TRY IT.

892
00:49:32,692 --> 00:49:35,608
(dial tone drones)

893
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,334
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY BOYFRIENDS

894
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:41,167
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT,
DO YOU?

895
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,584
ONLY IN HAWAII.

896
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,167
OH, GREAT.

897
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,109
(dogs barking)

898
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,067
OH, HELL.

899
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:16,834
I WAS GOING
TO CALL YOU.

900
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:18,109
I KNOW.

901
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,626
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

902
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,209
WE BROUGHT PICTURES.

903
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,626
MAYBE IT'LL HELP HER REMEMBER.

904
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,918
WE'LL TRY TO DO

905
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,167
A SKETCH THIS TIME.

906
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,334
WHAT?

907
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:30,709
I SAID, NO.

908
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:33,166
THE SHOOTER'S
STILL OUT THERE, MAC.
I KNOW.

909
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,167
WHAT IF HE
COMES LOOKING?

910
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:35,584
HE CAN'T FIND HER HERE.

911
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,085
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

912
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:38,542
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
FOR SURE.

913
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,417
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

914
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:41,793
WE GOT SIX GUYS
ON IT EVERYDAY.

915
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,584
WE RUN ANYTHING THAT
SMELLS LIKE A LEAD.

916
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,250
WE CANVASSED
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

917
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:47,751
THEN CANVASSED IT AGAIN
AND THEN AGAIN.

918
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:49,751
WE QUESTIONED EVERYONE
WHO KNEW YOUR EX-WIFE

919
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:50,793
WHOEVER KNEW KALLEN.

920
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:52,376
AND YOU'RE STILL
STUCK IN THE CHUTE.

921
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,709
WHOEVER IT WAS
COULD HAVE SHOT HER

922
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:57,584
RIGHT THERE
AT THE HOUSE
IF HE'D WANTED TO.

923
00:50:57,608 --> 00:51:00,542
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT HER
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

924
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:04,167
SHE'S HAD A HARD ENOUGH TIME
DEALING WITH IT AS IT IS.

925
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:07,709
SHE HAS TO PUT THIS
BEHIND HER AND MOVE ON.

926
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,417
I WILL KEEP MY EYES OUT.

927
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,166
GOD HELP THE SON OF A BITCH
IF HE EVER SHOWS UP HERE.

928
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,793
MR. McCLAIN,
YOU'RE INTERFERING

929
00:51:14,817 --> 00:51:16,626
WITH A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

930
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,817
ANDYOU'REINTERFERING
WITH OUR LIVES.

931
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,085
CARL, I WANT YOU
AND THE DEPUTIES OFF THE RANCH.

932
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:27,459
HEY, MAC...

933
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:30,542
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
BUT YOU CAN GO BACK TO L.A. NOW.

934
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:31,584
WE'RE DONE HERE.

935
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:33,233
IT'S OVER.

936
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:05,191
8.2 SECONDS.

937
00:52:28,274 --> 00:52:31,166
THIS IS REALLY
SOMETHING, CHARLIE.

938
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

939
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,959
VISITING.

940
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:36,250
TALKING WITH MY NIECES.

941
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:37,983
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

942
00:52:39,316 --> 00:52:41,292
I JUST WANTED
TO SEE THE GIRLS

943
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:43,292
MAKE SURE
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

944
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:45,292
THEY'RE FINE.

945
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:47,334
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

946
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:49,793
I AM SO SORRY, GIRLS.

947
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:51,166
IF I'D HAD ANY IDEA

948
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,751
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT YOU...

949
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:54,190
I'M ASKING YOU TO LEAVE.

950
00:52:58,191 --> 00:52:59,983
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

951
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,085
THIS IS DAVID WINSTON

952
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,250
A LOCAL ATTORNEY
I HAVE ON RETAINER.

953
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:20,166
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
SEE FOR OURSELVES

954
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,668
WHAT KIND OF LIFE YOU'VE MADE
FOR KELLY AND CHRIS

955
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:24,209
BEFORE WE SPEAK
TO THE JUDGE.

956
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,626
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

957
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,085
WE'VE PETITIONED
THE BECKETT SUPERIOR COURT

958
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:31,358
AND THE JUDGE HAS AGREED TO SEE
US IN HIS CHAMBERS NEXT WEEK.

959
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:35,001
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, GAYLE?

960
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,668
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

961
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:39,166
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO CHANGE.

962
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,334
YOU NEVER CHANGED FOR JESSE.

963
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:44,292
ALL THOSE PROMISES...

964
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:47,459
AND YOU DIDN'T CHANGE.

965
00:53:47,483 --> 00:53:49,668
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP
HURTING THOSE GIRLS

966
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,166
JUST LIKE
YOU DID MY SISTER.

967
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,150
AND I WILL NOT ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

968
00:54:00,733 --> 00:54:02,650
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE GIRLS.

969
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:06,459
YOU JUST HATE ME.

970
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:08,751
LOOK AT THIS.

971
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:10,483
LOOK HOW THEY'RE LIVING.

972
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:15,167
I CAN GIVE THEM
EVERYTHING, CHARLIE.

973
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:17,109
WHAT CAN YOU GIVE THEM?

974
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,085
WAS IT GOOD TO SEE
YOUR AUNT GAYLE?

975
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:37,834
LIKE OLD TIMES.

976
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,316
I WAS ASKING THE GIRLS.

977
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:44,876
KELLY?

978
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,942
YEAH, I GUESS.

979
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,542
DO YOU EVER GO TO VISIT HER

980
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:52,167
IN CHICAGO AND SEE
YOUR COUSINS, CHRIS?

981
00:54:52,191 --> 00:54:53,292
YEAH.

982
00:54:53,316 --> 00:54:56,043
THEY CAME TO L.A. A FEW TIMES...

983
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:58,209
AND WE'D GO OUT FOR DINNER.

984
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:01,166
COME ON, CHRIS.

985
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,209
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE'S HERE, CHRIS?

986
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,166
DO YOU?

987
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,542
SHE DOESN'T WANT US
TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

988
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:10,043
THAT'S RIGHT.

989
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,834
SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO STAY AT THE RANCH

990
00:55:11,858 --> 00:55:13,085
FOR THE REST
OF THE SUMMER.

991
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,043
SHE WANTS TO TAKE YOU
TO CHICAGO RIGHT AWAY

992
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,400
AND THEN THAT'S
WHERE YOU'LL LIVE.

993
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,775
FOR GOOD?

994
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:23,900
FOR GOOD.

995
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:46,668
SHE CAN'T EVEN WAIT
UNTIL THE SUMMER'S OVER.

996
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:48,834
I DON'T THINK
IT'S IN HER NATURE

997
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:50,918
TO WAIT FOR ANYTHING
SHE WANTS.

998
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:52,751
THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM.

999
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:54,626
AND IT'S WORSE FOR CHRIS.

1000
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,166
IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR HER
TO DEAL WITH HER MOTHER'S DEATH

1001
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,483
WITHOUT BEING MOVED HALFWAY
ACROSS THE DAMN COUNTRY.

1002
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,376
IS SHE GOING
TO COME OUT OF THIS?

1003
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,501
YES.

1004
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:06,584
WHEN?

1005
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:07,626
WHEN SHE'S READY.

1006
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,292
IF SHE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT IT

1007
00:56:09,316 --> 00:56:12,209
THEN SHE FEELS
SHE'S PROTECTED
FROM IT SOMEHOW.

1008
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:16,126
IT'LL LAST UNTIL
SOMETHING TRIGGERS
AN EMOTIONAL CATHARSIS

1009
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,166
AND THEN EVERYTHING
WILL COME OUT.

1010
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,292
IN THE MEANTIME...

1011
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:21,793
IT WOULD HELP HER

1012
00:56:21,817 --> 00:56:23,959
IF YOU WERE
ABLE TO EXPRESS

1013
00:56:23,983 --> 00:56:27,376
YOUR OWN FEELINGS
A BIT BETTER.

1014
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,166
FEELINGS ABOUT WHAT?

1015
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,542
ABOUT JESSE...

1016
00:56:30,566 --> 00:56:33,566
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND THE GIRLS.

1017
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:37,501
I'M NOT VERY
GOOD AT THAT.

1018
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:39,190
I TRY, I GET ALL...

1019
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:44,274
IT TAKES PRACTICE.

1020
00:56:48,817 --> 00:56:50,167
ARE THEY
STILL OUT THERE?

1021
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:51,608
YEP.

1022
00:56:53,525 --> 00:56:56,834
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

1023
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:59,834
YOU EVER TALK
TO HIM ANYMORE?

1024
00:56:59,858 --> 00:57:01,376
NOT FOR YEARS.

1025
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,001
I DON'T THINK
WE EVER TALKED.

1026
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,166
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY WE GOT MARRIED.

1027
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,166
I WAS YOUNG.

1028
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,793
IT DIDN'T LAST LONG.

1029
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:11,025
IT ENDED BADLY,
AND THAT'S THAT.

1030
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,918
YOU SEEING ANYBODY NOW?

1031
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:27,085
NO, NOT AT ALL.

1032
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:29,085
SO WHY AREN'T YOU
SEEING ANYBODY?

1033
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:30,334
YOU MEAN, WHY
AREN'T I DATING

1034
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:32,190
OR WHY AREN'T I
IN A RELATIONSHIP?

1035
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:35,918
BOTH.

1036
00:57:35,942 --> 00:57:37,793
I'M NOT DATING 'CAUSE
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

1037
00:57:37,817 --> 00:57:39,376
I CAN'T LEAVE MY JOB
AT THE OFFICE.

1038
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,668
PEOPLE DON'T SUFFER

1039
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:43,001
BETWEEN 9:00 AND 5:00.

1040
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:44,166
NO, THEY DON'T.

1041
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,918
AND I'M NOT IN A
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE...

1042
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:49,292
THE RELATIONSHIPS
I'VE BEEN IN

1043
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:50,692
HAVEN'T WORKED FOR ME.

1044
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,250
YOU HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT MAN.

1045
00:57:56,274 --> 00:57:57,584
NO...

1046
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,793
NOT YET.

1047
00:57:59,817 --> 00:58:01,668
AND IF YOU DID?

1048
00:58:01,692 --> 00:58:03,334
THEN I'D GO OUT
WITH HIM.

1049
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:05,793
ON A DATE...

1050
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:07,274
OR A RELATIONSHIP?

1051
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:09,650
BOTH.

1052
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:13,692
ANYMORE QUESTIONS?

1053
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,584
YEAH.

1054
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:19,025
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO
A FRENCH BRAID?

1055
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:22,067
YEAH.

1056
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,983
IT'S EASY. I'LL SHOW YOU.

1057
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,608
TAKE THIS HAIR.

1058
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:33,542
OKAY?

1059
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:37,190
MAKE IT
THREE PIECES HERE.

1060
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,190
WERE YOU ANY GOOD?

1061
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,166
OH, I HAD A FEW GOOD YEARS.

1062
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,250
YOUR DADDY WON RODEOS

1063
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:53,542
IN HOUSTON AND CHEYENNE
AND PLENTY OF OTHER PLACES.

1064
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:56,834
HE WAS A P.R.C.A. CHAMP
THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

1065
00:58:56,858 --> 00:58:58,166
WHAT'S P.R.C.A.?

1066
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,876
PROFESSIONAL RODEO
COWBOY ASSOCIATION.

1067
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,126
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

1068
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,959
THIS IS A SCORE LINE--
GIVES THE CALF

1069
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:06,668
A HEAD START.

1070
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:09,542
I CAN'T LEAVE THE BOX
TILL THE CALVES CROSS THIS LINE.

1071
00:59:09,566 --> 00:59:14,209
IF I DO, I BREAK THAT BARRIER,
AND THAT'S A TEN-SECOND PENALTY.

1072
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,566
THEN I MIGHT AS WELL PACK UP
AND HEAD HOME.

1073
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:26,501
NOW THE CLOCK IS GOING TO START
WHEN I CROSS THAT BARRIER

1074
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,043
AND IT STOPS

1075
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:30,067
WHEN I THROW UP MY HANDS.

1076
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,209
NOW...

1077
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:40,250
EVER SEE A MAN GO FROM ZERO
TO 30 MILES PER HOUR

1078
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:41,501
IN ONE SECOND?

1079
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:42,525
HANG ON.

1080
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,001
Charlie:
WHAT'S THE TIME?

1081
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:03,608
8.2 SECONDS.

1082
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,709
WELL, PACHECO'S A SMALL ARENA...

1083
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:11,584
KIND OF LIKE POWAY.

1084
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,250
I DID A 7.9 AT POWAY ONCE.

1085
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:16,459
GOT TO DO A LOT BETTER
AT PACHECO.

1086
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:17,876
WHAT'S PACHECO?

1087
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,209
A RANCH HANDS' RODEO,
LOCAL COWBOYS.

1088
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:23,166
YOUR DADDY DOES
WELL THERE

1089
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,942
WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN
AND TALK BUSINESS.

1090
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,751
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1091
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:31,542
YOUR DADDY'S
LOOKING FOR A SPONSOR.

1092
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:34,542
A SPONSOR FOR WHAT?

1093
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:37,085
GET BACK INTO
THE RODEO.

1094
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:39,668
COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
TO LIVE ON THE ROAD THESE DAYS--

1095
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:42,334
MOTELS,
RESTAURANTS.

1096
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:44,959
GOT TO DRIVE YOUR
HORSE ACROSS COUNTRY

1097
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:46,918
KEEP HIM FED
AND HEALTHY.

1098
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:48,959
AND THE P.R.C.A. FEES

1099
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:51,085
WELL, THEY
AIN'T CHEAP.

1100
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:53,166
MUST BE $450 BY NOW.

1101
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,542
AND THAT'SPERRODEO.

1102
01:00:55,566 --> 01:00:57,334
THEN THEY GOT DUES
ON TOP OF THAT.

1103
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:00,501
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE RODEO.

1104
01:01:00,525 --> 01:01:02,525
KELLY!

1105
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,316
THAT WAS
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE.

1106
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:11,166
SO NOW WHAT?
WE GO ON THE ROAD?

1107
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,542
WE LIVE IN MOTELS ALL YEAR LONG?

1108
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:15,166
THIS IS MY LIFE.

1109
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,085
IT'S WHAT I DO.

1110
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:20,334
IT'S NOT JUST YOU ANYMORE!

1111
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:23,001
WHAT IFIDON'T WANT
TO LIVE LIKE THAT?!

1112
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,316
(frustrated scream)

1113
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,817
MOM SURE DIDN'T.

1114
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,334
Judge:
THERE ARE THREE WEEKS

1115
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:05,793
UNTIL THE FINAL
CUSTODY HEARING.

1116
01:02:05,817 --> 01:02:07,043
YES, YOUR HONOR

1117
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:08,166
BUT MRS. MILLER'S NIECES

1118
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,334
ARE IN IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY

1119
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,085
LIVING WITH MR. McCLAIN.

1120
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:12,166
HOW SO?

1121
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,918
HE WAS DRUNK IN A BAR,
STARTED A FIGHT

1122
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:15,793
AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL,
YOUR HONOR.

1123
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:17,876
Winston:
THE SCHOOL YEAR
STARTS IN A MONTH.

1124
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,166
MR. McCLAIN HAS MADE

1125
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,334
NO ARRANGEMENTS
WHATSOEVER

1126
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:22,709
FOR THE GIRLS' EDUCATION.

1127
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:24,584
HE HASN'T SPOKEN
TO A SINGLE TEACHER

1128
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,166
HASN'T EVEN SHOWN
THE GIRLS

1129
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,085
THE SCHOOL THEY'D
BE ATTENDING.

1130
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:31,209
WHAT SCHOOL WOULD THEY
BE ATTENDING, MR. McCLAIN?

1131
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:33,626
Miller:
I HAVE PREREGISTERED
THE GIRLS

1132
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,292
IN THE FINEST PREP SCHOOL
IN ILLINOIS.

1133
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:38,001
ORIENTATION IS THE FIRST WEEK
IN SEPTEMBER, YOUR HONOR.

1134
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:40,166
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME
TO GET THE GIRLS

1135
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,584
INTO THE BECKETT PUBLIC
SCHOOL SYSTEM, YOUR HONOR.

1136
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:45,918
WHAT IS IT YOU AND MRS. MILLER
WANT, MR. WINSTON?

1137
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:48,085
WELL, WE'D LIKE YOU
TO MAKE A RULING

1138
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:50,166
ON THE CUSTODY ISSUE
NOW, YOUR HONOR.

1139
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,166
THE RULING'S
ALREADY BEEN MADE.

1140
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,166
OH, WE DON'T THINK IT'S WISE

1141
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,459
TO WAIT THREE
MORE WEEKS.

1142
01:02:56,483 --> 01:02:57,876
MS. SHAW?

1143
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,166
ALL MY REPORTS RECOMMEND

1144
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,292
THAT MR. McCLAIN BE ALLOWED
TO FINISH THE SUMMER

1145
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:03,250
WITH HIS DAUGHTERS.

1146
01:03:03,274 --> 01:03:05,668
THE GIRLS NEED A SECURE
AND STABLE HOME

1147
01:03:05,692 --> 01:03:07,417
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

1148
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:08,668
MR. McCLAIN

1149
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:10,085
HAS ALREADY SHOWN

1150
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:11,793
HE'S NOT ABLE
TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THEM.

1151
01:03:11,817 --> 01:03:13,584
Susan:
HE IS A FIRST-TIME

1152
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:15,626
SINGLE PARENT,
YOUR HONOR.

1153
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,376
Winston:
MRS. MILLER IS READY, WILLING

1154
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,876
AND ABLE TO STEP IN.

1155
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,166
NO ONE HAS YET DETERMINED

1156
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,001
THAT THAT WILL BE NECESSARY,
MR. WINSTON.

1157
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:24,542
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1158
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:27,775
I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

1159
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,025
(mooing)

1160
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:05,709
MORGAN SAID YOU CAN KEEP
THE GIRLS FOR THE SUMMER.

1161
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:07,626
HE FELT IT WAS
TOO SHORT A TIME

1162
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,166
TO WARRANT PULLING THEM AND
TO OVERRULE THE L.A. COURT.

1163
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,501
BUT HE HAS SOME SERIOUS
CONSIDERATIONS

1164
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:15,400
ABOUT THE GIRLS
AND ABOUT YOU.

1165
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:18,650
YEAH, WELL...

1166
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:21,983
JOIN THE CLUB.

1167
01:04:28,233 --> 01:04:29,709
IT'S NOT GOOD, MAC.

1168
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,668
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU IN SEPTEMBER.

1169
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:34,942
HE COULD GIVE THE GIRLS
TO GAYLE.

1170
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:41,584
SO, UH, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

1171
01:04:41,608 --> 01:04:45,400
IS THAT I REALLY ONLY HAVE
THREE WEEKS LEFT WITH THEM.

1172
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:51,834
I'M SORRY.

1173
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:54,483
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

1174
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:01,858
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
THIS FAR WITHOUT YOU.

1175
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,001
YOU'RE UP EARLY
THIS MORNING.

1176
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:44,501
YEAH.

1177
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:47,501
THE COLT'S LOOKING
REAL GOOD.

1178
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:49,876
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.

1179
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,566
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

1180
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:55,209
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1181
01:05:55,233 --> 01:05:58,608
I THINK YOUR MAMA
WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU, TOO.

1182
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:06,166
YOU KNOW, WHEN I ASKED
YOUR MOM TO MARRY ME...

1183
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,166
I DIDN'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY.

1184
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,001
I COULDN'T BUY HER

1185
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:12,166
ONE OF THOSE BIG DIAMONDS
OR ANYTHING.

1186
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,085
BUT THERE WAS THIS INDIAN

1187
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:17,043
AND HE HAD A LITTLE STORE
OVER IN MERCED.

1188
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:21,166
IN THE WINDOW, HE HAD THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL TURQUOISE NECKLACE

1189
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,334
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

1190
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:26,584
AND YOUR MOM
SAW IT ONE DAY.

1191
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,501
SHE TOLD ME
HOW MUCH SHE LIKED IT.

1192
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,501
SHE ASKED ME TO GET IT.

1193
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:33,525
AND I DID.

1194
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:39,417
SO I WENT BACK
AND I GOT IT FOR HER

1195
01:06:39,441 --> 01:06:42,167
AND I GAVE IT TO HER...

1196
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:44,692
THE DAY I ASKED HER TO MARRY ME.

1197
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:53,692
AND I WAS THINKING...

1198
01:06:57,274 --> 01:07:00,043
I THINK THIS NECKLACE

1199
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:03,668
WOULD LOOK AS
BEAUTIFUL ON YOU

1200
01:07:03,692 --> 01:07:05,525
AS IT DID ON HER.

1201
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:10,650
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

1202
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:16,043
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1203
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:17,817
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
HONEY?

1204
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:21,441
IT WAS SO DARK.

1205
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:25,983
HE WAS IN THE SHADOWS.

1206
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,834
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1207
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:31,190
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1208
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:35,959
I COULDN'T SEE HIS FACE.

1209
01:07:35,983 --> 01:07:37,190
I KNOW.

1210
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:42,709
AND I KEEP LOOKING
TO SEE HIS FACE

1211
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:44,900
BUT I NEVER CAN.

1212
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,166
I-I NEVER CAN.

1213
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,793
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1214
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:51,417
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1215
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:54,001
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

1216
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:57,334
I-I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1217
01:07:57,358 --> 01:07:58,959
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

1218
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:00,959
NO, IT'S NOT.

1219
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:03,001
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD DO.

1220
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:05,250
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD DO.

1221
01:08:05,274 --> 01:08:08,043
I DIDN'T SCREAM.

1222
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:11,167
I DIDN'T RUN FOR HELP.

1223
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:12,918
I JUST STOOD THERE.

1224
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:15,709
OH, IT'S OKAY.

1225
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:17,334
I JUST STOOD THERE.

1226
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:19,358
NO, IT'S OKAY.

1227
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,190
IT'S OKAY.

1228
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,793
DO YOU THINK HE'LL WIN?

1229
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:38,459
IF HE DOES, I'M
GOING TO HAVE

1230
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:40,166
TO FIND MYSELF
A NEW COWBOY.

1231
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,166
I DON'T LIKE

1232
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,709
WHEN THINGS CHANGE.

1233
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:46,566
NOBODY DOES, HONEY.

1234
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,459
BUT THEY CHANGE ANYWAY.

1235
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:50,483
MM-HMM.

1236
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,334
YOU GOT ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS
YOU NEED

1237
01:09:01,358 --> 01:09:02,751
RIGHT THERE ON THE COUNTER.

1238
01:09:02,775 --> 01:09:04,441
YOU SHOULDN'T GO.

1239
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,043
DOTTY SAID
SHE'D MAKE YOU DINNER

1240
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,525
BUT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH.

1241
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:13,417
CHRIS NEEDS YOU HERE.

1242
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,334
SHE'LL BE FINE.

1243
01:09:15,358 --> 01:09:18,166
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT SHE FEEDS THE DOGS

1244
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,584
AND LOOKS AFTER

1245
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:20,751
THE COLT.

1246
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:22,167
SHE'S ONLY TEN.

1247
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,166
AND DON'T LET THE DISHES
PILE UP.

1248
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:26,459
IT'S BEST IF YOU DO THEM
AS YOU GO ALONG.

1249
01:09:26,483 --> 01:09:28,501
WHAT IF SHE'S NOT FINE?

1250
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:31,376
WELL, THEN YOU TAKE CARE OF HER.

1251
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,167
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

1252
01:09:35,191 --> 01:09:37,166
I DON'T WANT TO BE HER MOTHER.

1253
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,959
I'M A KID.

1254
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:40,668
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A KID!

1255
01:09:40,692 --> 01:09:43,166
KELLY, CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

1256
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,292
CALM DOWN.

1257
01:09:44,316 --> 01:09:45,918
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

1258
01:09:45,942 --> 01:09:48,376
YOU ACT LIKE YOU CARE
BECAUSE YOUHAVETO.

1259
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,501
YOU NEVER CARED.

1260
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:50,668
YOU... NEVER....

1261
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:52,166
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1262
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,166
YES. YES, ITISTRUE.

1263
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,501
DO YOU THINK
I'D BE LIVING HERE

1264
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,274
IF MOM WAS STILL ALIVE?

1265
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:03,733
YOU NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT US AT ALL.

1266
01:10:28,608 --> 01:10:30,166
WHAT'S THAT?

1267
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,190
LETTERS-- FOR YOU AND CHRIS.

1268
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,668
"KELLY...

1269
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:01,918
"I JUST SAW
YOUR THANKSGIVING PLAY

1270
01:11:01,942 --> 01:11:05,166
"AND WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU WERE

1271
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:07,817
THE PRETTIEST PILGRIM
ON THE STAGE."

1272
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,191
YOU WERE ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD.

1273
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:15,459
I SAW THE SHOW;
I WATCHED THE WHOLE THING

1274
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:16,817
FROM THE BACK.

1275
01:11:21,316 --> 01:11:23,358
YOU WORE A BLUE DRESS.

1276
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,900
AND YOU SANG
"GOD BLESS AMERICA."

1277
01:11:37,817 --> 01:11:39,334
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THERE.

1278
01:11:39,358 --> 01:11:40,459
YEAH, WELL...

1279
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:43,316
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

1280
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:48,483
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER MAIL THESE?

1281
01:11:56,858 --> 01:11:58,358
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D READ THEM.

1282
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:07,166
NOW, YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT ABOUT ME.

1283
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,817
IT'S PROBABLY ALL TRUE.

1284
01:12:14,109 --> 01:12:16,900
BUT DON'T YOU SAY
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT YOU.

1285
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:33,209
There's little Davy Johnson.
Look at this guy.

1286
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:34,417
Five years of age

1287
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:36,417
and look at this clown--
He's got him.

1288
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:38,001
And what a ride. There's Davy.

1289
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:40,334
He completed his ride
in the opening

1290
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:41,668
of the Mutton Busting.

1291
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:42,959
Way to go, Davy!

1292
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,900
The crowd loves you. You betcha.

1293
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,167
GERALD SMITH.

1294
01:12:54,191 --> 01:12:56,626
WELL-KNOWN COWBOY
AROUND THESE PARTS.

1295
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,334
HE'S DRAWN THUNDERBOLT.

1296
01:12:58,358 --> 01:12:59,584
Here he comes.

1297
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:02,376
The chute's open,
and Thunderbolt comes up high.

1298
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,584
Look at that.

1299
01:13:03,608 --> 01:13:05,542
Just keep hanging on, Gerald.

1300
01:13:05,566 --> 01:13:07,166
Eight seconds into the ride.

1301
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,166
Hold on.
Here comes the side door.

1302
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,608
I think he made it--
eight seconds.

1303
01:13:18,692 --> 01:13:20,166
There's the steer

1304
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:21,626
and here comes Frankie.

1305
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,817
Look at this. He's got him down.

1306
01:13:25,858 --> 01:13:29,025
Yes, and under five seconds.

1307
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,709
And he's up next,
and here he comes.

1308
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,376
The long rope is up.

1309
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,709
He's got that little doggie.

1310
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,501
Down he goes.

1311
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:42,834
Now comes the roping...

1312
01:13:42,858 --> 01:13:44,126
Look at that.

1313
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,190
He's under ten seconds.

1314
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:49,793
That's official, folks.

1315
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:51,417
Defending Champion Carl Collins

1316
01:13:51,441 --> 01:13:53,650
in 9.4.

1317
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,001
OKAY, MAC, YOU'RE UP.

1318
01:13:57,025 --> 01:14:00,001
THE TIME TO BEAT IS 9.4.

1319
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:02,126
TIME TO BEAT'S AN EIGHT.

1320
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,501
Now, as you well know,
this is a big return

1321
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:05,584
for Charlie.

1322
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,668
He's fighting his way back

1323
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:10,085
from injuries
for the past few years.

1324
01:14:10,109 --> 01:14:12,166
It's sure good
to see Mac's back.

1325
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,250
This roping event
is usually the domain

1326
01:14:14,274 --> 01:14:16,126
of those young bucks.

1327
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,190
READY, MAC?

1328
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,542
Go get them, Charlie.

1329
01:14:22,566 --> 01:14:25,166
Hey, you've got him, cowboy.

1330
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:28,166
Grab him up... looking good!

1331
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:30,190
Yay!

1332
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:46,190
Man:
7.9.

1333
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,166
Charlie McClain's

1334
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:54,668
comeback time, folks--

1335
01:14:54,692 --> 01:14:56,858
an amazing 7.9 seconds.

1336
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:02,166
MAC IS BACK.

1337
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:05,166
MAC IS BACK--
I LIKE THAT,
IT'S CATCHY.

1338
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,109
HERE YOU GO.

1339
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,166
HOW'S YOUR KNEE?

1340
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,001
PRETTY GOOD.

1341
01:15:12,025 --> 01:15:14,001
THAT WAS A GOOD RUN, MAC.

1342
01:15:14,025 --> 01:15:15,876
IT WAS A DAMN GOOD RUN.

1343
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,250
I'LL DROP BY
DOTTY'S THIS WEEK.

1344
01:15:18,274 --> 01:15:20,525
WE GOT BUSINESS
TO DISCUSS.

1345
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:24,566
THAT A BOY.

1346
01:15:37,858 --> 01:15:39,459
CONGRATULATIONS.

1347
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:41,167
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

1348
01:15:41,191 --> 01:15:43,025
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

1349
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:48,459
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1350
01:15:48,483 --> 01:15:52,085
MY SPONSOR WANTS ME TO
SIGN A CONTRACT THIS WEEK.

1351
01:15:52,109 --> 01:15:54,043
TELL ME SOMETHING.

1352
01:15:54,067 --> 01:15:56,793
WHAT KIND OF A FATHER
DO YOU THINK I AM?

1353
01:15:56,817 --> 01:15:58,209
I THINK YOU'RE A FATHER

1354
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:01,190
WHO LOVES HIS DAUGHTERS
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

1355
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,209
IS THAT ENOUGH?

1356
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:07,793
WASN'T IT ENOUGH FOR YOU

1357
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,459
WITH YOUR FATHER?

1358
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:12,126
MY FATHER DIED
WHEN I WAS THREE.

1359
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,001
I NEVER KNEW HIM.

1360
01:16:14,025 --> 01:16:17,190
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO LEARN FROM HIM.

1361
01:16:21,608 --> 01:16:24,166
THEY WERE JUST BABIES.

1362
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,150
I WAS AFRAID
I'D LET THEM DOWN.

1363
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,709
I STILL FEEL THAT WAY.

1364
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:31,292
I WOULD IMAGINE

1365
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:33,834
IT'S THE MOST INTIMIDATING
THING THAT YOU'LL EVER DO

1366
01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:37,166
BUT...ITHINK...

1367
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,233
YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES.

1368
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,400
YOU THINK THERE'S ANY
CHANCE I'LL GET THEM?

1369
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:50,650
I THINK IT'S A LONG SHOT.

1370
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,542
I TALKED TO
MY ACCOUNTANT

1371
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:03,501
AND WE'RE GETTING
THINGS ALL SET UP.

1372
01:17:03,525 --> 01:17:06,167
AFTER SALINAS, WE'RE GOING
TO SWING THROUGH NEVADA

1373
01:17:06,191 --> 01:17:07,959
THEN DOWN TO ARIZONA...

1374
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:10,126
CROSS OVER
THROUGH NEW MEXICO

1375
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,126
UP COLORADO
AND INTO WYOMING

1376
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:15,959
AND THAT SHOULD BRING
US INTO THE FALL.

1377
01:17:15,983 --> 01:17:17,043
THEN WE'LL HAVE

1378
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:19,459
A FEW WEEKS TO
DO SOME PROMOTION.

1379
01:17:19,483 --> 01:17:22,166
WE'LL START AT MY
PLACE IN MODESTO.

1380
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:26,959
WE'LL MAKE IT A BIG DEAL, UH...
SIGN SOME AUTOGRAPHS.

1381
01:17:26,983 --> 01:17:30,668
WE'LL GIVE AWAY
SOME RODEO TICKETS AND...

1382
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,274
MAC, ARE YOU WITH ME HERE?

1383
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,190
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND, GEORGE.

1384
01:17:43,983 --> 01:17:46,608
YOU SAID IT WAS
A YOUNG MAN'S GAME ANYWAY.

1385
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,166
I RECKON IT IS.

1386
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,793
MAC...

1387
01:17:55,817 --> 01:17:56,876
THANKS.

1388
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,334
THANK YOU.

1389
01:17:58,358 --> 01:18:00,150
GOOD LUCK.

1390
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,376
SO WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

1391
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,417
I'M NOT.

1392
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:24,793
I TURNED HIM DOWN.

1393
01:18:24,817 --> 01:18:27,085
BUT YOU WANTED
TO BE IN THE RODEO.

1394
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:30,166
I THOUGHT I DID.

1395
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:32,209
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED

1396
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:35,209
HOW LONELY IT
GETS ON THE ROAD.

1397
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:38,085
I'D BE COMING BACK
TO THAT HOUSE

1398
01:18:38,109 --> 01:18:40,709
AND IT'D BE DARK AND QUIET.

1399
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:43,126
OF COURSE, IT'D BE CLEAN.

1400
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:47,834
AND THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY
LAUNDRY LYING ON MY RECORDS.

1401
01:18:47,858 --> 01:18:51,274
BUT I'D ALWAYS BE WONDERING
WHERE MY GIRLS WERE AT.

1402
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:57,501
I'D ALWAYS BE WONDERING.

1403
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:59,858
YOU WANT TO BE WITH US?

1404
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:09,209
WHAT'S THE MATTER, KELLY?

1405
01:19:09,233 --> 01:19:12,441
WHAT IF WE HAVE
TO GO WITH GAYLE?

1406
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,441
(crying)

1407
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,167
DADDY...

1408
01:20:07,191 --> 01:20:12,525
I-I PROMISE I WON'T
COMPLAIN ANYMORE.

1409
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:40,376
(crying):
I'M S-SORRY.

1410
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,584
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1411
01:20:42,608 --> 01:20:45,525
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1412
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:50,900
IT'S OKAY.

1413
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,459
I GOT IT FOR YOU, FOLKS.

1414
01:21:06,483 --> 01:21:07,459
THANK YOU.

1415
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:09,459
THERE YOU GO.

1416
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:11,459
HEY.

1417
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:13,166
HOW YOU DOING?

1418
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,501
WELL, I THINK
WE'VE BEEN BETTER, HUH?

1419
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:16,542
YEAH.

1420
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:18,417
FEEL READY?

1421
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:19,876
KELLY.

1422
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,166
CHRIS.

1423
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,043
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1424
01:21:23,067 --> 01:21:24,209
CHARLIE.

1425
01:21:24,233 --> 01:21:25,650
HELLO.

1426
01:21:31,316 --> 01:21:33,190
LET'S GO.

1427
01:21:35,483 --> 01:21:39,334
YOUR HONOR, MY SISTER AND I
WERE VERY CLOSE.

1428
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:41,834
I'VE KNOW KELLY
AND CHRIS SINCE
THEY WERE BORN.

1429
01:21:41,858 --> 01:21:44,834
IN MY CUSTODY,
THEY WOULD LIVE IN A STABLE

1430
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:48,001
FINANCIALLY SECURE
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT.

1431
01:21:48,025 --> 01:21:50,876
MR. McCLAIN'S HISTORY
AS AN ABSENTEE FATHER
IS WELL-DOCUMENTED.

1432
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,542
THAT'S NOT
THE QUESTION HERE.

1433
01:21:53,566 --> 01:21:57,584
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS
AT STAKE FOR THE GIRLS?

1434
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,001
AND, YOUR HONOR

1435
01:21:59,025 --> 01:22:02,584
THEIR BEST INTEREST
IS HAVING THEM LIVE WITH ME.

1436
01:22:02,608 --> 01:22:05,166
THANK YOU.

1437
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,417
I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS
ABOUT YOU, MR. McCLAIN.

1438
01:22:08,441 --> 01:22:11,959
YOU'VE BEING UNWILLING
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE

1439
01:22:11,983 --> 01:22:14,085
FOR SO MANY YEARS,
HOW CAN I BE CERTAIN

1440
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:17,043
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO CHANGE IT NOW?

1441
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:20,166
GIRLS, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE

1442
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,525
TO SAY?

1443
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:29,566
UM...

1444
01:22:32,316 --> 01:22:36,650
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD FOR US
SINCE OUR MOM DIED...

1445
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:42,959
AND...

1446
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:46,233
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE KNEW OUR DAD.

1447
01:22:49,274 --> 01:22:51,233
AND IF WE GO BACK NOW...

1448
01:22:54,942 --> 01:22:57,650
I JUST THINK IT'D BE REALLY SAD.

1449
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,900
THAT'S ALL.

1450
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,400
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY
AS YOUR SISTER?

1451
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:27,274
MY FATHER LOVED THE RODEO
HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

1452
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:34,166
HE HAD A CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN.

1453
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:36,025
UH, YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1454
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:41,566
AND... HE TURNED IT DOWN.

1455
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:48,400
HE DECIDED
THAT HE LOVED US MORE.

1456
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:57,166
I WANT TO STAY WITH HIM

1457
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,900
YOUR HONOR.

1458
01:24:01,775 --> 01:24:06,025
I REALLY WANT TO LIVE
WITH MY DAD.

1459
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,209
MR. McCLAIN

1460
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:24,441
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY ANYTHING?

1461
01:24:34,566 --> 01:24:37,525
I'VE, UH, I'VE MADE
SOME MISTAKES, YOUR HONOR.

1462
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,191
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1463
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:46,250
BUT I KNOW WHAT I WANT NOW.

1464
01:24:46,274 --> 01:24:48,001
DO YOU?

1465
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:49,483
YES, SIR.

1466
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:54,233
THESE ARE MY GIRLS.

1467
01:24:55,942 --> 01:24:57,358
I'M THEIR FATHER.

1468
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:01,166
WE'RE A FAMILY.

1469
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,566
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

1470
01:25:04,191 --> 01:25:08,233
AND I HAVE NEVER FELT THAT
MORE THAN I FEEL IT RIGHT NOW.

1471
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,668
NOW, I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT, UH...

1472
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:16,441
THEY NEED ME.

1473
01:25:18,775 --> 01:25:22,166
AND, UH...

1474
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,650
I'LL BE THERE FOR THEM.

1475
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:29,668
IT'S ALSO
THE OTHER WAY AROUND, TOO.

1476
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:31,126
I NEED THEM.

1477
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:32,483
SO, UH...

1478
01:25:34,983 --> 01:25:37,250
PLEASE...

1479
01:25:37,274 --> 01:25:40,584
PLEASE, YOUR HONOR...

1480
01:25:40,608 --> 01:25:43,190
LET ME BE THEIR FATHER.

1481
01:25:58,858 --> 01:26:00,793
MS. SHAW.

1482
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:02,085
(clears throat)

1483
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:03,292
YOUR OFFICE STAYS

1484
01:26:03,316 --> 01:26:07,166
IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THESE
FAMILIES FOLLOWING DECISION?

1485
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:10,067
YES, YOUR HONOR,
WE CERTAINLY DO.

1486
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:14,751
OKAY.

1487
01:26:14,775 --> 01:26:16,316
MR. McCLAIN...

01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,834
I HEREBY GRANT YOU

1489
01:26:19,858 --> 01:26:22,043

1490

(laughs)

1491
01:26:24,817 --> 01:26:26,085
Kelly:

01:26:26,109 --> 01:26:28,417
THANK YOU, SIR.

1493
01:26:28,441 --> 01:26:30,085

THANK YOU.

1495

(laughing)

1496
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,167
THANK YOU.

1497
01:26:38,191 --> 01:26:40,001

HOW ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT?

ARE YOU OKAY?
