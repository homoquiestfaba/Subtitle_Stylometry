1
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:20,641
Summer
1985, Elkridge, Illinois.

2
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,815
An evil force emerged and began

3
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,405
hunting down the senior
class in alphabetical order,

4
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,925
and also claiming the
lives of anyone related.

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,217
The pattern was discovered
by social outcast,

6
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:46,460
Zeke Zanderfeldt,

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,739
the last name listed
in the senior yearbook,

8
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,398
and thus the last of those
whose lives would be taken.

9
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,644
Along with a mysterious Jane
Doe with telekinetic powers,

10
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:01,406
the duo vowed to stop
the evil in its tracks

11
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,649
by facing the fear head-on.

12
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:07,619
Zeke enlisted the
help of a detective,

13
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,070
but his life was taken too.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,588
At the last second,

15
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:15,075
as the evil worked its way
down the list of names,

16
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,904
Zeke and the mysterious girl

17
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:21,908
managed to subdue and seemingly
destroy this evil force.

18
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,083
Or did they?

19
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,015
Authorities questioned Zeke,

20
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,227
who they believed was
responsible for the deaths.

21
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,160
Zeke went into hiding,

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,025
and the mysterious girl
vanished without a trace.

23
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,581
The story picks up
two years later.

24
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,101
Same town, new trouble.

25
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:50,731
- I don't know what you see
in this place, Charlotte.

26
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,215
It's really dreary.

27
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,527
Can't we do something
normal, like see a movie?

28
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:56,012
- Shut up, Roland.

29
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:56,978
You have to connect
with the dead

30
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,601
to really appreciate the living.

31
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,293
- Okay well, what
are you hoping to do?

32
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:02,122
- You'll see.

33
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,503
- No, not that.

34
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:07,575
- Don't be such a pussy.

35
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,267
Besides, today's the
two year anniversary

36
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,509
of this mysterious death.

37
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,754
- I don't want to do this.

38
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,065
- Don't be such a chicken.

39
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:15,894
Come on, let's do this.

40
00:02:15,894 --> 00:02:16,722
Give me your hand.

41
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,140
- Fine, we're doing something
of my choice after this.

42
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:42,127
- It's happening,
it's happening.

43
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,164
It's coming, it's coming.

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,547
It's here, it's
open.

45
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,793
- Charlotte, I don't think
we should be doing this.

46
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:58,108
- Enter
the material world.

47
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:03,010
- You fucking
pathetic little people.

48
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:24,374
- Zeke.

49
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,021
- What the fuck?

50
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:08,617
- I'll bet you want to know
what this is all about.

51
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:10,342
- Zeke?

52
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,002
Did you make this?

53
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,833
- Yes, but we should
probably get outta here.

54
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:20,387
Evil is afoot.

55
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,293
- It's been two
years, my friend.

56
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,778
What happened?

57
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,780
I haven't heard from you.

58
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,609
Ever since all this
shit went down,

59
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:38,163
you sorta just
disappeared off the map.

60
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,855
- I knew I had to hide.

61
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,477
The authorities were after me,

62
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,308
and they think I had
something to do with this.

63
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,004
I became obsessed with
this evil over the years.

64
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:55,077
I thought I stopped it
the first time around.

65
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:59,771
But with these two new deaths
of our former classmates,

66
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,499
I think we're thinking
the same thing right now.

67
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,191
- Man this is heavy.

68
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,438
I was afraid this was
gonna happen again.

69
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:13,336
- Well, I think our gut feelings

70
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:14,924
are trying to tell us something.

71
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:20,033
By the way, you look different.

72
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,551
What's what's with the get up?

73
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,382
- Ever since this all happened,

74
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,627
I'm tougher now.

75
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,558
- What do you mean?

76
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,388
- Well,

77
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,116
my brother was a
college student,

78
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,358
just about to graduate.

79
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,606
He was a member of the
track team, all-star,

80
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,403
really outstanding.

81
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:52,272
When I heard the news, I
didn't know how to react.

82
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,242
I mean, how do you go
about something like that?

83
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,383
All they found of
him in the woods,

84
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,247
was his grizzled remains.

85
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:05,906
How do you live your life
after finding out that news?

86
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,048
And the worst part of it all,

87
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,050
is that no one would believe me.

88
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:16,296
Nobody believed anything I said.

89
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,471
Nobody knew what
had really happens.

90
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,714
- But obviously we do.

91
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,032
- Since then I was lost.

92
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:29,274
I didn't know what to do.

93
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,657
Then the Anacondas took me in,

94
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,453
just like a family.

95
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,525
They're a gang,

96
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:41,079
but I like to think of
them as more than that.

97
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,530
They're like a
brotherhood to me.

98
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,738
And they toughened me up.

99
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,292
I'm ready now.

100
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,126
If I see that
demon fucker again.

101
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,995
When I felt like
this was happening,

102
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,444
I knew I had to find you, Zeke.

103
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:07,036
If anybody knows this thing
well enough, it's you.

104
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,658
Nobody knows it better than you.

105
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:13,008
And together, I say
it's finally time

106
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:17,150
we put an end to this
thing, once and for all.

107
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,820
- Lynda's dead, man, I
was just at her house.

108
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
There's like ambulances outside.

109
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:47,827
When the evil last struck, it
went in alphabetical order.

110
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,725
That's how I knew
how to stop it.

111
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,244
Her last name is Prescott.

112
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:53,867
- Meaning?

113
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,974
- Meaning the pattern
must be different now.

114
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:58,251
Do you have your yearbook?

115
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:00,874
- Yeah, why?

116
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,394
- I need to take a look at it,

117
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,016
and we need to see if
there's something else

118
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,224
that we could go off of.

119
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:11,851
Prescott.

120
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:16,234
Prescott, look at this.

121
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,789
Art club, drama,

122
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:24,035
and let's see, let
me just make sure.

123
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:28,212
Roland, Roland and Charlotte,

124
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,041
I didn't really know
them, but look at that.

125
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,630
Band camp, art club.

126
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,358
Could it be?

127
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,914
- It's picking off artists.

128
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,091
- There's no way
to know for sure.

129
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,266
Guess we'll just
have to wait and see.

130
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,315
- Officer Campbell.

131
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,183
Lynda Prescott.

132
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:11,980
Two weeks ago,

133
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,672
it was Roland Hartley
and Charlotte Davenport.

134
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,329
That makes three
dead this month.

135
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,404
I think I know who
might've done this.

136
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:31,378
Sarge, what would you do?

137
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,213
I'm gonna find the
guy who did this.

138
00:19:27,373 --> 00:19:29,168
- What the fuck?

139
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,568
- So tell me
what's going on.

140
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,813
- I already told
the other officer this,

141
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:56,125
but I had nothing to do
with these deaths, okay?

142
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,473
I had premonitions,
I had these visions.

143
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:00,095
They alerted me to the pattern

144
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,718
and me and this girl,
I don't know her name,

145
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:06,274
we were able to stop
this evil force in time,

146
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:07,758
before it killed anybody else.

147
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,967
- Do you realize
how ludicrous that sounds?

148
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,313
- I don't
care how it sounds.

149
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:12,521
This is the way it is.

150
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,074
Okay, this girl, she's
gone missing now,

151
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,835
but we stopped this evil,

152
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,630
but I don't think
it's gone for good.

153
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,563
I think it could come
back at any time.

154
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,427
I think if you want to
do your job correctly,

155
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:23,877
you need to be out
there on patrol.

156
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,715
- We'll
see you next Sunday.

157
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,165
Thank you so much for coming.

158
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,519
- What's ailing you, Sister?

159
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,625
- Father Michaels, I didn't
know you were in today.

160
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,249
The truth is, I've been
feeling an awesome presence,

161
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,804
an evil presence rising.

162
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,806
These thoughts have
been troubling me.

163
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,225
I've felt this before,
but never so strong,

164
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:12,227
never so strong as this.

165
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:15,368
- Well, evil is always
right behind you,

166
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,474
closer than you might think,

167
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:21,823
residing over this town,
over you, and all of us.

168
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,584
- This concerns me deeply.

169
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:27,725
This is why you found
me deep in prayer.

170
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,351
Why are you wearing your
civilian clothes, Father?

171
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,249
- That's not important.

172
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,873
What's important is you
ignore these feelings,

173
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,599
and let God handle it.

174
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,601
He has a plan, all right.

175
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,465
- We need to do
something about this.

176
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,122
We have to warn the others.

177
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,365
I'll gather the Sisters.

178
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,642
We'll get everyone together.

179
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:50,576
Father, we need all the
help that we can get.

180
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:52,371
This could mean the end.

181
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,303
- I wouldn't do that.

182
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,865
- Shit, they keep piling up.

183
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:41,074
They're calling them
freak accidents.

184
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:43,042
Beyond them all being
involved in the arts,

185
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,665
I don't see any other
connection here.

186
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,253
- What do you want to do?

187
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,324
If that's all we
have to go off of,

188
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:51,878
I don't see how we're
gonna find out who's next.

189
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,536
- We'll just have
to warn the others.

190
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:57,366
You weren't involved in
any art programs, were you?

191
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:58,609
- No.

192
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,439
- Well I was, this is
very personal to me.

193
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:07,307
Wait, we're just gonna have to
go down the line of artists.

194
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:09,413
I say we go with Julia Lochley.

195
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,828
She was in my senior class.

196
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,175
She was in all the school
plays in the leads.

197
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:15,384
She'd be a prime target
for this evil force.

198
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,371
- Zeke, Jake, what
do you guys want?

199
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,476
- Can you just come
with us right now?

200
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
I'll explain later.

201
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,100
- Right now?

202
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:44,517
You better tell me what
this is about, Zeke.

203
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,349
Let me just grab something
and I'll be right out.

204
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:59,981
- This evil, the
fear, it's returned.

205
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:00,740
And I,

206
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,985
I think it's picking
off art students.

207
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:06,435
I know that doesn't make sense.

208
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:07,367
- Say no more.

209
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,679
I'll take your word for it.

210
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,511
But why return now?

211
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:16,584
Why is it so after
our graduating class?

212
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:17,446
Why art students?

213
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,829
- I mean, that's what
we got to figure out.

214
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,831
I seem to be lucky
in this situation,

215
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,453
or at least I was the last time.

216
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:28,216
I think if you
just stick with me,

217
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,391
we'll be safe enough
until we figure this out.

218
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,601
- Can I talk to you
for a minute, Zeke?

219
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,361
- Yeah, sure.

220
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,161
- Why her man?

221
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,645
Is this something personal?

222
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,647
There are others out
there being killed.

223
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:47,925
You just like her.

224
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,168
Admit it.

225
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:50,100
- Shut up.

226
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,654
No, maybe she's an asset.

227
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:54,760
- Or I delved into
the dark arts.

228
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,762
Yeah, it's kind of
a hobby I picked up,

229
00:25:56,762 --> 00:26:00,317
spell casting, curses, healing.

230
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:04,321
- She's an asset, right?

231
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,978
So you're either with
us or you're not.

232
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,223
- All right.

233
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:17,748
- Officer Campbell,

234
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:19,267
the chief wanted me
to get this to you.

235
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,166
It's a possible missing person
of one Thomas Emory, age 20,

236
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,824
and he was last seen
in the downtown area.

237
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:28,172
- Thank you.

238
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:34,040
Sergeant Mooney?

239
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,838
Keep a look out for a Tom Emory.

240
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:41,392
I think we might have
another suspect on our hands.

241
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:37,000
- You will soon come
to know the truth.

242
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,243
- Who are you?

243
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:43,731
Where's this being?

244
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,353
What is this place?

245
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:49,564
- Soon your questions
will be answered,

246
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,118
and you will understand it all.

247
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,706
- Jake, this isn't funny.

248
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:33,254
- Hmm.

249
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:40,951
What the?

250
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,823
- This thing beckoned
me last night.

251
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,065
I don't know if it was a dream

252
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:28,827
or if it was real, this place.

253
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,862
I don't even know what it is.

254
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,520
It's some decrepit old mansion.

255
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,866
- The Bellevue Manor.

256
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,075
- Wait, I've heard
something about that.

257
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:36,835
Bad omens.

258
00:30:38,181 --> 00:30:39,941
What's the significance?

259
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,979
- I don't know, but I think I
know somebody who would know,

260
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,635
and we have to go
to the high school.

261
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,988
So Professor Reinhardt, what
do you make of all this?

262
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:57,131
- Richard Charles Bellevue

263
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:59,650
was one of the
founders of our town.

264
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,549
Legend has it he was
into the dark arts

265
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:02,895
and wanted to bring forth

266
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,484
a cataclysmic forthcoming
of ancient evil.

267
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:08,728
It was he who built this school

268
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:12,008
on a cursed Indian
burial ground in 1885.

269
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:15,356
A hundred years later, the
curse was set to take place.

270
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,047
Your graduating class.

271
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:20,913
The curse was tied
to a figurehead,

272
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,604
a physical embodiment
that was tasked

273
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:25,918
with a specific deed,
a ghoul if you will.

274
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,991
Of course, the events
were set by the ghoul,

275
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,993
but obviously it
wasn't successful.

276
00:31:33,546 --> 00:31:38,241
- The, the seemingly random
nature of these new deaths,

277
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,657
and why they're happening
two years later,

278
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:42,590
what significance
does this have?

279
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:48,561
- I would guess the old
figurehead was cast out,

280
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:51,875
and a new one was unwillingly
chosen to carry on,

281
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,464
and the manner of the deaths
and the order they occur

282
00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:00,677
was set by whoever or whatever
is harboring this curse.

283
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,129
I'd be willing to
bet that this evil,

284
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,717
the rift, whence it has came,

285
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,410
has something to do
with Bellevue Manor.

286
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,756
- Well, should we go there?

287
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,349
- You can,

288
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,732
but I would proceed
with extreme caution.

289
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:27,152
You have no idea what
you're getting into.

290
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:31,328
That mansion has
evil everywhere.

291
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,958
- All right, so this Bellevue
guy, who built the Manor,

292
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,580
he also cursed the school.

293
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,340
And based on the fact

294
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,377
that I beat this thing
the first time around,

295
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:46,861
and especially
with these visions,

296
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:48,897
I obviously have some
connection with this evil.

297
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:51,624
- And I have a connection
with the dark arts.

298
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:53,592
I knew I heard something
about Bellevue.

299
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,941
I've definitely felt
something, it's so clear now,

300
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:00,254
something trying to reach me.

301
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,496
When I held a seance last night

302
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,222
I picked up on some
cryptic messages,

303
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:05,190
but I couldn't make
sense of it all.

304
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,227
- I can also kind
of feel the evil.

305
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,577
Just saying, so we all
know where we stand.

306
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,822
- The professor
said something like

307
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:20,032
this evil is emanating
from the Manor,

308
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,759
like it's some sort of
hub for the paranormal.

309
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,760
- Then we have to go there.

310
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,417
What are we waiting for?

311
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,005
- I mean, we need
to prepare for this.

312
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,214
You have like mystical items,

313
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:31,319
or anything you
can bring, spells.

314
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,665
- I'll see what I can find.

315
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,665
- Just for thirty
grand a semester.

316
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,498
I don't need art school.

317
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,467
Some of our greatest artists
never even went to art school.

318
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,905
Who's out there?

319
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:45,428
I am not in the mood for games
right now, show yourself!

320
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,918
Nice costume, really scary.

321
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,127
Now, who is it?

322
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,543
I'm gonna call the cops.

323
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,009
- It's time again, Zeke.

324
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:52,426
The puzzle will be complete.

325
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,962
- All right, guys, I'll
be out in a second.

326
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,375
- Authorities are baffled

327
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,102
as these strange deaths
continue to pile up.

328
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,278
Is this the work
of a method killer?

329
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,591
Channel 4 investigates.

330
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:56,902
- Don't forget your umbrellas

331
00:40:56,902 --> 00:40:59,042
if you're going outside tonight.

332
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,044
There's a possible storm.

333
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,918
- Hello?

334
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:15,818
- Hey Ken, it's Trixie,
what are you doing?

335
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,440
- Right now?

336
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,890
Nothing.

337
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,894
- Wrong, you're coming
over to my plate right now.

338
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,171
- What's the rush?

339
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:25,517
- You'll find out
hen you get here.

340
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,691
My roommate's out of town,

341
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:28,900
and we'll have the
place all to ourselves.

342
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,350
- Okay, I'll be right over.

343
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:56,479
- Laura Whitley?

344
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,310
Impaled by sticks?

345
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:03,831
God damn it.

346
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:08,526
And we're still no closer
to catching this bastard.

347
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:18,639
I'm not cut out for this job.

348
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,178
- What is writing,

349
00:42:40,178 --> 00:42:44,562
but a collection of
shapes that form words,

350
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:51,258
words which make sounds to
summate the complex constructs

351
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:55,607
that which cannot
be easily summed up.

352
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:03,097
Writing is but a
poor man's painting.

353
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:09,552
What the hell have I been doing?

354
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:34,991
Father, what brings you here?

355
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:37,373
- As you may have known,
some of your friends

356
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:40,756
have met their cruel and
mysterious demise as of late.

357
00:43:40,756 --> 00:43:42,274
This has troubled me.

358
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:43,621
I just thought I'd check in.

359
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,208
- Oh, thank you.

360
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,142
I'm fine, no mystery
or cruelty here.

361
00:43:49,523 --> 00:43:51,214
- One can never
be too sure, Sean.

362
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,804
By the way, what are you
doing on this fine day?

363
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:57,945
- Trying to get some
writing done, college essay,

364
00:43:57,945 --> 00:44:00,638
a writing essay about
writing essays, I guess.

365
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:04,365
- Writing an essay about
writing essays, you say?

366
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:07,990
- Yes, I say I'm
writing an essay.

367
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,406
Got to get back to it if
you don't mind, Father.

368
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:16,826
- Death will fall upon you.

369
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:19,484
And the wrath of evil itself
will envelop this town,

370
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:21,693
in an inescapable cloud
of death and destruction

371
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:24,282
no mortal has witnessed before.

372
00:44:54,346 --> 00:44:56,486
- Father, what are
you doing here?

373
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:03,286
- Oh Sean, I just thought
I'd lend you a hand.

374
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,579
- Trixie, you promised me.

375
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:56,546
- I promised nothing, Chad.

376
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,824
I just said, come over.

377
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,826
Your dirty mind came
to that conclusion.

378
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:03,346
- Come on, I took you
to see the Bangles,

379
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:05,866
and we can't even hook up?

380
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,663
- Fine, lay down.

381
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,492
I've got to go get
something real quick.

382
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:12,459
- All right.

383
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:22,089
- Stay right there.

384
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:22,987
- You got it.

385
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:25,679
- Are you ready?

386
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:26,749
- Absolutely.

387
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,534
- No, not my hat!

388
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:28,077
- All right guys,
this seems familiar to me.

389
00:48:28,077 --> 00:48:30,286
I think we just
keep going straight.

390
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:32,564
Yeah, I can feel something.

391
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:34,187
Something doesn't feel right.

392
00:48:36,844 --> 00:48:38,916
It should be the next left.

393
00:48:41,194 --> 00:48:42,298
I hope we're prepared.

394
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:01,939
- Here we are,
the hub of the evil.

395
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,148
I can feel its essence
like never before,

396
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:05,770
like a pressure on my forehead.

397
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,566
Zeke, do you feel anything?

398
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,397
- I can hear it.

399
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:13,295
It's beckoning us.

400
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:16,919
- We've got to go
inside, it's the only way.

401
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:18,576
Stay close, come on.

402
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:35,549
- Seek this way.

403
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:39,864
- Zeke, where you going?

404
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:42,004
This place is creepy, man.

405
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:48,010
Hey man, it's coming on.

406
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,391
What do you feel?

407
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:55,017
- Now I've got you mortals
right where I want you.

408
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:59,194
You will endure my wrath
as did the others before.

409
00:51:08,444 --> 00:51:09,859
- It was you the whole time.

410
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,901
- When I defeated the evil
the first time around,

411
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:18,799
it latched on to me,

412
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:22,148
feeding off my
subconscious, my insecurity,

413
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:23,597
using me as a catalyst,

414
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,533
lashing out at those
I felt threatened by.

415
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,227
I didn't know I harbored
this curse until now.

416
00:51:32,227 --> 00:51:34,263
I was always jealous
of you, Jake.

417
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:35,575
I was jealous of everyone.

418
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:40,476
But that thing out
there, that's not me.

419
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:43,065
It's an empty shell
harboring evil curse.

420
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:45,688
And if you want to
defeat this evil,

421
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:46,862
you must defeat me.

422
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,866
- I can't do that, man.

423
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:53,627
- You know what must be done.

424
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:55,560
I have to go now.

425
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:14,269
- Stay away from Jake.

426
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:17,755
I am the artist, I
am the one you want.

427
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:20,102
- Him first, he was a jock.

428
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:25,349
- Heretofore, I command
you to let this man go.

429
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:27,696
I banish you to the underworld.

430
00:52:27,696 --> 00:52:29,767
Zeke, fight it.

431
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:33,080
- Yeah, I'm not a jock, Zeke.

432
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,703
I just played
tennis for a while.

433
00:52:34,703 --> 00:52:36,083
- You're not helping.

434
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:38,431
Zeke, I know you're upset

435
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:40,640
you didn't get cast in that
play that you wanted to.

436
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,263
But this, this isn't you.

437
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:45,817
The omen is feeding off
of your insecurities.

438
00:52:45,817 --> 00:52:48,165
Try to separate yourself.

439
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:53,170
Evil spirits, I command thee
to the underworld for eternity.

440
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:55,310
Leave this world.

441
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,104
We must [indistinct].

442
00:52:57,104 --> 00:53:00,867
Let go of this body
you're possessing.

443
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:02,248
I banish thee.

444
00:53:02,248 --> 00:53:03,421
I banish thee.

445
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,460
Get back to whence you came.

446
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:10,877
You will not claim another.

447
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,882
I banish you to
the great beyond.

448
00:53:15,882 --> 00:53:17,539
Leave this world.

449
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:22,302
Leave it in peace, let go
of this body you possess.

450
00:53:22,302 --> 00:53:24,753
I banish thee, I banish thee!

451
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,322
Holy shit, it worked.

452
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:43,599
Let's get outta here now.

453
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,266
- Officer Campbell,

454
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,302
there's been a fire
at the Bellevue Manor.

455
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:32,579
Possible arsonist.

456
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:33,408
- I'm on it.

457
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:39,379
God.

458
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,833
Cheryl, hold all my calls.

459
00:54:48,457 --> 00:54:50,770
Has anybody found a lead
on this Thomas Emory?

460
00:54:53,255 --> 00:54:54,083
Anybody?

461
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:09,478
My God.

462
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:25,839
- I know Julia, but he's gone.

463
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,463
I can't just bring him
back with your magic.

464
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:29,326
It's over.

465
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,988
You're right.

466
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:41,268
He wouldn't have wanted
it to be like this.

467
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:42,684
We gotta keep his memory alive,

468
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:43,995
that's the least I can do.

469
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:50,001
I know, don't worry
about me, I'll be fine.

470
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:53,246
I gotta go pay my respects now.

471
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,078
Yeah.

472
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:05,879
I really appreciate you
talking me through all this.

473
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:07,191
Your a good friend, Julia.

474
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,194
People like us gotta
stick together.

475
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:12,817
Always.

476
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,270
Bye.

477
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:00,140
Hey Zeke.

478
00:57:02,177 --> 00:57:03,661
It's your old friend, Jake.

479
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:06,181
I really miss you, man.

480
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:11,082
Brought you some stuff.

481
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:16,363
The school yearbook, I
got everyone to sign it.

482
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:19,505
Well, actually they
insisted on signing it.

483
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:23,336
Everybody missed you, a lot.

484
00:57:30,654 --> 00:57:32,000
And I got you a mix tape.

485
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,485
I made this just for you.

486
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,350
It's got all your
favorite hits on it.

487
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:40,111
I know you really
liked the Ramones.

488
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:51,398
I got you something here, too.

489
00:57:52,986 --> 00:57:55,713
Through the darkness,
He will find you.

490
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,959
Shed the guilt, the
curse that binds you.

491
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:04,757
Now in death, you
are free to rest.

492
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,655
You gave your life,

493
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:09,416
so there's no evil left.

494
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:21,670
We did it Zeke.

495
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,948
It's over.

496
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:27,434
You can finally rest now.

497
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:49,802
- Continuing from our report earlier,

498
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,355
we've been getting
calls all day,

499
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:53,495
and authorities have issued
a state of emergency.

500
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:54,876
Reports of strange happenings,

501
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,912
murders, and appearance
suicides, flooding in,

502
00:58:56,912 --> 00:59:00,157
as ominous clouds form
over residential areas.

503
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:02,642
Remain indoors, as we honestly

504
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:06,059
have never seen anything
like this before.

505
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:07,889
- That is beautiful.

506
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:09,511
- Not as beautiful as your eyes.

507
00:59:10,477 --> 00:59:11,755
- These eyes?

508
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:13,860
- Yes, those eyes.

509
00:59:20,902 --> 00:59:22,938
- I told you all.

510
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:26,528
I told you all it was happening
and you didn't believe me.

511
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,737
I told you .

512
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:33,846
All I've done.

513
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,262
There's nothing left for us.

514
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:39,127
I said it was coming.

515
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:40,887
I told you all.

516
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,303
I screamed it from
the top of my lungs,

517
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:44,960
the top of the head.

518
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,827
- Oh my God, he was
right the whole time.

519
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,785
- Officer Campbell?

520
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:18,925
Officer Campbell, come
in Officer Campbell.

521
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,690
- Chief, I don't know what the
fuck is going on out there,

522
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,176
but that's why I'm down
here in my basement, okay?

523
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:31,697
I'm in my own goddamn
basement, okay?

524
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:32,974
What I thought was one incident

525
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:35,459
turned into a string
of incidents, Chief.

526
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:37,219
You gave me one simple case,

527
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:39,912
and now it's just turned
into this fucking hell.

528
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:44,157
That's why I'm down
in my basement,

529
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:47,471
because I'm gonna wait
until hell blows over.

530
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:51,786
And then when it does, I'll
come back out and I'll see.

531
01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:53,546
I'll see all the
damage it's done.
