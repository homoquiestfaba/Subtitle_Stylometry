[tape whirling]

2
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:20,281
- Hello, I'm Sasha Neulinger,
the host of "Shit Diaries,"

3
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,154
and today our lovely
guest will be...

4
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,593
Excuse me, what are you doing?

5
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,728
What are you doing, Bekah?

6
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:36,253
[soft instrumental music]

7
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:57,622
I don't wanna curse
to my parents.

8
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,016
I don't wanna be
mean to my parents.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,323
And I don't wanna
hate my parents.

10
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,069
You know how you
have a nightmare

11
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,505
and you wish you could go back

12
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:12,246
and change what happened
in the nightmare?

13
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,682
[Sasha screaming]

14
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,205
- [Boy] Look at me.
- [Sasha yelling] I'm sorry

15
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,077
I did something bad, okay?

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,777
In the moment, when the footage
actually was being filmed,

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,474
I hated life.

18
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,521
I know vaguely how
I got to this place,

19
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,741
but there are pieces
that are missing.

20
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:34,355
It's a puzzle made from my life

21
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:37,706
and I feel like I have to
put that puzzle back together

22
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,100
if I'm ever going
to really move on.

23
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:44,278
[soft instrumental music]

24
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,934
The real Sasha,

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,071
the four-year-old Sasha,
is coming back.

26
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:56,768
[tape whirring]

27
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,907
[hospital machines beeping]

28
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,432
- [Jacqui] Late in my pregnancy

29
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,695
I started having
a medical problem

30
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,481
so I found myself a month
earlier than expected

31
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,309
in the hospital being monitored

32
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:19,226
and we came to this moment
where there was no choice,

33
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,141
but to have the child.

34
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,968
I've called my husband
and asked him to come

35
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,187
because we're
gonna have the baby

36
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:28,496
and he's not there, and
my parents come down,

37
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,193
my sister comes in.

38
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,500
I've got family around me.

39
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:34,502
There are people there,
but still no Henry.

40
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:38,332
Everybody's wondering,
is Henry okay?

41
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,291
Hours and hours and hours
and hours are passing

42
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:45,861
and finally Henry
showed up, and turns out

43
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:48,080
Henry had gone to
buy a video camera.

44
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,823
- [Henry] We're rolling.

45
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,217
- [Jacqui] Hi, hello,
you're making a face,

46
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,697
what's the matter?

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,831
The camera immediately
became a wall

48
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,485
between Henry and the family.

49
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,488
- [Henry] Does he
look like his mom?

50
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:08,231
- It was something that
became intrusive to me

51
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,235
because it was constant
and it felt to me

52
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,281
like I lost my husband.

53
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:17,588
My husband disappeared
into this lens.

54
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,423
- [Netta with Accent]
Jacqui, are you walking away?

55
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,338
What's the matter, honey?
Why don't you come here?

56
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,297
I would like to see you.
- [Henry] She's over there.

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,212
- You know I'm
not in this video.

58
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,387
- [Henry] She's
not in this video.

59
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,303
- Henry, turn it around.

60
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,826
- [Netta] Is it?
- [Henry] Oh.

61
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,829
- He is laying here now.

62
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,309
- [Henry] There you go.
- Very good.

63
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,527
- [Henry] Well this is...
- Jacqui, what's the matter?

64
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:44,876
- [Jacqui] Nothing,
this is your time.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,269
- [Henry] Grandpa, what
does it mean for you

66
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,532
to have a great-grandchild?

67
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,534
- Heaven.
- [Henry] Happy?

68
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:53,450
- That's the only way
I can express, heaven.

69
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,017
- [Netta] That's
right, that's right.

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,932
- [Henry] What did you feel the
first time you ever saw him,

71
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:57,846
how did you feel?

72
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,240
- I nearly fainted.

73
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,459
[laughing]

74
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,722
- [Netta] Look at that.

75
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:05,984
It's wonderful.

76
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,206
- [Henry] This is the world's
most documented family.

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,773
- [Jacqui] Coming
from both sides.

78
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,473
- [Henry in baby voice]
Hello, hello.

79
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,087
Hello?

80
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,134
- [Bubbie] Then bring it.

81
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,091
- [Woman] Oh I'm sorry.

82
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,441
- [Bubbie] Well yes and no.

83
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:36,101
â™ª Happy birthday to you

84
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:38,103
- Here he is.

85
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:39,540
[child babbling]

86
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,846
- Daddy, it's all
finished now, of the tape.

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,718
Now, take the tape out.

88
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,763
- [Henry] You want no me to
take your picture anymore?

89
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,461
- No.
- Why?

90
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,550
- I just don't want you to.

91
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:50,986
- [Henry] What do
you want me to do?

92
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,379
[static buzzing]

93
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:02,476
- Why do you have
all of this footage?

94
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,826
- Yeah, you know what, it's
just stuff I've accumulated

95
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,916
over the years
and I got into it.

96
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,048
And I don't know some of the
people that are in these films

97
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,790
because some of them aren't
marked, but to me I felt like

98
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,183
these were people's lives.

99
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:16,707
Somebody took the time to record

100
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,014
what they were in their lives.

101
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,320
Their happy moments.

102
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,799
That's what home movies were.

103
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:24,193
It wasn't, you didn't
film things that were bad.

104
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,716
You took out the movie camera

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,283
'cause there was a celebration,

106
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,285
because there was a trip,
because there was a party

107
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,635
and that, every time
I videotaped you guys

108
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,508
it was all that,
except in the background

109
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:39,556
stuff was going on and now when
I look at them, I see that.

110
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,645
[child mumbling]

111
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,778
- [Grandpa] Right here, you
want to come up and get it?

112
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,388
- Commercial, a little x-rated,

113
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,303
let's, mixed company, let's go.

114
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,828
[soft instrumental music]

115
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,096
- [Jacqui] Henry and Larry,

116
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,098
they played off each
other really well,

117
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,058
but it was almost like
a performance piece.

118
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:05,060
- We've always been
hooked as brothers.

119
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,804
- [Jacqui] Larry was
Sasha's godfather.

120
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,632
That was Henry's choice.

121
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,329
It was his brother.

122
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,679
I don't think that Howard
was pleased about it.

123
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,469
- [Henry] My brother
Howard was the first born.

124
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,646
My brother Larry was
born five years later

125
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,735
and then I was born 1955.

126
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,915
There was no question in my mind

127
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,657
that my brother Howard
was my mother's favorite.

128
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,617
He was this budding opera star.

129
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,706
I would go to see him in
operas and we would all go

130
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,013
and Howard would get
written up in the newspaper

131
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:45,927
and his picture taken.

132
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,059
Wow, that voice and his demeanor

133
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,627
and his like, strength
of character on stage.

134
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,586
He was a dramatic and
he was very strong

135
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,239
and he had this
deep baritone voice.

136
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,111
He was like somebody
to be reckoned with.

137
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:59,984
[singing in foreign language]

138
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,384
[instrumental piano music]

139
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,872
- Henry's the first
Jewish man I ever dated.

140
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,221
My parents had always said

141
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,571
you're gonna marry a Jewish man.

142
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:22,920
He was living in Maine.

143
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:26,837
He was creating programming
for PBS up there.

144
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,450
I was living in Philadelphia.

145
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,060
I was a graphic designer.

146
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,323
- [Henry] I loved
her creativity,

147
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,499
her intellectual capacity.

148
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,501
We could have these really
interesting discussions

149
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,763
about anything.

150
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,679
- We moved into it
really rather fast.

151
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,295
- Let's hear it for the chef.

152
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,474
[people cheering]

153
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,999
Jacqui was born on
Thursday, July 20th, 1961,

154
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,567
and in the headlines,
NASA put man in space,

155
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,004
commander Alan Shepard Junior
makes suborbital flight.

156
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,181
- [Sasha] What was the
time like for you then?

157
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,399
Was it a happy time?

158
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,406
- [Jacqui] There was
just so much happening.

159
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,713
We built this organic
garden in the back

160
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,889
and we were growing our own food

161
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,891
and I mean it was really nice.

162
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:25,287
It felt like it was just
this amazing, big playground

163
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,289
where everybody could be happy.

164
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,725
We were renovating that house.

165
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,294
We were starting
a business successfully.

166
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,991
The fabric of life,

167
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,732
there was a lot
that was beautiful.

168
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,212
It was early.

169
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,564
- [Henry] Before Sasha was
born, we wanted to find a place

170
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,653
where there were good schools

171
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,830
and some greenery around
our house, some open space.

172
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,703
- [Jacqui] In the 1800s
they had built a railroad

173
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,008
and the railroad would go out

174
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,402
to what were the
Philadelphia suburbs.

175
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,709
- People wouldn't go near
this house that we saw

176
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,188
because it was
kind of overgrown

177
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,800
and you looked in the window,
it hadn't been painted

178
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:02,498
or anything done in 30 years.

179
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,022
And Jacqui and I looked at
it and we saw through that.

180
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,372
We saw what the potential was.

181
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,028
- [Man] Have you heard

182
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,335
about [people chattering
drowns out man].

183
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,510
- [Man] Yeah.

184
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,296
- [Henry] Suddenly
we found ourselves

185
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,342
kind of like the meeting house,

186
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,649
the meeting place
for the family.

187
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,521
â™ª I love you

188
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,743
â™ª Words wouldn't
come in an easy way â™ª

189
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,745
[people cheering]

190
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,529
- [Henry] We had
this beautiful home,

191
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,270
and this yard, and this porch.

192
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,706
It was bliss.

193
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,709
It was like, and everything
was like a fairy tale.

194
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,319
How are you?

195
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,886
Can you tell us
who we have there?

196
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,887
Who is that?

197
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,149
- Rebekah.

198
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,760
- [Henry] Rebekah,
and who is Rebekah?

199
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,066
- Rebekah.

200
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,068
- [Henry] And who is she?

201
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,069
- Rebekah Anne.

202
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,244
- [Henry] Is it your sister?

203
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,638
- Bekah was born shortly after

204
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:58,032
we moved into the
house in Rosemont

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,862
and Sasha was really delighted.

206
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:05,605
He was so joyful to
have a little sister.

207
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:10,392
He couldn't wait to come home
from play dates or day care

208
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:14,962
and run to find her
and run to be with her.

209
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:18,400
â™ª Don't cry, don't
cry, don't cry â™ª

210
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:21,359
[soft piano music]

211
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,756
It's all gone.

212
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,149
Sasha was an
extraordinary child.

213
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,760
He was very interactive,
he was very present.

214
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,589
- Yeah.

215
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,505
- We love you.

216
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,116
- You love me.
- I love you very much.

217
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,162
- And my daddy does.
- Yes he does.

218
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,772
There was a time early on,

219
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,211
Sasha was a very little boy,
and he said to me one morning,

220
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:50,345
he said, "Mom, I chose
you to be my mother

221
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:52,477
"because you're the person
who can help me become

222
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,566
"the person that
I'm supposed to be."

223
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,526
And I'm looking at
him and thinking,

224
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,441
wow, what does he mean?

225
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,704
He was a little kid.

226
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
Then he paused and he
said, "And I had to wait

227
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,667
"a really long time for you
because you weren't ready."

228
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,147
â™ª Miss America

229
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:14,151
- [Jacqui] He was an
unusual child, very intense,

230
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,066
very focused and very joyful.

231
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,241
- [Henry] Sasha,
you're on TV now.

232
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,418
- Can I see? Can I see?

233
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,421
- [Sasha] I would like to see.

234
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:24,335
- [Woman] Scoot back.

235
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:26,729
Ready?

236
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,079
Swing.

237
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,386
- [Jacqui] There was a
tremendous change in Sasha

238
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,519
between kindergarten
and first grade.

239
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,826
In kindergarten they
called me into school

240
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,133
and told me that they've done
some standardized testing

241
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:43,267
and that Sasha had scored at
an extraordinary high level.

242
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,269
The teacher said that he
clearly was gonna need

243
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:49,012
special support because
of his incredible gifts.

244
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,622
[children chattering]

245
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,409
By the following year, Sasha
was increasingly struggling

246
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,977
being able to read or write.

247
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,501
He was quickly moved
into a support system

248
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,895
for kids that were
not keeping up.

249
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,766
Sasha didn't want to
go to school anymore.

250
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,337
He started to have episodes
where he would seem withdrawn.

251
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,034
- [Henry] All right, let me
see your real mask now, Sasha.

252
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,209
What about your real face?

253
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,385
Here it comes.

254
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:20,565
- Those trains are really doing
some damage work out there

255
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,045
come from city to city.

256
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,307
- [Henry] Yeah, what do
you think they're doing?

257
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,787
What do you think
they're carrying?

258
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:27,529
- I think they're carrying
lots of stuff serious.

259
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:28,399
Medicines.

260
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,057
- So why, when the
first thing happened,

261
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,798
why didn't you come
to me and tell me?

262
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,714
Certainly you felt safe and
you felt that I loved you

263
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,629
and you knew that I
would protect you.

264
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,456
- I didn't.

265
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:42,936
- I mean you can see it.

266
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:47,027
- Me right there in that
moment, I had never been abused.

267
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,247
After I was abused
and I walked downstairs

268
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,684
with my abuser

269
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:59,256
after it had all happened,
the first thing was

270
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,172
you offered him food
and gave him a hug.

271
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,826
- [Jacqui] But we
didn't know what he did.

272
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,307
- I didn't, I was
just a little kid.

273
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,967
[fireworks exploding]

274
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,276
Dad, get the video camera.

275
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,279
- [Henry] What do
you think I'm doing?

276
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:26,283
He started asking for the camera
as he got older more often

277
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,503
than me just showing
up with the camera.

278
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,984
He started to see
that the video camera

279
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:34,074
wasn't just something that
you recorded happy times,

280
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,684
but it was a tool.

281
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,425
- And do a close action,

282
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,296
make it look like
I'm really far up.

283
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,776
- [Henry] Climbing up
the mountain, oh my God!

284
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,431
"Dad, take the camera and
I wanna say something."

285
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:44,736
Come here a minute.

286
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,521
- Let me tell you where
I want him to be buried.

287
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,132
- Tell us what we're doing.
- Look, right here.

288
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,395
We're having a funeral
for my guinea pig.

289
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,745
Why can't we open it up and see?

290
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,008
I'm not gonna remember
him like that.

291
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,096
- [Henry] We don't
wanna open up.

292
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,662
- It's my guinea pig.

293
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:58,881
- [Henry] I know,
but it's not good

294
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,404
for you to look at him
now, okay, trust me.

295
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,884
- It's all right, dad.
- Trust me.

296
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,973
- It's all right.
- It's three against one.

297
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,628
- Yes, Sasha.
- How about we

298
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,977
all shut our eyes

299
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,893
because I want him
to be like in there,

300
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,592
not with the box 'cause he
needs to like take the plants

301
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,116
and the veins up with him.

302
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,900
- Yeah.
- In other words,

303
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,336
he doesn't think he
should be in a box,

304
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,772
he should be planted
in the earth?

305
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,252
- Yeah.
- And go back to the earth

306
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,514
like naturally?

307
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,430
- Yeah, why do you wanna
bury someone in a box.

308
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,824
- I order you to put
him back in the earth.

309
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,043
The earth is
- The box is--

310
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,261
how he was made.

311
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,220
The earth, Mother Earth.

312
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:34,656
- A box is like

313
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,875
a thousand times smaller.
- I just feel like

314
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,180
that's really good for him.

315
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,747
- [Henry] Tell me why,
explain that to me.

316
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:44,144
- I order him to be
buried without the box.

317
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,972
The freedom to be
feeling the plants.

318
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,234
- [Henry] Here's the box.

319
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,758
- Shall we take him
out and put him in?

320
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,499
He was a great guinea pig.

321
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,458
[guitar strumming]

322
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,245
- [Henry] Justin, son of Sasha.

323
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:02,814
â™ª I can't get no satisfaction

324
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:05,992
â™ª But I try, try, try

325
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,607
[static buzzing]

326
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,218
- It was across there.

327
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:16,437
[soft instrumental music]

328
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,875
It was so huge

329
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,447
and grown with the
leaves to the ground.

330
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,058
I don't know whether
it is still alive,

331
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,320
it's been a lot of years.

332
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,888
- Did you,

333
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,586
did you pick the tree
or did I pick it?

334
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,461
- I think you went
over to play in it.

335
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,250
You were at day care

336
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,296
and I came to pick you
up one day from day care

337
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,558
and we went home

338
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,647
and I gave you a bath
and I put you in the tub

339
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,823
and you started crying the
minute you hit the water

340
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:58,479
and what you said was,
"There's swords in my penis."

341
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,785
And there was an
abrasion on your penis.

342
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,439
So I called the pediatrician

343
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,137
and I took you
right to the office.

344
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,529
You wouldn't say anything.

345
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,402
All you would say was,
"Another boy pinched me."

346
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:10,621
I said to him,

347
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:16,497
"Is there any chance
that there's an adult

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,544
that is acting
inappropriately with Sasha?"

349
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:23,504
He said, "You don't
wanna open that door."

350
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,505
- This is the doctor saying?

351
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,028
- The doctor said to me.

352
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,335
He said, "If you open this
door and we report this,

353
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,641
"they're gonna, they're
gonna come to your house.

354

"They're gonna remove your
husband from the house.

"This is gonna become public.

356

"It's gonna be terrible
for your family.

open this door."

[soft piano music]

359
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,087
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

360
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,745
It's not a willow,
but a weeping something.

361
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,573
I think it's a weeping cherry.

362
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,359

[birds chirping]

364
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,976
- Why did we come to this tree?

365
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,025
- You were becoming increasingly

366
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,418
dangerous to yourself.

367
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:11,378
Like, we'd be driving and
you would open the door

368
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,683
and try and jump out.

369
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,209
You were expressing
that something was awful

370
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,647
and you didn't want
to continue living.

371
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,998
So that's why we came here.

372
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,436
It was completely free from
any possible connection

373
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,916
to what might have happened.

374
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,485
I said, "You know that good
people do good things?"

375
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,008
and you said, "Yeah,"

376
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,183
and I said, "And you know

377
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,837
"that bad people
can do bad things."

378
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,404
And you said, "Yeah."

379
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,798
and I said, "Well, sometimes
bad people do good things."

380
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,235
and you kinda looked
at me and I said,

381
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:45,716
"And sometimes good
people do bad things."

382
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,242
And you looked at me and said,
"Are you gonna kill me now?"

[soft instrumental music]

384
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,510

[humming]

386
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,125
- [Henry] What's your name?

387
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,692
- Hey, get to the movie!

388
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,607
But I'm not normal.

389
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,738
- [Henry] You're not normal?

390
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,000
- Yeah.
- Why?

391
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,699
- Because my name
is Squeegee Luigi

392
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:12,569
'cause I go like this.

393
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,227
- Sasha, do you wanna go to...?
- Bekah,

394
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,447
get out of the movie!

395
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,102
- Do you wanna go to the dog?

396
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,148
- I'm in a movie theater.

397
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,454
- [Henry] Go get the dog.

398

[Sasha screaming]

399
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,548

400
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,899
- Sorry.

401
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,074
Sorry.

402
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,729
I'm sorry I did
something bad, okay?!

[wipers swiping]

404
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,050

a cup of espresso.

405
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,096
- Yeah, sure.

406
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,923
- You want espresso?
- Sure.

407
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,577
- I can even do a latte.

408
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,406
- Actually I'm really
into soy lattes right now.

409
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,277
- Oh my God, really?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,497
- Well, I'm not
politically correct.

411
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,020
I don't use soy.

412
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,021
- It's not about politics.

413
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:13,978
- I know.
- It's about

414
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,154
not wanting dairy.

415
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,459
- I have a soy latte.

416
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:17,852
- You got the judgment...
- Free range milk.

417
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:21,421
- On the soy latte people?
- No, no, no.

418
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:24,728
If you're gonna have coffee,

419
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,252
have it with some
cream for God sakes.

420
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,169
- So how are you?

421
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:32,649
- Well, let's see,

422
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,869
it's like this whole
revisiting all of this

423
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:40,918
has kinda displaced me,
and it's kind of like,

424
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,878
it's been a struggle to keep
track of where I am today

425
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:49,275
and having to revisit the past,
so that we can talk about it...

426
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:53,235
it's caused me some
depression and some anger.

427
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,020
I start to feel
like it reminds me.

428
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,109
I feel like I'm slipping back.

[soft instrumental music]

430
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,947
When I think about my mother,
I was sort of tolerated

431
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,474
more than loved.

432
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:21,220
My mother was
inaccessible emotionally.

433
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:26,442
She compensated by
being very gregarious.

434
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,096
- Do they know how to make love?

435
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,011

â™ª In the army now, woo

438

- You know it works both ways.

440
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,020
- [Henry] But when there
weren't people around.

441
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,543
- Are you not
talking about that?

442
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,286
- All I can remember is my
mother berating my father

443
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,724
every single day of his life.

444
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:51,946
She ridiculed him,
emasculated him,

445
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,775
and he just stood there
and took it.

446
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,996
My father hated confrontation.

447
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,304
My mother, she avoided
anything emotional.

becoming kind of like a joker.

two nuts like that in your life?

456
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,032

457
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,776
I could make people laugh
and I could be somebody else.

me another funny face.

to make a small adjustment

painful on reentry.

do the string now.

Why don't you go shoot
something that's interesting

instead of me?

477
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,784
I got a call at the office

478
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:33,264
from a therapist he
was seeing at the time

479
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,919

come over here right now.

This was important.

00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,227
I remember walking
into that office

482
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,708
and he never made
contact, eye contact.

483
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,188
Dr. Vogelson, I went
to shake his hand.

484
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,669
He kinda acted
like, it was weird.

485
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,454
It's like wouldn't you
like look at somebody

486
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,629
that comes into your office

487
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,195
and at least acknowledge
they're, you know?

488
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,414
So he was acting
very strange to me.

489
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,373
I said, okay, whatever.

490
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,158
Sat down and then, of course,
he proceeded to tell me

491
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:00,640
that you said some things
and that they implied

492
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:03,643
that something happened to
you by someone in the family.

493
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,905
- Sexually?

494
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,428
- Something sexually
happened to him.

495
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:09,170
He's been abused sexually
and you're the prime suspect

496

at this time.

497
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,694
He kept looking at
me very strangely.

498
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:14,218
"I suggest that you
have an attorney.

499
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,698
I suggest that you have
a lie detector test."

00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,483
It was like he--

00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,746
He says, "My job is
to protect your son"

502
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,097
and he threatened to say if
they thought I was a threat

503
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,534
that they would have me
removed from the house.

504
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,798
I was shit because I
was the prime suspect.

- Loser.

- Loser.

00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,430
I remember being in my
bedroom watching the ink

512
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:55,259
kind of spill into the
fabric as I was writing.

513

kitchen with those as a mask

over your head.

You wore this part
more like around your,

00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,877
under your mouth and this
came up over your head.

517
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,490
Yeah, like that.

518
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:09,970
- Oh my God.

519
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:10,884
- Yep.

520
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,627
- Oh my God.
- But you were little

521
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,150
and it covered your eyes then

522
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,065
and I asked you to take
it off and you wouldn't

523
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,240
and you got a knife

524
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,721
and you were threatening
to kill yourself.

525
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,810
I remember Stewart was like,
come on, dude, take it off.

526
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:25,812
Come on, and he was
like really pushing you

527
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,728
to not do this.

528
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:35,038
- My nephew Stewart,
Larry's second son,

529
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:38,128
he was discharged
from the Air Force

530
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:42,829
and he wanted to go back
and live with his parents.

531
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:47,834
Well, his mom had remarried
and his step-father said,

532
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,444
"No, you can't come back here.

533
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,446
"When I was 18 I was
thrown out of the house.

534
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,274
"You're a man now,
you're not coming home."

535
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,406
So Stewart came to live
with us for a few months

536
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,104
and he helped me
around the house.

537
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,498
He was very happy
to watch the kids.

538
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,239
- I was outside having a
softball catch for a while.

539

542
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,084

543
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,087

[sorrowful instrumental music]

545
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,290
- Is that everything?

546
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:56,119
- That, these are my
complete medical records.

547
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,513
- Of our time.

548
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,604
- Of your treatment with me.

549
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,738
- Okay.
- Or our encounters.

550
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,131
- Our encounters.

551
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,568
10 years of encounters.

552
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:11,831
- When I first saw Sasha

553
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,399
he was a cute little boy

554
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:22,581
whose parents were
confused and desperate

555
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:27,324
and the boy himself was
spewing vituperation, anger.

556
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,332
Whatever the problem was
that you were having,

557
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:38,466
it was very deep

558
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,471
and you weren't saying a lot.

559
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:49,564
A child often is not
able to express in words

560
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,655
what sort of dysfunction
they're experiencing.

561
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,657
They usually show it
in their behavior.

562
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:03,970
It's really helpful to ask
the child to draw pictures.

563
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,667
- I did not get any attention

564
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,931
and there's, I don't even know
what these creatures are.

565
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:10,716
They're like angry dogs maybe.

566
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,503
- Anything on the back?

567
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,592
- Let's see.

568
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,508
This is a picture of how
I felt when I wanted to

569
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,510
jump out of the window.

570
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:25,992
So Bekah, Mom and Dad are
together and I'm alone.

571
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,124
It's not that I didn't get love,

572
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,822
it's that I didn't feel lovable.

573
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:36,959
Oh!

574
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:44,619
- We left Dr. Lustig's
place, one afternoon,

575
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,577
we got into the car, you
were both in the back seat

576
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:50,451
and Bekah started crying
and I turned around

577
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:54,716
and she was screaming and
you were grabbing her chest

578
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,676
and I said, "Stop that,
what are you doing?"

579
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,591
And you said, "I'm
doing a titty twister."

580
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,724
And Bekah was hysterical
crying at that point.

581
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:06,380
You said, "Bekah has a
private club with Stewart

582
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,425
"and if I were you, I'd
wanna know what was going on

583
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,601
"in that private club."

584
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,691
That was all that you said,
and you didn't touch her again

585
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,301
the whole way home.

586
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:20,263
So we sit down and
I said to Bekah,

587
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:23,310
"Sasha said that you have a
private club with Stewart."

588
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,746
And she said, "Yep."

589
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,879
And I said, "Okay, what
happens in the club?"

590
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,489
She said, "I can't say it."

591
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:29,359
[laughing]

592
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,013
She was so little, Sasha.

593
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,624
And I said, "Could you draw it?"

594
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,322
And she said, "Yep."

595
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,890
So I got her a piece
of paper and a pen.

596
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:41,676
- I was just coming
down the stairs

597
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,725
and I remember my brother
kind of came around the corner

598
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,206
and I locked eyes with him
and I was just terrified

599
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,992
and at that moment
I knew that he knew.

600
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,995
No words were exchanged.

601
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:58,998
[soft piano music]

602
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,755
While the abuse would happen,
it would, for the most part,

603
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,061
be in his room in the attic

604
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,064
and there was this
picture of a cat.

605
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,762
I would just look
at this picture.

606
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,635
I would feel everything
that was happening,

607
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:32,553
him touching me, penetrating
me, making me touch him,

608
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:36,513
but I would still just
be lost in that picture.

609
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,300
I wasn't even present,
I wasn't there.

610
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,692
My mind wasn't there.

611
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,575
Someone turned the lights out.

612
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:01,800
You know, it was scary
for me to draw that picture

613
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:06,500
and tell her, but
at the same time,

614
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:09,851
I felt like in a way
death would be better

615
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:12,549
than having to endure that.

616
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,733
I don't think I've
ever said that.

617
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:26,346
Ever in my life,
not even to Doc.

618
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:27,651
But it's the truth.

my sister was going through.

This is what I, these are
the images I saw in my mind.

626
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:27,146
The only reason I felt
comfortable starting

627
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:30,323
to even talk about what
was happening to me

628
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,502
was because I felt
obligated to tell my parents

629
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,374
or hint to my parents what
was happening to my sister.

630
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:41,987
I knew that Bekah was the most
beautiful person in the world

631
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,945
and if he was doing that to her,

632
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,121
then maybe what he
was doing is wrong

633
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:50,343
and also, I don't want him
to do it to her anymore.

634
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:54,869

courage to talk to my mom

Not exactly what was going on,

but kind of beat around the bush

638
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,443
and said you should
talk to Bekah.

639
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:06,794
And I just remember after that,

640
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,929

kind of exploded.

00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,666

Elevator, second floor.

700

[water pouring into cup]

701
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,721
- [Woman] Terry breaking.

702
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,158
- [Man] Okay.

703
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,073
- [Man] It's not like--

704
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,469
- October 29th, 1998,

705
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,340
your parents came into
the police station.

706
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,995
They laid out this
general timeline

707
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:59,304
and I just sat there
like, oh boy, oh geez.

708
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,653
This is gonna be a mess.

709
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:01,610
You know?

710
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,133
Realistically.

711
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,526
Okay, you have all
this information.

712
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,181
Now what do you do?

713
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,011
We have Larry, we have
Stewart and we have Howard.

714
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:14,275
Howard was in New York City.

715
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,537
That would create its
own set of problems.

716
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,496
He's a cantor in
Temple Emanu-El.

717
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,846
It's the largest
synagogue in the world.

718
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,240
Every mover and shaker
in New York is there.

719
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,937
It's a high profile place.

720
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,722
[singing in foreign language]

721
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,463
The guy sang for the pope.

722
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:32,250
He's well respected, and to
lock up somebody like that,

723
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,774
you have to start getting
all your ducks in a row.

724
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,782
Stewart, Stewart was MIA.

725
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,305
He was somewhere, but
nobody knew where he was.

726
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,263
He was around the area.

727
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,176
I would get to him.

728
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,917
Larry, I knew where Larry was.

729
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,571
He lived about an hour away.

730
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,139
So I went up to see him.

731
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,445
- What are you doing?
- Who's that?

732
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:54,750
[people chattering]

733
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,144
- I'll say, who in
the world are you?

734
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,146
- Just showed up cold on a whim.

735
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,756
He could have slammed
the door in my face.

736
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,368
We talked to him
and confronted him

737
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,718
with the issues
about abusing you

738
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,375
and he was adamant
that this didn't happen.

739
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,507
No, you got the wrong guy

740
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,205
and he said, "Give me
a polygraph examination.

741
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,425
"I wanna take a polygraph exam."

742
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,036
He doesn't do too well
so we just tell him

743
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,734
he really didn't do
too well and it's time

744
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,692
to maybe clear the air,

745
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,521
and his lips started quivering

746
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,611
and he basically told the truth.

747
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,134
He confessed.

748
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,180
It was like a burden was
lifted off his shoulders.

749
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:38,751
[kids yelling in distance]

750
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,710
[door slamming]

751
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:42,581
- Wow.

752
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:55,594
- I'm Lawrence Nevison
from BBC Broadcasting.

753
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,596
I'm here, I'm
feeling rather well.

754
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:04,559
- The television
would be running

755
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:09,216
and every Sunday night
my parents would go out

756
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,567
and my brother would
be home babysitting me

757
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,395
and he would put
a blanket over me

758
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,180
and the blanket would
kinda come up to about here

759
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:21,402
and then he'd pull my pants down

760
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,970
and then he'd put my
penis in his mouth.

761
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:29,845
I have to say that obviously
it was somewhat pleasurable,

762
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:34,110
but at the same time
very strange and awkward

763
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:37,549
and then it got to a point
where I didn't want him

764
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,203
to do it to me anymore
and he'd get angry.

765
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,381
Of course, I didn't
know it at the time,

766
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:47,559
but no wonder because my
brother Howard brutalized him

767
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,997
and I don't know how many times
raped him his entire life.

768
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:01,529
I remember kinda looking
up, wanting it to end

769
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,402
and

770
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,928
just feeling so dirty.

771
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,625
- He called it
the lollipop game.

772
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,412
- Yes.

773
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,891
- Sounds like they both did
the same parallel things.

774
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,110
- They did the same
things because, yeah,

775
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:21,593
'cause Larry was gentle,
but I felt so dirty,

776
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,899
so disgusting and so confused.

777
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:27,033
- What he did was
his distorted idea

778
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,470
of expressing his love for me.

779
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,255
We really had this
loving relationship

780
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,606
even though I was
also afraid of him.

781
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:37,913
But Howard, on the
other hand, to me,

782
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,480
I don't even think
it was sexual.

783
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,918
I think for Howard it was
just an act of dominance.

784
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,617
"I will make you know
that I am the boss."

785
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,534
- [Woman] They're older.

786
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,884
Here it snows.
- It's just the snow.

787
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:53,363
- Would you please stay tuned

788
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,453
if you possibly can stand it.

789
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,933
I can't any longer,
but I've got to be here

790
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:58,978
'cause it's my job.

791
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,415
You people, you can get up

792
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,939
and you can change
the bloody station.

793
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:08,944
I can't, I'm stuck here with
all these insane individuals

794
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,512
and I've got to do this
and I'm foaming at the mouth

795
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,992
and I've got to compose myself.

[distorted laughing]

797
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,699
- I remember Dr. Lustig
put us on speakerphone

798
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,353
and dialed Dad's phone.

799
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:32,272
Dad answered and you told
him that Howard had hurt you

800
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,274
and there was this long pause

801
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,712
and what Dad said was,
"Well, I know it's true

802
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:40,454
"because he did it to
me when I was a kid."

803
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,897
That was the first time that
your father made any reference

804
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:52,074
or disclosed that he had
been a victim of abuse

805
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,903
or that any abuse had
occurred in his family.

806
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:58,559
In all of this,
before we were married,

807
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:01,867
the years of our marriage,
therapy sessions,

808
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,261
and your increasing
awful trouble

809
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:09,657
and Dr. Vogelson's theories
that Dad was abusing you.

810
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:13,313
In all of this,
you becoming suicidal

811
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:16,185
and staying that way for a
significant period of time,

812
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:20,407
Dad never shared with me
that there was any history

813
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,453
of any kind of sexual
abuse in his family

814
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:26,587
or that he had been abused
at the hands of his brothers

815
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,199
who had been frequent visitors
with open arms to our home

816
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:33,551
and who had had access to
you, and I was furious.

817
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:37,076
I was furious with him.

There's something
on it, on the drive.

For a while I was suicidal,

but

831
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:57,809
I couldn't check out

832
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:00,942
because I love my kids too much

833
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,857
and I couldn't hurt them again.

[eerie instrumental music]

835
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,873
- Larry, he confessed

836
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:21,963
and this sort of got
the balling rolling.

837
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,966
That started the whole show.

838
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,056
Six days later we end
up tracking Stewart.

839

No imperfections.
- You can't.

- That's great, that's great.
- Now move here, Ted.

842
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:40,025
- Now we charged
Larry early February.

843
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:42,070
We charged Stewart
the end of February.

844
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,682
He had 16 counts, two
felonies, two misdemeanors,

on with our lives.

00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:05,833
Not the way it works.

852
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:09,663
It was this endless process
of having to appear,

853
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,491
going into the
police department.

854
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:14,015

by various DAs in
the sex crimes unit.

858
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:27,333
What that does to the victim
is throw them right back

859
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:31,119
into the place where they
were when they started.

860
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:39,867
Larry's trial was
relatively swift.

861
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,434
There was the confession.

862
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:45,568
The confession was allowed
and I remember the anguish

00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,162
and said, "Huh, I'm
gonna take a plea."

874
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:18,210
I think at that time, he
admitted being abused by Larry.

875
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:21,213
He did like a one and a
half years or two years

876
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,910
and he had to go to
a half-way house.

877
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,477
There were rules
set for probation.

878
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,436
I think he violated them,
I think they put him back in

879
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,786
for I don't know how long.

880
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,614
[ominous instrumental music]

881
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,840
- Child sexual abuse
is the vile gift

882
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:43,626
that keeps on giving
and we know that Larry

883
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,846
had received it from Howard

884
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,328
and we know that
Stewart had received it

885
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:51,199
from his father Larry.

886
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:54,986
The big question is,

887
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,510
did anyone give
the gift to Howard?

888
00:46:57,553 --> 00:47:00,730
- [Child] Let's go, Howie.

889
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:05,779
- It was never revealed
in their household

890
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,914
or certainly his younger
brothers, Larry and Henry,

891
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,872
knew nothing about it.

892
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:12,786
[screaming]

893
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,743
[Howard shushes room]

894
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,180
- Can't hear the rhythm.

895
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,746
[people chattering]

896
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,531
- [Larry] That Billy
goat has no milk

897
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:20,750
and I'm on a straight account.
- Go and answer the baby.

898
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,056
[child chattering]

899
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,841
- You know, successful
conviction of Stewart,

900
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:26,974
Howard's the only one left and
Howard's just sitting there.

901
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,062
- [Detective] Right.

902
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:32,850
- [Dr. Lustig] It was two years

903
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,678
from the time that
Larry and Stewart

904
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:40,727
were convicted until Uncle
Howard's preliminary hearing.

905
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,077
Why?

906
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:47,908
Because the nature of his
abuse of Sasha is different

907
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:50,693
than those of Larry and Stewart.

908
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:51,956
Much more violent.

909
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,874
[ominous instrumental music]

910
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:00,965
- There was something

911
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:03,881
about you being upstairs
in the bedroom with Howard

912
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,492
when everybody else
was downstairs

913
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:11,149
that just felt off to me,

914
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:12,672
and I went up the stairs

915
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,848
and I approached the
door to your bedroom

916
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,635
and it was closed, and
I knocked on the door

917
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,333
and I said, "Hey,
what's going on?

918
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,248
"How's everybody, what
are you doing in there?"

919
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:27,034
And Howard said, "Oh,
we're good, we're playing.

920
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:28,818
"We're having
uncle, nephew time."

921
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:31,821
And

922
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:34,302
I walked away.

923
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,785
- Why didn't you open the door?

924
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:42,571
- Howard's voice,
the tone of his voice,

925
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,183
the ease with which he responded

926
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:50,753
felt very normal to me.

927
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:54,105
- In my room the door was
closed, he laid me on the floor,

928
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:57,195
pulled my pants down,
he was on top of me

929
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:58,761
in a push-up position.

930
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:05,551
What he stuck up my
butt was wet, it hurt.

931
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:08,336
He was taking it up
and putting it back in.

932
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,296
He got off, pulled up my pants,

933
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,647
pulled my pants back up,
then he pulled up his pants

934
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,824
and said, "Tell anyone
and I'll kill you."

935
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:18,999
- [Sasha] You know,
I really believed

936
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:21,306
that it was only
a matter of time

937
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,310
before Howard would crawl
through my bedroom window

938
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,659
and kill me.

939
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,488
[ominous instrumental music]

940
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:46,418
- Sasha was frightened to death

941
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,247
of having to face Uncle Howard

942
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:55,166
and testify publicly that
Uncle Howard had violated him.

943
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:58,038
- If that mocking
bird don't sing.

944
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,561
Mama's gonna buy
me a mocking bing.

945
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:00,954

- A what?

[laughing]

947
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:04,218
- What's a mocking bing?

948
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:07,091
- A diamond ring.
- A diamond ring.

949
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,398
- [Jacqui] Sasha, don't
do that shit, okay?

950
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:13,010
Please, I have no
patience for that.

951
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,012
- What do you think?

952
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:18,232
Am I too hot?
- Sasha, please.

953
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:19,712
- Am I too hot for ya?

954
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,410
- Look what I made it into.
- Quiet!

[music fading in background]

00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:30,636
- [Sasha] Smile.

You're on live TV.

960
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,907
- She doesn't feel like
smiling right now, Sasha.

961
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,214
- What happened?
- She's upset.

962
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:44,302
- [Sasha] About what?

963
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,524
You mean I did something bad?

What are you doing?

966
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,444
- [Bekah] I was sad
'cause I didn't know

967
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:58,794
why he was hurting me.

968
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:01,493
I didn't know what
I had done wrong,

969
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:04,104
but I wasn't angry
because I knew

970
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,976
that he was just having a
really hard time like I was,

971
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,066
but I was dealing
with it differently.

[melancholy instrumental music]

973
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,899
- We were in big trouble.

974
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,381
His behavior became scary.

975
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:21,817
- Just turn off the thing!

[Sasha screaming]

977
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:31,000
- He was completely
unpredictable

978
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,133
and completely uncontrollable.

979
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:36,789
- So Jacqui had to stop working.

980
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,705
We had to do everything
to keep Sasha alive,

981
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,228
not destroying himself.

982
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:46,364
We went from being
very prominent

983
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,322
to having to close our doors.

984
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:51,847
And then, of course, eventually
it destroyed our marriage.

985
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,026
The kids were primarily
at Jacqui's house.

986

They weren't living with me,

987
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:00,987

Yeah, Sash.

that's gonna win a game?

- Yeah.

your chance, Sasha.

There you go.

you're on fire tonight.

- I'm feeling it, I'm
feeling it so much.

1007

- It's awesome, man.
- Thank you.

It's just so cool
to play for my dad.

You don't have to,
if you don't want to.

It's not...

1011
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:27,465
You do whatever you need to do.

1012
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:32,252
- Well, I want to because I
want to really share with you

1013
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,340
what I felt.

[sighing]

1016
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,003
What are you gonna do, Howie?

1017
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:44,960
I called him Howie.

1018
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,180
What are you gonna do, Howie?

1019
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,747
- How old were you, Dad?
- What?

1020
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,009
- [Sasha] How old were you?

1021
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,619
- Probably no more
than six or seven.

1022
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,104
And I'm like, I'm leaning
over the tub like this naked,

1023
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,715
butt naked, my shirt's still on,

1024
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:03,457
and I'm like wondering
does he want me to throw up

1025
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,981
or what is it that
he wants me to do?

1026
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:09,550
It was such a searing pain.

1027
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,073
I literally saw stars.

1028
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:13,337
People say I saw stars
because there was so much.

1029
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,340
I did, I saw them and
I focused on the tiles

1030
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:19,299
that are still there now.

1031
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,823
And I prayed that that
pain would leave me

1032
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,434
as soon as it possibly could.

1033
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:25,610
I prayed that that
pain would go away.

1034
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,400
How could you, on your watch,
let this happen, again,

1035
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:34,706
to your own children?

1036
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:35,837
In your home.

1037
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:41,365
It's that question

1038
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:45,891
that's taken me a really
long time to answer to myself,

1039
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:48,110
let alone explain
it to someone else.

1040
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:50,112
Let alone someone giving
you the opportunity

1041
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,201
to even answer that question

1042
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:56,162
because many times people
didn't want to ask me why,

1043
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:59,948
they just looked at
me and wondered, how?

1044
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:03,343
To me, what they did to me
was some sort of anomaly.

1045
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,694
No one told me, Henry,
that's child sexual abuse

1046
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,261
and you suffer from PTSD.

1047
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,437
- Did you even know what the
term child sexual abuse was?

1048
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:11,699
- No, no one--

1049
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:15,181
Look, if I knew that
what they did to me

1050
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:19,359
was an indication of something
that could be repeated,

1051
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,361
they would not have been
within a mile of you guys

1052
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,884
and they wouldn't
have been in my life.

1053
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,499
A year after I was born

1054
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:31,415
my father had a nearly fatal
heart attack and couldn't work,

1055
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,939
so my mother had
to go out to work

1056
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:37,551
in a sweat shop making sweaters
and my father stayed home

1057
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:39,858
and he became Mr. Mom.

1058
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,862
So my father had a much
greater influence over me

1059
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,603
than my mother did.

1060
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:49,607
My father was a much
more giving, emotional,

1061
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,566
compassionate, generous person.

1062
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,395
My two brothers, of course,
were under my mother's rule.

1063
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,266
My father worked a lot of hours.

1064
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,879
He had a grocery store
and a butcher shop.

1065
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,403
So it was a big
change when my father

1066
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,145
became my primary caregiver.

1067
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:09,583
[instrumental music]

1068
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:12,760
I know in my heart that
the reason why I turned out

1069
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,588
differently than
both of my brothers

1070
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,504
was because of my father.

1071
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,163
My father taught me
different things

1072
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:26,121
than my mother would
have taught me.

1073
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:28,341
My father taught me about love.

1074
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,866
[soft instrumental music]

1075
00:56:56,151 --> 00:57:00,765
- Your father did his
self-appointed task very well.

1076
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,117
He just didn't consider

1077
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,163
that he might have
to protect his kids

1078
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:11,471
from a person
other than himself.

1079
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:15,040
[soft instrumental music]

1080
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:21,002
[footsteps tapping]

1081
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:24,745
- What was the main
sticking point?

1082
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:26,399
What was the main reason
why we weren't ready

1083
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,183
to go after Howard?

1084
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,838
- I know there was the
concern about your fear

1085
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:34,799
and your ability
to stand up to that

1086
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:38,716
and our ability to get
the appropriate conviction

1087
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:41,545
based upon your ability
to come into court.

1088
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,938
I talked to your mom and
what she shared with me

1089
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:46,898
was, over a number
of conversations,

1090
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,508
you needed this to heal.

1091
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:52,164
- You and me together are
still gonna see much more

1092
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:53,644
good, beautiful stuff.

1093
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,210
Don't give up on me yet.

1094
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,432
[ominous instrumental music]

1095
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,175
- We had decided to proceed.

1096
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:05,656
In February, we had
approved the arrest.

1097
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:10,182
Detective Ohrin went to New York
to arrest Howard Nevison.

1098
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:13,664
- Went to Howard's
condo about 4:30,

1099
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,927
took him back to
their police station.

1100
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,889
He ended up calling the head
DA in Manhattan at the time

1101
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:23,195
on his cellphone.

1102
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:24,544
His name was Morgenthau.

1103
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,459
He was a prosecutor
in Manhattan forever.

1104
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,896
People had told me the
"Law and Order" show

1105
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,637
was based on him.

1106
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:35,033
- The district attorney
from Manhattan at the time,

1107
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:39,254
Robert Morgenthau, had allowed
Howard to not go through

1108
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:41,082
the normal process for arrest.

1109
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:43,476
So instead of bringing him
back to Montgomery County,

1110
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,565
they were going to go through
extradition proceedings

1111
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,871
up in New York.

1112
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,569
And that was really the
first window that I had

1113
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:54,574
into the kind of power
that this individual held.

1114
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:55,967
[cameras clicking]

1115
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,057
[people chattering]

1116
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,406
- [Woman Newscaster]
That is the powerful voice

1117
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,929
of Howard Nevison.

1118
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:04,366
Cantor Nevison is seen
here helping to celebrate

1119
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,587
the high holidays at the
largest Reform Jewish temple

1120
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,936
in the United States.

1121
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,808
As a cantor, he's
been a central figure

1122
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,680
in the Manhattan temple
leading Jewish congregants,

1123
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,639
young and old, in song.

1124
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,162
- [Male Newscaster]
Nevison is accused

1125
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:20,774
of sexually molesting a
boy between 1993 and 1997

1126
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:22,950
when the boy was
only seven years old.

1127
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,344
Nevison's brother Lawrence,
and Lawrence's son Stewart

1128
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:28,086
are already in jail for
molesting the same child.

1129
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,653
- [Woman Newscaster]
The victim's own father

1130
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,611
and his Uncle
Lawrence tell police

1131
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,831
they were also
violently sodomized

1132
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:36,877
by Howard Nevison when
they were young boys.

1133
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,400
[singing]

1134
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:40,054
[tense instrumental music]

1135
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,628
- [Male Newscaster] Howard
Nevison posted bail and is free

1136
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,456
until his preliminary hearing.

1137
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:57,985
- What's the turning point then?

1138
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,597
At what point did I decide,
hey, you know what,

1139
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,599
I can do this, I
can face Howard?

1140
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:08,430
- The person who had
the greatest respect

1141
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:13,000
in the Neulinger family was
your maternal great-grandfather.

1142
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:16,656
The one who took the
family out of Europe.

1143
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,832
- [Henry] So what do you think
about your great-grandson?

1144
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,660
- My zayde?
- Your zayde.

1145
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:24,664
[soft piano music]

1146
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,799
I wanted to have
Joseph protect you.

1147
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:32,193
You're able to get
a skullcap of his.

1148
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:35,153
- You mean a yarmulke?
- Yarmulke.

1149
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:38,460
So you had your
zayde's yarmulke.

1150
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:40,114
- I had already changed my name.

1151
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:41,594
- Your name had
already been changed.

1152
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,205
- I didn't wanna share a
name with my abusers anymore

1153
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:46,120
and that's why letting
go of the Nevison name

1154
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:49,036
was so important to me.

1155
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,562
You see there's no more boys
to carry on the name Neulinger

1156
01:00:56,217 --> 01:01:00,004
and I'm gonna take your name.

1157
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:04,269
My name is going to be
Sasha Joseph Neulinger.

1158
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:10,362
My dad changed it
with official law.

1159
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,668
- [Woman] That's right, he did.

1160
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:16,498
- My name is now
Sasha Joseph Neulinger.

1161
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:21,025
- And why the Joseph?

1162
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:22,940
- Because I love you.
- Because you love me?

1163
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,162
- [Jacqui] He said the
Neulingers are always so loving

1164
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:31,600
and kind and it would
be an honor for him

1165
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,734
to continue this
name, and especially

1166
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:36,344
that he loves you so much.

1167
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:40,697
- It's unbelievable when
you tell that to somebody.

1168
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,829
- [Jacqui] We already
filed it with the attorney.

1169
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:55,537
- And right before you were
to testify against Howard,

1170
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:59,367
we did this prayer
here in the office.

1171
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:02,849
- Praised be thou,
oh Lord our God,

1172
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:05,460
king of the universe,
who has kept us in life

1173
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:08,028
and has sustained us
and privileged us

1174
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,727
to reach this season of justice.

1175
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,119
- We had practiced

1176
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:20,345
that whenever you were
feeling unsure of yourself,

1177
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:24,349
at least with regard to
testifying against Howard,

1178
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:28,048
you could put on his yarmulke.

1179
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:31,791
[soft piano music]

1180
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:36,796
And he would be
able to protect you.

1181
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,888
- Three years ago the
district attorney's office

1182
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:44,804
arrested and prosecuted
the real perpetrators.

1183
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,546
This child has put different
faces and different names

1184
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:50,244
on these kinds of allegations.

1185
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:54,727
- They tried every which
way to confuse you.

1186
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,077
You testified for about
an hour and a half,

1187
01:02:57,121 --> 01:03:00,080
and then the defense
attorney, one of them said,

1188
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:03,344
"Well, this person
that abused you

1189
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:05,782
"looked like your Uncle Howard."

1190
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:08,393
And you said to the effect
of no, that was Uncle Howard.

1191
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:11,396
He said, "Well, the
person that abused you,

1192
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:13,311
"was he heavier than
your Uncle Howard?"

1193
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,139
You go, "No, that
was my Uncle Howard."

1194
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:16,880
"Well, was he skinnier?"

1195
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:18,969
You said, "No, that
was my Uncle Howard."

1196
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,798
You said something
along the line of,

1197
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,409
look, after this went
on for a few minutes,

1198
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:28,500
"Look, if my mother gains
or loses 100 pounds,

1199
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,676
"I know it's my
mother, all right?

1200
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,418
"This is the guy that
did those things to me.

1201
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,159
"That's him, that's
my Uncle Howard.

1202
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:36,769
"He did those things to me."

1203
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,512
Well, I'm looking at the gallery

1204
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:44,864
and everybody, like to a man,
is going, "Holy shit, man,

1205
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,083
"this kid is solid."

1206
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,214
It was truth.

1207
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,653
- He testified I think
better than anyone else could

1208
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,873
about how devastating
it was, how frightening

1209
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,615
and unpleasant and scary it was.

1210
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:59,923
The acts committed against
him were truly disgusting

1211
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:02,403
and have indelibly
affected his life.

1212
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,666
- Do you have anything to
say in your own defense, sir?

1213
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,799
- Anything to say, sir?
- No.

1214
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,715
- The judge is allowing Howard
Nevison to return to New York

1215
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:10,890
while he awaits trial.

1216
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,850
He is out of jail
under a $250,000 bond.

1217
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:16,026
His next court date, June 13th.

- So Philadelphia
Inquirer article

1219
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,687
the day after the
preliminary hearing.

1220
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:28,255
It's incredible.

1221
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:33,304
"Mid-way through his testimony

1222
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:37,308
"he pulled out a white
black-rimmed yarmulke,

1223
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:41,312
"as if he'd forgotten it
whilst sitting during services

1224
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:44,750
"and placed it on his
curly brown hair."

1225
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:51,322
And then he continued
and he hurt Uncle Howard.

1226
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:55,369
That took two years.

1227
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:02,028
I still have

1228
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:06,946
my yarmulke in the drawer.

1229
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:15,215
Incredible courage

1230
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:20,133
from that little boy.

- It's my grandpa's backyard.

1234
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:02,436
Hi, this is the day
of my bar mitzvah.

1235
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,658
I'm still in my
pajamas, but who cares?

1236
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,661
Anyway, you know.

1237
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,664
Today I become a Jewish man.

1238
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:16,494
I just, I am so happy
to be surrounded

1239
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,583
by people that love me.

1240
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:21,934
I mean, it's like I have
this huge wall of people

1241
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,283
that I love and that love me,

1242
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:25,938
but I'm gonna see
you guys today.

1243
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,461
Adios, see you at
the bar mitzvah.

1244
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:28,941
- Rumble.
- Come on,

1245
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,290

Sasha, come on.

We need you out of your seats.

â™ª Y'all ready for this?

1253
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:49,918
â™ª I like to move it, move it

1254
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,008
- Come on, let's hear
it for the man here.

â™ª I like to move it, move it

1256
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:55,794
- He did a great job today.

â™ª I like to move it, move it

â™ª Give it up

01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,811
I'm happy, I'm really happy.

1264

[soft instrumental music]

1265
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:49,848
My mom said that after the
preliminary hearing with Howard

1266
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:52,155
she noticed a difference in me.

1267
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:54,113
- Of course, you won.

1268
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,854
- Well, I hadn't won,
'cause he wasn't convicted

1269
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,029
of anything.
- It doesn't matter.

1270
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,683
- [Sasha] How do you mean I won?

1271
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:02,687
- You testified about
what that man did to you

1272
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:06,647
in front of him,
quite capably,

1273
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,780
and whatever happened
subsequent to that

1274
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:14,568
was the responsibility
of the judicial system.

1275
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,222
It had nothing to do with Sasha.

1276
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:19,182
[soft piano music]

1277
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:25,710
- [Newscaster] Temple Emanu-El
issued this statement today

1278
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:27,973
saying the cantor has
been a faithful servant

1279
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:30,410
to our congregation
for 23 years,

1280
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:32,238
and never in all of
that time has there been

1281
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:35,241
any suggestion of improper
behavior on his part.

1282
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,330
We continue to
presume Cantor Nevison

1283
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:39,463
innocent until proven otherwise.

1284
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,165
- All right, so
that's 2002 though

1285
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,776
and it's 2006 by
the time we finally...

1286
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,387
Then there's four more years.

1287
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,302
- What happened?
- There's four more years.

1288
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:54,478
- Four years of your life
disappeared, what happened?

1289
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:56,610
- You came to law
enforcement at a time

1290
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:59,918
when the way that we
handled cases like this

1291
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:02,225
was that a child
would be interviewed

1292
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:03,704
by many different people.

1293
01:09:03,748 --> 01:09:06,011
So the first report comes
in and there might be

1294
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:07,317
a responding police officer

1295
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,057
who has some
communication with you,

1296
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:11,495
and there might be a social
worker and a detective

1297
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:14,193
and a prosecutor and the
people at the hospital

1298
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:16,543
who you talk to, both a
social worker and a nurse

1299
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:20,199
and a doctor, and at the
end of this whole process,

1300
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:24,377
I mean, there were dozens,
dozens of different statements

1301
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:27,206
being attributed to you,
some of which probably

1302
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,208
didn't even reflect
what you said to anybody

1303
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:30,688
at a different time.

1304
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:34,605
- Recollecting the same
story for the 47,000th time

1305
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:38,739
in this series of endless
people that you have to talk to

1306
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:41,089
and maybe the shade of the color

1307
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:44,615
of the shirt that you were
wearing that day four years ago

1308
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:47,226
is recollected as a
different shade of blue

1309
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,010
and then the defense
attorney's gonna jump in

1310
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:52,666
and say, "See, this is
not a viable witness."

1311
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,234
- Howard's two attorneys,
they filed motions,

1312
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:57,802
since you and I spoke
a lot over the years,

1313
01:09:57,845 --> 01:10:01,719
that somehow I coerced
you into your statement.

1314
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:04,983
They filed motions that
you were hypnotized

1315
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:07,420
by the psychiatrist.

1316
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:09,422
It got to the point where
playing youth hockey

1317
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:12,208
you had a concussion so there
was some motion they filed

1318
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:15,863
that basically that because of
the injury you were confused.

1319
01:10:15,907 --> 01:10:17,256
- The lawyers in this case

1320
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,041
represented the
defendant very zealously.

1321
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:24,045
But what that zealous
representation revealed

1322
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:28,006
is that it was just gonna be
an all-out war against you.

1323
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:29,616
- A letter was sent out

1324
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,749
to the members of the Temple
Emanu-El up in New York City,

1325
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,968
so they had
a fundraiser for Howard

1326
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:35,448
and they were asking
the congregants

1327
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:38,234
to provide money to
his defense fund.

1328
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,844
When you have two attorneys

1329
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:43,848
that have an unlimited
supply of funds,

1330
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:45,589
they can file a lot of motions.

1331
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:51,508
- It delayed the
process over years.

1332
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:56,077
Drew it out to a point that
it was absolutely unnecessary

1333
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,427
and caused additional harm.

1334
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:04,477
- Ultimately we got through
all of those motions

1335
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:07,132
and got to the place
where we were actually

1336
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:09,003
getting ready to go to trial.

1337
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:13,747
So there was one felony charge
and four misdemeanor charges

1338
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:17,577
against Howard Nevison and
it was with that framework

1339
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:20,276
where we had a trial date
set and we were ready to go

1340
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,147
that the defense
attorney approached me

1341
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:24,628
about trying to resolve
it and a possible plea.

1342
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:29,633
The most significant
penalty would have come

1343
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:31,199
from the one felony charge,

1344
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:33,419
punishable by up to
20 years in prison.

1345
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:38,337
The proposal that was
suggested by the defense was

1346
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,819
a plea to they're five
different misdemeanors

1347
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,342
and not to the felony.

1348
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,693
They always want to
plead to the misdemeanors

1349
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:47,999
if they're gonna plea.

1350
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:50,218
In fact, I've probably
rejected it more times

1351
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:52,090
than I can even think of
as I'm sitting here.

1352
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,874
- Did you do what
he said you did?

1353
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,136
- Speak to my lawyer.
- Is he lying?

1354
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,095
- But in this case,
it was different.

1355
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,097
For me, it was one
of those decisions

1356
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:03,144
I wanted to leave to Sasha,
so that he could figure out

1357
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:05,321
what the next step of
his life was gonna be.

1358
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:10,238
Sasha's first reaction was
nope, we're gonna go to trial.

1359
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:11,805
It's all or nothing.

1360
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:18,551
And it was a couple days later
I got a call back from Jacqui

1361
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:21,685
saying they talked about it
and they thought about it

1362
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:24,078
and they wanted to move
forward with a plea.

1363
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,648
[footsteps on stairs]

1364
01:12:28,692 --> 01:12:30,998
- I made the decision to
accept the plea bargain

1365
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,044
because I didn't
want to go to trial

1366
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:36,047
with the possibility that
he'd get off completely clean,

1367
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,703
completely clean and have a
chance to hurt other people

1368
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:43,620
and I also wanted to move
forward with my life.

1369
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,274
I remember...
- The doors.

1370
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:47,841
- These doors.

1371
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:50,366
- So our final day in court
was the sentencing hearing.

1372
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:53,020
It was September 19th of 2006.

1373
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:54,761
- [Newscaster] Hearing
appeals could go on for years,

1374
01:12:54,805 --> 01:12:56,894
the victim's family
earlier agreed to a deal

1375
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:59,505
dropping felony charges
with Nevison pleading guilty

1376
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:00,898
to lesser misdemeanor counts.

1377
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:02,813
For the family, that was enough.

1378
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:05,337
But before the cantor could
return to New York today,

1379
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,166
the judge directed him
to first take a tour

1380
01:13:08,209 --> 01:13:09,297
of the county prison.

1381
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:10,473
The apparent reason

1382
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,866
behind the unusual court
ordered field trip,

1383
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,827
to make clear to the
65-year-old convicted molester

1384
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:18,655
that should he get
in trouble again,

1385
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:21,309
prison is where he
will likely end up.

1386
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:24,661
- Probation of 12 years
and I'm gonna make sure

1387
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,141
you get a tour of the prison
before you leave today

1388
01:13:27,185 --> 01:13:29,274
to show you what it
would have been like,

1389
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,189
and I was like, what?

1390
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:34,105
I felt the same like
punch in the gut,

1391
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:39,110
like this case, the abuse
suffered by the children

1392
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:41,155
by three different
people, it was actually

1393
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,418
on three different levels.

1394
01:13:43,897 --> 01:13:45,725
Larry's level to Sasha was here.

1395
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:49,642
Stewart's level to Sasha
and Rebekah was up here.

1396
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:53,167
Okay, right about here.

1397
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:56,083
Howard's abuse to
Sasha was here.

1398
01:13:56,127 --> 01:14:00,392
So you're talking
extreme, middle, low level

1399
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,438
for the purposes of this.

1400
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:05,310
The punishment dictated
at the end of it

1401
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:07,791
was just the opposite.

1402
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:11,359
Howard got this.

1403
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:13,144
Stewart got this

1404
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:15,189
and Larry got this.

1405
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:16,974
Was it fair?

1406
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:17,975
Fuck no.

1407
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:20,064
[engine revving]

1408
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:35,688
- This is our courtroom
and you came up here

1409
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,518
to this witness stand.

1410
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,520
- Sasha, you've been
living with this case

1411
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:42,956
for a long time, haven't you,

1412
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,741
and that's you asking
me the questions.

1413
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:46,003
- That is.

1414
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,439
- Sasha, you've been
living with this case

1415
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,136
for a long time, haven't you?

1416
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,007
Yes.

1417
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,182
How old are you today?

1418
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:54,054
I'm 16, but I'll be 17 tomorrow.

1419
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:57,710
As we bring this entire
episode in your life to a close,

1420
01:14:57,754 --> 01:14:59,233
do you have any
thoughts or words?

1421
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:00,452
I do.

1422
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,410
And then you said,
keep your voice up.

1423
01:15:02,454 --> 01:15:05,022
[soft piano music]

1424
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,545
There was a time in my life

1425
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,329
when I didn't have
trouble smiling.

1426
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:12,246
I trusted everyone,
especially my family.

1427
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:15,293
But at the age of three,
I lost my trust and happiness

1428
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,904
because of one man
who betrayed me.

1429
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:20,690
I was so scared and tormented
by what my Uncle Howard

1430
01:15:20,733 --> 01:15:24,171
was doing to me that I
repeatedly tried to kill myself,

1431
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:28,219
but I have so much
to live for now

1432
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,787
because I didn't take
the easy way out.

1433
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,572
I fought the beast and I won.

1434
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:37,402
I won because I spoke when
he swore he'd kill me.

1435
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:40,753
Uncle Howard, as a cantor
in the Jewish religion,

1436
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:41,972
you should know
that what you did

1437
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:44,627
does not sit very well with God.

1438
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,934
And as we approach the season
of our Jewish high holidays,

1439
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:50,328
I hope you ask God to
have mercy on your soul.

1440
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:52,504
[blowing air against cheeks]

1441
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,592
- Is he laughing?

1442
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:56,247
- [Henry] I don't think so.

1443
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,554
[orchestral instrumental music]

1444
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:07,867
- Oh.

1445
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:12,568
[singing in foreign language]

1446
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:23,579
â™ª Nothing is hoid,
but the son of a boy â™ª

1447
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:28,845
â™ª La, da, da, da de

1448
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:31,891
â™ª La, la, la de

1449
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,731
- So what do you
think looking back?

1450
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:47,559
Did you say what
you wanted to say?

1451
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:51,694
- I said what I wanted to say

1452
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:57,047
and at the same
time, I look back

1453
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:00,659
and I still see that I was
an angry person about it.

1454
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:02,182
I was very angry

1455
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:05,795
and revisiting this story
again for the purpose

1456
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:11,148
of making a film has been
challenging at times,

1457
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:14,760
but this is
happening everywhere.

1458
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:17,676
I really hope that children
don't have to go through

1459
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,331
what I went through, but
there are a lot of children

1460
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:21,767
that are going through that.

1461
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:25,684
So let's stop.

1462
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:27,164
Let's do what we
can to prevent it.

1463
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:28,687
Let's talk about it.

1464
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:33,431
I'm motivated because I realize,

1465
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:38,001
I realize how incredibly
lucky and blessed I am

1466
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,525
to have my whole life
ahead of me, you know?

1467
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:42,701
He didn't destroy it.

1468
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:46,009
It's done, man, it's amazing.

1469
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:49,795
It's cool to be in
there all by myself

1470
01:17:49,839 --> 01:17:52,668
and just say thank you, goodbye.

1471
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,061
Moving on.

1472
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:56,062
- Good.
- Feels good.

1473
01:17:56,106 --> 01:17:56,933
- All right.

1474
01:17:58,282 --> 01:18:00,501
- Let's, uh, peace out of here.

1475
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:02,112
Can I grab something?

1476
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:04,114
Thanks.

1477
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:09,293
[wheels rolling]

1478
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,950
[people chattering]

1479
01:18:22,654 --> 01:18:24,700
- [crew] I got the camera.

1480
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:27,833
[soft instrumental music]

1481
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:35,928
- [Woman] He'll be right back?

1482
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:38,278
- [Man] Yes, he should be here.

1483
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:40,541
- Now, what you do,
save the tape.

1484
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:42,630
Wait for, there's
gonna probably be

1485
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:45,024
a small ceremonial type thing.

1486
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:48,767
- [cousin] Oh, there's
more video cassettes.

1487
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:51,335
- So in other words, you're
just wasting this on?

1488
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:52,728
You know it takes time
to watch these too

1489
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:55,034
after they're
photographed, you know?

1490
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:00,736
- [Bubbie] I'd like you to
speak with an English accent.

1491
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,520
- [Larry] I can't do that.

1492
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:04,783
I implorably refuse.

1493
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,567
[laughing]

1494
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:08,569
Shocked, I shocked.

1495
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:09,614
- Look at that.

1496
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,314
- He shan't do that.
- Thank you.

1497
01:19:16,012 --> 01:19:17,709
[hands clapping]

1498
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,631
- This was taken with him

1499
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:28,546
and there I am here.

1500
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:30,417
He put his hands
on my shoulders.

1501
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:34,117
He said, "God has kissed
your vocal chords."

1502
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,684
[piano music]

1503
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:46,956
[soft instrumental music]

1504
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:50,568
- So this is our team room.

1505
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:52,483
This is where the team will
come and watch the interview.

1506
01:19:52,526 --> 01:19:54,964
- The interviewer, the child.
- Yes.

1507
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:56,400
- And that's the close-up.
- Yes.

1508
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:57,836
- That's the shot of
where the child's sitting?

1509
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,750
- [Woman] Yep, that's it.

1510
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,317
- One person does the interview.

1511
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,016
Ideally one time and everybody
who has a part of that

1512
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,322
can go and watch.

1513
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:07,498
So the police can go,
the prosecutors can go,

1514
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,108
the social workers can go.

1515
01:20:09,152 --> 01:20:11,894
We can have medical and
mental health people on site

1516
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:15,114
and everybody that needs to
know for their profession

1517
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:17,987
what happened, can
go listen and watch

1518
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,510
and they don't have
to re-interview

1519
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:22,295
and re-traumatize the
child over and over again.

1520
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:24,558
The things that we do
here at Mission Kids

1521
01:20:24,602 --> 01:20:27,518
came out of what you
lived that we felt,

1522
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:29,694
in this county,
you shouldn't have had to live.

1523
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:32,566
So it's better for kids now
because of what you endured.

1524
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:42,881
[people chattering]

1525
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,883
- The thing is every
word's important,

1526
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:47,581
every single word is important.

1527
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:54,937
- Stop it.
- Tatala darling.

1528
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,460
- Tatala darling.

1529
01:20:56,503 --> 01:20:57,809
- Darling, how are you.
- Darling, how have you been?

1530
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:58,941
- It's been so long.

1531
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:06,252
[large crowd chattering]

1532
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:17,655
What can be done to help
present day survivors

1533
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:20,484
while working to create
awareness and resources

1534
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,400
to help protect future
generations of children?

1535
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:31,103
As a survivor

1536
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:37,718
I know what a place like Dallas
CAC would have done for me.

1537
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:40,156
[soft instrumental music]

1538
