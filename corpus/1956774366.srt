like really pushing you

528

Larry's second son,

and live with his parents.

531
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:47,834
Well, his mom had remarried
and his step-father said,

thrown out of the house.

535

So Stewart came to live
with us for a few months

536

around the house.

you were grabbing her chest

Elevator, second floor.

702
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,158
- [Man] Okay.

703
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,073
- [Man] It's not like--

704
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,469
- October 29th, 1998,

705
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,340
your parents came into
the police station.

706
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,995
They laid out this
general timeline

707
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:59,304
and I just sat there
like, oh boy, oh geez.

708
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,653
This is gonna be a mess.

709
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:01,610
You know?

710
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,133
Realistically.

711
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,526
Okay, you have all
this information.

712
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,181
Now what do you do?

713
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,011
We have Larry, we have
Stewart and we have Howard.

714
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:14,275
Howard was in New York City.

715
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,537
That would create its
own set of problems.

716
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,496
He's a cantor in
Temple Emanu-El.

717
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,846
It's the largest
synagogue in the world.

718
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,240
Every mover and shaker
in New York is there.

719
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,937
It's a high profile place.

720
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,722
[singing in foreign language]

721
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,463
The guy sang for the pope.

722
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:32,250
He's well respected, and to
lock up somebody like that,

723
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,774
you have to start getting
all your ducks in a row.

724
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,782
Stewart, Stewart was MIA.

725
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,305
He was somewhere, but
nobody knew where he was.

726
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,263
He was around the area.

727
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,176
I would get to him.

728
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,917
Larry, I knew where Larry was.

729
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,571
He lived about an hour away.

730
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:52,139
So I went up to see him.

731
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,445
- What are you doing?
- Who's that?

732
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:54,750
[people chattering]

733
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,144
- I'll say, who in
the world are you?

734
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,146
- Just showed up cold on a whim.

735
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,756
He could have slammed
the door in my face.

736
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,368
We talked to him
and confronted him

737
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,718
with the issues
about abusing you

738
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,375
and he was adamant
that this didn't happen.

739
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,507
No, you got the wrong guy

740
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,205
and he said, "Give me
a polygraph examination.

741
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,425
"I wanna take a polygraph exam."

742
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:20,036
He doesn't do too well
so we just tell him

743
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,734
he really didn't do
too well and it's time

744
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,692
to maybe clear the air,

745
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,521
and his lips started quivering

746
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,611
and he basically told the truth.

747
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,134
He confessed.

748
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,180
It was like a burden was
lifted off his shoulders.

749
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:38,751
[kids yelling in distance]

750
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,710
[door slamming]

751
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:42,581
- Wow.

752
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:55,594
- I'm Lawrence Nevison
from BBC Broadcasting.

753
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,596
I'm here, I'm
feeling rather well.

754
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:04,559
- The television
would be running

755
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:09,216
and every Sunday night
my parents would go out

756
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,567
and my brother would
be home babysitting me

757
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,395
and he would put
a blanket over me

758
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,180
and the blanket would
kinda come up to about here

759
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:21,402
and then he'd pull my pants down

760
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,970
and then he'd put my
penis in his mouth.

761
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:29,845
I have to say that obviously
it was somewhat pleasurable,

762
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:34,110
but at the same time
very strange and awkward

763
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:37,549
and then it got to a point
where I didn't want him

764
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,203
to do it to me anymore
and he'd get angry.

765
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,381
Of course, I didn't
know it at the time,

766
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:47,559
but no wonder because my
brother Howard brutalized him

767
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,997
and I don't know how many times
raped him his entire life.

768
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:01,529
I remember kinda looking
up, wanting it to end

769
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,402
and

770
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,928
just feeling so dirty.

771
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,625
- He called it
the lollipop game.

772
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,412
- Yes.

773
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,891
- Sounds like they both did
the same parallel things.

774
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,110
- They did the same
things because, yeah,

775
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:21,593
'cause Larry was gentle,
but I felt so dirty,

776
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:23,899
so disgusting and so confused.

777
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:27,033
- What he did was
his distorted idea

778
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,470
of expressing his love for me.

779
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,255
We really had this
loving relationship

780
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,606
even though I was
also afraid of him.

781
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:37,913
But Howard, on the
other hand, to me,

782
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,480
I don't even think
it was sexual.

783
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,918
I think for Howard it was
just an act of dominance.

784
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,617
"I will make you know
that I am the boss."

785
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,534
- [Woman] They're older.

786

Here it snows.
- It's just the snow.

00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:53,363
- Would you please stay tuned

788
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,453
if you possibly can stand it.

789
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,933
I can't any longer,
but I've got to be here

790
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:58,978
'cause it's my job.

791
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,415
You people, you can get up

792
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,939
and you can change
the bloody station.

793
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:08,944
I can't, I'm stuck here with
all these insane individuals

794
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,512
and I've got to do this
and I'm foaming at the mouth

795
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,992
and I've got to compose myself.

[distorted laughing]

797
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,699
- I remember Dr. Lustig
put us on speakerphone

798
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,353
and dialed Dad's phone.

799
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:32,272
Dad answered and you told
him that Howard had hurt you

800
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,274
and there was this long pause

801
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,712
and what Dad said was,
"Well, I know it's true

802
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:40,454
"because he did it to
me when I was a kid."

803
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,897
That was the first time that
your father made any reference

804
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:52,074
or disclosed that he had
been a victim of abuse

805
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,903
or that any abuse had
occurred in his family.

806
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:58,559
In all of this,
before we were married,

807
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:01,867
the years of our marriage,
therapy sessions,

808
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,261
and your increasing
awful trouble

809
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:09,657
and Dr. Vogelson's theories
that Dad was abusing you.

810

In all of this,
you becoming suicidal

811
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:16,185
and staying that way for a
significant period of time,

812
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:20,407
Dad never shared with me
that there was any history

813
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,453
of any kind of sexual
abuse in his family

814
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:26,587
or that he had been abused
at the hands of his brothers

815
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:30,199
who had been frequent visitors
with open arms to our home

816
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:33,551
and who had had access to
you, and I was furious.

817
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:37,076
I was furious with him.

but

831
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:57,809
I couldn't check out

832
00:43:57,852 --> 00:44:00,942
because I love my kids too much

833
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,857
and I couldn't hurt them again.

- Larry, he confessed

836

and this sort of got
the balling rolling.

837
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,966
That started the whole show.

Six days later we end
up tracking Stewart.

No imperfections.
- You can't.

- Now we charged
Larry early February.

843

We charged Stewart
the end of February.

844
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:44,682
He had 16 counts, two
felonies, two misdemeanors,

Not the way it works.

852
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:09,663
It was this endless process
of having to appear,

853
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,491

by various DAs in
the sex crimes unit.

858
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:27,333
What that does to the victim
is throw them right back

859
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:31,119
into the place where they
were when they started.

860
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:39,867
Larry's trial was
relatively swift.

861
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,434
There was the confession.

862
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:45,568
The confession was allowed

00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,162
and said, "Huh, I'm
gonna take a plea."

874
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:18,210
I think at that time, he
admitted being abused by Larry.

875
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:21,213
He did like a one and a
half years or two years

876
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,910
and he had to go to
a half-way house.

877
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,477
There were rules
set for probation.

878
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,436
I think he violated them,
I think they put him back in

879
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,786
for I don't know how long.

880
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,614
[ominous instrumental music]

881
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,840
- Child sexual abuse
is the vile gift

882
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:43,626
that keeps on giving
and we know that Larry

883
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,846
had received it from Howard

884
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,328
and we know that
Stewart had received it

885
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:51,199
from his father Larry.

886
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:54,986
The big question is,

887
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,510
did anyone give
the gift to Howard?

888
00:46:57,553 --> 00:47:00,730
- [Child] Let's go, Howie.

889
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:05,779
- It was never revealed
in their household

890
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,914
or certainly his younger
brothers, Larry and Henry,

891
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,872
knew nothing about it.

892
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:12,786
[screaming]

893
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,743
[Howard shushes room]

894
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,180
- Can't hear the rhythm.

895
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,746
[people chattering]

896
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,531
- [Larry] That Billy
goat has no milk

897
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:20,750
and I'm on a straight account.
- Go and answer the baby.

898
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,056
[child chattering]

899
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,841
- You know, successful
conviction of Stewart,

900
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:26,974
Howard's the only one left and
Howard's just sitting there.

901
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,062
- [Detective] Right.

902
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:32,850
- [Dr. Lustig] It was two years

903
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,678
from the time that
Larry and Stewart

904
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:40,727
were convicted until Uncle
Howard's preliminary hearing.

905
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:43,077
Why?

906
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:47,908
Because the nature of his
abuse of Sasha is different

907
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:50,693
than those of Larry and Stewart.

908
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:51,956
Much more violent.

909
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,874
[ominous instrumental music]

910
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:00,965
- There was something

911
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:03,881
about you being upstairs
in the bedroom with Howard

912
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,492
when everybody else
was downstairs

913
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:11,149
that just felt off to me,

914
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:12,672
and I went up the stairs

915
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,848
and I approached the
door to your bedroom

916
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,635
and it was closed, and
I knocked on the door

917
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,333
and I said, "Hey,
what's going on?

918
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,248
"How's everybody, what
are you doing in there?"

919
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:27,034
And Howard said, "Oh,
we're good, we're playing.

920
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:28,818
"We're having
uncle, nephew time."

921
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:31,821
And

922
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:34,302
I walked away.

923
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,785
- Why didn't you open the door?

924
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:42,571
- Howard's voice,
the tone of his voice,

925
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,183
the ease with which he responded

926
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:50,753
felt very normal to me.

927
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:54,105
- In my room the door was
closed, he laid me on the floor,

928
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:57,195
pulled my pants down,
he was on top of me

929
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:58,761
in a push-up position.

930
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:05,551
What he stuck up my
butt was wet, it hurt.

931
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:08,336
He was taking it up
and putting it back in.

932
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,296
He got off, pulled up my pants,

933
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:14,647
pulled my pants back up,
then he pulled up his pants

934
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,824
and said, "Tell anyone
and I'll kill you."

935
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:18,999
- [Sasha] You know,
I really believed

936
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:21,306
that it was only
a matter of time

937
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,310
before Howard would crawl
through my bedroom window

938
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:26,659
and kill me.

939
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,488
[ominous instrumental music]

940
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:46,418
- Sasha was frightened to death

941
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,247
of having to face Uncle Howard

942
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:55,166
and testify publicly that
Uncle Howard had violated him.

943
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:58,038
- If that mocking
bird don't sing.

944
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,561
Mama's gonna buy
me a mocking bing.

945
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:00,954

- A what?

[laughing]

947
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:04,218
- What's a mocking bing?

948
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:07,091
- A diamond ring.
- A diamond ring.

949
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,398
- [Jacqui] Sasha, don't
do that shit, okay?

950
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:13,010
Please, I have no
patience for that.

951
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,012
- What do you think?

952
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:18,232
Am I too hot?
- Sasha, please.

953
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:19,712
- Am I too hot for ya?

954
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,410
- Look what I made it into.
- Quiet!

[music fading in background]

00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:30,636
- [Sasha] Smile.

You're on live TV.

960
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,907
- She doesn't feel like
smiling right now, Sasha.

961
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,214
- What happened?
- She's upset.

962
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:44,302
- [Sasha] About what?

963
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:49,524
You mean I did something bad?

What are you doing?

966
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,444
- [Bekah] I was sad
'cause I didn't know

967
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:58,794
why he was hurting me.

968
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:01,493
I didn't know what
I had done wrong,

969
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:04,104
but I wasn't angry
because I knew

970
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,976
that he was just having a
really hard time like I was,

971
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,066
but I was dealing
with it differently.

[melancholy instrumental music]

973
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,899
- We were in big trouble.

974
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,381
His behavior became scary.

975
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:21,817
- Just turn off the thing!

[Sasha screaming]

977
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:31,000
- He was completely
unpredictable

978
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,133
and completely uncontrollable.

979
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:36,789
- So Jacqui had to stop working.

980
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,705
We had to do everything
to keep Sasha alive,

981
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,228
not destroying himself.

982
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:46,364
We went from being
very prominent

983
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,322
to having to close our doors.

984
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:51,847
And then, of course, eventually
it destroyed our marriage.

985
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,026
The kids were primarily
at Jacqui's house.

986

They weren't living with me,

987
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:00,987

Yeah, Sash.

that's gonna win a game?

- Yeah.

your chance, Sasha.

There you go.

you're on fire tonight.

- I'm feeling it, I'm
feeling it so much.

1007

- It's awesome, man.
- Thank you.

It's just so cool
to play for my dad.

You don't have to,
if you don't want to.

It's not...

1011
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:27,465
You do whatever you need to do.

1012
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:32,252
- Well, I want to because I
want to really share with you

1013
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,340
what I felt.

[sighing]

1016
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:44,003
What are you gonna do, Howie?

1017
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:44,960
I called him Howie.

1018
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,180
What are you gonna do, Howie?

1019
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,747
- How old were you, Dad?
- What?

1020
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,009
- [Sasha] How old were you?

1021
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,619
- Probably no more
than six or seven.

1022
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,104
And I'm like, I'm leaning
over the tub like this naked,

1023
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,715
butt naked, my shirt's still on,

1024
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:03,457
and I'm like wondering
does he want me to throw up

1025
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,981
or what is it that
he wants me to do?

1026
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:09,550
It was such a searing pain.

1027
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,073
I literally saw stars.

1028
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:13,337
People say I saw stars
because there was so much.

1029
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,340
I did, I saw them and
I focused on the tiles

1030
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:19,299
that are still there now.

1031
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,823
And I prayed that that
pain would leave me

1032
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,434
as soon as it possibly could.

1033
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:25,610
I prayed that that
pain would go away.

1034
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:33,400
How could you, on your watch,
let this happen, again,

1035
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:34,706
to your own children?

1036
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:35,837
In your home.

1037
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:41,365
It's that question

1038
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:45,891
that's taken me a really
long time to answer to myself,

1039
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:48,110
let alone explain
it to someone else.

1040
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:50,112
Let alone someone giving
you the opportunity

1041
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,201
to even answer that question

1042
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:56,162
because many times people
didn't want to ask me why,

1043
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:59,948
they just looked at
me and wondered, how?

1044
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:03,343
To me, what they did to me
was some sort of anomaly.

1045
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,694
No one told me, Henry,
that's child sexual abuse

1046
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,261
and you suffer from PTSD.

1047
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,437
- Did you even know what the
term child sexual abuse was?

1048
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:11,699
- No, no one--

1049
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:15,181
Look, if I knew that
what they did to me

1050
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:19,359
was an indication of something
that could be repeated,

1051
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,361
they would not have been
within a mile of you guys

1052
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,884
and they wouldn't
have been in my life.

1053
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,499
A year after I was born

1054
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:31,415
my father had a nearly fatal
heart attack and couldn't work,

1055
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,939
so my mother had
to go out to work

1056
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:37,551
in a sweat shop making sweaters
and my father stayed home

1057
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:39,858
and he became Mr. Mom.

1058
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,862
So my father had a much
greater influence over me

1059
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,603
than my mother did.

1060
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:49,607
My father was a much
more giving, emotional,

1061
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,566
compassionate, generous person.

1062
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,395
My two brothers, of course,
were under my mother's rule.

1063
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,266
My father worked a lot of hours.

1064
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,879
He had a grocery store
and a butcher shop.

1065
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,403
So it was a big
change when my father

1066
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,145
became my primary caregiver.

1067
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:09,583
[instrumental music]

1068
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:12,760
I know in my heart that
the reason why I turned out

1069
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,588
differently than
both of my brothers

1070
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,504
was because of my father.

1071
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,163
My father taught me
different things

1072
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:26,121
than my mother would
have taught me.

1073
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:28,341
My father taught me about love.

1074
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,866
[soft instrumental music]

1075
00:56:56,151 --> 00:57:00,765
- Your father did his
self-appointed task very well.

1076
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,117
He just didn't consider

1077
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,163
that he might have
to protect his kids

1078
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:11,471
from a person
other than himself.

1079
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:15,040
[soft instrumental music]

1080
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:21,002
[footsteps tapping]

1081
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:24,745
- What was the main
sticking point?

1082
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:26,399
What was the main reason
why we weren't ready

1083
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,183
to go after Howard?

1084
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,838
- I know there was the
concern about your fear

1085
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:34,799
and your ability
to stand up to that

1086
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:38,716
and our ability to get
the appropriate conviction

1087
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:41,545
based upon your ability
to come into court.

1088
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,938
I talked to your mom and
what she shared with me

1089
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:46,898
was, over a number
of conversations,

1090
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,508
you needed this to heal.

1091
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:52,164
- You and me together are
still gonna see much more

1092
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:53,644
good, beautiful stuff.

1093
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,210
Don't give up on me yet.

1094
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,432
[ominous instrumental music]

1095
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,175
- We had decided to proceed.

1096
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:05,656
In February, we had
approved the arrest.

1097
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:10,182
Detective Ohrin went to New York
to arrest Howard Nevison.

1098
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:13,664
- Went to Howard's
condo about 4:30,

1099
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,927
took him back to
their police station.

1100
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,889
He ended up calling the head
DA in Manhattan at the time

1101
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:23,195
on his cellphone.

1102
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:24,544
His name was Morgenthau.

1103
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,459
He was a prosecutor
in Manhattan forever.

1104
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,896
People had told me the
"Law and Order" show

1105
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,637
was based on him.

1106
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:35,033
- The district attorney
from Manhattan at the time,

1107
00:58:35,076 --> 00:58:39,254
Robert Morgenthau, had allowed
Howard to not go through

1108
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:41,082
the normal process for arrest.

1109
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:43,476
So instead of bringing him
back to Montgomery County,

1110
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,565
they were going to go through
extradition proceedings

1111
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,871
up in New York.

1112
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,569
And that was really the
first window that I had

1113
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:54,574
into the kind of power
that this individual held.

1114
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:55,967
[cameras clicking]

1115
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,057
[people chattering]

1116
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,406
- [Woman Newscaster]
That is the powerful voice

1117
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:01,929
of Howard Nevison.

1118
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:04,366
Cantor Nevison is seen
here helping to celebrate

1119
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,587
the high holidays at the
largest Reform Jewish temple

1120
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,936
in the United States.

1121
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,808
As a cantor, he's
been a central figure

1122
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,680
in the Manhattan temple
leading Jewish congregants,

1123
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,639
young and old, in song.

1124
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,162
- [Male Newscaster]
Nevison is accused

1125
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:20,774
of sexually molesting a
boy between 1993 and 1997

1126
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:22,950
when the boy was
only seven years old.

1127
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,344
Nevison's brother Lawrence,
and Lawrence's son Stewart

1128
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:28,086
are already in jail for
molesting the same child.

1129
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,653
- [Woman Newscaster]
The victim's own father

1130
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,611
and his Uncle
Lawrence tell police

1131
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,831
they were also
violently sodomized

1132
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:36,877
by Howard Nevison when
they were young boys.

1133
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,400
[singing]

1134
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:40,054
[tense instrumental music]

1135
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,628
- [Male Newscaster] Howard
Nevison posted bail and is free

1136
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,456
until his preliminary hearing.

1137
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:57,985
- What's the turning point then?

1138
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,597
At what point did I decide,
hey, you know what,

1139
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,599
I can do this, I
can face Howard?

1140
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:08,430
- The person who had
the greatest respect

1141
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:13,000
in the Neulinger family was
your maternal great-grandfather.

1142
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:16,656
The one who took the
family out of Europe.

1143
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,832
- [Henry] So what do you think
about your great-grandson?

1144
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,660
- My zayde?
- Your zayde.

1145
01:00:22,314 --> 01:00:24,664
[soft piano music]

1146
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,799
I wanted to have
Joseph protect you.

1147
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:32,193
You're able to get
a skullcap of his.

1148
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:35,153
- You mean a yarmulke?
- Yarmulke.

1149
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:38,460
So you had your
zayde's yarmulke.

1150
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:40,114
- I had already changed my name.

1151
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:41,594
- Your name had
already been changed.

1152
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,205
- I didn't wanna share a
name with my abusers anymore

1153
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:46,120
and that's why letting
go of the Nevison name

1154
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:49,036
was so important to me.

1155
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,562
You see there's no more boys
to carry on the name Neulinger

1156
01:00:56,217 --> 01:01:00,004
and I'm gonna take your name.

1157
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:04,269
My name is going to be
Sasha Joseph Neulinger.

1158
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:10,362
My dad changed it
with official law.

1159
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:11,668
- [Woman] That's right, he did.

1160
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:16,498
- My name is now
Sasha Joseph Neulinger.

1161
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:21,025
- And why the Joseph?

1162
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:22,940
- Because I love you.
- Because you love me?

1163
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,162
- [Jacqui] He said the
Neulingers are always so loving

1164
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:31,600
and kind and it would
be an honor for him

1165
01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,734
to continue this
name, and especially

1166
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:36,344
that he loves you so much.

1167
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:40,697
- It's unbelievable when
you tell that to somebody.

1168
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,829
- [Jacqui] We already
filed it with the attorney.

1169
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:55,537
- And right before you were
to testify against Howard,

1170
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:59,367
we did this prayer
here in the office.

1171
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:02,849
- Praised be thou,
oh Lord our God,

1172
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:05,460
king of the universe,
who has kept us in life

1173
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:08,028
and has sustained us
and privileged us

1174
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,727
to reach this season of justice.

1175
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,119
- We had practiced

1176
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:20,345
that whenever you were
feeling unsure of yourself,

1177
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:24,349
at least with regard to
testifying against Howard,

1178
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:28,048
you could put on his yarmulke.

1179
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:31,791
[soft piano music]

1180
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:36,796
And he would be
able to protect you.

1181
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,888
- Three years ago the
district attorney's office

1182
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:44,804
arrested and prosecuted
the real perpetrators.

1183
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,546
This child has put different
faces and different names

1184
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:50,244
on these kinds of allegations.

1185
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:54,727
- They tried every which
way to confuse you.

1186
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,077
You testified for about
an hour and a half,

1187
01:02:57,121 --> 01:03:00,080
and then the defense
attorney, one of them said,

1188
01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:03,344
"Well, this person
that abused you

1189
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:05,782
"looked like your Uncle Howard."

1190
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:08,393
And you said to the effect
of no, that was Uncle Howard.

1191
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:11,396
He said, "Well, the
person that abused you,

1192
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:13,311
"was he heavier than
your Uncle Howard?"

1193
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:15,139
You go, "No, that
was my Uncle Howard."

1194
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:16,880
"Well, was he skinnier?"

1195
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:18,969
You said, "No, that
was my Uncle Howard."

1196
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,798
You said something
along the line of,

1197
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,409
look, after this went
on for a few minutes,

1198
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:28,500
"Look, if my mother gains
or loses 100 pounds,

1199
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,676
"I know it's my
mother, all right?

1200
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,418
"This is the guy that
did those things to me.

1201
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,159
"That's him, that's
my Uncle Howard.

1202
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:36,769
"He did those things to me."

1203
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,512
Well, I'm looking at the gallery

1204
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:44,864
and everybody, like to a man,
is going, "Holy shit, man,

1205
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,083
"this kid is solid."

1206
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,214
It was truth.

1207
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,653
- He testified I think
better than anyone else could

1208
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,873
about how devastating
it was, how frightening

1209
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,615
and unpleasant and scary it was.

1210
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:59,923
The acts committed against
him were truly disgusting

1211
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:02,403
and have indelibly
affected his life.

1212
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,666
- Do you have anything to
say in your own defense, sir?

1213
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,799
- Anything to say, sir?
- No.

1214
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,715
- The judge is allowing Howard
Nevison to return to New York

1215
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:10,890

1337
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:13,747

it was with that framework

set and we were ready to go

attorney approached me

1341

about trying to resolve
it and a possible plea.

1342
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:29,633
The most significant
penalty would have come

1343
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:31,199
from the one felony charge,

1344
01:11:31,243 --> 01:11:33,419
punishable by up to
20 years in prison.

1345
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:38,337
The proposal that was
suggested by the defense was

1346
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,819
a plea to they're five
different misdemeanors

1347
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,342
and not to the felony.

1348
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,693
They always want to
plead to the misdemeanors

1349
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:47,999
if they're gonna plea.

1350
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:50,218
In fact, I've probably
rejected it more times

1351
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:52,090
than I can even think of
as I'm sitting here.

1352
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,874

he said you did?

1353
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,136
- Speak to my lawyer.
- Is he lying?

1354

it was different.

1355
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,097
For me, it was one
of those decisions

1356
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:03,144

his life was gonna be.

1358
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:10,238
Sasha's first reaction was
nope, we're gonna go to trial.

1359
01:12:10,282 --> 01:12:11,805
It's all or nothing.

1360

And it was a couple days later
I got a call back from Jacqui

1361
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:21,685
saying they talked about it
and they thought about it

1362

forward with a plea.

accept the plea bargain

1365
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,044
because I didn't
want to go to trial

1366
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:36,047
with the possibility that
he'd get off completely clean,

1367
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,703
completely clean and have a
chance to hurt other people

1368
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:43,620
and I also wanted to move
forward with my life.

1369

1377
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:02,813
For the family, that was enough.

1378
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:05,337
But before the cantor could
return to New York today,

1379
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,166
the judge directed him
to first take a tour
