00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,040
Hello

2
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,880
Hello?

3
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
Oops! Where are you?

4
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,480
In celebration

5
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,480
Well

6
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,840
The association''senior police officers
invites you to attend AGM.''

7
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,640
''Unveiling of this year's retired
Welcome to new members''

8
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,040
''Buffet with dancing. Ystad Saltsjöbad''
Go on like that?

9
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,840
I have done that in 30 years
of tradition and duty

10
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,200
-Need help?
-Yes

11
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,040
LDAG is in Ystad.
It does not look good if I am absent

12
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,200
I have not seen you as a man
of tradition and duty, right.

13
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,120
-Who are you going with?
"I was not going to torment someone else.

14
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,600
I would not torment you ...

15
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,920
I have nothing special for me today.

16
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,720
That's
fucking boring tilställningar.

17
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
To an outsider, they are deadly.

18
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,520
-Is it champagne?
-Yes, I think.

19
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,520
If you are unsuccessful, then?

20
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,600
I would not be in uniform on the street
after 20 years.

21
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,400
If everyone was so vain that you ...

22
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,080
"It's not wrong on their uniforms.
-Jo.

23
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, it is quite ugly. But seriously ...

24
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,160
If everyone thought like you
would the police come.

25
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,760
Some must of course palla
to work in real life

26
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,200
Yes, and who should thank them?

27
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,920
-How much do Svartman?
"It is not about the

28
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,800
-Wallander serves no fortune.
-No, but a bit more.

29
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,320
He of course do not have a uniform.

30
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,560
-What the hell!
-The barely visible.

31
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,240
Stop being such a fucking wimp.

32
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,760
All right

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,520
All right, fine horse.

34
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,080
Calm, take it easy
But God, what is that?

35
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,120
There is something in the water.

36
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,480
Thank

37
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,400
-Hey.
-Hey.

38
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,560
-Yes, heels.
-Yes.

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,760
A glass of

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,880
Nämen! Kurt!

41
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,720
-Hey
"It was not yesterday.

42
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,880
Katarina. Sven, defectors
now in the security industry

43
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,600
-This is my wife Mette.
-Catherine.

44
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,040
Yes, I am a defector
and damn glad of it.

45
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,880
I still get invited here -

46
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,200
and said Mette wanted to go to a party.
Where is you?

47
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,520
"We just got.
-V was thinking well that ...

48
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,440
Over there, perhaps?

49
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
You kidding, it's Maundy Thursday.
Martinsson is on duty.

50
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,280
Then'll have someone to talk about it
for Martinsson.

51
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Wallander is on leave
and does not answer his phone.

52
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,960
lsabelle and Pontus is on course.

53
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,920
What should I do? Go there yourself?

54
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,280
You may well take it on the road?

55
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,840
I eat lamb with mother in law.
The family is sitting in the car.

56
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,960
Sure, I can stop at a corpse
on the way to the mother.

57
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,520
-You are the best in the world.
-Tell that to my wife!

58
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,480
Ha ha!
-Stop it, Linda.

59
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Now the father.
Soon we are at grandma.

60
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,740
-That 's it.
-Dad will!

61
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,460
We should just stop on the road.
A job thing.

62
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,580
- What job thing?
- You know, the job thing.

63
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
It goes fast.

64
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,520
-No, I have never looked back.
-Good.

65
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,320
Being the police are equally appreciated
which will be patching lisa.

66
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,600
No one tackaar
and salary, we will not talk about.

67
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,360
-It may well be other reasons.
-Look around in here.

68
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,560
How many had chosen to become police officers
if they could choose again?

69
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,320
-Are you in security?
-No, I have stopped working.

70
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,400
Sven serves so well.
Of my salary was the only tax.

71
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,920
Sven will also end soon.

72
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
We plan
to obtain a place south.

73
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,960
Wow, it sounds fantastic.
Where did you have in mind here?

74
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,360
Do not know, just warm.

75
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
It might be something for you? Kurt?

76
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,560
You are a meritorious police
and can get any job you want.

77
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,280
I can hear myself.

78
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,840
After a few years, you can take the wife
on perpetual vacation.

79
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,320
Oh, no ... We are not married.

80
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,160
Colleagues.
And neighbors.

81
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,400
It is only today
I am "and".

82
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,640
-Then you are police, too?
-No. I am a prosecutor.

83
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,240
You can not park there!

84
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Hey!
Here you can 't stand? Hey!

85
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,480
What the hell was this?

<i> We have two burning vehicles
cenrala in Ystad. </ i>

89
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,440
-Have Wallander come?
-No.

90
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,080
Where the hell is the fire?

91
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,480
Martinsson. What, another one?

92
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,240
<i> We have three burning vehicles

Kurt Wallander?
There is someone Ebba looking for you.

94
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,960
What the hell is it now?

95
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,040
Yes, minister

96
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,320
Yes, you do not need to yell.

97
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,480
I will. Relax, I'm on the road.

98
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,800
We must go. You too. Sorry.

99
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,560
-Yes, it's just so.
"We may well see you again? Take Sven's short ..

100
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,800

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Okay, thanks. Hello.

102
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,280

Strangely, just run like that.
-No, something happened.

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,360

"I check.

Out! Out of the car!

107
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
Out! Out with you!

108
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,880
-What the hell was that?
-A Turn of the robbery.

109
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,600
3701, we are on the E65
just west of Skurup.

110
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
We have witnessed a robbery
against cash.

111
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,320
-3701. Hello?
-Bring your camera. You must take pictures.

Yes, it is understood!

115
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,720
Where the hell are they somewhere then?

116
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
Now drag the. They stick.

117
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,160
What are you doing?
We would wait for reinforcements.

118
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,560
What the hell do we do then?
They will of course be excluded.

119
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,200
Do not be such a fucking pussy,
what we said. Okay?

120
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,680
But take it easy!

121
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,200

-What the hell is happening?
-Back! Back off! Back off!

125
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,400
And when the horses began to react ... ?

126
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Yes, they were frightened
and began to fuss

127
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
-Come on.
-Stay in your car.

128
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,760
-Yes, but Linda must pee
-Yes, yes.

-You got the horses.
-Yes.

131
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,080
You went up and touched the corpse?

132
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,120
-Did you know if he was alive?
-No.

133
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,040
Were you in front and went on ...

-Yes.

No.

140
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,360
-Can we go now?
-Yes, the way your car. I will.

Move a bit, so.

00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,440
It looks good. It is quiet.

152
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
It is quiet.
It is quiet, my friends.

153
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,000
It was professional done

Check out the car. The car! The camera in the car!

172
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,960
"There are going well. Be calm.
"We have to go.

173
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,400
-Nyberg. Nyberg!
-Yes.

174
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,960
-Camera.
-Yes, that's it.

175
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,000
Damn, they saw the robbery.

176
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,480
They followed.

177
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,400
-Is the last picture?
-Yes. It is the last picture.

178
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,840
All the fucking fire is already extinguished.

179
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,000
I want all the police cars are out
until we have found Pontus.

180
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,200
Yes, it's good. Thank you. Hello.

181
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
Fucking idiots!

182
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,920
-Did you find something more?
-Yes, I do well always.

183
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,400
There is no indication
Pontus that was shot here.

184
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,800

"Yes, five hundred times. No response.

Yes. How is he?

196
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,440

You fucking pussy.

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
-Hey.
-Hey.

202
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,800
I would like to submit these.

203
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,240
But first a question ...

204
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,160
What was it that really happened?

205
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,760
You were well clear instructions
whether to stay and wait?

206
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,840
Or is it something we've missed?

207
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,280
It was my fault.

208
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,280
They were on their way out and I ...

209
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,240
You received an express order
to stop and wait for reinforcement!

210
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,560
Did not you?

211
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,200
-Yes, but it would take ...
-So you heard!

212
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,880
But you acted exactly the opposite
Is that correct understood?

213
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
-Yes, but
-No, but damn!

214
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,760
You understand what could have happened?

215
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,720
Damn kids!

216
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,640
What I wanted to say is ...

217
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,080
... I'm very happy
n that's okay.

218
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

219
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,840
Thank you.

220
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,520
Shall we go out and walk? When we do so.

221
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:20,480
-Do we know how much they came over?
15 million under SkandiGuard

222
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,840
And this murder ...
Is it something related?

223
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:30,280
-It 's not what we see.
-Then, we separate investigations.

224
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,160
The body was badly
according to Karin Linder.

225
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,400
He is shot in the head.
Svartman was the first place.

226
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,100
-Where is he?
-Available.

227
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,520
Damn, we manage two investigations
and the two men short.

228
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,920
Call Svartman.

229
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,200
As you know, took some pictures Pontus
with his camera phone.

230
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,400
Here we Marko Lehtinen.

231
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,800
It is hogerhanden
to this guy -

232
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,120
-Leonard named Belker

233
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,440
He sat at Kumla in eight years,
then ran away and he is wanted.

234
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,240
He is probably active.

235
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,200
July 28, 2002 in Märsta,
a raid on eleven million.

236
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,680
-Svartman are going.
-Thank you. August 25, 2005 in Hallunda.

237
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,160
15 million.
Four days later Akalla, 19 million.

238
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,360
"There are no amateurs.
-What is interesting is how he works.

239
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,760
Robberies twice
every few days.

240
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,800
First staging something spectacular
so the police are busy.

241
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,200
"When chaos is worse, turn it into.
-Then we can wait one to robbery.

242
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,280
There will we be prepared for.

243
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,440
-Hey.
-Aren 't you leave today?

244
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,680
I thought it,
not to speak about my wife.

245
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,320
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

246
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,600
"It was a sour old man.
-Bye.

247
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,600
Bye, Ebba. We are on the phone.

248
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
-Take care of Jussi.
-You say it.

249
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,040
-Hey.
-Svartman! Hello.

250
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,360
Be precise body found
in the watercourse?

251
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,640
There. Eggelstad.

252
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,320
Theoretically, the scene of the crime lie
well upstream.

253
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,720
Be Linder fast on
if there is a link to the robbery.

254
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,520
She is ready for lunch
and found a thing on the discovery site.

255
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,920
-A little thing.
-The offender was a minor.

256
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,720
It seemed like an entire kindergarten
had barging around there, "she said.

257
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,520
She told me to hand over
it Svartman.

258
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,600
I do not understand why.

259
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,720
Then you health Linder
I was free.

260
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,920
-Would I have locked the kids?
-Come on.

261
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,320
It is a major setback.

262
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,440
Last year, we laid down
enormous resources on security.

263
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,340
-What did you do?
-A major analysis of our procedures.

264
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,840
<i> Here is a long list.
You can follow me. </ I>

265
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,600
Is there anything else you can come to me.

266
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,640
Ystad police want to ask some questions.

267
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,400
Of course. Mike Sterner.

268
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,040
- You set the schedule for shipments.
-Yes, just to the south of Sweden.

269
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,040
Counted as Ystad in southern Sweden?

270
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,480
-Should I be honest ...
"There, we assume.

271
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,160
-This kind will not be possible
"It does.

272
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,960
Like, it does not matter
how secure a system is.

273
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,900
-Can you explain how you work?
-Yes.

274
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,600
We run three cars, two of which are empty.

275
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Körsohemat encrypted
individually to the drivers.

276
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,600
They do not know themselves
if they are running with empty boxes.

277
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,700
You are responsible for the encryption
Southern Sweden?

278
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,720
I'll tell you about a competitor.

279
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,360
A few years ago
were subjected to the raids.

280
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,560
They improved their methods,
but the robbers were always the right car.

281
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,760
It was a town that was leaking.

282
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,520
He felt the encryption?

283
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,360
Arena had studied at KTH
and was an expert in cryptography.

284
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
How does it himself?

285
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,760
You have increased resources for security
the last year.

286
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,100
I have a new lock
and we have video surveillance.

287
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,440
Can you see the recordings
from the last month?

288
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,560
It can be difficult.
I do not think they will save the links.

289
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
Sorry.

290
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,120
This should be
throughout the last month.

291
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,920
-Fine, thanks.
-Thank you.

292
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
The bullet penetrated through pannbenet
and penetrated the left hemisphere.

293
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
It went out through the back of the head

294
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,740
-How long has he been dead?
-One week, plus or minus two days.

295
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,400
Nothing of water in the lungs,
so he was probably dead before he came in.

296
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,320
Could he have been murdered somewhere else
and floated to Eggelstad?

297
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,800
It is possible.
Identification will not be easy.

298
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,560
Fingerprints
there was no code.

299
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,660
Dental impressions are analyzed.
It takes time.

300
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,680
I understand.

301
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,640
An athletic man, around 55 years.
That is what I can say.

302
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,560
Something more?

303
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,600
This was in the pocket.

304
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,200
Hello.

305
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,280
-How does it work? If you find something?
-Nothing.

306
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,880
That's him all the time.
Not a visit to two weeks.

307
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,480
-What is he doing?
Jobs.

308
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,380
Can you play at normal speed?

309
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Damn, that's of course Internet poker.

310
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,160
Damn, I thought he was working.

311
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,400
-How long has he been doing?
-All the time.

312
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,840
Is he a compulsive gambler?

313
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,000
Gambling debts?
Then he has a damn good reason.

314
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,120
We can not pick him for it.

315
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:09,600
He is the only one who knows
driving schedule before it is encrypted.

316
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,120
Does he have gambling debts -

317
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,120
-is it reasonable that he is open
for every conceivable proposal.

318
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,480
I think we should wait
until we find something more.

319
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,320
Look what I got today.

320
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,120
There are more than Sven and Mette
with foreign plans.

321
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,120
A colleague and his wife
skaa move to the south of France.

322
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,920
"Provence,
two kilometers from the salt bath. "

323
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,080
A fantastic house.

324
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,160
-How the hell did you afford that?
-Free sector.

325
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,360
He switched to corporate law.

326
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,760
-Maybe you should change jobs?
-No.

327
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,000
He defended a construction company
who used a float trowel -

328
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,000
-who had given every tenant
tracheal problems, especially the children.

329
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,200
-A clear conscience is the best pillow.
"Yes, let them rotate in insomnia

330
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,240
They have all fa
a fantastic house.

331
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,240
400 gross square meters of stunning.

332
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,640
You may well bite on Sven's proposal?

333
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,200
Then you buy a house
and invite me down

334
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
-See you.
-Yes.

335
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,000
Svartman!
A woman called five times -

336
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,240
-on a car that is on her land.

337
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,920
-Could you take it?
-No, I'm going to lunch.

338
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,240
You may well take something on the road?

339
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,120
-Thanks, you are ...
- ... "The best". I know.

340
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,720
Damn.

341
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,000
-Hey. Johan Svartman, Ystad police.
-Christina Tham.

342
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,320
It is my land you spill on.
Here it is.

343
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,800
-Fine!
-UGLY. Take it now?

344
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
-Now?
"I was clear on the phone.

345
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,280
I demand to scrap heap moved
from my chips today.

346
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,080
"I do not know if this is possible.
"This is exactly what will happen ..

347
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,760
Vil talk to my lawyer?
Black Brandt called you?

348
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,200
No, Svartman.

349
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,440
Sven ...

350
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,640
MOBILE CALLING

351
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,920
Kurt.

352
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Hey, Svartman.

353
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
You may ask her to call the municipality.

354
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,880
Explain politely
that she can stop her lawyer ...

355
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,880
An Amazon?

356
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
-Hey.
-Have you checked license plate numbers?

357
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,640
No, I have not had time.

358
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,520
Is it your car, drive it away.

359
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,320
The car does not move
until I say so.

360
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,220
You can go. We will contact you.

361
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,600
He managed
had these keys.

362
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,720
Contact Nyberg and vehicle registration office.

363
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,120
The car is registered on
Harald Claesson, Guresgränd 1A.

364
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,280
Good, then we will go there.

365
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,400
Kurt! Come.

366
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,200
He has selected a route on the map.

367
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,520
That cross,
that was where we found the Amazon Basin.

368
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,000
He has been out and oriented,
so anything happening here.

369
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,400
He is shot, body dumped
in the water and float -

370
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,600
-down here to Eggelstad
where we found the body.

371
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,560
The question is
what happened along the road.

372
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,840
I could go the way
and check out a bit.

373
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,080
It is good that you suggested yourself.

374
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,960
That takes a day.

375
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,160
One day the forest is what I need.

376
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,880
I talk a job now.
No fucking picnic.

377
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,680
No, of course.

378
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,360
"It's good. We heard.
-Yes

379
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,440
-Hey. Oh, hey you.
-Hey.

380
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,920
-Molly!
"She felt I uktar dog.

381
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,480
Is Sven-home?
-Yes. He sits in the sauna.

382
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,240
-You can get along nicely.
-I am not complaining.

383
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,920
Not really.

384
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,200
It was not
for money, I ended -

385
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,480
-but it does not hurt
when they roll into.

386
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,480
It was time. How do you say?

387
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,160
"Only the rich
prevailing over their own time. "

388
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,240
And it makes you?
-Yes, now.

389
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,240
I work more than rarely.

390
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,280
As police worked, I continued,
evenings, weekends ...

391
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,880
I know.

392
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,080
The marriage went down the drain.

393
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,160
It was my fault.

394
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,320
So we sat there without life
in addition to the job.

395
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,400
The compromise I do not like
with Mette.

396
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,000
I got a second chance.

397
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,240
She deserves everything I can give her.

398
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,080
What about you? Have you not thought of
to marry again?

399
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,280
The idea may well beat sometimes.

400
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,200
Did you make safety analysis
on SkandiGuard?

401
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,360
That's right. About a year ago.

402
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,280
We look at them
in connection with robbery

403
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,360
Yes, it was their transportation.

404
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,720
I went through
their internal practices.

405
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,280
Is there a gap ...

406
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,840
Did you hear about
by Mikael Sterner?

407
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,520
Yes, he did a little for himself -

408
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,560
-but he seemed serious

409
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,480
-You do not suppose ...?
-No.

410
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,880
"We believe nothing yet.
-Here is Mette.

411
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,720
-Hey.
-Come here. Come.

412
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,320
Come and visit.

413
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,440
Come and visit me.

414
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,800
She knows that I uktar dog.

415
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,920
-Were you a good hand?
-Excuse me?

416
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,880
It must be difficult to fold
when you sit on a good hand.

417
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,040
"I do not understand.
- No?

418
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,280
Bells on my Saagar
"Poker" and "addiction"?

419
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,200
I am not an addict.

420
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,240
Do you have gambling debts?

421
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,480
No, I do not.

422
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,640
On the contrary.

423
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,080
Poker gives me
a steady side income.

424
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,960
lnom one years, I say me
to become professional players.

425
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,640
You can see my bank accounts.
I have no secrets.

426
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,120
There were no gambling debts?

427
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,000
He earns more in poker
than the three of us are doing together.

428
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,080
Perhaps it is to do
so you can move south.

429
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,400
-What you talking about?
-No, nothing.

430
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,800
Okay, back to square one.

431
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,920
-Hey, Nyberg.
-Hey.

432
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,560
-How does it work?
-Joda.

433
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,280
The lab has sent the report
the explosive from the shipment.

434
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,920
There were no sensations.

435
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,840
It was a primer, remote ...

436
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,200
Yes, on a signal.

437
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,080
Is it the type
which has been used in the other wafers?

438
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,440
Yes, but it does not mean anything.

439
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,000
The military uses the dough.
It is easy to obtain.

440
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,920
One thing that was weird ...

441
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,080
The amount of dough and apteringen
was nasty like.

442
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,360
-Okay. Thank you for so long.
-Thank you.

443
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,960
You ... What would you do

444
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,160
-If you had unlimited
money during the holidays?

445
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,840
Purely hypothetical?

446
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,400
I would do what I do.

447
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,080
Two weeks in Iceland,
excavation and fishing.

448
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,520
It is expensive to snuff

449
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,600
If they called and said
that you had received an inheritance

450
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,400
-from an unknown aunt in America,
what would you do?

451
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:41,760
I would probably go home
and devote myself to what I like.

452
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,360
How do you work?

453
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,120
I met a colleague from the past.
He has a lot of money.

454
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,160
He would take early retirement
and do not give a shit.

455
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,400
It sounds like shit.

456
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,440
-Had he inherited?
-No, he has worked them together.

457
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:10,480
-Yes, he may not have been the police.
-No, you're right in.

458
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,600
I'll call when I get a moment.
It is good.

459
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,760
Now I am not ...
Were not you told to rest?

460
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,880
"It was a prescription
-You were told to go home and rest.

461
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,680
I know, but we would look up
one thing about cars.

462
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,960
-There must have been witnesses.
"We heard them, we could get in.

463
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,240
We thought somebody shot
and laid out on the web.

464
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,240
Right. Check it out, then.

465
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,640
Then you go home and rest.

466
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,560
-Is not it beautiful?
-What are they doing here?

467
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,080
Lame and sick, they are lagging here
to work.

468
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,240
-They 're sick. Slot, then?
-What the hell are they to do with it?

469
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,840
"I can check it out.
-Fuck it.

470
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,400
Wait, wait! Check.

471
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,040
All watching the fire,
but he is about to leave.

472
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,440
It's a Vespa Elite, an old.

473
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,520
Fucking-eye you have.
-My dad had one of those.

474
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,600
Check it out.

475
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,480
Elite-e at the end.
"I know.

476
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,600
Scanian scooter club.

477
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,280
-Maybe he is a member.
-There you have membership.

478
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,120
What did you do
between 13 and 15 on Thursday?

479
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,080
I and the girl was on lunoh
with her sister.

480
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,000
-You were not out there with vespan?
"I have not started yet

481
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,120
Do you have names
and phone to his sister?

482
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,360
-Did he have an alibi?
-Easter Dinner.

483
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,680
-How many are there left?
-Atta, if v holds us to Ystad.

484
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,560
-Shall we take the entire southern Skane ...
-Yes, if necessary.

485
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,840
-Shall we?
-Yes.

486
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,140
Do not be so fucking pussy!

487
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,800
Hello?

488
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,440
Hello?

489
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,960
Hello. Pontus Hoijer, Ystad police.

490
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,960
Is that your scooter outside?

491
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,920
-What d'ya?
-A bilbrand.

492
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,760
Yes, I read something in the newspaper.

493
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,880
-What did you do last Thursday?
- No fan tutte I fire on a car.

494
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,880
Me and the wife was with my parents
and ate dinner.

495
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,200
Do you have names and phone numbers?

496
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,920
Helge and Birgitta Karlsson.
0414-12 12 32.

497
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,400
You, in which the helmet ...

498
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,280
Freeze! Freeze!

499
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,760
Lie still! Lie still!

500
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:51,120
A witness saw you get out
a blue Ford Fiesta before the fire.

501
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:03,840
-Do not want to cooperate?
-You can interpret it how you want.

502
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,720
I just drove a car into the square.

503
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,480
And after that?
"I left the car and pulled.

504
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,280
Once you had set fire to it?

505
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,560
I had no idea
that they would blow up the car.

506
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,160
I was in hell on the road
to emphasize the self.

507
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,600
Who are "they"?

508
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:39,720
He knows nothing. He received 12 000
to drive a car at the square.

509
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,500
They work
in cells isolated from each other.

510
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,620
We must have something more going on.
Anything!

511
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,120

She sought protection for all the shit

01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,720
About two years
I could give it to her.

Now I have thrown her out
insecurity again.

01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:17,000
They contacted me
when I had just met Mette.

580
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,040
Just as if they had figured it out.
At first, I said flatly no.

581
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:34,160
Then the firm could not so well
I had hoped

582

-Kurt! The shipment is empty.

They found great value shipment,
blown and exhausted.

630
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:14,400
He almost made me feel
it was me who had chosen the wrong.

Inconceivable that he took risks like that.

643
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,720
He must have taken
that he would be discovered.

He was in love, Kurt.
All burns not for his job.
