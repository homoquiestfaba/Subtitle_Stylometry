1
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:33,163
Morning Earl.

2
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,661
Hope I didn't wake you up.

3
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,349
What are you doing up there, Joe?

4
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,053
I'm just putting the
finishing touches on her.

5
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:41,848
Ain't she a peach?

6
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,501
Well what the hell is it?

7
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,856
It's a subspace interstellar communications

8
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:46,881
array, of course!

9
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,186
And here we are, bottom of the 9th,

10
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,596
the Rangers down by two.

11
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,031
Thomas on third base, Gables on first,

12
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,830
representing the tying run.

13
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,131
Johnson takes the plate,
it's been a rough night for

14
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,747
the Rangers, and you can tell
that tempers are running hot.

15
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,210
Anderson's pitched a hell
of a game this evening, but

16
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,386
he has not done well
against Johnson allowing-

17
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,791
This is Joe McNut.

18
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,521
Can anyone hear me please?

19
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,815
Hello, hello?

20
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,399
This is Earth, come in, over.

21
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,220
Phil, what the hell you trying to do?

22
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,350
Trying to contact me an alien race, Earl.

23
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,984
Well do you have to do it now?

24
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,478
I didn't know him.

25
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:12,034
I suppose not.

26
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,821
Hello space, come in over.

27
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,911
This is Joe McNut.

28
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:33,278
To space.

29
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,810
Earl?

30
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,499
What did you do?

31
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:23,807
Probably some damn
airplane toilet dropped its

32
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:24,483
load.

33
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,797
Then why are you taking your gun?

34
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,632
Because whatever it is it's trespassing.

35
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,759
You coming?

36
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,546
One small step for,

37
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,664
well wait up Earl.

38
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:45,326
Hold on Earl, wait for me.

39
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:28,741
This dang thing pulverized itself a cow.

40
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:34,010
One cow, one bull.

41
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,060
Now what are the chances of that happening?

42
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,564
I've seen everything now.

43
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,578
Except that, of course.

44
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,258
Maybe you should poke it with a stick.

45
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:56,177
I ain't poking it with no stick.

46
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,556
That's it.

47
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,323
Go on ahead, give her a good poke there.

48
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,856
What, do you want me to do it?

49
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,873
I don't know why you
thought you had to go poke it

50
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:56,618
with a stick.

51
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,515
Get it all pissed off.

52
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,930
Keep your voice down Joe.

53
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,240
Now I suppose we'll have
one of them intergalactic

54
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,310
wars or something.

55
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,280
Whole damn planet will
probably be taken over.

56
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,120
You and I'll be the
first to go, but whatever.

57
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,760
I said keep your voice down.

58
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,720
Besides, there ain't no such thing as aliens.

59
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,170
Then why are we hiding in a hay stack?

60
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,789
Cuz whatever it is, it might be dangerous.

61
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,510
I think I understand.

62
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,104
You're a-feared of the unknown.

63
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:26,685
I ain't no feared of the unknown.

64
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,431
Yes, you is.

65
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,263
No, I ain't.

66
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:28,850
Yes, you is.

67
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,544
No, I ain't.

68
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,653
Yes, you is.

69
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:31,917
Oh, now you all gone paranoid.

70
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,314
How many times I gotta to say it?

71
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,248
There ain't no such things as aliens!

72
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,443
It's just you and me sitting on the porch and

73
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,231
that's all it's ever going to be.

74
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:45,239
Look Carl.

75
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,259
Aliens!

76
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,109
Is this your property?

77
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,754
Yes ma'am, me and my brother Joel.

78
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:52,122
I'm special agent Carlisle, with the NC66.

79
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,841
Over the past several
months we've been monitoring

80
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,932
the deteriorating orbit of
geostationary meteorological

81
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,855
satellite number 216B4C10.

82
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,908
At 21:21 number 216B4C10 succumbed to

83
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:05,180
the planet's gravitational pull and

84
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,239
we've since tracked its
beacon to this location.

85
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,838
We will now remove the satellite.

86
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,819
Your cooperation, though mandatory,

87
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,839
is appreciated.

88
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:45,042
Excuse me, what about my cow?

89
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,204
Sorry?

90
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,602
Whatever the hell that thing is.

91
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,920
It crashed into my field
and blew up my stud bull and

92
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
milking cow.

93
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,973
We are not trained to respond to that.

94
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,379
Your country thanks you.

95
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:28,291
I suppose that's the government for ya, Joe.

96
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:46,740
Hey, you dropped this.

97
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,176
Throw it in the trash, Earl.

98
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,700
It's garbage.

99
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,191
You sure?

100
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,587
I mean, you never know when
those aliens will come down and.

101
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:29,642
Makes you think though, doesn't it?

102
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,754
About what?

103
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:33,094
You know, about what's out there.

104
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:42,031
Here we are, sitting on
this porch night after night,

105
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:47,805
drinking the same beers,
never leaving this town.

106
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:56,875
And one day, out of the blue, smack,

107
00:12:56,895 --> 00:13:02,170
here comes a goddamn weather satellite.

108
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,470
Crashes into your field and

109
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,250
turns your best bull into hamburger.

110
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,900
And you realize we're not
just sitting on this porch in

111
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:24,470
the middle of this field,

112
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,780
we are sitting on a front seat of a planet.

113
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,210
That is shooting its way all across space.

114
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,283
And who knows, maybe even time.

115
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,058
In a way, Joel,

116
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:56,396
You and me, we are astronauts.

117
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,454
Yeah.

118
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,161
I guess we is, ain't we?

119
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:28,276
Hey Earl, that was awful good cow meat.

120
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,408
Yeah, it wasn't half bad.

121
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:36,256
Course it was probably
crawling with radioactivity.

122
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,660
Hey Earl.

123
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Lord what now?

124
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,621
Sure is one nice night.

125
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,926
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

126
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:46,700
Hello, hello, this is Earth, come in, over.
