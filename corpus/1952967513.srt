Mr. Wells?

254
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,271
Listen, l know l was sort of
imposed on you here.

255
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,138
Mr. Shadoe is quite
an advocate for you.

256
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,735
Mrs. Blossom, please.
l'm trying to apologize.

257
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,142
For what, Mr. Wells?

258
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:26,873
For Topher.

259
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,881
For screwing up
your film festival.

260
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,282
Topher Shadoe is
a horrendous name.

261
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:36,345
Why you boys choose to change
your names is beyond me.

262
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,823
Names, faces, films.

263
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:44,296
l don't forget the good ones,
even yours.

264
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,355
You've got a schedule to keep.

265
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:52,167
Yeah, right, um, okay.

266
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,242
<i>O</i>kay, last question, Tommy.

Tell us what makes your
creative vision unique.

00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,711

Stow it, Ralph.
l need a poo break.

273

So, Tommy, back to you.

No pressure.

275
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,495
So, yeah, l like to see what
people are gonna do

276
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,232
when they think
no one is watching.

277
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,570
Sometimes l'll peek
through the crack

278
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,976
of my sister's bedroom door...

279
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,736
and watch her sleep.

280
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:40,510
l also like to walk around
with my hands like this.

281
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,578
Like how mysterious you look

282
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,385
surrounded by all
that smoke, Zach.

283
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:48,255
l wonder what
you're looking at...

284
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,852
what you're you thinking.

285
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,235
Sometimes l spend my whole day
framing people up.

286
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,239
My whole life is cinematic.

287
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:03,902
l even masturbate cinematically.

l can see to that.

725
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:03,676
That's...awesome.

726
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,235
Shane, your mom cut herself
with the cheese knife thingy.

727
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,102
<i>Godver</i>.

728
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,368
C.W., do me a favor...

729
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,813
Take him home, will you?

730
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:34,716
He's a little, uh, wasted.

731
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,152
You gonna be okay?

732
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:47,026
Home in one piece, C.W.

733
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:48,293
Sure.

734
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:49,424
He's mine.

735
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,704
Hey.

736
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,709
Hey, camera dude!

737
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,040
Thanks.

738
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:03,445
l wish l was inside your head.

739
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:06,980
All right, let's get you
back to your dorm.

740
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,110
Wait. Abbey.

741
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:10,052
We, uh, need to get Abbey.

742
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,818
We'll get her on the way out.

743
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,688
Excellent.

744
00:40:18,396 --> 00:40:21,194
<i>O</i>kay, let's get you to bed.

745
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:22,961
<i>O</i>kay.

746
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,695
Alone.

747
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,331
Bitch.

748
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,888
Good morning, son.

749
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,489
How'd you get in here?

750
00:40:54,732 --> 00:40:58,361
Your R.A. seemed real eager
to let me surprise you.

751
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:03,271
So guess what l got in the mail?

752
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:05,867
l have no idea, Dad.

753
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,343
Two things:

754
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,506
your tuition bill...

755
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,511
and this.

756
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:16,047
My invitation.

757
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:21,983
Dad, can we, uh,
talk about this later?

758
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:24,290
l have a scholarship interview
to get to.

759
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:27,764
We talked about this
months ago, Danny.

760
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,495
l pay for film school,

761
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:33,197
and you are not
to show that film.

762
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:34,864
Dad, it's fiction.

763
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,874
lt's worse than fiction.

764
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:38,773
lt's a lie.

765
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,472
Look, Dad, l have a real
chance at winning this.

766
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:44,140
Not at my expense, you don't.

767
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:45,877
Not at your mother's.

768
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,544
Don't bring her into this.

769
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:50,253
Withdraw the film, son,

770
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:54,054
or your little
movie career is over.

771
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:56,821
Dad, please.

772
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,559
Aw, jeez.

773
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,893
Take a shower.

774
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,904
You stink.

775
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,103
<i>[door opens and closes]</i>

776
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,447
Gimme a cigarette.

777
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:23,180
l am not supposed
to talk to you.

778
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,121
So, don't talk.

779
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:35,194
Did that old windbag tell you
to stay away from me?

780
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,928
Why would she tell me that?

781
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,334
Because you have
a decision to make.

782
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,065
Don't let him win.

783
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:43,130
Danny?

784
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,335
Do you care about anyone else?

785
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,402
See, l won 1 5 years ago.

786
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,879
<i>Judas Kiss</i> won.

787
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:50,972
You cheated.

788
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,949
l did not.

789
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:54,952
What's the date on that?
<i>[vibration]</i>

790
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,085
First draft.

791
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,025
Senior year, high school.

792
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,618
So what?

793
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:07,228
Playing dumb doesn't really
do it for you.

794
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,256
<i>O</i>fficial rules say,

795
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,633
''<i>O</i>riginal screenplay written
while attending Keystone.''

796
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,428
Who are you, huh?

797
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:16,372
Why do you care
so much about my past?

798
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:18,238
His past is the key
to your future.

799
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,904
What on this campus
isn't the key to my future?

800
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:23,573
That script proves Danny
cheated with Abbey's help.

801
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:26,174
That's how you
keep him from winning.

802
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:29,186
Winning was the worst thing
that ever happened to you.

803
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,179
l can't just walk into
Blossom's office with this.

804
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,452
How would she know it's real?

805
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:37,586
You don't have to.

806
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,461
Now l gotta win.

807
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:50,338
He's going cut me off if l keep
<i>Judas</i> in the festival.

808
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:52,934
Your dad's really that much
of a <i>Rasshol?</i>

809
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:54,444
Trust me.

810
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,343
That's him on a good day.

811
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:08,356
Most people walk facing the
direction they're headed, C.W.

812
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:09,484
Hey.

813
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,223
You gonna go to
Martinez' party tonight?

814
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,166
Yeah, sure.

815
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,395
Great.
Then we'll meet you there.

816
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,968
And remember--

817
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,567
eyes forward.

818
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:35,242
Come on.

819
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:48,187
<i>O</i>nly you and l know
about the script.

820
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:51,633
Look, l can't concentrate
on this right now, okay?

821
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:57,131
l'm serious.

822
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,732
Get him out of your head.

823
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:06,145
You know, you're right...

824
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:08,617
l gotta get psyched
about this interview.

825
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,347
l love you, Abs.

826
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:12,447

00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:17,626
Too much love in the room.

829
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,025
Wish me luck, huh?

830
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,363
Luck, really.

831
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,243
Zach, you ready for this?

832
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,713
Uh, yeah. Ready.

833
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,040
ls it all right if l come in?

834
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,575
Perfectly fine, Danny.

835
00:45:43,754 --> 00:45:46,018
l'll start where we left off.

836
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:50,525
Your film, <i>Judas Kiss,</i> tackles
some pretty intense issues.

837
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:54,122
Why such a controversial
subject in the short form?

838
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:58,534
Well, sir, l kind of wanted
<i>Judas Kiss</i> to be more of a...

839
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:02,733
great knockout punch rather
than an entire boxing match.

840
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,604
That is a wonderful
metaphor, Danny.

841
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:06,200
Thank you, sir.

842
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:07,642
Winning this competition

843
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:09,669
could open a lot of
doors for you, Danny.

844
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,147
What do you plan to do
with those opportunities?

845
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:13,548
Get rich.

846
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:16,348
<i>[Ralph and Rebecca laugh]</i>

847
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:20,153
So, um, where do you
see yourself, say,

848
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:22,159
in 1 5 years from now?

849
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:26,154
Famous, l hope.

850
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:29,291
l'd work for it, obviously.

851
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,699
Few more shorts
before l graduate,

852
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,225
then my first feature.

853
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,295
Actually, l have an idea
for it right now.

854
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,569
lt's about love in
a parallel universe

855
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:39,166
where everyone's
turned around.

856
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:40,571
Turned around?

857
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,307
Yeah, like an all-gay universe

858
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:45,838
where straight people
are the minority.

859
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,650
Gay, right.

860
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:49,710
<i>O</i>f course.

861
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:52,119
ls that a problem?

862
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,716
No, no.
Not for me, it isn't.

863
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:58,319
So, in 1 5 years...

864
00:46:58,362 --> 00:47:00,387
Beach house in L.A.,

865
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:01,398
penthouse in New York,

866
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:03,195
maybe one or two movies a year.

867
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:05,862
Fly to places
like ltaly or Spain.

868
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:07,536
<i>[chuckles]</i>

869
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,672
What's so funny?

870
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:11,334
Nothing.

871
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,741
Spain is--

872
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:15,711
Spain's awesome, man.

873
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:19,739
So...

874
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:22,149
What happens when
everything doesn't go

875
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,619
according to your plan?

876
00:47:23,654 --> 00:47:25,212
Well, l can work it.

877
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:28,123
<i>Judas Kiss</i> proves
what l can do.

878
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,889
Yeah, but there's lots of
great films in this festival.

879
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:33,892
What if it doesn't win?

880
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:37,259
<i>O</i>r what if you hit massive
writer's block one day?

881
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,359
Excuse me?

882
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,267
What if you don't become rich?

883
00:47:40,304 --> 00:47:41,271
No fancy houses.

884
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,500
You're just a part-time waiter

885
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,372
who shoots wedding videos
on the weekends

886
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:47,468
for some millionaire's
spoiled daughter?

887
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,839
Are you supposed to be
asking me questions like this?

888
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,175
You shouldn't be afraid
of questions, Danny.

889
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,788
l'm not afraid.

890
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:03,384
All l'm asking is,

891
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:06,157
what happens when you don't
get what you want?

892
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:09,257
Look, l'm just focusing on
my goals right now.

893
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,327
lt sounds to me like you're
focusing more on the rewards.

894
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:17,798
What if you don't have
what it takes?

895
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,447
<i>O</i>kay, great.

896
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,812
Ralph, your turn.

897
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:29,842
Um, Danny, let's talk about
the lighting schemes you chose

898
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:33,186
and how you used light to
heighten the dramatic tension

899
00:48:33,224 --> 00:48:35,317
between the father and the son.

900
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:39,821
Whaddya say, boys?

901
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:41,296
Lunch?

902
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:42,822
Uh, you two go ahead.

903
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:45,562
l'll catch up
after my cigarette.

904

01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:18,011
The way he calls me C.W.,

1084
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:21,182
l swear, he made me
hate my own name.

1085
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:23,158
He promised me everything,

1086
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:25,058
anything l wanted.

1087
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:27,154
Until Mommy and
Daddy Lyons met me,

1088
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:33,329
and my films were too weird,
too bloody.

1089
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,598
Too bloody weird.

1090
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:41,603
So when do you meet them?

1091
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:44,078
Today...

1092
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:46,014
At the luncheon.

1093
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:49,312
Come here.

1094
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,455
You think l'm scared of Shane?

1095
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:59,326
Nothing compares to how
scared he is of his parents.

1096
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:01,330
Think about what you're doing.

1097
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:08,028
l don't have a choice...

1098
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:10,096
Look, l told you about my dad.

1099
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,505
l need Shane's help.

1100
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:17,139
Those pills
he's been feeding you...

1101
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,511
they helping?

1102
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,551
My dad's cutting me loose,

1103
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:24,519
one of the judges
is out to get me.

1104
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,613
l could lose everything.

1105
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:29,250
l need a place to stay,
a job, money.

1106
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:33,496
Shane can get me
all those things.

1107
01:02:35,231 --> 01:02:38,598
So you and me...
we're off the table.

1108
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:42,530
Well, maybe we could, uh...

1109
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,767
Look.

1110
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:47,800
Whatever you've
done to get here,

1111
01:02:48,044 --> 01:02:50,604
l'll stand by you.

1112
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,615
l'll be your friend.

1113
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:55,677
But so long as
you're with Shane,

1114
01:02:55,718 --> 01:02:57,481
there can never be an us.

you've decided today

1133
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:29,669
about Danny's future
changes everything for you.

1134
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,434
Why am l so important?

1135
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,965
Did you even look around as you
announced my name out there?

1136
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,541
No one knew me.

1137
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:37,341
l know.

1138
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:41,715
You actually remember me?

Faces and films.

1140
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,949
Frankly, with you,
it was more about the film,

1141
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:49,982
the one that got you
into this competition.

1142
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:52,925
Your face was pretty,

1143
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:56,420
but your <i>Judas Kiss</i>
was horrifying.

1144
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:59,663
l've never been able
to get it out of my mind.

1145
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,603
Well, it wasn't a horror film.

1146
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:06,969
You can't take a compliment,
can you?

1147
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:10,343
That was supposed to be nice?

1148
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,871
Would you like my critique?

1149
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:15,850
Yes. No.

1150
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:19,321
How did you even know
what l decided to do?

1151
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:22,847

This roller coaster ride's
almost over.

1157

You just need to take
the last loop.

you fucking <i>mus</i>.

01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:15,364
Dude, everyone's looking
for you.

1262
01:13:15,404 --> 01:13:16,701
lt's a fucking shit storm.

1263
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:23,839
l had to wait until l could
confirm the allegation.

1264
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:27,042
The <i>Judas Kiss</i> screenplay
was written before

1265
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,382
Mr. Reyes' matriculation
at Keystone.

1266

Rough life.

1270
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,360
l used to come
up here myself

1271

when l was upset
about something,

1272
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:53,707
which was often
back in the day.

1273

Drama, drama, drama.

1274
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:05,185
Not that l'm ungrateful,

1275
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:07,280
but what are you doing here?

1276
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:12,283
Walking down memory lane,

<i>[chuckles]</i>

1278
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:16,356
Looks like you tripped over
someone yourself.

1279
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,930
Just a little disagreement
with myself.

1280
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:26,305
l hope you knocked
some sense into yourself.

1281
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:28,242
And then some.

1282
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:30,245
l'm a mean son of a bitch.

1283
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,310

1284
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:37,216
l've decided to quit.

1285
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:39,483
Well, you're a better man
than me.

1286
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:42,491
l've learned to take a punch
better than you.

1287
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:55,032
l want to roll back
this roller coaster

1288

1289
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,976

''Welds.''

1292
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:09,985
That's just a typo, isn't it?

1293
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:14,853
Frigging university's
too cheap to replace it.

1294
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:19,193
You still go by Zachary?

1295
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:24,358
No one could ever get used
to calling me that.

1296
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,368
Yeah, tell me about it.

1297
01:15:29,004 --> 01:15:33,498
Well, no offense, old man,
but after tonight,

1300

So what if it's
