1
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,885
I'm telling you, Arnold,
your ball is flat.

2
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,801
It's not flat.
It's just a little low on air.

3
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,039
Like I said, your ball is flat.

4
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:20,358
I can't believe
we let those fifth graders beat us.

5
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:25,157
- The thing is we tried our best.
- We got our buns whupped.

6
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:28,285
Come on, we had fun.
And we almost beat 'em.

7
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:32,599
Why do you always have
to look on the bright side?

8
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,485
Somebody has to.

9
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,841
- Mr Green, what's going on?
- It's Scheck.

10
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:47,125
He wants to knock down the whole
neighborhood and put up a fancy mall.

11
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,925
Who's Scheck?

12
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,760
<i>The plan, approved</i>
<i>by the mayor moments ago,</i>

13
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,885
<i>would allow Future Tech Industries</i>
<i>to redevelop</i>

14
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:59,438
<i>a six-square-block area</i>
<i>between 33rd and 39th Streets.</i>

15
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:02,758
I understand the president and CEO
of Future Tech Industries,

16
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:06,556
Mr Scheck,
is about to make a statement.

17
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:11,677
I'm delighted at the mayor's
support of our renewal plan.

18
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,724
- Nice suit.
- Sh!

19
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:17,562
I am behind
Mr Scheck's project 100%.

20
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:21,964
Although some of you
may have concerns

21
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:25,199
about how this plan will impact
your homes and businesses,

22
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,927
I assure you, change is good.

23
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:31,124
This plan represents
the end of urban decay,

24
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,643
the end of your broken-down shops
and apartment buildings,

25
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:37,924
the end of antiquated
and dilapidated storefronts.

26
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:42,239
It's time for a new world.
Out with the old, in with the new.

27
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:45,205
What's wrong with old things?
Some are great.

28
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,006
- Yeah, like Mrs Vitello.
- Whippersnapper.

29
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:54,325
The city council are against it,
but the mayor's lettin' him do it.

30
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,923
- I never figured he'd pull it off.
- What does it mean?

31
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:03,241
They want us to move away
so Scheck's corporation can move in.

32
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:06,319
- No!
- No way!

33
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,362
It's time to put the past behind us.

34
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:14,157
I have seen the future,
and it's Future Tech Industries.

35
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:19,003
- But this is our neighborhood.
- They can't just tear it down.

36
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,847
<i>This is our neighborhood</i>

37
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:25,204
<i>How can they tear it down</i>

38
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,803
<i>How can they turn our smile</i>

39
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,197
<i>Into a frown</i>

40
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:35,686
<i>We may be just a few</i>

41
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:38,645
<i>But if me and you and you</i>

42
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:43,403
- No. No singing, Eugene.
- I thought the occasion called for it.

43
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:48,038
- <i>We may be just a few...</i>
- No. This is serious.

44
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,080
Oh, my...

45
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,887
We can't take this lying down.
We should do something.

46
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,518
- Yeah, but what can we do?
- We can refuse to sell our houses.

47
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,599
Sign a petition!

48
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:10,922
This is our neighborhood and
we're not giving it up without a fight!

49
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:14,318
Arnold! What an annoying
little goody two-shoes.

50
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,556
What a dopey little dreamer.
What a corny little cornball.

51
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:23,323
Always trying to get everyone
to look on the bright side.

52
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:27,275
How I despise him. And yet...

53
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:33,365
I love him! I love his unerring sense
of right and wrong.

54
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:37,361
I love his insistence on the needs of
the many over the needs of the few.

55
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,759
I love most how
his hair smells up close,

56
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:45,239
then he looks at me and
I make an excuse for being so close.

57
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,683
Then I insult him to cover up
the secret, adoring feelings

58
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:53,523
which I have so long
and painfully harbored. Oh, Arnold!

59
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,475
- Mr Green can write the petition.
- Say no more. I'm already on it.

60
00:05:57,647 --> 00:05:59,638
If only I had the guts to tell you.

61
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:03,516
If only I weren't such a coward
and had your strength.

62
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,643
We'll get everybody to sign.

63
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,401
What if you lose
and the neighborhood is torn down,

64
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,559
you move away
and we never see each other again

65
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:16,084
and I never tell you
how I really feel about you?

66
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,966
Oh, Arnold, how I love you.

67
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,526
Dad!

68
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:31,205
- How's it going, Miriam?
- Molasses, it's you.

69
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,441
- Great, but where does the store go?
- Here. Big Bob's Beeper Emporium.

70
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:39,759
Big sign, can't miss it, and the overpass
drops you right in the parkin' lot.

71
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:43,203
- That's good. Right in the stinkin' lot.
- Dad?

72
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,801
- What, Olga?
- It's Helga, Dad.

73
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,322
- That's what I said.
- Could we talk?

74
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:51,126
- We gotta split. We'll talk.
- Right.

75
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,080
Send me the paperwork.
I can't wait to start.

76
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,841
- Can I keep this pop-up thing?
- You got it.

77
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:59,123
Know what this is? It's our future.

78
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:02,245
Here's where my new Super
Beeper Emporium is gonna go up,

79
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:06,639
right after we rip down the flower shop,
Green Meats and the rest.

80
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:10,641
Yeah, about all that... Lots of people
will have to sell up and move.

81
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,240
What's your point?

82
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,921
I was just wondering if this whole
tear-down-the-neighborhood

83
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,725
Future Tech thing is really necessary.

84
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,879
It's more than necessary.
It's progress.

85
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,800
You can't have progress without pain.
No pain, no gain.

86
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:26,437
What's wrong with leaving things
the way they are?

87
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:30,486
Leave things the way they are and
Big Bob's Emporium doesn't happen.

88
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,239
But, Dad...

89
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:36,446
I'll say this once, and I want
you to hear it. Change is good.

90
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,246
When the new Big Bob's
Super Beeper Emporium goes up,

91
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,797
the cash will roll in and
you'll forget the old neighborhood.

92
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:47,438
And do you know why?
Because we'll be rich.

93
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:51,122
That means you'll be rich.
You can have that pony.

94
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,279
- I wanted a pony when I was five.
- What do you want now?

95
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,881
- I don't know.
- Make up your mind,

96
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:01,518
'cause once my store goes up,
you can have anything you want.

97
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,362
- Anything?
- That's what I said.

98
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:11,076
We're gonna be
stinkin' rich, girl. Rich.

99
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:14,603
What's more important
than that, huh?

100
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,767
- Grandpa?
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.

101
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:38,719
- Grandpa, I'm worried.
- Oh, don't worry, Arnold.

102
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:42,482
We won't sell up.
We're right behind you. Right, pookie?

103
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:47,846
Home team, home team, woo!

104
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,398
What if Scheck
makes everyone else sell?

105
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,116
Then I guess they'll bulldoze
down the neighborhood.

106
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,563
We'll have to move
to an old folks' home

107
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:00,524
and who knows
what'll happen to you.

108
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,518
You'll probably be sent
to a foster home

109
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,838
in some Midwestern state
like Manitoba or...

110
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,316
Wait. No, that's not a state,
that's a province.

111
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,637
Oh, no, Arnold!
You'll be a Canadian!

112
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:14,959
- Grandpa, I'm serious.
- I know, but we're not cooked yet.

113
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,482
Whatever happens, we'll all be OK,

114
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,524
even if we have to become Canadians.

115
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,440
They have very good bacon there.

116
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,480
Canadian. Bacon. This thing on?
Come on, Arnold. Work with me.

117
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,399
Goodnight, Grandpa.

118
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,082
- Goodnight, Grandma.
- Go, team!

119
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,326
Awesome!

120
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,286
Release.

121
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,524
- What's going on?
- You must be a sound sleeper.

122
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,757
They've been hammering
on it all morning.

123
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,645
- Look!
- Willikers!

124
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,526
- It's so wicked awesome.
- It's not awesome.

125
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,566
It's terrible. Read it. We've got
30 days to save the neighborhood.

126
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:10,638
Look, it's that Scheck fella.

127
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:15,403
<i>It's time for a new world.</i>
<i>Out with the old, in with the new.</i>

128
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:19,276
<i>I have seen the future</i>
<i>and it's Future Tech Industries.</i>

129
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,802
He sure gives me the willies.

130
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,356
But he looks good in a suit.

131
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:27,405
- Gerald.
- I know. I'm just saying.

132
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,205
Come on!

133
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,886
Monkeyman!

134
00:10:56,887 --> 00:11:00,721
Yeah, six days to go,
and then sayonara, suckers!

135
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:05,881
Six days. Enough time to try
maybe one last big thing.

136
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,402
- But what?
- How about a party?

137
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,081
You always throw the most
<i>outré</i> parties, Arnold.

138
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:14,478
Yeah, a party. A block party.
With music and food.

139
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,525
- And finger sandwiches.
- And food!

140
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:21,077
We'll have a concert so loud
we'll get on the news.

141
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,239
Then people would get excited and
the mayor will have to change her mind.

142
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,716
And she'll stop the bulldozers.

143
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,559
What do we call it?

144
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,287
Save the Neighborhood
Debutante Ball.

145
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:32,800
Block Power, baby.

146
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,117
- Blockenanny.
- Block Till You Drop.

147
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:37,676
It's a Block Thing.
Y'all wouldn't know.

148
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,997
A Block Party... Party?

149
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,443
- How about Blockapalooza?
- Yeah!

150
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:47,441
- Blockapalooza.
- This Saturday is the day.

151
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,077
- Blockapalooza!
- Get your tickets while they're hot!

152
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:55,286
"Save the neighborhood"?
"Blockapalooza"? This we don't need.

153
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,200
It's Nick. I think we got a problem.

154
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,000
Blockapalooza, hah! Please.

155
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,035
It's called Blockapalooza,
a last-ditch effort to save

156
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:33,880
a forgotten neighborhood
from the wrecking ball.

157
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:38,165
A classic story of the little guy
pitted against the corporate giant.

158
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:42,559
- They'll mess up the deal!
- Forget it. It's all taken care of.

159
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,639
<i>This is our last chance to stand up</i>

160
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,367
<i>and tell Future Tech Industries</i>
<i>we won't sell.</i>

161
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,405
<i>We won't let 'em tear down</i>
<i>our neighborhood.</i>

162
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:55,355
We intercepted their permit,
making the whole assemblage illegal.

163
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,443
Go, go, go.

164
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,920
- What's going on?
- This whole assemblage is illegal.

165
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:14,160
- But we filed a permit.
- We never got any permit.

166
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,878
<i>Disperse from this area at once.</i>

167
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,961
- Grandma?
- Bring on your worst.

168
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,881
- We shall not be moved.
- Come on. Nice and easy.

169
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,761
Stop! That's a frail old lady.

170
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,487
Never give up. Never give in.

171
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,084
Save the neighborhood.
One if by land, two if by sea.

172
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,922
Put the lime in the coconut.
Mix it all up.

173
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:54,476
Well, that's it.
This place belongs to Scheck now.

174
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,366
They've got the cops
on their side. I give up.

175
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:00,246
Me too. I'm selling my place.

176
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,762
Goodbye, old neighborhood.
I'll miss you.

177
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,246
Selling?

178
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,285
I'll go try
and get Grandma out of jail.

179
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:12,760
- Then we'd better get packing.
- We can't give up. It's not over.

180
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:17,603
That Scheck character has us
covered from every angle, short man.

181
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:20,235
Wait! Where are you all going?

182
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:24,079
Come back. Come back.

183
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:31,358
<i>Out with the old, in with the new.</i>
<i>I've seen the future. Change is good.</i>

184
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,644
Only two more days.

185
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,685
There's gotta be some way
to stop the bulldozers.

186
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,883
There's nothing more we can do.

187
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,642
Face it. In two days,
this neighborhood is coming down

188
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,640
and we'll just have to move on.

189
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,644
I just want to do something.
Baby carriage!

190
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:02,163
I see it. Saving the neighborhood
isn't a game.

191
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,206
It's real life. And in real life,
you can't always win.

192
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:13,561
I can win Runaway Bus every time
but that's because it's a game.

193
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:18,517
- I guess.
- You did your best, buddy.

194
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,518
What are you guys doing?

195
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:32,076
Just looking at a piece of history.

196
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:36,081
Four years ago, we made
these handprints in the cement.

197
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,397
"Sid and Stink."

198
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,525
- Sid and Stink?
- It only says Stink

199
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:45,202
because just when
I was fixing to write the Y,

200
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:49,485
Sid's old man came along,
and we had to hightail it.

201
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,525
I always thought
that made it even cooler.

202
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:56,600
We thought it'd be there forever, but
after they tear down the neighborhood,

203
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,122
I reckon nobody'll even remember.

204
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:00,686
Yeah.

205
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:13,366
- Hi, Mr Green.
- Look, that was me, aged four.

206
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:16,200
My grandfather did it.
He was proud of me.

207
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:20,599
He used to say, "One day,
Green Meats will be your shop."

208
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:26,478
<i>Sure enough, my father took it over</i>
<i>and then he passed it on to me.</i>

209
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:30,401
<i>That was the proudest day of my life.</i>

210
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:35,439
<i>I always knew one day I'd pass</i>
<i>the shop on to my own son.</i>

211
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:39,801
I guess now that's never gonna happen.

212
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,280
Because they're tearing
down the neighborhood?

213
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:47,201
No. Because my son hates meat.
He's a vegetarian.

214
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,323
We haven't spoken in years.

215
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:55,242
Still, I never thought I'd be
the last Green to run Green Meats.

216
00:16:55,407 --> 00:17:01,516
Another couple of days,
it's all gonna be just a pile of bricks.

217
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,599
Excuse me, Arnold.

218
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,758
- Grandma?
- Still in jail.

219
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,522
- I thought it was just one night.
- She keeps trying to escape.

220
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:22,157
Thinks it's a game.
Fourth time they put her back.

221
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,204
Hi. Have you seen Grandpa?

222
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,042
Oh, Arnold. We may never
see each other again.

223
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,523
Mr Hyunh, can I help you
clean out your refrigiterator?

224
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:54,916
- Grandpa, what are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.

225
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,839
You haven't sold the house yet.

226
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,716
It's only a matter of time.
Everyone else has sold.

227
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:05,085
Scheck owns the whole block now,
except for us. I have to sell.

228
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,966
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither.

229
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,924
I was born in this house.

230
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,841
My dad got it in the 1890s,
over a hundred years ago.

231
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:18,478
Won it in a card game from a man his
dad had fought in the Tomato Incident.

232
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:22,003
- The Tomato Incident?
- Yes, the Tomato Incident.

233
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,362
Now, that was a good story.

234
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:28,406
<i>The Yanks won rights</i>
<i>to this land after the Pig War.</i>

235
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,445
<i>But we still paid</i>
<i>taxes to the British</i>

236
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:35,680
<i>on all sorts of goods, including</i>
<i>tobacco, meats and vegetables.</i>

237
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,442
<i>The whole town was in a snit</i>
<i>over a new tomato tax.</i>

238
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,485
<i>The Brits were adding a nickel</i>
<i>on every tomato.</i>

239
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,366
<i>People were spoiling for a fight.</i>

240
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,722
- What happened?
- The Tomato Incident.

241
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:50,162
My grandpa and his neighbors
overturned a cart

242
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:53,046
of British tomatoes on this very street.

243
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:56,916
Soldiers were sent to arrest him
by order of the colonial governor,

244
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,442
Archibald Von Scheck.

245
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:03,077
- Von Scheck?
- I wonder if he's any relation.

246
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,124
Von Scheck's men
attacked the neighborhood

247
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,596
but the locals used
guerrilla warfare.

248
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,156
They made a barricade
of vegetable carts

249
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:14,525
and fought with whatever they had.
They had lots of tomatoes.

250
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,645
<i>They were British tomatoes,</i>
<i>which were small and hard</i>

251
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:21,197
<i>and really hurt</i>
<i>if you got hit with one.</i>

252
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,160
Let her rip.

253
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:30,605
<i>That did it. The redcoats were</i>
<i>in full, ignominious retreat.</i>

254
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,396
That's why we eat
American tomatoes, Arnold.

255
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,764
Although I had one recently
from Chile. Very juicy.

256
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,395
- Did that actually happen?
- Of course.

257
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:44,401
- I sliced it up and put it in a sandwich.
- No. Don't you see?

258
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,956
- This is our answer.
- Yes!

259
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:50,437
Juicy tomatoes from Chile.
Why didn't I think of that?

260
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,165
No, the Tomato Incident.

261
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,319
If that battle happened right here,
this whole neighborhood

262
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,205
should be a national landmark.

263
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,645
There probably was a document that
declared this block a historic site once.

264
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:07,404
Maybe I can find it. I show it to the
mayor, and she'll stop the bulldozers.

265
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,603
They couldn't tear down
these buildings ever!

266
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,327
Mr Green and Mrs Vitello
could keep their shops,

267
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,955
Sid and Stinky's
handprints would stay,

268
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,722
and you, Grandma, and me
could keep living like before.

269
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:22,800
Nothing would change. Grandpa,
don't sell the boarding house.

270
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,356
I'll find that document
and save the neighborhood.

271
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:28,087
You're a bold kid. I'm with you!

272
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:33,116
But you better hurry before the
bulldozers knock down the whole thing.

273
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:39,641
<i>Change is good. I've seen the future</i>
<i>and the future is FTI.</i>

274
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:46,805
My Emporium goes here where
we're knocking down these old shops?

275
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:49,117
- Right.
- That's in the contract?

276
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,040
- Absolutely.
- There's no funny business?

277
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:57,520
Am I a rat fink? It's all on the up-and-up.
Trust me. All you gotta do is sign.

278
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:04,963
Big... Bob... Pataki!

279
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,958
Beautiful. It's all settled.

280
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:10,961
In two days, we'll tear down the old
and make way for the new.

281
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:15,757
Then all we gotta do is sit back
and watch the moolah roll in.

282
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:19,840
- You've got a way with words.
- Can I keep the pen?

283
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,682
Oh, Arnold,
another moral dilemma...

284
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:36,079
Stick with Big Bob and get rich
or find some way to help you,

285
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:40,160
my beloved, noble Arnold,
whom I have so long adored.

286
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,559
If only I knew what to do.
If only I had a sign.

287
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,558
Perfect.

288
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,922
OK, Arnold, you convinced me.

289
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:57,636
We find that document, show the
mayor, prove that the neighborhood

290
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:02,085
is a legal national landmark
and stop the bulldozers.

291
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:07,560
And we're gonna do it all
in the next 46 hours and 19 minutes.

292
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:11,117
- Right.
- Should be plenty of time.

293
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:18,961
Arnold! I mean, watch where
you're going, football head.

294
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,958
Sorry. We're in a hurry.

295
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:24,164
We've gotta find a document
to save the neighborhood.

296
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:28,081
If you think you're gonna save it
you're dopier than I thought.

297
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,805
All the papers are signed.

298
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:33,198
In two days,
this place is gonna be a parking lot.

299
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,278
End of story. Any questions?

300
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:39,281
Yeah. Do you think you could
lend us bus fare?

301
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:43,918
- We're a little short, Helga.
- It's like I'm living in Loser City.

302
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:47,397
Since my dad's Super Emporium
is gonna be built

303
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,196
on the ashes of your old lives,
and I'm gonna get rich,

304
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,484
I guess I can give you
change for the bus.

305
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:55,966
Thanks.

306
00:22:56,127 --> 00:23:00,006
Good luck.
You're gonna need it, losers.

307
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,886
Where are we going?

308
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:06,323
To the one person
that can help us: Mr Bailey.

309
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:10,765
- At the Federal Office of Information?
- Right. I know he can help us.

310
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:15,446
I can't help you.
C-A-N, apostrophe, T. Can't.

311
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,325
But this is important.

312
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:20,843
So is my job.
Look at all this work I got.

313
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:25,842
I have no time to check on a document
that was probably lost 50 years ago.

314
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:29,204
Leave me alone. I don't know
how you got in here anyway.

315
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,360
But if we don't find that document,
everything's gonna be torn down:

316
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:36,485
Mr Green's butcher shop,
Mrs Vitello's flower shop.

317
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,638
The video store, the arcade.

318
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,765
How many ways can I say it?
I can't help you.

319
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:44,566
Bowling alley. Slausen's ice cream.

320
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:48,117
- I don't want to lose my patience.
- Dolly's Donuts.

321
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:52,963
- Dolly's Donuts?
- Yeah. That great donut shop.

322
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:56,563
- What did you say?
- Just that it's a shame

323
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,287
they're gonna tear down
Dolly's Donuts.

324
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,520
Yeah. Dolly's Donuts.
Two days from now, they're history.

325
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,485
No more Dolly's Donuts, Mr Bailey.

326
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:10,401
But I love those donuts.
Nobody makes a cruller like Dolly.

327
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:15,402
I've been going to Dolly's every day for
30 years. I couldn't survive without 'em.

328
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:20,357
How can they tear down an institution
like Dolly's? That's just savage.

329
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:26,124
- I know. But, hey, what can you do?
- Right. See you, Mr Bailey.

330
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:29,996
Where are you going?
You want to save your neighborhood?

331
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,159
Come on, then.
We've got a document to find.

332
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:50,157
This is it. When the computer stops,
it'll spit out a card

333
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:52,443
telling us everything the system knows

334
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:55,405
about where
your tomato document is.

335
00:24:57,007 --> 00:25:00,841
"The location of your document
is unknown."

336
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:02,725
I'm sorry, boys.

337
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:06,800
- It's all right. Thanks for your help.
- You did your best.

338
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,998
What do we do now?

339
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:15,843
It's probably not worth mentioning,
but I know a guy, the city coroner...

340
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:19,238
He's kind of, well, a nut.

341
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:21,477
But he's a well-known history buff

342
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:25,276
and keeps all kinds of records
on old historical papers.

343
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,517
- Maybe he could help you.
- Where is he?

344
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:35,316
They look like they're closed.
Let's come back later.

345
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:38,479
- We don't have time. Come on.
- You first.

346
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:42,765
Hello?

347
00:25:56,247 --> 00:26:00,160
Hello! I was just taking a nap.
Did I scare you?

348
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,164
I scare most people.
Not intentionally, you understand.

349
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:10,243
Just the nature of the job.
Anyhoo, what can I do for you?

350
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:14,036
The Tomato Incident
did indeed happen.

351
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:20,077
In fact, it was a major historical
turning point in the birth of the country.

352
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,965
What about the document?

353
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,606
There was, as I recall, a document
stating that your neighborhood

354
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,077
was officially declared
a national landmark.

355
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:33,603
Not an especially well-known document,
but official nonetheless.

356
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:39,524
And I just may have a file on it.
I keep my historical records in here.

357
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:41,279
Wrong drawer.

358
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,963
Here we go. Tomato Incident...

359
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:48,721
Tomato Incident, Tomato Incident,
Tomato, Tomato, Tomato.

360
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,764
Tomato Incident! Here it is.

361
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:53,839
According to my records,
there was a document

362
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:58,717
detailing the official status of your
neighborhood as a national landmark.

363
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,526
- What happened to it?
- Let's see.

364
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:05,646
It was contained in a collection
of local historical papers

365
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:11,723
which were sold at auction five years
ago to a private corporation.

366
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:16,040
There's no record of a name,
but there is an address.

367
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:21,921
66613 Riverside Highway.

368
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,561
It's out on the peninsula.

369
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,325
Going to the peninsula?

370
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,797
Don't talk to the driver
while the bus is in motion.

371
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:41,166
- But the bus isn't in motion.
- Now it is. Get behind the yellow line.

372
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:49,920
66590, 66600.
We're close, Gerald.

373
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:01,523
Future Tech Industries.

374
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,520
- Future Tech Industries?
- They've got the document?

375
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:11,162
Future Tech has the document that
could save the neighborhood.

376
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:13,841
- Now what?
- We'll talk to Mr Scheck.

377
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,044
You can't talk to Mr Scheck
without an appointment.

378
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:20,165
- Then we'll make one.
- He doesn't make appointments.

379
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,915
All righty, then. Have a nice day.

380
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:25,759
Right. Goodbye.

381
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,285
- There's cameras everywhere.
- I think they're watching us.

382
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:41,277
Man, this is creepy.
Let's get away from here.

383
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,962
- Security?
- <i>Yes, Mr Scheck?</i>

384
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:50,166
<i>There are two boys in the hallway,</i>
<i>40 feet from your security desk.</i>

385
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:53,524
- <i>What? Sir, I...</i>
- Apprehend them

386
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:55,564
and bring them to my office.

387
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:59,356
<i>Life is just a bowl of cherries</i>

388
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,676
We found these boys
wandering the halls unescorted.

389
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,645
- Without security clearance?
- That's right, sir.

390
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:12,479
This is serious, isn't it?

391
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:16,083
We can't have young boys wandering
around Future Tech Industries

392
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,841
unescorted without security
clearance, now, can we?

393
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,202
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

394
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,245
And these small boys
just snuck past security

395
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:27,843
and wandered about the building
unescorted. Right?

396
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,317
- Yes, sir.
- Who's responsible for that?

397
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,205
Aren't you head of security?

398
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,359
- Sir, yes, sir.
- "Sir. Yes, sir."

399
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,803
- Is that all you can say?
- No, sir. I mean, yes, sir.

400
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:44,199
There he goes again.
Why don't you just go now.

401
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,642
Go back to being head of security.

402
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:51,278
How many others are wandering
around Future Tech unescorted

403
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:56,521
while you stand here like a big,
dumb stiff repeating "Sir, yes, sir."

404
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,484
Yes, sir!

405
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,963
What can you do with him?
He's like a wind-up doll.

406
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,516
"Yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir."

407
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:09,282
I'll tell you, it's hard
to get good help nowadays.

408
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:12,519
It must be upsetting to be
dragged unceremoniously

409
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:15,918
into my office like this,
but I can't have boys

410
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:19,602
wandering the halls of my company
unescorted. You understand?

411
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,758
My name is Scheck.
Who are you?

412
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:25,397
We live in the neighborhood
you want to tear down.

413
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,798
- That I'm going to tear down.
- We heard there's a document

414
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:33,119
saying it's a national landmark
and can't be torn down by anybody.

415
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:36,996
I've heard about that, too.
I had my people investigate.

416
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,682
You know what they found?
The document doesn't exist.

417
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,600
The whole thing's
just a rumor, bogus.

418
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:47,840
If there were such a document,
I'd never go through with my plan.

419
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:52,125
But it must exist. It was
part of a historical paper collection.

420
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:55,324
Look, as much
as I admire your thoroughness

421
00:30:55,487 --> 00:31:01,198
and direct approach, the fact remains,
neither you nor I have the document.

422
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,597
So the neighborhood's coming down.
Any questions?

423
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:07,601
What if we said
we don't buy your story?

424
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,519
Security.

425
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:13,686
That went well.

426
00:31:13,847 --> 00:31:16,566
Scheck is not a good man.
But he's a natty dresser.

427
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:30,244
- What's wrong?
- I just had an interesting conversation

428
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,843
with two young boys:
One had a weird stack of hair,

429
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:35,963
the other was a football-headed kid.

430
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:40,166
Bob, know anything
about a football-headed kid?

431
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:43,160
I don't know nothing about
no football-headed kid.

432
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:47,684
Are you sure? Because
there was one nosing around here

433
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:51,283
asking about that document.
You know the one I mean.

434
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:54,359
The document that could
mess up our whole operation?

435
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:57,883
It's locked in the records room.
Nobody has a key except us.

436
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:03,599
I haven't seen a kid like that around,
but I will keep my eyes open.

437
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,007
I'm not ready to give up yet.

438
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:12,604
You're gonna have to face the facts:
There's nothing we can do.

439
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:16,476
- There's gotta be something.
- It would take a miracle.

440
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:20,686
- Hello?
- <i>The document you seek exists.</i>

441
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:23,281
- <i>They're hiding it from you.</i>
- Who is this?

442
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:25,278
- <i>Call me Deep Voice.</i>
- Who are you?

443
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:29,235
<i>I can't say, but I can tell you</i>
<i>that Scheck is up to no good.</i>

444
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:32,080
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that can stop him is that document.</i>

445
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,364
- <i>How do you know about it?</i>
- Let's just say I know.

446
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:39,236
- Where is the document?
- At FTI in a safe deposit box.

447
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,126
- Nick Vermicelli has the key.
- But how?

448
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:45,199
<i>Follow Nick and you'll find the key.</i>
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

449
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,517
<i>But wait! Who are you?</i>

450
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:54,957
That is too freaky. I'm sorry I ever
doubted you. I'm in. What's the plan?

451
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:58,756
We find Nick Vermicelli.
Then we spy on him,

452
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:03,045
until we find out where he's hiding
the key to the safe deposit box.

453
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:08,235
We steal the key, sneak in to FTI
and get the document.

454
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:10,477
We evade the security guards,

455
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:14,686
then all we have to do is
deliver the document to the mayor,

456
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:18,317
who declares the neighborhood
a landmark and stops the bulldozers.

457
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:20,762
Arnold, that's a long plan.

458
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,441
I know. But we gotta do it.

459
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,359
We'll need some special equipment.

460
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:28,997
This may sound crazy,
but I've heard of this girl, Bridget,

461
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:33,718
who lives across town,
kind of an equipment specialist.

462
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:40,237
- Is this right?
- It's the address Fuzzy Slippers gave.

463
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:44,525
- How do you know she'll help?
- Because Bridget helps people.

464
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:46,564
That's how the legend goes.

465
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:51,002
- Maybe she's not home.
- What's this button?

466
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,796
- You shouldn't touch that.
- What could happen?

467
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:10,002
- Which one of you touched my button?
- Me.

468
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:27,278
If you're gonna save the neighborhood,
you're gonna need some equipment.

469
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:30,966
State of the art.
Mini condenser microphone

470
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,879
for the ultimate concealed surveillance.

471
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:34,958
Headphones and micro-radar
tracking dish.

472
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:39,643
400:1 zoom lens binoculars with
infrared capability for night vision.

473
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:42,844
High tension, plastic wire, anodized
steel pulleys and nylon straps

474
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,760
for maneuvering in
vertically-challenging situations.

475
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,760
A two-way secure walkie-talkie
for maintaining communication.

476
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:51,487
And a synchronized, programmable,

477
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,842
glow-in-the-dark watch
set to Greenwich time

478
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,316
and accurate
within 1/10,000th of a second.

479
00:34:56,487 --> 00:35:00,116
It all fits into this cool
AS-47 Junior Secret Agent utility belt.

480
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,198
How much does this cost?

481
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,677
Since it's for a good cause,
it's on the house.

482
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:10,125
- I figure it's my contribution.
- Great. We'll take two.

483
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,801
- Do they come in other colors?
- Black or pink.

484
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,606
- We'll take black.
- What about this?

485
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,998
- Why do we need a remote-control car?
- You never know.

486
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,522
Whatever you say.

487
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:30,724
The neighborhood is counting on you.
Good luck, boys.

488
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:47,323
- What are you doing here?
- Walking, until you knocked me down.

489
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,045
Sorry. We were just...

490
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:53,405
Out playing your dumb secret agent
game. Aren't you a little old for that?

491
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,444
Come on. We got things to do.

492
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,519
What, some new plan
to save the neighborhood?

493
00:35:58,687 --> 00:36:00,279
- That's right.
- Let's roll.

494
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:04,076
Take off those lame shades
so you can see where you're walking.

495
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:08,081
Good luck, Hardy Boys.
You're gonna need it.

496
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:10,920
Oh, my brave little
football-headed hero

497
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,839
on yet another absurd quest,

498
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,237
to save the only home
you've ever known,

499
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:20,435
armed with nothing but your best friend
and your sporty utility belt.

500
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:24,725
Godspeed, my steed,
my only, my love.

501
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,402
This is the place.

502
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:38,837
Could you open the door?
We need to get out really bad.

503
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:43,797
- We gotta follow him. He's got a key.
- The bus stops at the corner of 43rd.

504
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,566
Juvenile delinquents.

505
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:01,526
- We're way under 21.
- Maybe we can get in around back.

506
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:05,122
<i>Ain't this a great old block</i>

507
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:08,757
<i>Don't you wish we could</i>
<i>roll back the clock</i>

508
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,237
<i>Oh, the windows we busted</i>
<i>The hubcaps we stole</i>

509
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:15,558
<i>The apples we boosted</i>
<i>The bums that we rolled</i>

510
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:18,799
<i>The fun that we had</i>
<i>violating parole</i>

511
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:23,916
- <i>Ain't this a great old block, Doc</i>
- Got her.

512
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:27,284
- What are they saying?
- So, is the key safe?

513
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:29,358
Course it's safe. I got it right here.

514
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:33,281
Good. We wouldn't want it
to fall into the wrong hands.

515
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,324
They're talking about a key.

516
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,842
Maybe it's the key
Deep Voice mentioned.

517
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,765
<i>Don't worry about the key.</i>

518
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,997
- What key?
- What's goin' on?

519
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,079
- What happened? Did I do that?
- Who's doing that?

520
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,360
This thing on?
Sorry about that, folks.

521
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:55,678
- <i>Hit it, Tony.</i>
- Get a busboy over here.

522
00:37:55,847 --> 00:38:00,557
Clean this up. Get us more drinks.
Yo, busboys! What are you, deaf?

523
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:04,845
Clean up this mess
or I'll make you wear it.

524
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,083
Look. The key. It's around his neck.

525
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:13,002
And get us two more Bartletts.
No ice this time. And no lipstick.

526
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:18,446
- We'll get those for you right away.
- Right away.

527
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:21,997
Football-headed kid!

528
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,964
Here's the deal.
The boys are risking their life

529
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:31,917
with some crazy plan to get a rare
historic document from Scheck

530
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,839
and they don't stand a chance.

531
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,522
We must think of a back-up scheme
that'll bail us out

532
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:40,247
when their crazy,
lamebrained plan fizzles.

533
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:45,606
So come on. Think of a plan.
It's got to be smart, logical and feasible.

534
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,725
We could paint the house
with vanishing cream.

535
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:53,722
- Then it would be invisible.
- That is the stupidest idea ever.

536
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:57,562
What if it rains? Ding-dong.
You ever think about that?

537
00:38:57,727 --> 00:39:02,482
It'll wash the vanishing cream off,
and then everyone'll see us.

538
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:07,038
What we gotta do is build a dummy
neighborhood one block over.

539
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,437
You're the dummy.
That will never work!

540
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:12,679
Yeah? I don't see you
coming up with anything.

541
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:16,601
Dig a little deeper
into the caverns of your puny mind.

542
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,839
Digging? Caverns?
Hey, wait a minute.

543
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:24,398
- That reminds me! The secret tunnels!
- What secret tunnels?

544
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:31,116
Pretty impressive, eh? A network
of tunnels that honeycomb the block

545
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,881
and possibly lead
to the rest of the neighborhood.

546
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:36,959
I hate it. It's dark, and it smells.

547
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,357
- It's very creepy.
- Let's go back.

548
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:41,199
Wait, wait. Listen.

549
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:45,645
One tunnel goes under the street
from our house to the one opposite.

550
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:49,846
If we wire it with explosives,
we'll blow a hole in the street

551
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,043
that the bulldozers can't cross.

552
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:56,962
Yeah? Just one little detail.
Where you gonna get the explosives?

553
00:39:57,127 --> 00:40:00,722
From you, of course.
Just go down to your job site

554
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:04,880
and lift a couple hundred pounds
of explosives when no one's looking.

555
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,762
That's the craziest thing I ever heard,

556
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:12,886
especially considering
I got twice that much under my bed.

557
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:15,925
What? We all got
our little peccadilloes.

558
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,806
- Finally.
- Let's hope he's ready for bed.

559
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,764
He should be. It's midnight.

560
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:51,318
As soon as he's asleep,
we can get the key off him.

561
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:56,478
As soon as he falls asleep? What
if he keeps watching TV for hours?

562
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:59,684
Maybe there's nothing good on.

563
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,477
Someone's calling him. Quick!

564
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:05,923
Last time we nearly got killed
using that thing.

565
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:08,476
We gotta find out who's calling him.

566
00:41:08,647 --> 00:41:12,242
- It might be a clue.
- All right.

567
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:18,561
- That's Big Bob.
- Yeah, Bob. You're a full partner.

568
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,036
What're you calling for?
What about your contract?

569
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:26,520
You got a problem with the contract?
Quit reading it and get some rest.

570
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:29,679
- Stinkin' pain in the...
- That no-good runt!

571
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:33,203
"Party of the first part,
party of the second part..."

572
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,278
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

573
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:37,756
Wait a minute. What the heck!

574
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:43,756
I think he's finally asleep, Gerald.

575
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:48,720
Give me that key!
I was just resting my eye.

576
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,718
- Time to go in.
- Wait.

577
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:52,798
You're not gonna hang from that?

578
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:55,765
- Not unless you want to.
- It's not my size.

579
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:15,125
No problem. I'll fix it.

580
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:18,885
Come on.
Almost there. You can do it.

581
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,607
What is that? Who's going?

582
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,480
It's an angel.

583
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:52,241
- <i>Good job getting the key.</i>
- Deep Voice. Where are you?

584
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:55,126
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I'm watching all your movements.</i>

585
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm everywhere and nowhere,
but mostly I'm everywhere.

586
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:01,085
Come on,
cut the voodoo dolly mumbo jumbo.

587
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,124
Why must you be so mysterious?

588
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:06,597
You seem confused
about who's calling the shots. I am.

589
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,565
<i>Without me,</i>
<i>you'll never get the document.</i>

590
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:13,515
You must get into Scheck's office.
His safe deposits are behind his desk.

591
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:18,078
- We have to get back into his office?
- Only this time, don't get caught.

592
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:21,796
<i>Find a way to distract security</i>
<i>away from the main entrance.</i>

593
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:25,642
Now, it's exactly two a.m.
The bulldozers roll at seven.

594
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:27,525
What are you waiting for?

595
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:31,125
Man, that Deep Voice
is a pain in the...

596
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,358
Come on.

597
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,438
It's us. How you been?

598
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:41,077
So it's the two juvenile delinquents
who busted my door.

599
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:45,286
Think you can make up your own rules,
come and go as you please?

600
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,802
Couple of renaissance men.

601
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:52,199
- Sorry about that.
- But we're kinda in a hurry... Murray.

602
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:56,042
Don't talk to the driver
while the vehicle's in motion.

603
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,437
The stinkin' bus is fallin' apart.

604
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:04,124
I know we're not supposed
to talk to you,

605
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:06,164
but could you drive a little faster?

606
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:10,161
I drive 25 miles an hour,
no exceptions, no discussion.

607
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:13,524
- I wonder what bee got in his boxers.
- You'd have one too

608
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,279
if you were in my moccasins.

609
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:19,122
My girlfriend left me two weeks ago.
Her name is Mona.

610
00:44:21,287 --> 00:44:25,838
- She said she wanted a whole man.
- What's that mean?

611
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:31,479
I lost the real one in the war.
She thought it was cool at first.

612
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:35,276
In walks Johnny Come Lately
and I'm out the doggie door.

613
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:39,759
You meet a girl. You think it's forever,
then the whole thing goes kablooey.

614
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,964
She broke my heart,
and although I still love her,

615
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:47,279
I made up my mind that from now on,
I ain't gonna care about nothin'

616
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:49,517
or stick my neck out for nobody.

617
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:54,636
- I'm only looking out for number one.
- That was an inspiring story.

618
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:58,163
Isn't there another bus
we can take to FTI?

619
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:23,686
Those cameras detect any motion.
If we move, they'll see us.

620
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,236
This is no time
for playing with toy cars.

621
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,716
I'm not playing, Gerald.

622
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:40,485
What was that?

623
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:44,037
We can get to Scheck's office
this way. Come on.

624
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:54,243
Deep Voice said to look
in the room behind his desk.

625
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:05,199
What are you waiting for?

626
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:14,320
We'd better get started.

627
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,161
That's the last of it, Gramps.

628
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:29,239
Now all we do
is run this wire up to the street

629
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:31,682
and wait for the bulldozers to come.

630
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:35,283
Then we blow a huge hole,
and they fall right in.

631
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:38,280
Sounds great.
Now, let's get out of here.

632
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:40,802
Yes, it is still very creepy.

633
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,401
Wake up!
I've just read the fine print.

634
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:56,401
So it's Scheck's Beeper Emporium, is it?
You're trying to double-cross me.

635
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,400
- I don't know what you mean.
- I read the contract!

636
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,924
I get a new Beeper Emporium,
but Scheck gets 51% of my company!

637
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,477
It's true, but you signed a contract.
There's nothing you can do.

638
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:10,002
- The ink's dry.
- You were in on it!

639
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:14,399
- You knew he was gonna shaft me!
- So what? It's a free country.

640
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:19,322
If it's a free country, I guess I'm free
to beat the living snot out of ya!

641
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:22,559
- Bob, don't get crazy.
- Too late!

642
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:11,840
The key. What happened?
Oh, no. That dream I had, that angel...

643
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:15,363
That wasn't no angel.
It was that football-headed kid!

644
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:20,726
It was really happening!
He must've stole the stinkin' key!

645
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:22,878
Yeah, Mr Scheck, it's me, Nick.

646
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,515
Bad news. I think I lost the key.

647
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:29,999
Yeah, the key. I think
that football-headed kid took it.

648
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,204
I was asleep.
I think he snuck in and stole it.

649
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:35,597
Yeah, I know.
I'm stupid, stupid.

650
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:38,440
997.

651
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:40,962
998.

652
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:44,957
999.

653
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:49,357
- Empty?
- Where's the document?

654
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:53,440
Looking for something?
Here you are, back again.

655
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:57,202
After I'd patiently explained
that your mission is hopeless.

656
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,086
It still is,
though I'm less inclined to entertain you

657
00:49:00,247 --> 00:49:02,442
after you broke into my building again.

658
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,723
You thought
you could get away with this?

659
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:08,323
There are cameras everywhere.
I record everything that goes on.

660
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,036
Did you think I'd let
you save your little neighborhood?

661
00:49:12,207 --> 00:49:15,995
Don't you realize who I am?
Alphonse Perrier De Von Scheck.

662
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,806
I can trace my ancestry
to the founding fathers.

663
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,197
Do you know when we lost control
of this city?

664
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:25,360
When that ridiculous Tomato Incident
took place in your neighborhood.

665
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:30,442
Tearing it down and putting my name in
its place will be the sweetest revenge.

666
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:33,360
But the document.
Where's the document?

667
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:38,442
Unfortunately, like your little plan,
it's about to go up in smoke.

668
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,843
My guards will now lock you away
where you won't cause more trouble.

669
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:58,806
Run!

670
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:04,002
Get them, for heaven's sake.

671
00:50:08,247 --> 00:50:09,839
They went thataway. Come on.

672
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,640
There they are!

673
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,685
I'll lose them on the stairway.
Head for the garage.

674
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:20,566
Find a way out.
Call me on the walkie.

675
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:37,519
<i>Arnold, what happened?</i>

676
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,962
- Where are you?
- <i>Where's the document?</i>

677
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:42,402
- Scheck burned it.
- Burned it?

678
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:45,206
Right in front of us.
He laughed at us.

679
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:48,006
He said we never had a chance.
He's gonna win.

680
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:51,000
- Don't give up.
- Why not? It's over.

681
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:53,078
It's not. There must be something.

682
00:50:53,247 --> 00:50:58,002
- Aren't there any other copies?
- No. He wouldn't make a copy.

683
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,443
There were video cameras
all over the place.

684
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:04,883
They record everything
that goes on in Scheck's building.

685
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:08,562
- Scheck said so himself.
- <i>The document must be on videotape.</i>

686
00:51:08,727 --> 00:51:11,321
Get to the room
with the video recorders,

687
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,523
find the tape and catch him
burning the document.

688
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,757
We can show the tape to the police

689
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:17,804
and it'll be as good
as the document itself.

690
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:21,926
We can win, Deep Voice.
We can save the neighborhood.

691
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,399
Down here.

692
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:38,319
What the?

693
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:51,845
<i>Warning: Intruder, level five.</i>

694
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:54,840
<i>Warning: Intruder, level five.</i>

695
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:12,439
- I got it!
- I thought he burned it.

696
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:17,886
And I got it all on videotape for the
police. It's just as good, maybe better.

697
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:21,198
I am moved by your greatness.
Get out of there!

698
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:22,959
I'll wait till the guards are gone.

699
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:26,563
I'm on the street.
I'll get a cab and meet you out front.

700
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,560
We've got 24 minutes
before the bulldozers roll.

701
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,083
We can make it.
See you in two, Gerald.

702
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:39,240
<i>Don't go out yet.</i>
<i>It's swarming with guards.</i>

703
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,159
How do you know I'm here?

704
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:44,558
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>You've got the evidence you need.</i>

705
00:53:44,727 --> 00:53:46,763
<i>We've got to get you out of the building.</i>

706
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:50,886
- If you're caught now, all is lost.
- How can I get out of here?

707
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:55,404
Wait until the guards go
to the other side of the building.

708
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,320
I'll distract them,
but it'll only buy you a few minutes.

709
00:53:58,487 --> 00:54:01,047
They're covering the elevators
and the stairs.

710
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:06,165
Don't come any closer.
Ignore that man with the voice box.

711
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,761
- Who are you?
- No one.

712
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:12,761
No more games. I'm not doing
anything until I know who you are.

713
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,521
You? You're Deep Voice?

714
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:21,918
- Looks like it.
- But I don't get it.

715
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:24,362
Why couldn't you just tell me?

716
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,758
- Why the secret identity?
- No reason.

717
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:30,760
You just risked everything to help me.

718
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:34,806
- So? What's your point?
- Pretty amazing thing to do.

719
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:39,438
- I'm a pretty amazing person.
- I thought you were on your dad's side.

720
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:42,246
- You were gonna get rich.
- Money isn't everything.

721
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,046
- Why'd you do it?
- It's my civic duty.

722
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:48,563
- 'Cause I love a good mystery.
- Come on. Why?

723
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:52,720
I don't know. Maybe I just took pity
on you and your stupid friends.

724
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:55,162
- Why?
- 'Cause...

725
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:57,682
...maybe I don't
hate you as much as I thought.

726
00:54:57,847 --> 00:55:02,796
Maybe I even like you a little.
You might even say I like you a lot.

727
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,605
You did this for me?

728
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:09,557
That's right. What do you do
when someone you love is in trouble?

729
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:12,924
- Love?
- You heard me. I love you.

730
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:15,237
Who else has been stalking you,

731
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:18,479
building shrines to you,
filling books with poems about you?

732
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:20,524
I love you.
I've always loved you

733
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:23,360
since I first saw
your stupid football head.

734
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:26,405
From that moment,
I've lived and breathed for you,

735
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:29,035
dreamed of telling
you my secret feelings,

736
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:31,675
and grabbing you and kissing you!

737
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:33,758
Come here, you big lug!

738
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:45,364
I'm confused.
Did you just say you loved me?

739
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:47,085
Are you deaf?

740
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,078
- Not now!
- Not now?

741
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,363
Oh, Arnold, just hold me.

742
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:57,716
- I need to think.
- Do the thinking for both of us now.

743
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:02,483
This is all happening too fast.
I feel dizzy. I need to lie down.

744
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:05,115
- Wonderful. I'll go with you.
- No.

745
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:09,565
There's no time. We've got
20 minutes before the bulldozers roll.

746
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,604
- Bulldozers?
- The neighborhood.

747
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:15,646
We have to save the neighborhood.
Come on. Let's roll.

748
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:28,526
Oh no.

749
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:31,281
I couldn't find a cab. Come on.

750
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,358
- What's she doing here?
- No time to explain.

751
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:36,883
We got exactly 16 minutes
to stop the bulldozers.

752
00:56:37,047 --> 00:56:38,958
Behind the yellow line.

753
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:45,686
That football-headed kid
and his little pals

754
00:56:45,847 --> 00:56:48,236
have the document on videotape
and they're headed uptown

755
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:50,716
on city bus number 13.

756
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:54,596
- Get 'em!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

757
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:57,600
All right, everybody, listen.
There's a bus headed uptown.

758
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:00,725
<i>Your job is to stop it.</i>

759
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:09,518
- Couldn't you go a little faster?
- 25 mph. No exceptions, no discussion.

760
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:12,247
- But lives are at stake.
- Not my problem.

761
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:15,524
The thing is, Murray,
we're in a hurry.

762
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:19,396
A neighborhood's about to be
torn down and we can stop 'em.

763
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:22,001
We have to get there in 14 minutes.

764
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,203
I'll get you there
when I get you there,

765
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:28,076
which, according to my schedule,
will be in about 44 minutes.

766
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:31,922
- That'll be too late.
- We have to get there in 14 minutes.

767
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:35,443
Then you're gonna have
to sprout wings and fly.

768
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:38,963
- Don't you wanna save people's homes?
- Not my problem.

769
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:41,721
Don't you care that every building
from 33rd to 39th Street

770
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,479
will be demolished?

771
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:46,320
- 33rd to 39th Street?
- Right.

772
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,718
That's where Mona lives.

773
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:53,675
Hang on to your goodies.
We got a neighborhood to save.

774
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,363
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.

775
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:08,677
Pray this hunk of junk

776
00:58:08,847 --> 00:58:12,601
holds together long enough
to get us uptown in one piece.

777
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:25,924
- Where's Arnold?
- Look!

778
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:29,883
- In position.
- Do it.

779
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:32,322
Roger that.

780
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,004
- I didn't know you were religious.
- Neither did I.

781
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:04,243
His fake leg's stuck. I can't budge it.

782
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,523
Gerald, you'll have to drive.

783
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:08,405
- Him?
- Are you crazy?

784
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:12,162
You're the top-scoring Runaway Bus
player at the arcade.

785
00:59:12,327 --> 00:59:15,046
That's a game. This is real life.

786
00:59:15,207 --> 00:59:17,482
I know you can do it.

787
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:21,162
Why do you always
have to look on the bright side?

788
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:23,682
"We can save the neighborhood
and find the document."

789
00:59:23,847 --> 00:59:26,520
- "You can drive the bus."
- Somebody has to.

790
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:29,599
Get on the floor. You too, Helga.

791
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:33,203
- Why?
- Because I'm driving the bus, OK?

792
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:36,404
And because I'm nine,
and I can't reach the pedals.

793
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:40,560
Arnold, you work the clutch.
Helga, you work the brakes.

794
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:45,278
And try to get Murray's
fake leg off the stinking gas pedal!

795
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:59,443
Brake!

796
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:08,278
My cans!

797
01:00:08,447 --> 01:00:09,766
Clutch!

798
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:25,041
<i>You take the high road</i>
<i>and I'll take the low road</i>

799
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,956
What are those guys up to?

800
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:42,519
- Is the overpass wired?
- Yes.

801
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:46,475
- Blow it.
- Boss, this is pretty serious.

802
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,764
- Serious?
- As in 15 to life.

803
01:00:49,927 --> 01:00:52,885
Just do it, you incompetent moron!

804
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,682
All right. It's seven o'clock.
Time to take it all down.

805
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:31,803
- Why'd I eat chilli for breakfast?
- Easy, Gramps. Don't blow yet.

806
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:34,686
As soon as I push down this plunger,

807
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,759
we'll commence
Operation Stop the Bulldozer.

808
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:43,445
What's goin' on? 286-DX plunger,
high-gauge wire, C-47 tubing.

809
01:01:43,607 --> 01:01:46,326
I know, you're planning
to blow the street up,

810
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:50,082
make a hole big enough
to stop the bulldozers.

811
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:53,557
- You could do serious jail time.
- Well, I...

812
01:01:53,727 --> 01:01:55,604
You need any help?

813
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:04,002
- We can't make it!
- Let's jump out.

814
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:07,603
No. Use the truck.
We can jump the hole!

815
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:11,043
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard! Let's do it!

816
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:14,802
- What happened?
- It's OK. We're jumping the ramp.

817
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:16,400
What ramp?

818
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:51,636
- What smells so rank?
- Get out.

819
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,239
- Now what?
- Grandma!

820
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,604
- What about her? She's in jail.
- She was.

821
01:03:15,047 --> 01:03:16,446
Yea, Grandma!

822
01:03:16,607 --> 01:03:18,962
- She's going back to jail.
- I know.

823
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:23,845
Hang on!

824
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:08,077
- I got it! I got the tape!
- That's wonderful. What tape?

825
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:11,284
The tape that'll prove this neighborhood
is a historic landmark

826
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,358
and can never be destroyed.

827
01:04:13,527 --> 01:04:16,360
All I need is a VCR,
and I can show you.

828
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:18,518
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Bridget?

829
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,120
Up here.

830
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:23,118
Tape her.

831
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:29,246
Wow.

832
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,922
Who does she think she is?
Catwoman?

833
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:47,320
Oh, my word! That's enough for me.

834
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:50,524
As your mayor, I reclaim
this entire neighborhood

835
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,077
as a national historic landmark
never to be torn down.

836
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:06,958
It's after seven o'clock. What are you
idiots waiting for? Knock it down!

837
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:14,526
It's that lying crook, Scheck!
Come on! Let's get the car!

838
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:17,076
I got the hubcap!

839
01:05:33,287 --> 01:05:37,883
I would've gotten away with it if it
wasn't for that meddling football head,

840
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,403
the kid with the weird hair
and that one-eyebrowed brat.

841
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:44,365
Tell it to the judge,
you big donut-hole!

842
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:49,317
Tell it to your cell mate in Folsom.

843
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:57,366
- Where are you going?
- I'll make it up to you.

844
01:05:57,527 --> 01:06:00,883
I'll buy you breakfast.
We'll talk. They have a special.

845
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,958
Willikers, what a day!

846
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,437
Fistfights, car chases
and political intrigue.

847
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:09,643
Don't forget
about the overpass blowin' up!

848
01:06:09,807 --> 01:06:12,401
And it's only 7.30 in the morning!

849
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:17,163
I wanna go back to bed.
I'm exhausted.

850
01:06:28,127 --> 01:06:30,277
<i>Change is good.</i>
<i>Change is good.</i>

851
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:40,045
I thought we set the explosion
down the middle of the street.

852
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:41,799
You didn't see nothing. Scatter.

853
01:06:47,447 --> 01:06:50,325
What happened? We made it!

854
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:52,566
Mona?

855
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:55,043
You saved the neighborhood!

856
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:59,678
You're my hero.
I'm so sorry I made fun of your leg.

857
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:03,601
- I don't care. I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Murray.

858
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:07,840
I love you just the way you are.

859
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:14,720
- Pretty crazy day.
- Yeah, we said a lot of nutty things.

860
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,355
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

861
01:07:17,527 --> 01:07:21,236
About all that stuff I said, Arnold, I...

862
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:26,879
- It was crazy back there...
- With all the excitement we just...

863
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:30,437
- Got carried away?
- You didn't really mean all that?

864
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:32,518
You don't really love me?

865
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:35,918
- Right.
- You were caught up in the moment.

866
01:07:36,087 --> 01:07:40,558
- Right.
- You actually hate me, don't you?

867
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:46,518
Of course I hate you, you stupid
football head, and don't ever forget it!

868
01:07:49,247 --> 01:07:50,566
Yes!

869
01:07:56,687 --> 01:07:59,201
I guess we did it, Arnold.

870
01:08:00,727 --> 01:08:04,402
- We saved the neighborhood.
- Yep. Everything's back to normal.

871
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:07,206
Shall we go shoot some hoops?

872
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:09,756
Gerald, our ball's flat, remember?

873
01:08:09,927 --> 01:08:13,124
- No. Just a little low on air.
- Wait.

874
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:17,758
- You're looking on the bright side?
- Somebody has to.

875
01:08:19,647 --> 01:08:22,605
<i>We saved our neighborhood</i>

876
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:25,679
<i>They could not tear it down</i>

877
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:29,157
<i>They could not turn our smile</i>

878
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:33,115
- <i>Into a frown</i>
- The show's over, Eugene.
