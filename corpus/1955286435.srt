1
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,448
Jose, let's go!

2
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,922
Jose, get up!
You're going to be late!

3
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,072
Miguel, hurry up!
Don't you ever leave the bathroom?

4
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,322
"Miguel, hurry up.

5
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,967
Don't you ever leave the bathroom?"

6
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,631
- You need to go the the restroom?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,083
Aww. Aww.

8
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,709
Miguel, that's not even funny!

9
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,917
Really?
You locked the door?

10
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,497
A long river. A long river!

11
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,891
- It smells good.
- Oh, no, no.

12
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,546
Over there. Over there.

13
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,773
Why don't you get up
when I ask you to get up?

14
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,786
That way you wouldn't be
running late all the time.

15
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,650
Here you go.

16
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,654
How come Miguel gets more?

17
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,543
Your brother needs
all the protein he can get

18
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,897
for his big game tonight.

19
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,546
He probably won't eat
anything anyway.

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,410
He's to busy plucking
his eyebrows like a girl.

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,736
- Yeah?
- Oh, man, come on.

22
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,531
Stop playing.
Stop. Come on.

23
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,535
I'm late. Please.
Did you wash your hands?

24
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,907
Spotless.

25
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,134
Come on, mom.

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,996
Oye, mijo. Here.

27
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,302
You're still hungry?
Eat this.

28
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,469
Really, mom?
Expired cereal?

29
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,798
Jose, what is your problem?

30
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,184
I told you I'm going to be late!

31
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,159
- You keep shouting all the time.
- No, sit down.

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,143
Sit down and eat!
Sit down and eat, okay?

33
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,354
- I don't want you to be late.
- Okay. Okay.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,614
It's a big day, you know?

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,375
You've been waiting
for this a long time.

36
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,599
Hopefully, after tonight's game
you'll get scholarships.

37
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,146
Oh, please, god.
Please, god.

38
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,782
You okay?
You're not feeling sick, are you?

39
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,162
No. Mom, can you stop?

40
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,369
Okay.

41
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,579
You know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

42
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,330
And if I win, Dani buys me
lunch and dessert.

43
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,376
That's nice, mijo. Eat.
You're okay?

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,669
- You're feeling okay today?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mom.

45
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,063
Buenos Dias, Jose.
Did you eat?

46
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,435
Welcome to Abuelita's
specialty restaurant.

47
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,862
This is real sausage.
I'll make it for you.

48
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,816
- That's okay.
- Eh?

49
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,485
- What do you want to drink?
- How about a soda?

50
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,615
Ay, you're loco.

51
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,002
Let's see.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,329
How about some coffee?

53
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,385
Abuelita, I don't drink coffee.
I'm too young.

54
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,628
Too young? I've been drinking coffee
since I was six years old.

55
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,632
Keeps you warm when
you're working out in the fields.

56
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,635
No, thanks.

57
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,242
you know, I have a chess game
today against Dani.

58
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,407
Do you remember
the last techniques I taught you?

59
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,244
- I practiced all night.
- Go easy on that poor kid, huh?

60
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,089
- You're it.
- Stop.

61
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,255
What's wrong?

62
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,550
Did you get in a fight
with your mom again?

63
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,888
- With Miguel?
- Cut it out.

64
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,900
- You're such a butthead.
- You're a double butthead.

65
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,726
- A double butthead? Really?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,686
All right, stand over here.

67
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,303
Put your hands
on the hood, please.

68
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,494
You don't have
any weapons on you?

69
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,908
Get in the car.

70
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,907
Let's go check it out.

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,909
- No.
- What?

72
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,708
Let's go through
the cemetery instead.

73
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,917
- But we're going to be late.
- It's a shortcut.

74
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,917
- You scared?
- No way, weirdo.

75
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,460
Last one there gets first start
for the chess match.

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,054
- Three...
- Two...

77
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,224
Cheater!

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,847
<i>If there was a song
of the story of us</i>

79
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,478
<i>it wouldn't have a refrain</i>

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,944
<i>it'd be a hundred verses</i>

81
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,323
<i>and never the same</i>

82
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,161
<i>like coming back round again</i>

83
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,738
<i>I'd play it</i>

84
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,745
<i>and you would understand it</i>

85
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,537
<i>and give it just the right name</i>

86
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,131
<i>la de da, la de da</i>

87
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,877
<i>oh, la de da da</i>

88
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,760
<i>la de da, la de da</i>

89
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,758
- da da
- come on.

90
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,181
Come on!
You throw like a girl!

91
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,991
Do something!
Throw it home! Throw it...

92
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,564
He got you right on the...

93
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,975
Quit throwing like a pansy!

94
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,230
You got to man up!
Oh, yeah, baby!

95
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,782
You better watch out.
She's got an arm!

96
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,067
- Whoa!
- Ow!

97
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,161
That's the bell!

98
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,366
That's it, that's it. That's the bell.

99
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,789
Goodness.

100
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,037
I'm sorry, man.

101
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,788
What's your deal, man?

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,370
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

103
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,165
- Enough!
- What are you doing?

104
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,628
That's enough. That's enough!

105
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,008
What the hell are you idiots...

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,010
I mean...

107
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,835
You guys really disappoint me.

108
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,801
- He started it.
- You, young lady,

109
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,295
need to mind your own business.

110
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,391
And stop acting like catwoman,
jumping all over everybody.

111
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,853
Go inside. Go inside.
I'll deal with you later.

112
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,813
Go. Go!

113
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,438
You, too. Not you.

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,609
Jose, what's the matter with you?

115
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,625
You should try and be
more like your brother.

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,624
Why? Because I don't play
as good as him?

117
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,829
He's striving for the championship.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,640
You could learn
a thing or two from him.

119
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,328
Whatever.

120
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,959
- How did you do that?
- Can't tell you.

121
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,255
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Check.

122
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,639
- Well, then...
- You know what's funny?

123
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,217
- I knew you were going to do that.
- Huh. Check.

124
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,434
I knew you were going to do that.

125
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,435
Are you sure, Dani?
I hate doing this.

126
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,939
No fair. No!

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,860
- Oh, yeah, it was.
- Nice job, Jose.

128
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,451
I saw how you skewered her king.

129
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,947
You dominated the board.

130
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,028
That's because he pressured me.
This game doesn't count.

131
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,084
No, no, no.
I want my pepperoni pizza.

132
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,078
- No.
- You know,

133
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,370
you have killer instincts.

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,500
Thanks.
And we had a deal.

135
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,460
- No.
- See? Look, you got to move here.

136
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,341
You know,
you're just like your brother.

137
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,400
Are you ready to cheer him on
in tonight's game?

138
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,884
Why does everybody
keep asking me about Miguel?

139
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,755
Is today national Miguel day?

140
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,236
Hey! Hey! Hey!

141
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,697
Jose!

142
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,317
What are you thinking?

143
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,510
You just bought yourself a trip
to the principal's office.

144
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,584
Come on, let's go!

145
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,287
You know...

146
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,304
There's a word that describes

147
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,298
what you did out there,

148
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,301
and it's on the tip of my tongue.

149
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,893
I can't remember...
Oh, yeah.

150
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,718
Stupid.

151
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,770
"Stupid" is a word I thought
I'd never hang on you, Jose.

152
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,260
And there's nothing you can say

153
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,796
to convince me
that you're innocent.

154
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,691
And I've heard
all the excuses, trust me.

155
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,321
"They made me do it."

156
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,778
"My girlfriend
wanted me to do it."

157
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,949
I did it.

158
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,658
I wanted to do it.

159
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,328
I would do it again.

160
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:41,076
Well, since you're being
so abnormally honest,

161
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,961
what punishment
would you impose on thyself?

162
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,669
If my brother did it,
you wouldn't punish him.

163
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,960
Is that what you surmise?

164
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,963
Everyone let's the champion slide.

165
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,125
That's all you care about,
and you know it!

166
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,387
Feeling a little destructive today,
aren't we?

167
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,769
If you spent more time
acting like a champion

168
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,483
and less time envying them,
you wouldn't be here,

169
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,195
or in after school detention,

170
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,965
which is where you're going
for the next two weeks.

171
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,569
- Come on.
- You want me to make it three?

172
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,407
Where you going?
Sit your butt right back down.

173
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,213
You don't leave
until I tell you to go.

174
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,007
What do you...
What do you have there?

175
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,586
Cherry jawbreaker.

176
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,304
My mom brought it from Mexico.

177
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,595
- Cherry jawbreaker, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,810
Here. Why don't you have it?

179
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,061
All right.

180
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,813
Let's just consider this payment

181
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,568
in lieu of the damages that
I'm not charging you for, okay?

182
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,294
You just try and keep
your hands to yourself.

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,620
And just remember
one thing, Jose.

184
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,535
The privilege of a lifetime
is being who you are.

185
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,256
Put that there in the bank.
Run with it.

186
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,836
Go on.

187
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,484
- No, I like the chicharones.
- Hey, Jose. You got a second?

188
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,653
Poor kid.

189
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,493
He doesn't have half the talent
that Miguel does.

190
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,630
Jose, you need to sit down
and do your homework.

191
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,204
How are you?

192
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,121
I'm bringing back the chess club

193
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,291
and I want you to be in it.

194
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,539
I don't know how many students
I'm going to be able to recruit

195
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,381
or if we're even
going to get anywhere.

196
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,140
If you join the team,
I'll get you out of this detention.

197
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,940
Nobody plays chess around here.

198
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,727
I'll teach them.

199
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,982
Teach who?

200
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,937
Them.

201
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,565
Good luck with that.

202
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,373
Think about it.

203
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,253
Check.

204
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,518
Hey, why you getting
home so late?

205
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,307
- They gave me detention.
- Why?

206
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,862
- Because I broke Miguel's trophy.
- Why would you do that?

207
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,397
I felt like it.

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,780
You felt like it?
You felt... get in the house.

209
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm going to teach you
about feeling something.

210
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,784
Get in the house right now, Jose.

211
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,493
Get in the...
Are you kidding me?

212
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,003
Jose! You better get...

213
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,575
If I hurt myself, you are
going to get in so much...

214
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,172
I swear, if I...
You're going to be grounded,

215
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,958
I swear to god.

216
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,211
I can't believe you!

217
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,467
Jos... oh, god,
where'd he go?

218
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,638
Boy, where are you?

219
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,216
Jose!

220
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,655
- What happened to you?
- Shh.

221
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,237
- My god, what a foul smell.
- Shh! Abuela!

222
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,243
Let us get you
out of those clothes

223
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,655
before people think
there's a skunk in my house!

224
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,628
Shut the door. Hurry.

225
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,457
What did you do? What's going on?

226
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,631
I'm not here.
Please, go cover for me.

227
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,183
Please. Please.

228
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,467
Have you seen Jose?

229
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,159
I can't find him.
He's in big trouble.

230
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,853
- Is he here?
- No.

231
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,853
Maybe he went to Dani's house.

232
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,874
That little brat got detention.
Can you believe that?

233
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,334
If he comes here,
send him home, okay?

234
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,858
Oh, I will, Mija, Si.

235
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,701
- Now, Mija...
- Mom, please, please.

236
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,486
- Just send him home, okay?
- Okay.

237
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,291
oye, I am going to teach you

238
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,632
one of your grandpa's
favorite strategies.

239
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,668
- I don't feel like it, Abuelita.
- Come on, Jose.

240
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,553
You know that when you play,
it makes you feel better.

241
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,511
This one is special.

242
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,891
It's called
"home away from home."

243
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,520
If I bring out
my pawn king to e4.

244
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,109
You bring out
your pawn king to e5.

245
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,529
There you go.

246
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,279
I bring out my knight to f3.

247
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,122
You bring out your knight to c6.

248
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,537
Mmm.

249
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,916
I bring out my bishop to c4.

250
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,137
Ahh.

251
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,668
Okay, everybody, come in!

252
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,075
Okay, okay, okay.

253
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,795
All right, I want everybody's
attention, please.

254
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,166
First of all, welcome.

255
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,822
And for all y'all
who don't know me,

256
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,717
I am the mother of the best
soccer player on this planet.

257
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,389
The universe!

258
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,812
All I have to say is
David Beckham better watch out

259
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,098
because my baby's coming.
Ain't that right, sweetie?

260
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,767
He is going to get a big scholarship
to a big college

261
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,322
and he's going to kick
some soccer Booty. Yeah!

262
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,567
That's right.

263
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,528
Let's get them a drink.
Come on, who wants something?

264
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,832
Not you guys.
Yeah, right here. Right here.

265
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,787
We got some soda
back there for you somewhere.

266
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,998
Mom, I'm going to head out
with the guys for a bit.

267
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,830
- Okay?
- Oh, you are?

268
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,104
We're starving. We haven't
had anything to eat all day.

269
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,731
We're just going to pick up
some burgers and be right back.

270
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,005
Come right back, because
you have to ice this shoulder.

271
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,638
- Mom, it's fine.
- Can I go with you?

272
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,425
- I want a burger.
- Um... just stay here.

273
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,600
Stay here for a bit, okay?
I'll bring you something, all right?

274
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,639
Number five?
No tomatoes, toasted buns.

275
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,435
I got you. All right.
I'll see you in a bit.

276
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,663
Jose, will you throw out
the garbage, please?

277
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,051
To the champions, boys!

278
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,721
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Oh, snap!

279
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,850
And here, fellas, is to finally
getting out of this dump.

280
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,599
- Yes, sir.
- Here we go, boys. Whoo!

281
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,232
It's cold.

282
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,732
Party, guys!

283
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,284
- Oh, no, you did not!
- Oh, no.

284
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,728
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

285
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,366
You holding back from us, bro?

286
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,656
- Yikes.
- Give me that.

287
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,095
Don't do it.
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

288
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,599
What are you doing,
designated driver?

289
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,120
Why am I always
the designated driver?

290
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,963
Because you wanted to drive
your blue power ranger car.

291
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,887
We won!
We won the game!

292
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,097
- We won!
- My ass is buzzing, bro.

293
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,098
- That's disgusting.
- Where is it?

294
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,110
- Don't ever say that again.
- Ole, ole, ole!

295
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,103
Hey, I got a text.
Oh, this girl, bro! Damn.

296
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,105
- We won the game!
- Damn, she fine.

297
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,227
- Look at this girl.
- That's your mom's name.

298
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,524
- Pretty hot.
- Watch this.

299
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,283
Whoa!

300
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,921
May the blessing of almighty god,
the father, the son

301
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,335
and the holy spirit,
come down on you.

302
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,965
- Amen.
- Amen.

303
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,595
I ruined his trophy at school.

304
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,387
Sometimes brothers do that.

305
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,606
Why did this happen?

306
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,817
I don't know, mijo.

307
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,910
I'm trying to understand myself.

308
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,634
Come on.
Let's go home.

309
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,629
Andale.

310
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,430
Hey.

311
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,259
I didn't know
you were back already.

312
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,104
Why didn't you wait
for me this morning?

313
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,890
I didn't feel like it.

314
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,654
Do you want to hang
after school?

315
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,647
I brought my game boy.
Barn!

316
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,569
Nah.

317
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,067
Guitar hero?
I'll let you win.

318
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,990
I have detention.

319
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,238
Yay! So do I.
Come on.

320
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,742
It's called the nimzo-Indian.

321
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,076
Welcome, Jose.

322
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,459
Okay, you guys
already know the routine.

323
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,462
- Here. Let's do it.
- Take out your pieces.

324
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,556
Jose, I'm the new detention teacher.

325
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,057
And it's now officially
chess team practice.

326
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,270
If any of you
want regular detention,

327
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,917
you can walk down the hallway
and complain to your principal.

328
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,491
I'm sure he'll be happy
to make it more painful for you.

329
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,065
I learned new tactics, Jose.

330
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,490
- Consider yourself warned.
- Why are you doing this?

331
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,780
To learn how
to beat you at chess.

332
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,294
And to win back
that pizza and shake.

333
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,871
Here.

334
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,461
What? You're scared?

335
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,417
I dare you.

336
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,088
You want to double-dare?

337
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,931
Don't hold your breath.

338
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,716
Okay, today we're going to try
a few techniques

339
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,595
that will weaken
your opponent in an instant

340
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,903
and ensure the best possible chance
for a checkmate.

341
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,155
Hi, mom.

342
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,750
Here's some water.

343
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,752
It's important to stay hydrated.

344
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,299
Do you want anything?

345
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,552
I can go get you something.

346
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,274
Anything?

347
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,998
Sorry.

348
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,550
- Abuela?
- Yeah?

349
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,839
How do you know that Miguel
went to heaven?

350
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,928
I know because
he was a good son and brother.

351
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,563
What about when you do
bad things?

352
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:06,194
Mijo, god watches
our every move,

353
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,945
so it's better to do more good
than bad things in your life.

354
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,907
- And Miguel?
- Yes, he did.

355
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,627
You want to know what I think?

356
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,417
What?

357
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:27,631
I think your grandfather
is teaching Miguel

358
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,433
how to play chess
just as he taught me.

359
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,258
Really?
Like, right now, maybe?

360
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,015
Oh, yeah.

361
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,556
He loved to teach as much
as he loved to play.

362
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,402
Cool.

363
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,534
This belonged to your Abuelito.

364
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,499
It's a family heirloom.

365
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,129
She will protect you
as she has me.

366
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,261
Wow. Thank you, Abuelita.

367
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,508
Mm-hmm.

368
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:17,637
And remember what your grandfather
always said about the queen.

369
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,602
Don't use her or I'll lose her.

370
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,318
- My move?
- Yes, your move.

371
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,691
This is what
you call notation books.

372
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,105
Here's when you write down

373
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,083
all your information
on how you make a move.

374
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Take the pencils,
and you can pass them down.

375
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,502
Please don't eat the pencils.
We're going to need them.

376
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,286
Okay, when you're playing chess,
you got to focus on the center.

377
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,934
You got to focus
right in the middle,

378
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,128
because the center
is where you want to be.

379
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,917
Now, the rule of thumb is this,

380
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,672
the weakest pawn is the pawn
closest the the king,

381
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,724
and the art of chess
is about attacking.

382
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,740
But when you're attacking,
you've got to ask yourself,

383
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,734
is that movement some
kind of form of defense?

384
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,095
Or is that movement some
kind of form of attack?

385
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,732
Ask not what your king
can do for you,

386
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,560
but what you can do
for your king.

387
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,685
Shake your pants, everyone.

388
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,567
- You ready, army?
- Begin.

389
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,740
- Pawn a4!
- Good move, Jose.

390
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,615
Attack, and always be attacking.

391
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:19,949
Pawn to e5.

392
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,164
That's a really good move.
Think, Jose.

393
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,459
Knight to f3.
Come on, bring it.

394
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,672
Right smack in the middle.
This is a new frontier.

395
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,178
And in the frontier
where the battle goes down,

396
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,175
right, it's threat
meeting another threat.

397
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,448
You're going to fight the threat
with another threat.

398
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,762
Knight to c6.

399
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,305
Acknowledge the fact that
she's not fighting aggressively.

400
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,019
- She's thinking about it.
- Bishop, c4.

401
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,560
Absolutely right.
Good move, Jose.

402
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,566
- Feel what they're doing.
- Oh, yeah.

403
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,279
Knight to f6.

404
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,698
- Knight, g5.
- Excellent, Jose.

405
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,791
Now you're using excellent tactics

406
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,536
and you're dominating the board.

407
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,578
Now what are you going to do?

408
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,792
Rook to g8.

409
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,882
I never taught you that move.

410
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:12,168
Bishop, take f7.

411
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,678
- Check!
- King, e7!

412
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,256
Yeah, Peter!

413
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,431
Capture rook.

414
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,600
I think we're becoming
a real team here.

415
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,095
Regionals are coming up,

416
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,313
and we might just make it.

417
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,694
Okay, let's play one more game,
okay, guys?

418
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,027
What are you doing
bringing the queen out?

419
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,084
Mr. Alvarado wants us
to use the queen.

420
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,407
What?

421
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,752
No, the queen is one
of the most powerful pieces.

422
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,288
She should not be used.

423
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,131
If you expose yourself,
you're done.

424
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,646
That's how your grandfather
taught me to play,

425
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,690
bless his soul, and that's how
I taught you to play.

426
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,054
I know, but he's the coach.

427
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,259
Then he should teach you right.

428
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,639
- He's a retard!
- Abuelita!

429
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,467
Ay! Okay, I'll calm down before
Abuelita gets ghetto on you.

430
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
Listen, I have some leftovers
for your mom.

431
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,862
Can you take them when you're done?

432
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,570
Hey, mom.
I brought you some food.

433
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:26,325
It's on the kitchen table.
Okay?

434
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,087
I can heat it up
for you if you want.

435
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,296
Mom, can you say something?

436
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,557
Why did god take your brother?

437
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,306
I know.

438
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,113
Maybe it should've been me.

439
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,910
Hey, principal Thomas.

440
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,199
Any chance you can make it rain
chess team money?

441
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,123
- We have a chess team?
- Yeah. It's pretty damn awesome.

442
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,693
We've been practicing for months,

443
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,351
and now we're competing
in the district.

444
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,224
Yeah, well, the district
has cut all money

445
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,378
for extracurricular activities,
so I can give you what's leftover,

446
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,031
but I can promise you
it ain't much.

447
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:23,138
The scraps?
Come on, that's like $5.00.

448
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,467
How am I supposed to get my team
to Dallas this year?

449
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,931
Welcome to Brownsville, Mr. A.

450
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,393
You seen the soccer field?

451
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,733
Coach Stevens' been crying
for over a year to get it re-sod.

452
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,480
Now, my job is to fill that case.

453
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,276
You help me do my job,
then and only then I can help you.

454
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,619
In the meantime, here.

455
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,486
A little donation to the cause.

456
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,793
You can't win if you don't play.

457
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,641
Distractions?

458
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,393
What does "distractions" mean?

459
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,123
It's like when we have homework,

460
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,587
but there's a great movie playing
on TV so we forget to do it.

461
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,291
And the teacher yells at us
the next day.

462
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,401
Yeah!

463
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,200
It can also happen when
we're not focused on our matches

464
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,327
- and end up losing.
- Yeah, there was this kid,

465
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,620
he was picking his nose
through the whole entire match.

466
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,655
- That's a very disgusting example.
- But he does make a point.

467
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,245
Feast your eyes on this.

468
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,088
The checkmates.

469
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,413
Did you see what
their nickname is?

470
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,014
Butt cheek one, butt cheek two,

471
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,095
because they live in
a crackhouse.

472
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,110
Stop!

473
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,028
Do you understand?

474
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,856
The checkmates
are the team to beat.

475
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,573
We need to put
Brownsville on the map

476
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,454
and show them that we exist.

477
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,872
Let's nail this
district match coming up.

478
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,462
You down, dawg?

479
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,037
- Yeah!
- We're down!

480
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,842
- Oh, yeah!
- Down, fool?

481
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,166
- Down with the clown?
- Yeah! Every day!

482
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,051
- You want to be on top, right?
- Yeah!

483
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,618
You are going to go in there
and knock on the door and say,

484
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,427
- "wake up!"
- Yeah!

485
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,097
- "Brownsville is here!"
- Wake up!

486
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,427
Annihilate any crazy distractions
you have in your head

487
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,483
get the boards.

488
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,863
No!

489
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,281
That teacher is crippling
your game.

490
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,990
Abuelita, why are you hating on
Mr. Alvarado?

491
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,661
I'm not hating Mr. Alvarado.

492
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,869
- I just don't like his style.
- I'm learning different now.

493
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,131
Mijo, if you have the best goalie
on your soccer team,

494
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,665
do you move him
to play center or wing?

495
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,420
No! You try to get him
to be a better goalie.

496
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,894
Look at my knight.

497
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,306
Hey, mom. Ls there
anything in your fridge?

498
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,306
Some cold cuts
and fresh bread, Mija.

499
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,309
- Hi, Jose.
- Hey.

500
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,562
Why didn't they make
the king more powerful?

501
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,534
The queen can move anywhere.
He's the king.

502
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,815
Yeah, well,
you can't change the rules.

503
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,989
- Ma, where's the bread?
- So, maybe I'll just go here.

504
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,989
Who's winning?

505
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,701
Look at your queen
and look at mine.

506
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,952
Who's winning?

507
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,464
Never sacrifice your queen
for a killing.

508
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,957
You guys want anything?

509
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,709
Mijo, tomorrow,
just remember what I taught you.

510
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:51,674
I've been busting my butt
teaching you since you were five.

511
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,932
So don't screw up and make me
throw my flip-flop at your head.

512
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,353
- So much pressure.
- Pressure is good.

513
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,097
Checkmate.

514
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,794
- Your turn.
- I know.

515
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:09,166
You're new, aren't you?

516
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,432
Yeah.
This is my first tournament.

517
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,346
I'll take it easy on you, then.

518
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,394
- That's okay.
- I insist.

519
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,021
It could possibly traumatize you
if you lose to me.

520
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:26,824
What do you mean?
Well, I'm a girl,

521
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,645
and some boys can't handle
losing to a girl.

522
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,151
Sometimes they never recover.
Some stop playing forever.

523
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,905
In fact, the last guy that lost
looked just like you,

524
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,745
- but you're cuter.
- That's not going to happen to me.

525
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,866
- Shh.
- Sorry.

526
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,710
Don't be sorry.

527
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,882
Be gone.

528
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,301
Check.

529
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,063
- That's not fair.
- Haven't you heard?

530
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,926
Life isn't fair.

531
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,941
Hmm.

532
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,186
Checkmate.

533
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,158
- What happened?
- I got distracted.

534
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,081
Go pull yourself together

535
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,770
and go support
your fellow teammates.

536
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,456
And keep your mouth shut.

537
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,958
I used my vacation money
for this. Go.

538
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,921
I need mucho cerveza.

539
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,298
- Good match.
- No, it wasn't.

540
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,894
You slaughtered me.

541
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,719
Yeah, I did slaughter you,
but don't worry about it.

542
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,095
- It was your first...
- All right.

543
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,813
- Was your coach mad?
- I think so.

544
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,944
- He asked for a lot of beer.
- Yeah, sometimes they do that.

545
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,282
- It takes the edge off.
- The edge of what?

546
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,339
I don't know.
They don't make sense half the time.

547
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,533
- Oh, true.
- I heard you lost, champ.

548
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,123
- To me. I'm Sandy.
- Hi, Sandy.

549
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,804
Nice going, Jose.
You know how to pick a winner.

550
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,328
He played a solid game.
Be proud of him.

551
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,751
Oh, I'm very proud
of my teammate.

552
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,251
- Ow.
- That's a secret code we use.

553
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,795
Oh! Are you best friends?

554
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,932
Yeah.

555
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,137
Jose, you were so cool,
not like the other guys.

556
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,350
There was this one time
I played a guy...

557
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,200
More like a kid
who thought he was a guy,

558
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,347
Hey, you.

559
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,279
I saw your game earlier.
Not bad.

560
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,819
Thanks.

561
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,780
Looks like you got
your hands full, buddy.

562
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,543
- Let's go, Jose.
- Why?

563
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,456
- Mr. Alvarado is looking for us.
- No, he isn't.

564
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,100
I have to practice
before my next match.

565
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,924
Us winners do that.
Come on, teammate.

566
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,957
Good luck!
You, too, for next time.

567
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,012
What? You look at that!

568
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,296
Look at your shirt!
Look at your shirt, man!

569
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,181
Attention, everyone!

570
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:06,389
Brownsville brainiacs,
we're headed for the regionals!

571
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,687
- I'll race you.
- Cheater!

572
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,980
Mr. Alvarado,
why do we always have pizza?

573
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,714
Why are you always
complaining, Peter?

574
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,067
He's like a woman!

575
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
You want to take it outside
with a woman?

576
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,434
- Let's go! Okay, come on.
- Okay!

577
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,237
Yo, Muhammad Ali!

578
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,002
You want to restrain
that left hook just for the night?

579
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,606
You don't want to knock a brother down
before the big fight!

580
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,629
- Ooh!
- J.C. You're not.

581
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,416
- You're old like dried snot.
- And your school photo

582
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,710
looks like a mugshot.

583
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,423
Oh!

584
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,884
- What!
- Sorry, Mr. Alvarado.

585
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,345
Your bags are in the front.
Grab them.

586
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,852
Can you believe
we got first place?

587
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,418
Yeah. You're still in shock, huh?

588
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,228
- These are awesome.
- We're the bomb.

589
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,240
Hey.

590
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,779
If Miguel were here,
he'd be proud of you.

591
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,656
What?
That I'm a good loser?

592
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,254
She played a good game.

593
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,456
I probably would have
lost to her, too.

594
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,882
Yeah, right.
When hell freezes over.

595
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,892
Can I ask you a question?

596
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,893
Yeah. What?

597
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,058
Why did you want to
avoid the border patrol officers

598
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,542
when they were arresting those guys
on our way to school?

599
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,276
- I wasn't avoiding them.
- Yeah, you were.

600
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,109
- You were scared.
- I wasn't scared.

601
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:54,036
- Don't you trust me?
- Yes.

602
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,924
Prove it.

603
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,128
My parents just told me
they're not us citizens.

604
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,346
I thought you said
your mom was from Brownsville.

605
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,723
She told me that
so I wouldn't worry.

606
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,807
Swear on your life
you won't tell anyone.

607
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,944
Promise me.

608
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,316
I promise.

609
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:25,991
I won't tell anyone.

610
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:32,119
<i>All the trouble I've seen</i>

611
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,830
<i>disappears</i>

612
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,631
<i>into the night</i>

613
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:43,127
<i>and I know the tighter
I hold on to you</i>

614
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,721
mine's better. See? Look.

615
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,755
The noise makes it all...

616
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,765
- The sound of it.
- Yeah.

617
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,347
Oh!

618
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,444
Ow.

619
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,569
I'm going to remember that.

620
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,217
I'll get you next time
in Dodgeball.

621
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,402
I'll get you.

622
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,363
- You wouldn't.
- I would. I would, too.

623
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,333
- Hey, Abuelita.
- Hey! How did it go?

624
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,077
It went okay.

625
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,829
And? What else?

626
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,250
- That's it.
- Hmm.

627
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,836
I lost.

628
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,466
- I told you, that teacher...
- Abuela, it had nothing to do with him.

629
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,756
It was my fault.
I lost my concentration.

630
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,011
- What do you mean?
- Well, I didn't use my head.

631
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,604
There was girl,
and she was really cute, too.

632
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,812
- Blonde hair and really cute.
- Listen to me.

633
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,624
It wasn't that
you didn't use your head.

634
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,397
- It's that you used the wrong one!
- Abuela!

635
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,612
This is the biggest problem
with a man.

636
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,572
You always lose
when he's in control.

637
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,413
Abuela, can you stop it?
You're traumatizing me.

638
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,140
- I'm trying to save you.
- From what?

639
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,413
From yourself.

640
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,213
- Listen to me...
- Abuela, I know. You told...

641
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,837
- Dirty little bastard, listen...
- Abuela, Abuela! Listen.

642
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,626
I'm tired and I want to go
get some rest.

643
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,841
Please do not disturb me.

644
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,972
Well, excuse me,
Mr. blah-blah-blah.

645
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,641
The king doesn't want to talk.
Typical!

646
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:21,391
Oh, lord, forgive Jose

647
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,606
for he knows not what he does.

648
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:32,121
It's too dark in here.

649
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,825
Ma, leave it off.

650
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,956
I am too old and blind
to be walking in the dark.

651
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,460
What if I fall and break a hip?

652
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,166
Who'll take care of me then, huh?

653
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,085
I brought you some food.

654
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,684
Jose had a chess game today

655
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,677
and I don't think he did very good.

656
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,599
Maybe you can talk to him
and cheer him up

657
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,770
since I already tried.

658
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,863
You know,
sometimes I wonder who died,

659
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,782
you or Miguel.

660
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,697
He was my son.

661
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,700
Honey, what are you
talking about?

662
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,923
I'm saying that he was my son.
He's not yours.

663
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,496
I know, and he loved you
very much, Mija.

664
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,952
He would light up every time
you would walk into a room.

665
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,139
You know that he thanked me
before every game.

666
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,136
He always thanked me.

667
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,138
And may god bless
Miguelito for eternity.

668
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,692
But, Mija,
what about your other son?

669
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,857
- You were blessed to have two.
- He doesn't need me.

670
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,147
You took him away from me
a long time ago

671
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,781
- and you turned him against me.
- I did no such thing.

672
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,798
You were always with Miguel
so I took care of Jose

673
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,782
and I just taught him
how to play chess.

674
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,873
Ma, who asked you
to teach him to play chess?

675
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,960
- Who asked you?
- But he needed attention!

676
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,326
- Attention?
- Yes!

677
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,462
Mom, what the hell
do you know about attention?

678
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,749
What do you know?

679
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,283
Every time you and papa
went off to your chess tournaments

680
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,719
and you left me alone,
I needed attention, too.

681
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,046
- What do you know about that?
- What are you saying?

682
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:20,055
I hate chess!
I didn't ask you to teach him chess!

683
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,216
I can't deal with this!
I can't deal with this!

684
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,765
I want you to get out of here. Go!

685
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,652
Checkmate.

686
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,022
- No, your time ran out.
- No.

687
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,161
I checkmated you,
you can't move anywhere.

688
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,676
- Anywhere in the square.
- Still, you ran out of time...

689
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,910
- No. I won. I checkmated you.
- Dude, look at your time.

690
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,252
No! You're cheating!

691
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,117
- You're a liar!
- Hey!

692
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,964
What is this?

693
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,971
Put your hands on the seat.

694
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,837
All of you,
put your hands on your seat.

695
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,272
What happened to my soldiers?

696
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:53,864
What happened to my knights?
What happened to my kings?

697
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,648
You're acting like a bunch
of salvajes.

698
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,945
You want to bring the violence?
Put it in the board.

699
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,871
Because there are no lies
on the board.

700
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:11,621
And just like in life,
every action has a consequence.

701
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,545
Pick them up.

702
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,748
I want everyone
to set up the board.

703
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,306
Shake their hands.

704
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,855
This is a battle of the will.

705
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:42,948
Begin.

706
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,626
<i>- At the park or at the beach...
- Check.</i>

707
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,508
<i>At home or on TV,
nothing could go wrong</i>

708
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,007
- <i>when you're with me...
- Check.</i>

709
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,141
<i>Catch a ride or catch a wave</i>

710
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,929
<i>at home or in la</i>

711
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,943
<i>nothing could go wrong
when you're with me...</i>

712
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,347
Checkmate.

713
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,364
<i>When you're with me</i>

714
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,727
<i>baby, baby, close your eyes</i>

715
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,355
<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

716
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:26,112
<i>I want you, I want you</i>

717
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,373
<i>baby, baby, don't think twice</i>

718
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,120
<i>I want you, I want you</i>

719
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,962
<i>I want you, want you,
want you, want you...</i>

720
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,501
Guess who.

721
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,554
- Not you.
- You sound worried.

722
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,928
- I'm not.
- Well, neither am I.

723
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,175
Good.

724
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,177
I hope you've improved
since last time.

725
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,559
- Whatever, homey.
- Fo' shizzle my nizzle, dawg.

726
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,387
Let's get rolling, 'aight?

727
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,354
My coach thinks
I have lots of potential.

728
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,984
He thinks I'll be
in top ten next year.

729
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,782
I'll have to travel
to New York for nationals.

730
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,737
Times Square,
strawberry fields... forever.

731
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,238
- Can you stop?
- All right, guys,

732
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,468
we're ready to begin round three
of our regional tournament

733
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,082
remember,
we are using USCF rules.

734
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,118
If you touch a piece,
you must move it.

735
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,711
Shake hands and begin.

736
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,833
Check.

737
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,190
Checkmate.

738
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,538
Good game.

739
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,918
What happened?

740
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,376
I won.

741
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,552
Did you take notation?

742
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,925
- Mm-hmm.
- Eso.

743
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,757
Check.

744
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,436
Checkmate.

745
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,742
What? Yes?

746
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,145
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Yes!

747
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,824
- Notation? Yes.
- Whoa, look at that... oh!

748
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,408
Oh!

749
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,179
Guys, do you think
they're going to fly us to Dallas

750
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,597
- for the championship?
- If they do,

751
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,101
you're going to have to
take a shower.

752
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,374
- I don't stink.
- Yes, you do.

753
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,794
Well, here, use this.
It works.

754
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,554
Oh, dude!
You smell like a girl.

755
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,376
Here. It works better
if you take it out of the box.

756
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,643
It's true.

757
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,966
I got a shower cap on my head

758
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,313
- hey!
- Yep?

759
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,757
Take the cap off and sit down.

760
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,607
Shut up and sit down.

761
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,860
- You think that was funny?
- It wasn't me.

762
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,993
You find it very humorous?
Ls that funny, Jose? Was it you?

763
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:40,042
Dani? Dani, isn't that where
your parents work?

764
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,632
- Stop the bus.
- Dani, sit down.

765
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,271
- Stop the bus. Stop!
- We can't stop the bus.

766
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,005
- Sit down! Dani!
- Stop! Get out of the way!

767
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,627
- Stop!
- We can't stop the bus!

768
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,804
- What are you doing?
- Jose, what are you doing?

769
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,893
- Jose!
- Stop the bus!

770
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,888
- Stop the frigging bus!
- Dani!

771
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,141
Open the door.

772
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,524
I need to get to my mom.

773
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,821
- No! Mom!
- Dani!

774
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,776
Dani! Jose!

775
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:15,446
Hey, Jose! Dani!

776
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,118
- Jose! No, no, no, no.
- Dani!

777
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,827
- Get out of here!
- Dani!

778
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,328
No, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

779
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,170
- We need you over here.
- Mom!

780
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,416
- No!
- My mom!

781
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,811
What are you doing,
Mr. Alvarado?

782
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,455
No, no, no, no, no.

783
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,962
- No, don't! Mr. Alvarado!
- There's nothing we can do.

784
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,014
- Dani!
- In the Van. Get in the Van.

785
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,088
- Don't go!
- Jose.

786
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,554
- Dani!
- Get them in the Van now.

787
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,465
Okay? Nothing you can do.

788
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,184
Stay with me, all right?

789
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,972
Do you want to go inside?
Your mom's probably worried.

790
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,722
I don't care.

791
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,830
No!

792
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,040
<i>You lifted my chin</i>

793
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,785
<i>brushed the hair from my face</i>

794
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,883
I've never been good

795
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:43,633
<i>at learning my place</i>

796
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,391
<i>but all my thoughts escape</i>

797
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,600
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

798
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:53,402
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

799
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,607
<i>when you bring me in</i>

800
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,819
<i>when you hold me close</i>

801
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,200
<i>all the trouble I've seen</i>

802
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:09,575
<i>disappears into the night</i>

803
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:16,212
<i>and I know the tighter
I hold onto you</i>

804
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:20,962
<i>the more everything
will become right</i>

805
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,851
<i>when you whisper my name</i>

806
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,855
<i>stars seem to shine brighter</i>

807
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,485
<i>when you're near</i>

808
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,412
<i>and you see when I'm sad</i>

809
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,463
<i>before I shed a tear...</i>

810
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,088
Okay, we have to get started.

811
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,125
Where's Jose?

812
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,338
He's coming.
Set up your pieces.

813
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:06,894
But we need him.

814
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,137
Is she going to be okay,
Mr. Alvarado?

815
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,186
Dani's tough,
and she's with her family.

816
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,191
Hopefully, she'll be back.

817
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,115
But listen, we didn't get
to this stage with one player.

818
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,288
Come on, Brownsville brainiacs.

819
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,940
Show me some of that attitude
you often torture me with, huh?

820
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,674
I think it's time
for another speed drill.

821
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,933
Start!

822
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,723
We may have suffered a setback,

823
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,555
but you kids have
what it takes to win.

824
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,940
Hey, listen!

825
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,147
Would I be investing
my rent money in you

826
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,858
if I didn't think
you could do it?

827
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,609
So, come on,
don't make me homeless.

828
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,174
Crap.

829
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,135
Hmm.

830
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,138
You know,
locked away behind glass,

831
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,561
it has an air of exclusivity.

832
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,401
But it's not. It's inclusive.

833
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,147
Everyone benefits.

834
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,861
Wow. A chess title.
South Texas.

835
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,533
Man, that's...
That's unprecedented territory.

836
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,223
District's going to benefit from it.

837
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,160
The community is hungry
for good news about these kids,

838
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,574
and I really think that this
would be the perfect place

839
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:04,170
to put the story...

840
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,591
Right in the pantheon,
right here.

841
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,180
What do you think?

842
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:13,006
What do I think?

843
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,683
Well, as you know, we lost Dani.

844
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,392
Yeah.

845
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,813
I just found out Peter
has no running water in his home,

846
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,823
and Jose's headed down
a real bad alley.

847
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:32,121
Did I mention that
I'm just about flat broke?

848
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,906
I'm selling pickles to pay for gas.

849
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,195
Well, you know what they say.

850
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,575
The harder the battle,
the sweeter the victory.

851
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,631
I'm not investing
my time and heart

852
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,052
into these kids for a trophy.

853
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,801
I'm doing it because chess...

854
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,515
Might just be their chance
for a better life.

855
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,645
That's what I want them
to champion.

856
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,074
I'd like to believe once upon a time
you felt the same way.

857
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,952
I'm sure it wasn't
because of the money.

858
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,278
Am I right?

859
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,752
Well...

860
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,512
Listen, kid.

861
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,970
Where you been, Flojo?

862
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,892
I have a new setup to teach you.

863
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:44,272
This one is with the queen
in defensive mode.

864
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,021
- No, thanks, Abuelita.
- What's going on?

865
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,904
How about if we practice

866
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,992
the home away
from home technique?

867
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,947
It's one of your favorites.

868
00:58:56,742 --> 00:59:00,542
- Dani's parents got arrested.
- What?

869
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,907
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

870
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,285
What's going on?

871
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,514
Hello?

872
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,139
Dani's parents got arrested.

873
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,756
I heard they were arresting people
at the factory. How's she doing?

874
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,725
- She's gone.
- Oh.

875
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,400
Well, I'm sure
you'll make other friends.

876
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,857
- Dani was my best friend.
- I know, mijo,

877
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,728
but what are you going to do?

878
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,380
- She should be with her mother.
- You think kids are better off

879
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,324
just because they're
with their mothers, like me?

880
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,743
Like Miguel?

881
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,581
Why are you talking to me like this?

882
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,266
- You killed him!
- What did you say?

883
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,011
You put pressure on Miguel
to be perfect.

884
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,955
He told me.
It's your fault!

885
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,767
You drive all the men
in your life away!

886
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,338
Just like dad,
until he left us, too.

887
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,336
- Shut up.
- Why?

888
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,589
- Can't handle the truth?
- Jose!

889
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,051
- Miguel was your only life.
- And you are hers, too.

890
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,552
Mom! I can speak for myself.

891
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:03,015
Then tell him.

892
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,194
Oh, my god.

893
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,065
Hi, Jose.

894
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,776
What are you doing here, coach?

895
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,936
You are Jose's coach?

896
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,315
Yeah.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

897
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,175
Well, can't you see
that we're fighting here?

898
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,369
Yeah, the entire neighborhood

899
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,844
can hear that you guys
are fighting here.

900
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,238
What do you want with my kid?

901
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,205
I just came to check up on him.

902
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,856
Why don't you check on
the shitty attitude you helped create?

903
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,962
Is that what they're teaching him
at this school?

904
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,128
Between and my mother,
you ruined him.

905
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,800
Excuse me, Mrs. Perez.

906
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,300
Jose's a very decent

907
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:43,052
and very talented young man.

908
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,599
Don't you see?

909
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,391
Miguel died.

910
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,814
You lost a son,

911
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,273
but Jose has lost his brother
and his mother.

912
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,819
If you'll allow me.

913
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:03,027
Jose, can I please
talk to you outside?

914
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,864
I'm going to be straight with you.

915
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,630
We have the state tournament
coming up.

916
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:23,888
On a personal level,

917
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,267
I feel horrible about what you kids
have to deal with.

918
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,187
But we're a team,
and we worked so hard.

919
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,478
I can't do this without you.

920
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,485
Every king needs his knight.

921
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:42,453
What would Dani do?

922
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,870
What would Miguel do?

923
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,373
You dropped this on the bus.

924
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:31,243
Mijo, no matter what you decide...

925
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,923
please, follow your heart.

926
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:42,926
<i>It's not impossible
for me to cry</i>

927
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,506
- it's just...
- Okay.

928
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,932
Bishop to e3.

929
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,773
<i>But it's ingrained, you know</i>

930
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,728
<i>boys don't cry</i>

931
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:04,526
come on, Peter.
It's your move.

932
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,161
Peter, come on, make a move.

933
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,538
I don't want to do this anymore.

934
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,535
I don't want to wear
my crown and this robe

935
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,747
in the middle of the street
on my day off, but I am.

936
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,340
Come on, be strategic.
Find the center.

937
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,745
- <i>It's not impossible</i>
- <i>just move</i> a <i>piece.</i>

938
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,755
<i>For me to cry, it's just...</i>

939
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,848
Susie!

940
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,965
<i>And it's a shame, you know</i>

941
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,642
- <i>but it's ingrained, you know...
- </i> Time <i>out.</i>

942
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,400
<i>- Boys will kick and scream...</i>

943
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,187
Cause a scene

944
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,571
<i>take your anger out
on someone else</i>

945
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,409
<i>steal their car, race their car</i>

946
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,196
<i>don't you dare</i>

947
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,580
<i>no, don't you dare cry...</i>

948
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,196
Mr. A., what are you doing?

949
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:57,575
Get back on your square
before you run out of time.

950
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,424
And by the way, I was looking,
and you're toast.

951
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,221
You're the king and you're not even
protecting yourself.

952
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,216
How are you supposed to win
by making weak moves like that?

953
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,599
Tell me.

954
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,806
- <i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>
- <i>Make</i> a <i>move.</i>

955
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,439
Bishop, g7.

956
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,595
<i>No, baby...</i>

957
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,904
Pawn to f3.

958
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,028
<i>Boys don't cry, boys don't cry...</i>

959
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,646
Castle!

960
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,446
Queen, b2.
Find the center!

961
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,240
No, Mr. Alvarado.
Fight for the center.

962
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,455
- Knight, c6.
- Yes.

963
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,456
Castle.
You want to expose his queen.

964
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,040
Expose their king.

965
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,455
One of the strategies
is called the Ruy Lopez.

966
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,594
You start off with your pawns,
and one's in front of the king.

967
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,612
You move that, and then you start off
moving one of your knights...

968
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,256
Any of your knights, okay?

969
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:56,564
If they use the Sicilian,
you got to use the Yugoslav attack.

970
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,210
You're going to study the position,

971
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,021
study what kind of game he plays.

972
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,271
Strategize these movements, guys.

973
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:06,355
That's an illegal touch move.
You always forget to say that.

974
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,288
Let's hear it
for our amazing chess team.

975
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,496
Come on!

976
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,656
Put it together.
There you go.

977
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:22,075
Right on. Go team!

978
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,705
All right.

979
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,255
We have to remember
that we're here today

980
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:32,138
to help sponsor their trip to Dallas
to play in this championship.

981
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,637
And I'm very thankful
for the parents

982
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,519
for bringing out
all the concessions.

983
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,516
We got hot dogs
and pizza and tamales

984
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,899
and all kinds of good stuff,

985
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,516
so please gorge yourselves.

986
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,112
Just get fat. It's okay,
because we need the money.

987
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,148
We also have posters of the brilliant
Brownsville brainiacs.

988
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,534
If you buy it, they will sign it.

989
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,911
And I'm also available
for photographs today.

990
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,541
Come on!

991
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,118
Whew! Play on!

992
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,924
Yeah! Yeah!

993
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,089
Yeah!

994
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,354
- Hi, Abuelita.
- Hi, mijo.

995
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,505
No' no' no' no' no.

996
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,765
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

997
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,345
you have to eat something
before you go to sleep.

998
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,153
Abuelita, I'm tired.

999
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,896
I know, but you need
energy to think.

1000
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,573
Without your brain,

1001
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,569
the chessboard
becomes a storm at sea

1002
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:37,322
with waves this high
that will swallow you up

1003
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:42,170
if you don't eat my taquitos!

1004
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,383
There you are.

1005
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,380
You know, you've been
working really hard.

1006
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,592
You remind me of your grandpa.

1007
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:59,178
He would play and play and...

1008
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,812
We could watch his beard
grow over his mouth.

1009
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,402
<i>I...</i>

1010
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,611
the taquitos warm enough, mijo?

1011
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,616
Now you really remind me
of your grandpa.

1012
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:30,802
Hey. Good morning.

1013
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,861
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to your school.

1014
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,425
Jerry asked me to work
an extra shift.

1015
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,177
He gave me overtime.

1016
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,850
I got you milk for your cereal.

1017
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,532
Let me get a bowl, all right?

1018
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,315
Not going to tear
that banner down, now, are you?

1019
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,700
No.

1020
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,406
Oh, darn!

1021
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,699
Feels good to be
part of a team, don't it?

1022
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,962
Yeah.

1023
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:52,094
- Good luck, Jose.
- Thank you.

1024
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,090
Yeah, brainiacs!

1025
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,837
Go, brainiacs, go.

1026
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:55,613
Your mom got called into work
at the last minute,

1027
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:00,148
but she told me to tell you
mucho good luck.

1028
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,365
Yeah.

1029
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,865
Don't forget your underwear.

1030
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,367
I forgot mine on a trip
with your grandpa

1031
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,779
and I ended up wearing his,
and they were not so clean.

1032
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,873
All right, Abuelita.
I don't need to hear that.

1033
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,955
How long is your bus ride?

1034
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,962
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours? Oh, my god.

1035
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,125
How can anyone ride a bus
for ten hours?

1036
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:25,054
I have some hemorrhoid cream
just in case.

1037
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,684
Abuelita, I'm good down there.

1038
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,312
You're good down there.

1039
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,813
God bless you!

1040
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,981
I'll be praying for you.

1041
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,821
Blessed be the lord god almighty,
follow Jose in his journey...

1042
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,856
Abuelita, Abuelita.

1043
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:47,414
I think you've blessed me enough
to last me 20 years.

1044
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:51,620
Oh, my love, not enough blessings
are enough for you.

1045
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,923
I love you so much.

1046
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,428
Are you ready?

1047
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,392
I wouldn't be so nervous
if Dani was here.

1048
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,061
You'd be goofing off
and I'd be yelling at you two.

1049
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:19,938
Mr. A., do you think I'll ever
see her again?

1050
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,029
If you want something bad enough,

1051
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,450
it will always be within your reach.

1052
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,079
Just like this tournament.

1053
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,866
You really want to win this bad,
don't you?

1054
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:43,877
<i>All my life</i>

1055
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,893
<i>I want to be a firefly</i>

1056
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,256
<i>burning bright through the night...</i>

1057
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,314
Shooting for the moon

1058
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,767
<i>with you there</i>

1059
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,398
<i>flying through the midnight air</i>

1060
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,686
<i>all the things that we could do</i>

1061
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,900
<i>all the places we could share</i>

1062
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:06,651
<i>where we're going,
we don't need a plan</i>

1063
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:11,076
<i>hold it all in
the palm of our hand</i>

1064
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,447
let's be more
than we've ever been

1065
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,874
<i>the things we never do...</i>

1066
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:20,003
Jose, take care of the fort.
I'll be right back, okay?

1067
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,673
<i>Take a chance and jump right in...</i>

1068
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,932
Hey, hi.
Brownsville brainiacs.

1069
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:30,095
<i>Here and now was made
for me and you</i>

1070
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,466
let's be more
than we've ever been

1071
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,023
<i>the things we never do...</i>

1072
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,728
Let's get a couple games in.

1073
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,519
Come on.

1074
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,282
<i>Here and now was made for me...</i>

1075
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,316
<i>- Quick. Quick.
- And you...</i>

1076
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,911
Don't block the doors, okay?

1077
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,735
Okay.

1078
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,042
I'm going to find out
what's next.

1079
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:10,337
<i>All the things that we could do</i>

1080
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:15,095
<i>these days were made
for me and you</i>

1081
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,311
<i>all the things that we could,
all the things that we could...</i>

1082
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:24,062
<i>- You may begin.
- Baby, you and me could do</i>

1083
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,683
<i>all the things that we could do</i>

1084
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,615
<i>baby, you and me
could do, do, yeah</i>

1085
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,998
let's be more
than we've ever <i>been...</i>

1086
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,995
- Check.
- Check.

1087
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:43,168
<i>Right here, right now
was made for me and you</i>

1088
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,589
<i>- take a chance, jump right in...
- Checkmate.</i>

1089
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,168
<i>Do things we never do</i>

1090
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,514
<i>here and now
was made for me and you...</i>

1091
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,181
Checkmate.

1092
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,009
<i>Here and now was made</i>

1093
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,925
<i>for me and you.</i>

1094
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,015
- Next match?
- Yeah.

1095
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,690
Jose! OMG!

1096
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,030
I heard about Dani.
I am so sorry. I feel so bad.

1097
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,486
And you, how are you doing?
Are you okay?

1098
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,423
Have you been practicing?
Do you want some help?

1099
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,617
Do you want some party mix?
They relax me.

1100
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,826
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

1101
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,879
What are you looking at?

1102
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,224
- Nothing.
- Liar.

1103
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,257
You were checking out
that girl walking by.

1104
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,641
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you leading me on?

1105
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:38,348
Because I'm not going to be
the other woman.

1106
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,929
I was just drinking water.

1107
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,516
Boys!

1108
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,444
- Girls!
- Boys. Girls!

1109
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,147
Isn't this place a lot better
than last year's?

1110
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,735
- I wouldn't know.
- This is your first time?

1111
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,081
Yeah.

1112
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,511
Then this game
won't take very long.

1113
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,075
I won last year.

1114
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:04,464
You may begin.

1115
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,116
Check.

1116
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,344
Check.

1117
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,468
Checkmate.

1118
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,100
Good game.

1119
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:03,639
Punk.

1120
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,320
- Jose, study the notations.
- Here's his weak point.

1121
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,920
Try to get him
when he moves his king.

1122
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:16,534
I'll be right back.
I need to see the team standings.

1123
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,161
Keep working, keep working.

1124
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,538
I'm not mad anymore.
I saw your last match.

1125
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,541
- You were great.
- I was just lucky.

1126
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:31,384
That was last year's champ.

1127
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,009
It's not realistic
to think it was luck.

1128
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,442
In fact, you turned
that game on him...

1129
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,966
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

1130
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:41,759
Why do you talk
so much and so fast?

1131
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,774
Hello?
I'm a woman.

1132
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,187
That's what we do.

1133
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,766
That dude gives me the creeps.

1134
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,784
- Are you playing him?
- Yeah.

1135
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,356
You're toast.

1136
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,793
Hi, I'm Jose.
What's your name?

1137
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,036
You don't know my name?

1138
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,406
No.

1139
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,384
You really do live
in the middle of nowhere.

1140
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,006
Not again.

1141
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,507
Hi.

1142
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,588
I just want to say good luck.

1143
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,005
You're Jacob, right?

1144
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:24,854
Yeah.

1145
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:28,389
You have really cute eyes.

1146
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,024
Anything else?

1147
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,236
Pretty, isn't she?

1148
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,492
She's okay.

1149
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,751
Dude, she's hot.

1150
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,246
Yeah.

1151
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,049
You may begin.

1152
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,887
Check.

1153
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,124
Checkmate.

1154
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,418
What?

1155
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:14,996
Checkmate.

1156
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,173
Enjoy it.
It won't last.

1157
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,344
So how's the team doing?

1158
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,644
I lost count.
The computer broke.

1159
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,678
But we're holding up.

1160
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,522
Here are your chess notes
and your next opponent.

1161
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,058
Start studying, okay?

1162
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:38,732
We need you to make
at least 5 out of 8 points.

1163
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,151
The kid doesn't make mistakes.

1164
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,914
Thanks for that.

1165
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,315
The computer's finally back up.

1166
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,954
We're still uploading scores,

1167
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,802
but we believe the points
from this match

1168
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,956
will determine the team champion.

1169
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,326
Do all of you understand?

1170
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,792
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1171
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,172
- Good.
- All right.

1172
01:19:58,419 --> 01:19:59,499
Come on, Jose.

1173
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,572
I heard you're pretty good.

1174
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,743
Your coach told you
to ignore me, didn't he?

1175
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,644
My coach thinks
you're going to win.

1176
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:36,786
- Can you believe that?
- Of course, I do.

1177
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:41,804
You know, my best friend Dani
was supposed to be here.

1178
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,586
She would do anything in her power
to take you down.

1179
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,680
Well, since she's not here,

1180
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,335
I'll do it for her.

1181
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:53,264
Ladies and gentlemen,

1182
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:54,524
yo" may begin.

1183
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,771
Don't take that move.

1184
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:54,594
Check.

1185
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,792
Checkmate.

1186
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,838
Good game.

1187
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,410
That's okay.
Your points were good.

1188
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,412
- We still have a chance.
- Thanks.

1189
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:09,794
Ladies and gentlemen,

1190
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,423
there was slight delay
with the results

1191
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:15,803
of some of the final scores.

1192
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,641
We have our winning teams.

1193
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:23,387
Starting with the middle school
Texas state champion...

1194
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,017
Congratulations goes to...

1195
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:29,981
The Brownsville brainiacs.

1196
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,992
What? Come on, man.
You got to be kidding me.

1197
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,462
- There's got to be some mistake.
- Stand back.

1198
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,672
No, what kind of operation
are you running here?

1199
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:37,026
Stand back.

1200
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:41,781
And the high school
state champion, Dallas east.

1201
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,245
Congratulations to everybody.

1202
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,367
This has been
a fantastic tournament.

1203
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,464
Good job, guys.
Good job.

1204
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,481
Jose! Jose!

1205
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,446
Abuelita,
what are you doing here?

1206
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,881
I thought you couldn't make it.

1207
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,905
You're kidding.
No way!

1208
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,285
But how'd you make it here?

1209
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,078
Well...

1210
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,503
<i>I sit there in my cubicle
in the morning</i>

1211
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,883
<i>I</i> can hardly wait
to Google you today

1212
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,721
<i>but nothing every comes up,
it gets boring</i>

1213
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,298
<i>but I'll find you,
yeah, I'll find you</i>

1214
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,515
<i>I miss you so much that it hurts...</i>

1215
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:50,017
I love you so much.

1216
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,650
<i>But I know where you'll be</i>

1217
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:56,738
<i>after work...</i>

1218
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,695
You did so good.

1219
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,065
<i>You're the star in my sky...</i>

1220
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,315
How'd you learn to play like that?

1221
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,744
- From grandma.
- Yeah?

1222
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,542
- Can you teach me?
- I will.

1223
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,327
<i>On the fourth of July</i>

1224
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,670
<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing</i>

1225
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:11,956
<i>oh, oh, oh, oh...</i>

1226
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:14,289
Brainiacs! Brainiacs!

1227
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,920
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1228
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,053
<i>sometimes I feel like</i>

1229
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,180
<i>when I hold my breath
and count to ten...</i>

1230
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,717
- Okay, what's your next move?
- Be right there with <i>me...</i>

1231
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,181
I do remember this.

1232
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,562
<i>All my stars
are floating overhead</i>

1233
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:33,360
'cause <i>I</i> passed out again...

1234
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,765
You can't do that!

1235
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,284
When do I get to use this?

1236
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,777
- Are you thirsty, mijo?
- Yes, please.

1237
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,229
<i>You're like a sunny delight...</i>

1238
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,591
Show me the home away from home.

1239
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,615
All right.

1240
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,010
The most powerful piece
is the queen.

1241
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,584
You don't want to lose her.

1242
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,408
<i>You're the star in my sky</i>

1243
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,163
<i>you're the wink in my eye</i>

1244
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,745
<i>you make me feel like a kid</i>

1245
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,579
<i>that heard the ice cream truck</i>

1246
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:57,955
<i>you're like a sunny delight
on the fourth of July</i>

1247
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,173
<i>you make me sing,
you make me sing...</i>

1248
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:15,109
<i>I'll find you...</i>

1249
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,050
Let's enjoy life.
