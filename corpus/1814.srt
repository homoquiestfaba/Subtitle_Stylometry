1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,440
Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,040
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,520
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,400
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,840
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,320
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,360
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,280
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,200
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,920
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,120
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,520
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,600
After tonight.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,240
Can I get anyone more coffee?

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,320
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,800
You're welcome.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,480
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,360
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,320
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,760
Federal banks
ain't supposed to stop you...

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,200
in any way during a robbery.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,160
They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,720
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,160
I heard about
this one bloke...

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,000
He walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,560
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,000
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,880
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,480
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone...

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,760
not a pistol, not a shotgun...

38
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,680
a fucking phone.
Cleans the place out.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,440
They don't even lift
a fucking finger.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,200
The point isn't the girl.
The point is...

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
You want to rob banks?

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,320
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,720
No more liquor stores?

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,360
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,440
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

51
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,280
Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't
even speak fucking English.

52
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,640
You tell 'em,
"Empty out the register..."

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,040
they don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,320
They make it too personal.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,320
We keep on, one of these gook
fucker's gonna make us kill him.

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
I don't want to kill anybody,
either.

58
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,400
But they'll probably
put us in a situation...

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,080
where it's us or them.

60
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,280
And if it's not the gooks,
it's these old fucking Jews...

61
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,360
who've owned the store
for fifteen fucking generations.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,080
You got Grandpa Irving
sitting behind the counter...

63
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,520
with a fucking Magnum
in his hand.

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
Try walking into one of those
places with nothing but a phone.

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,840
See how far that gets you.
Fuck it. We're out of it.

66
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,200
Yeah, well, what then?
Day jobs?

67
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,320
- Not in this life.
- What, then?

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,200
Garcon! Coffee!

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
This place.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Garcon means "boy."

71
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,880
This place? A coffee shop?

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
What's wrong with that?

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,720
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations...

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,960
you get your head blown off
sticking up one of them.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,360
They're not expecting
to get robbed.

78
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,840
Not as expecting, anyway.

79
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,560
I bet you could
cut down on the hero factor...

80
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
in a place like this.

81
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Correct.

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,880
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

83
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,240
Manager... he don't give a fuck.

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,680
He's just trying
to get you out the door...

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
before you start
plugging the diners.

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,640
Waitresses? Fucking forget it.

87
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
No way they're taking a bullet
for the register.

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Busboys, some wetback
getting paid $1.50 an hour...

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
really give a fuck
you're stealing from the owner?

90
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,400
Customers sitting
with food in their mouths.

91
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
They don't know
what's going on.

92
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
One minute they're
having a Denver omelette...

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
next minute, someone's
sticking a gun in their face.

94
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,280
See, I got the idea...

95
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,560
last liquor store we stuck up.
Remember?

96
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
All the customers
kept coming in?

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
Yeah.

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,360
You got the idea
taking their wallets.

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
Thank you.

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

102
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Yes, we did.
- People come to restaurants.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,560
A lot of wallets.

104
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,480
Pretty smart, huh?

105
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Pretty smart.

106
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Come on.
- All right.

108
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Same as last time, remember?

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,040
You're crowd control.
I handle employees.

110
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
I love you, Pumpkin.

111
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,400
I love you, Honey Bunny.

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
Everybody, be cool!
This is a robbery!

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,600
Any of you
fucking pricks move...

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,200
and I'll execute every
motherfucking last one of you!

115
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Ha ha ha

116
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Jungle boogie,
Jungle boogie

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,800
- Get it on
- Jungle boogie

118
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,040
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

120
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,320
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

122
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,840
- Jungle boogie
- Come and shake it around

123
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
OK, so tell me again
about the hash bars.

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
- OK. What you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?

125
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,640
Yeah, it's legal,
but it ain't 100% legal.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,040
You just can't walk
into a restaurant...

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
roll a joint,
and start puffing away.

128
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
I mean, they want you to smoke
in your home...

129
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,440
- or certain designated places.
- And those are hash bars?

130
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,880
Yeah, it breaks down like this.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,280
It's legal to buy it,
it's legal to own it...

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
and if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar...

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
it's legal to sell it.

134
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,120
It's legal to carry it,
but... but that doesn't matter...

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,800
'cause, get a load of this,
all right?

136
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,960
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam...

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
it's illegal
for them to search you.

138
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,400
I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.

139
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, man, I'm going.
That's all there is to it.

140
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm fucking going.

141
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,200
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

142
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
But you know what the funniest
thing about Europe is?

143
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
- What?
- It's the little differences.

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here...

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,960
but it's just
a little different.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
Example?

147
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,320
You can go to a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
And I don't mean just, like,
in no paper cup.

149
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm talking about
a glass of beer.

150
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,400
And in Paris, you can
buy a beer at McDonald's.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,840
And you know what they call...

152
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,320
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in Paris?

153
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

154
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,440
No, man, they got
the metric system there.

155
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,240
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

156
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,640
What do they call it?

157
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
They call it
a "Royale with Cheese."

158
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,120
- "Royale with Cheese."
That's right.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,600
What do they call a Big Mac?

160
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it "Le Big Mac."

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,400
"Le Big Mac." Ha ha ha ha.

162
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,880
What do they call a Whopper?

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,440
I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
You know what they put on
French fries in Holland...

165
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,240
- instead of ketchup?
- What?

166
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,160
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

167
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.

168
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,680
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

169
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
Yuck.

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,360
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

172
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,280
That's counting our guy?

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm not sure.

174
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,280
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

175
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
It's possible.

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
We should have fucking shotguns.

177
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
What's her name?
Mia.

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,080
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
I don't know.
However people meet people.

180
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,800
She used to be an actress.

181
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,160
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

182
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,960
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Pilot? What's a pilot?

184
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, you know the shows on TV?

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't watch TV.

186
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah, but you are aware...

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
that there's an invention
called television...

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
Yeah.

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,560
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

191
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
That show's called a pilot.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

193
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,680
and on the strength
of that one show...

194
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,480
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

195
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,040
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

196
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,600
Some don't, become nothing.

197
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,400
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,520
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

199
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,600
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

200
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,240
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

201
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,040
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

202
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,480
I mean, he got a weight problem.

203
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

204
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,120
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

206
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
Word around the campfire is...

207
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,760
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

208
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,560
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

209
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,880
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

210
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,480
Well, then, what, then?

211
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Gave her a foot massage.

212
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,680
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Then what did Marsellus do?

214
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

215
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

216
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,600
Nigger fell four stories.

217
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

218
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,640
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

219
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,840
Nigger fell through that.

220
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

221
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,640
That's a damn shame.

222
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,800
But still, I have to say...

223
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,520
you play with matches,
you get burned.

224
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
What do you mean?

225
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,760
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,080
a foot massage.

227
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
You don't think he overreacted?

228
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

229
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,360
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

230
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,480
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

231
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,000
I give my mother a foot massage.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

233
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
on Marsellus' new wife.

234
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,240
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

235
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,480
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

236
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

238
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

239
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

240
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,040
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

241
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

243
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,520
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

244
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

245
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,600
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

246
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

247
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Have you ever given
a foot massage?

248
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,640
Don't be telling me
about foot massages.

249
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm the foot fucking master.

250
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,120
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.

251
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,560
Got my technique down
and everything.

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't be tickling or nothing.

253
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

254
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,880
Fuck you.

255
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,640
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

256
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
You know, I'm kind of tired.

257
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,520
I could use
a foot massage myself.

258
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

259
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm getting
a little pissed here.

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,360
- This is the door.
- There it is.

261
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
What time you got?

262
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,160
7:22 in the a.m.

263
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,640
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

264
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,840
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

265
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

266
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
to throw Antwan
off a building...

267
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
into a glass
motherfucking house...

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

269
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass...

270
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,920
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,840
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

272
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,680
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

273
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,200
and I'm saying it does.

274
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,960
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
and they all meant something.

276
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

278
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,800
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

279
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,640
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

280
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,400
Fucking Marsellus knew it...

281
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,360
and Antwan should've fucking
better known better.

282
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,080
I mean,
that's his fucking wife, man.

283
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,720
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

284
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,200
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,560
It's an interesting point.

286
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,600
Come on.
Let's get into character.

287
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,920
What's her name again?

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,680
- Mia.
- Mia.

289
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,840
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

290
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,520
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida...

291
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,040
and he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

292
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,120
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

293
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,960
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,680
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

295
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,760
It is not a date.

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,680
It's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife...

297
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,200
to a movie or something.

298
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
It's just good company,
that's all.

299
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

300
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

301
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,640
Hey, keep chilling.

302
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
You know who we are?

303
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
We're associates
of your business partner...

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Marsellus Wallace.

305
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,280
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

306
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Let me take a wild guess here.

307
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,560
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

308
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
I thought so.

309
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,640
You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace...

310
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,800
don't you, Brett?

311
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,280
Yeah, I remember him.

312
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
Good.

313
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,360
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

314
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,720
Sorry about that.
What you having?

315
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,440
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

316
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

317
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,120
What kind of hamburgers?

318
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

319
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,440
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

320
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,840
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

321
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,080
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

322
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,880
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

323
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

324
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,000
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

325
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,440
They're good.

326
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,240
You mind if I try one of yours?

327
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,640
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,720
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.

329
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Vincent, you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger?

330
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,840
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

331
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
I ain't hungry.

332
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,600
If you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

333
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,840
Me, I can't usually get 'em...

334
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian...

335
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,480
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian...

336
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,360
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmm.

337
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
You know what they call...

338
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,040
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

339
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,040
- No.
- Tell him, Vincent.

340
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Royale with Cheese.

341
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?

342
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,240
Because of the metric system?

343
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,320
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

344
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,840
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

345
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,360
What's in this?

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,640
- Sprite.
- Sprite, good.

347
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,000
You mind if I have
some of your tasty beverage...

348
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,760
to wash this down with?

349
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Go right ahead.

350
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,760
Ahh.

351
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
That hit the spot.

352
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,920
You, Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

353
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,440
Why don't you tell
my man Vince here...

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
- where you got the shit hid at?
It's over there.

355
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,280
I don't remember asking you
a goddamn thing!

356
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
- You were saying?
- It's in the cupboard.

357
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,520
N-no.
The one by your kn-knees.

358
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
We happy?

359
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Vincent? We happy?

360
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,520
Yeah, we happy.
Pbbbt.

361
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,920
Look... I'm sorry, uh,
I... I didn't get your name.

362
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,120
I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?
But... but I... I never got yours.

363
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
My name's Pitt...

364
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,680
and your ass ain't talking
your way out of this shit.

365
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,120
No, no, no.

366
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
I just want you to know how...

367
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
I just want you to know
how sorry we are...

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,960
that things got so fucked up
with us and... and Mr. Wallace.

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,440
W-we got into this thing with
the best intentions. I never...

370
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?

371
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,320
I didn't mean
to do that. Please, continue.

372
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,800
You were saying something
about "best intentions."

373
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,920
What's the matter?
Oh, y-you were finished?

374
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,240
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

375
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

376
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,000
What?

377
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,680
What country are you from?

378
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
Wh-what?

379
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,720
"What" ain't no country
I ever heard of!

380
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,360
- They speak English in "What"?
- Wh-what?

381
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?

382
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
Yes!

383
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,720
- Then you know what I'm saying.
- Yes!

384
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,120
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

385
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
What? I...

386
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,400
Say "what" again!
Say "what" again!

387
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,480
I dare you!
I double-dare you, motherfucker!

388
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Say "what"
one more goddamn time!

389
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,280
H-h-he's black.

390
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,680
- Go on!
- He's bald.

391
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,280
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

392
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Oww! Aah!

393
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,760
- Does he look like a bitch?
- No!

394
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,920
Then why you try to fuck him
like a bitch, Brett?

395
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,320
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

396
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,560
Yes, you did, Brett!

397
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,720
You tried to fuck him.
- No.

398
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
Marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked...

399
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,480
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

400
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,120
You read the Bible, Brett?

401
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
Y-yes.

402
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,280
Well, there's this
passage I got memorized...

403
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,560
sort of fits this occasion.
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

404
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,800
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

405
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,800
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

406
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,600
"and the tyranny of evil men.

407
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,400
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

408
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,440
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

409
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,040
"and the finder
of lost children.

411
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,760
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

412
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,280
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

413
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,760
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

414
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,360
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

415
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,840
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

416
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,360
No!

417
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,960
Let's stay together

418
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,680
I think you're gonna find...

419
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,960
when all this shit
is over and done...

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
I think
you're gonna find yourself...

421
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
one smilin' motherfucker.

422
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,840
Thing is, Butch,
right now you got ability.

423
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,160
But painful as it may be,
ability don't last.

424
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,240
And your days
are just about over.

425
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life...

426
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,720
but that's a fact of life...

427
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,160
your ass is gonna have
to get realistic about.

428
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,360
See, this business
is filled to the brim...

429
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,520
with unrealistic
motherfuckers...

430
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,320
motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

431
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,680
If you mean it turns
to vinegar, it does.

432
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,160
If you mean it gets better
with age, it don't.

433
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Besides, Butch...

434
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
how many fights you think
you got in you, anyway?

435
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,560
Hmm? Two?

436
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,080
Boxers don't have
an Old-timer's Day.

437
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,920
You came close,
but you never made it.

438
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
And if you were
gonna make it...

439
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,440
You would have made it
before now.

440
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,080
Good or bad

441
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,920
Or happy or sad

442
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,320
Ooh, ooh, ooh

443
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,080
Ooh, ooooh, ooh

444
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeah

445
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,440
You my nigger?

446
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
It certainly appears so.

447
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,640
Night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

448
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,080
That's pride fucking with you.

449
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,280
Fuck pride!

450
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,520
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.

451
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,880
You fight through that shit.

452
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,280
'Cause a year from now...

453
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,720
when you're kickin' it
in the Caribbean...

454
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,440
you're gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

455
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,040
Ha ha ha.

456
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,280
I got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace.

457
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

458
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,240
Say it.

459
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

460
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,680
Yo, Vincent Vega,
our man in Amsterdam.

461
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,840
Jules Winnfield,
our man in Inglewood.

462
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,400
Get your asses on in here!

463
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Goddamn, nigger!
What's up with them clothes?

464
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
You don't even want to know.

465
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,240
Where's the big man?

466
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
Big man's right over there
taking care of some business.

467
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,800
Why don't you hang back
for a second or two, you know?

468
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,440
You see the white boy leave,
just go on over.

469
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,080
How you been?

470
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,800
I've been doing pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

471
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,720
All right.

472
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,240
So, I hear you're taking Mia out
tomorrow?

473
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,360
At Marsellus' request.

474
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,480
Have you met Mia?

475
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,400
Not yet.

476
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
- What's so fucking funny?
- Not a goddamn thing.

477
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,080
I got to piss.

478
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,360
Look, I'm not a fucking idiot,
all right?

479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
It's the big man's wife.
I'm gonna sit across from her...

480
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,680
chew my food
with my mouth closed...

481
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,400
laugh at her fucking jokes,
and that's it.

482
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,560
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

483
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
Then what did you fucking ask me
about it for?

484
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,560
Asshole.

485
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
Give me a pack of Red Apples.

486
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,960
Filters?
- Nah.

487
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,120
You looking at something,
friend?

488
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,040
You ain't my friend, palooka.

489
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,320
What was that?

490
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,840
I think you heard me just fine,
punchy.

491
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,240
Vincent Vega's in the house?

492
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,280
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.

493
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,800
You'd never do that to me

494
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,920
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

495
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
Don't worry about it.

496
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

497
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,080
And some matches.

498
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,960
Here's what I want to do

499
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,120
Hey

500
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
We ought to stay together

501
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,200
It's as if it turns...

502
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,040
every part of your body
into the tip of a penis.

503
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,440
Wow.

504
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

505
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,920
Well, you see
how they use that gun...

506
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,320
to pierce your ears?

507
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
They don't use that to pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

508
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,360
Forget that gun.

509
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,880
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

510
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,680
All my piercing,
eighteen places on my body...

511
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
every one of 'em
done with a needle.

512
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,040
Five in each ear. One through
the nipple of my left breast.

513
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,120
Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

514
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,800
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

515
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,080
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

516
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,360
Excuse me.

517
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,720
I was just curious, but, um...

518
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
why would you wear a stud
in your tongue?

519
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,480
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

520
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,400
Vincenzo. Step into my office.

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
This is Panda,
from Mexico.

522
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,920
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.

523
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,640
Different, but equally good.

524
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,000
And that is Choco, from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

525
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,720
Now, the first two
are the same...

526
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,760
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

527
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,240
But this one
is a little more expensive.

528
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,640
This is 500 a gram,
but when you shoot it...

529
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,720
you will know
where that extra money went.

530
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
Now, there's nothing wrong
with these two.

531
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,760
This is real, real,
real good shit.

532
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,280
But this one
is a fucking madman.

533
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,680
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.

534
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Am I a nigger?

535
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,560
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.

536
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,280
Now, white people
who know the difference...

537
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,200
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

538
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...

539
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,160
with that Amsterdam shit
any old day of the fucking week.

540
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,800
That's a bold statement.

541
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

542
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
This is a seller's market.

543
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,400
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

544
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,320
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

545
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,240
All right,
give me three grams of madman.

546
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,080
If it's as good
as you say it is...

547
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,640
I'll come back
and buy another thousand.

548
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,560
Well, I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

549
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,920
But... I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

550
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
That is what a nice guy I am.

551
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

552
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,160
Yeah, that's cool.

553
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,880
All right.
I'll just get one for you.

554
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,760
Honey,
will you get me some baggies...

555
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,600
and, uh,
twistix from the kitchen?

556
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,600
OK.

557
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,520
Hey, uh,
what do you think about Trudi?

558
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,920
She ain't got a boyfriend.

559
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,000
You want to, uh,
hang out, get high?

560
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,480
Which one is Trudi?

561
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,400
The one with all the shit
in her face.

562
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,720
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

563
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,960
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

564
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,680
No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.

565
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,120
All right. No problemo.

566
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,840
I'll take a rain check.

567
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,200
Oh.
Thank you, Jody.

568
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Still got your Malibu?

569
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,400
Ah, man. You know what some
fucker did the other day?

570
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,360
What?
- Fucking keyed it.

571
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,960
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it.

572
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,080
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days...

573
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,840
and some dickless piece of shit
fucked with it.

574
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
They should be
fucking killed, man.

575
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,520
No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

576
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,000
Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.

577
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,760
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

578
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
It'a been worth him
doing it...

579
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,120
just so I could've caught him
doing it.

580
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,240
- What a fucker!
- What's more chicken shit...

581
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,760
than fucking
with a man's automobile?

582
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,880
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

583
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,200
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

584
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

585
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,800
Mind if I shoot up here?

586
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,360
Mi casa, su casa.

587
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,960
Muchas gracias.

588
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Hello?

589
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,560
Billy Ray was a preacher's son

590
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,000
And when his daddy
would visit he'd come along

591
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,520
Vincent.

592
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,840
Vincent.
I'm on the intercom.

593
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,040
Where is it?
Where is the intercom?

594
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,320
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

595
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
To your right.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,520
...was the son
of a preacher man

597
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,720
The only boy...

598
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,920
Warm. Warmer. Disco.

599
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,120
Hello.

600
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,200
Push the button
if you want to talk.

601
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,560
- Hello.
- Go make yourself a drink...

602
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,080
and I'll be down
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

603
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
The bar is by the fireplace.

604
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,800
Being good isn't always easy

605
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,000
OK.

606
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,480
When he started
sweet-talkin' to me

607
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,040
He'd come and tell me
everything is all right

608
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,600
He'd kiss and tell me
everything is all right

609
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
Can I get away again tonight?

610
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,400
The only one
who could ever reach me

611
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,960
Was the son of a preacher man

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,600
The only boy
who could ever teach me

613
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,560
Was the son of a preacher man

614
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Yes, he was, he was

615
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
- Lord knows he was,
- Ooh, yes, he was

616
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,560
How well I remember

617
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
The look
that was in his eyes

618
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,640
Stealin' kisses
from me on the sly

619
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,960
Takin' time to make time

620
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Tellin' me that he's all mine

621
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,960
Learnin' from
each other's knowin'

622
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,120
Lookin' to see
how much we've grown

623
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,240
And the only one
who could ever reach me

624
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,480
Was the son of a preacher man

625
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,120
The only boy
who could ever teach me

626
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,880
Was the son of a preacher man

627
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,160
Yes, he was, he was

628
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,120
Oh, yes, he was

629
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,960
Let's go.

630
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,560
What the fuck is this place?

631
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,320
This is Jack Rabbit Slim's.
An Elvis man should love it.

632
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,240
Come on, Mia,
let's go get a steak.

633
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
You can get a steak here,
daddy-o.

634
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,680
Don't be a...

635
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,920
Oh, after you,
kitty cat.

636
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,400
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

637
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,080
Now, how may I help you?

638
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,000
There's a reservation
under Wallace.

639
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,680
- Wallace?
- We reserved a car.

640
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,600
Oh, a car. Why don't you
seat them in the Chrysler?

641
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,400
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

642
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,720
Then we start to rock

643
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,560
School gal, baby,
gonna tell you some news

644
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

645
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,160
Well, it's one, two,
pull off my shoes

646
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Three, four,

00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,120
Five, six, gonna get your kicks

648
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,240
Down at the corner
of Lincoln and 46th, yeah

649
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,360
All right

650
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,640
I've been waitin'
in school all day long

651
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Waitin' on the bell
to ring so I can go home

652
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,200
Throw my books on the table,
Pick up the telephone

653
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,760
Come on, baby,
let's get somethin' goin'

654
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,680
Decaf!
Just a minute.

655
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,840
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

656
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,080
Then we start to rock

657
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,720
School's out baby,

658
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,880

Well, it's one, two,

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,840

Five, six,

Down at the corner

You gotta move,

Rockin', rockin', baby,

Ricky! Ricky!

667
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

668
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,040
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

669
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,680
Vincent!

670
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,800
Just so that you all know...

671
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,320
Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show.

672
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,120
So we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jack Rabbit Slim's.

673
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,880
Thank you.

674
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,360
Call for...

675
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Phillip... Morris!

676
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,240
What do you think?

677
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,840
I think it's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

678
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,760
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

679
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,640
Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.

680
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,480
Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.

681
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,880
How do you want that cooked?

682
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,320
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

683
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,640
Bloody as hell, and oh, yeah,
look at this. Vanilla Coke.

684
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,760
What about you, Peggy Sue?

685
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:49,720
I'll have the Durwood Kirby
burger, bloody, and...

686
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,120
the $5.00 shake.

687
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,400
How do you want that shake?

688
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,840
Martin and Lewis,
or Amos and Andy?

689
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,120
Martin and Lewis.

690
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,840
Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

691
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,920
Mm-hmm.

692
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,600
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

693
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,520
Last I heard.
- That's $5.00?

694
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,280
You don't put bourbon in it
or nothin'?

695
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,680
- No.
- Just checkin'.

696
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

697
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,240
...lonesome town

698
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,040
To cry my troubles away...

699
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,360
Could you, um...

700
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,480
roll me one of those, cowboy?

701
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,360
You can have this one, cowgirl.

702
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
Thanks.

703
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,640
...with regret

704
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,760
Think nothin' of it.

705
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,520
...lonesome town

706
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,800
I can learn to forget

707
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,000
So... Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

708
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,600
- Sure did.
How long were you there?

709
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,520
Just over three years.

710
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,680
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

711
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,320
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

712
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
Why would you?

713
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,600
I heard you did a pilot.

714
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,760
That was my fifteen minutes.

715
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,360
What was it?

716
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,080
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

717
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,920
called "Fox Force Five."

718
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,440
- What?
"Fox Force Five."

719
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

720
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,240
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

721
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,960
And Five, as in there's one,
two, three, four, five of us.

722
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

723
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,840
She was the leader.

724
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,560
The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

725
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,360
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

726
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,440
French Fox's speciality was sex.

727
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,960
What was your specialty?

728
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,680
Knives.

729
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,440
Character I played,
Raven McCoy...

730
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,480
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

731
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,920
According to the show...

732
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,600
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

733
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,360
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

734
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,120
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

735
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,200
And if we would've
got picked up...

736
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,600
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show...

737
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,440
I would've told another joke.

738
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,240
You know any of them old jokes?

739
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Well, I only got the chance
to say one...

740
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,920
'cause we only did one show.

741
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,240
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

742
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,040
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

743
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,440
No. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

744
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,840
You'd be em...

745
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,720
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

746
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,640
I promise I won't laugh.

747
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,560
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

748
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,800
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

749
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you...

750
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,160
'cause it's been
built up too much.

751
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,720
What a gyp.

752
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,160
Martin and Lewis.

753
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,360
Vanilla Coke.

754
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,720
Mmm. Yummy.

755
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,720
You think
I could have a sip of that?

756
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,240
Be my guest.

757
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,120
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like.

758
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,200
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

759
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,440
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

760
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,240
All right.

761
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,800
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

762
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,280
Told you.

763
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,760
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00...

764
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,200
but it was pretty fucking good.

765
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Don't you hate that?

766
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,600
Hate what?

767
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,920
Uncomfortable silences.

768
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,840
Why do we feel
it's necessary...

769
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,200
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

770
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,840
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

771
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,640
That's when you know you've
found somebody really special...

772
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,000
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute...

773
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,240
and comfortably share a silence.

774
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,720
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet...

775
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,240
but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

776
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,440
I'll tell you what.

777
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

778
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,000
You sit here
and think of something to say.

779
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,120
I'll do that.

780
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,160
OK.

781
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,120
I said goddamn! Goddamn.

782
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,520
Goddamn.

783
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,840
I need some hair spray.

784
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,160
Mmm. Don't you just love it...

785
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,640
when you come back
from the bathroom...

786
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,360
to find your food
waiting for you?

787
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,760
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

788
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,160
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

789
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,560
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

790
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,000
Would you like some coffee?

791
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,480
Which one? There's two Monroes.

792
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,160
No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.

793
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,960
That is Mamie Van Doren.

794
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,600
And I don't see
Jayne Mansfield.

795
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,680
She must have the night off
or somethin'.

796
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,000
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.

797
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,760
So, did you think
of somethin' to say?

798
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,800
Actually, I did.

799
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,360
However...

800
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
You seem like
a really nice person...

801
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,520
and I don't want to offend you.

802
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,880
Ooh. This doesn't sound like
the usual mindless, boring...

803
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,000
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

804
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,360
That sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say.

805
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,000
Well, well, I do.
I do.

806
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,520
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

807
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,920
No! No, no, no.

808
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,160
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

809
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,600
I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me...

810
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,680
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me...

811
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,640
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

812
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,120
Then,
through no fault of my own...

813
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,600
- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.

814
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,120
That's an impossibility.

815
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,040
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this...

816
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,640
would be an exercise
in futility.

817
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,040
Is that a fact?

818
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,920
Besides,
isn't it more exciting...

819
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,720
- when you don't have permission?
All right. All right.

820
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,560
Well, here it goes.

821
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,400
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

822
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,520
Who's Antwan?

823
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,760
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

824
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,320
He fell out of a window.

825
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,640
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

826
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,240
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

827
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,640
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

828
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,560
and yet even another way
is to say...

829
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,600
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

830
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,000
Is that a fact?

831
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,920
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

832
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,720
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

833
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,560
They.

834
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,320
They talk a lot, don't they?

835
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,040
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

836
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,960
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

837
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,720
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

838
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,840
Did it involve the "F" word?

839
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
No. No, no, no.

840
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,720
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

841
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,680
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

842
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,920
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

843
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,040
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

844
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,720
Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

845
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,960
Well, I mean...

846
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,200
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

847
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,920
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

848
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,520
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

849
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,960
No, it seemed excessive...

850
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,800
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

851
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,200
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

852
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,320
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

853
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,080
A husband
almost killing another man...

854
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,360
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

855
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,200
But did it happen?

856
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,920
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

857
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,600
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

858
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,040
Really?

859
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,960
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

860
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,480
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

861
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,640
except Marsellus and Tony.

862
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,640
But when you little scamps
get together...

863
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,200
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

864
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,440
Ladies and gentlemen...

865
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,880
now the moment
you've all been waiting for...

866
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,840
the world-famous Jack Rabbit
Slim's Twist Contest.

867
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,200
This is where
one lucky couple...

868
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,280
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

869
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,080
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

870
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,520
Right here!

871
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,840
Hey, all right!
- I wanna dance.

872
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

873
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,320
No, no, no, no, no, no.

874
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,000
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

875
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,640
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

876
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,240
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

877
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,080
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

878
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,520
All right. You asked for it.

879
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,040
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

880
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,600
Let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.

881
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,760
Young lady, what is your name?

882
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,640
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

883
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,560
And how about your fella here?

884
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,000
Vincent Vega.

885
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,720
All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

886
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,800
Yay!
Go for it!

887
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,360
All right!

888
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,480
It was a teenage wedding

889
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,720
And the old folks
wished 'em well

890
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,160
You could see that Pierre

891
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,600
Did truly love the mademoiselle

892
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,640
And now the young
monsieur and Madame

893
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,600
Have rung the chapel bell

894
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,200
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

895
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,440
It goes to show
you never can tell

896
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,840
They furnished off
an apartment

897
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,440
With a two-room Roebuck sale

898
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,640
The coolerator was crammed

899
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,160
With TV dinners and ginger ale

900
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,320
But when Pierre found work

901
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,560
The little money comin'
worked out well

902
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,520
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

903
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,880
It goes to show
you never can tell

904
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
They had a hi-fi phono

905
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,520
Boy, did they let it blast

906
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,280
700 little records

907
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,600
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

908
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,800
But when the sun went down

909
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,280
The rapid tempo
of the music fell

910
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,040
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

911
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,200
It goes to show
you never can tell

912
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,160
They had a teenage wedding

913
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,920
And the old folks
wished 'em well

914
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,880
You could see that Pierre

915
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,440
Did truly love
the mademoiselle

916
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,360
Ha ha ha!

917
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,800
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

918
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,960
I don't know what you call that.

919
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,640
Drinks. Music.

920
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,240
I'm gonna take a piss.

921
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,400
That's a little bit
more information...

922
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,920
than I needed, Vince,
but go right ahead.

923
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
Girl

924
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,800
Bow, bow, bow

925
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,800
You'll be a woman soon

926
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,040
I love you so much,
can't count all the ways

927
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,920
I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say is

928
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
He's not your kind

929
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,200
They never get tired
of puttin' me down

930
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,800
And I never know
when I come around

931
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,200
What I'm gonna find

932
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,120
Don't let them
make up your mind

933
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,360
Don't you know, girl

934
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,360
Bow, bow, bow

935
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,080
You'll be a woman soon

936
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,760
One drink and that's it.

937
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,320
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink.

938
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,800
But do it quickly.

939
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,800
Say good night and go home.

940
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,760
Girl

941
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,080
You'll be a woman soon

942
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,960
Soon

943
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,560
You'll need a woman

944
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,960
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

945
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,120
But what they're sayin', girl,
just cuts like a knife

946
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,880
The boy's no good

947
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,000
Well, I finally have found
what I've been lookin' for

948
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
But if they get a chance,
they'll end it for sure

949
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,120
Sure they would

950
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,480
Baby, I've done...

951
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,600
You see, this is a moral test
of oneself.

952
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,400
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

953
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,040
Because being loyal
is very important.

954
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,680
They never
get tired of puttin' me down

955
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,520
And I never know
when I come around

956
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,680
What I'm gonna find

957
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,040
Don't let them
make up your mind

958
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,240
Don't you know, girl

959
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,520
You'll be a woman soon

960
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,800
Please

961
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,280
Come take my hand

962
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,720
Girl

963
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,480
You'll be a woman soon

964
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,960
Please

965
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,520
Come take my hand

966
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,560
Hello.

967
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Girl

968
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,520
So, you're gonna go out there,
you're gonna say...

969
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,720
"Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."

970
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,120
Walk out the door
and get in the car.

971
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,920
Go home, jerk off,
and that's all you're gonna do.

972
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,800
Now it's up to you, girl

973
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,720
You'll be a woman soon

974
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,200
Please

975
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,040
Come take my hand

976
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,080
You'll be a woman soon

977
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,680
Soon

978
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,000
You'll need a man

979
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,800
All right, Mia.
So, listen, I gotta go.

980
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,640
All right?

981
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,160
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

982
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,120
You f... Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

983
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,640
Oh, come on, girl.
We're gettin' out of here.

984
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,760
We gotta walk now.

985
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,240
Don't fucking die on me, Mia.

986
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,720
Silly fuck.

987
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,800
Answer!

988
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,480
Have you got the ring?

989
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,600
Why, certainly.

990
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,840
Join hands,
you two love birds.

991
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,960
Uh-uh.

992
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,840
Please. Please.
Hurry up.

993
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,080
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

994
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,960
Hold hands, you love birds.

995
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,040
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

996
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,280
Now, what do you say?

997
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,720
I give up,
I'll marry you!

998
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,360
Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

999
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,400
I can hear it.

1000
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,080
I thought you told
those fuckin' assholes...

1001
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,760
never to call here this late.

1002
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,120
Yeah, I told 'em...

1003
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,240
and that is exactly
what I'm going to tell...

1004
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,840
this fucking asshole right now.

1005
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,240
I'll teach you a thing or two.

1006
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,400
Don't you dare strike me!

1007
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,360
Hello?

1008
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,920
Lance, Vincent.

1009
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,880
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.

1010
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,480
I'm comin' to your house.

1011
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,000
Whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses, man.

1012
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,440
Wh-what's the problem?

1013
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,600
I got this chick,
she's fuckin' Odin on me.

1014
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,680
Don't bring her here.

1015
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,640
I'm not even fucking
joking with you, man.

1016
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,840
Don't not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-butt to my house.

1017
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,800
No choice.

1018
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,920
She's O.D. In'?

1019
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,880
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!

1020
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,800
OK, well, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet...

1021
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,080
and you take her to a hospital
and call a lawyer.

1022
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,080
Negative.

1023
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,640
This is not
my fuckin' problem, man!

1024
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,320
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

1025
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,440
Are you talking to me
on a cellular phone?

1026
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,800
I don't know you.
Who is this?

1027
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,200
Don't come here.
I'm hanging up the phone.

1028
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,480
Prank caller! Prank caller!

1029
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,520
What the hell was that?!

1030
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,400
Have you lost
your fucking mind?!

1031
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,680
You were talking about drug shit
on a cellular ph...

1032
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,680
Lance, help me.

1033
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,080
You crashed your car
into my fuckin' house!

1034
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,040
Grab her feet.

1035
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,800
Hey, hey, hey!
Are you deaf?

1036
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,520
You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

1037
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,560
This fucked-up bitch
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

1038
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
Do you know
who Marsellus Wallace is?

1039
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
Yeah.

1040
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,800
If she croaks on me,
I'm a fucking grease spot!

1041
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,680
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help...

1042
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,800
and that you let her die
on your fuckin' lawn.

1043
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,920
Now, come on, help me.
Help me. Pick her up.

1044
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,080
Shit!

1045
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,440
Lance!

1046
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,760
Shit!

1047
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,280
It's 1:30
in the goddamn morning.

1048
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,440
What the fuck's
going on out here?

1049
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,160
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1050
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,680
Who's she?

1051
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,280
Go to the fridge
and get the adrenaline shot.

1052
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,520
What's wrong with her?

1053
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,720
- She's O.D.ing!
- Get her out of here!

1054
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,920
Get the shot!

1055
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,880
Fuck you!
Fuck you, too!

1056
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,320
What a fuckin' bitch.

1057
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,640
Just keep talkin' to her.

1058
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,640
She's gettin' the shot.

1059
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,280
I'm gonna go get
my little black medical book.

1060
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,760
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

1061
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
I never had to give
an adrenaline shot before.

1062
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,760
You've never given
an adrenaline shot?

1063
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,960
I never had to.

1064
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,160
I don't go joypopping
with a bunch of bubblegummers.

1065
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
My friends
can handle their highs.

1066
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
- Get the shot!
- I am if you'll let me.

1067
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,520
I ain't fucking stopping you!

1068
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,000
Well, stop talkin' to me.
Start talkin' to her!

1069
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,440
- Get the shot!
- All right!

1070
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,080
Hurry up, Lance!
We're losin' her!

1071
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,680
I'm lookin' as fast as I can!

1072
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,360
What's he lookin' for?

1073
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,160
I don't know. Some book.

1074
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,560
What are you lookin' for?

1075
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,000
My little black medical book!

1076
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,280
What are you lookin' for?

1077
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,800
A little black
fuckin' medical book!

1078
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,560
It's like a textbook
they give to nurses.

1079
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,160
I never saw no medical book.

1080
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,440
Well, trust me, I have one.

1081
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,720
If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot?

1082
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,320
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!

1083
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,800
While you're lookin' for it,
she's gonna die on our carpet.

1084
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,080
You're never gonna find anything
in this mess.

1085
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,840
Honey, I'm going to fucking
kill you if you don't shut up!

1086
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,840
Get in here!

1087
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,080
Christ.

1088
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,800
Get the fuck out of my way.

1089
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,880
Pig.

1090
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,080
Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.

1091
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,200
While I'm doin' this...

1092
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,960
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

1093
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,120
It's got to be exact?
Yeah, exact.

1094
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,040
A shot in the heart,
so I guess it's gotta be exact.

1095
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,560
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's here.

1096
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,040
- That's it.
- This it?

1097
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,880
What I need
is a big fat magic marker.

1098
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,360
- You got it?
- What?

1099
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,040
A magic marker! A felt pen!
A fuckin' black magic marker!

1100
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,880
All right.
Hurry up.

1101
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,600
Fuck. OK, OK, OK.
I think it's ready.

1102
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,000
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- I'll tell you what to do.

1103
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,920
No, no, no.
You're gonna give her the shot.

1104
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,400
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.

1105
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,800
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I never done this before.

1106
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,720
I ain't never done it before,
either. I ain't startin' now.

1107
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
You brought her here, that means
you're gonna give her the shot.

1108
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,160
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house...

1109
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,880
then I give her the shot.
Give her the shot.

1110
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,960
- Give it to me.
- Here.

1111
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,960
Give me that.

1112
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,000
Tell me what to do.

1113
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,760
OK. You're giving her
an injection of adrenaline...

1114
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,400
straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

1115
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,640
You've got to
pierce through that.

1116
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,760
You gotta bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

1117
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,400
I gotta stab her three times?

1118
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,200
No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

1119
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,640
But hard enough to get through
her breastplate into her heart.

1120
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,560
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

1121
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,640
OK, then what happens?

1122
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,960
I'm kind of curious
about that myself.

1123
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,120
This ain't no fuckin' joke, man!

1124
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,520
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!

1125
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,560
She's supposed to come
out of it like that.

1126
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,760
All right. Count to three.
Ready?

1127
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,000
One...

1128
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,560
two...

1129
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,120
Three!

1130
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,560
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1131
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,240
If you're all right,
then say something.

1132
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,160
Something.

1133
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,480
Ha ha. That was fuckin' trippy.
Ha ha ha ha.

1134
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,720
Uhh.

1135
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,760
Oh, man.

1136
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,320
Mia. Mia.

1137
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,480
What's...

1138
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,560
what's your thoughts on... on...

1139
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,040
on how to handle this?

1140
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,440
What's yours?

1141
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,600
Well, I'm of the opinion...

1142
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,720
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

1143
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,960
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident.

1144
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,520
If Marsellus knew
about this incident...

1145
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,880
I'd be in as much trouble
as you.

1146
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,320
I seriously doubt that.

1147
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,960
I can keep a secret if you can.

1148
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,440
Shake on it?

1149
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,920
Mum's the word?

1150
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,160
Cool.

1151
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,680
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1152
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,480
I'm gonna go home
and have a heart attack.

1153
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,920
Vincent!

1154
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,560
Do you want to hear
my "Fox Force Five" joke?

1155
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,040
Sure.

1156
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,520
Except that I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

1157
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,120
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

1158
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,600
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

1159
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,720
I can't wait.

1160
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,760
OK.

1161
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,080
Three tomatoes are walking
down the street...

1162
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,480
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato,
and Baby Tomato.

1163
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,360
Baby Tomato
starts lagging behind...

1164
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,280
and Papa Tomato
gets really angry...

1165
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,040
goes back and squishes him,
and says, "Catch up."

1166
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,640
Hmm. Hmm.

1167
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,760
Ketchup.

1168
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,080
See you around.

1169
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,320
Oh, that Paddlefoot...
he funny, silly dog.

1170
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,880
He think totem pole alive.
Hee hee hee!

1171
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,920
He arctic tenderfoot.

1172
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,520
Ho ho ho ho!

1173
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,360
That totem pole
been here forever.

1174
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,360
Butch?

1175
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,960
Butch,
stop watching TV a second.

1176
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,160
Yeah?

1177
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,400
We got a special visitor.

1178
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,000
Now... do you
remember when I told you...

1179
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,040
your daddy died
in a P.O.W. Camp?

1180
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,840
Well... this here
is Captain Koons.

1181
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,440
He was in the P.O.W. Camp
with Daddy.

1182
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,560
Hello, little man.

1183
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,480
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

1184
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,720
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

1185
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,960
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

1186
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,280
over five years.

1187
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,160
Hopefully...

1188
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,640
you'll never have to experience
this yourself...

1189
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,040
but when two men
are in a situation...

1190
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,240
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were...

1191
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,680
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

1192
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,080
If it had been me who'd...

1193
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,160
not made it...

1194
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,400
Major Coolidge would be talkin'
right now to my son... Jim.

1195
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,680
But the way
it turned out...

1196
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,120
I'm talkin' to you...

1197
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,800
Butch.

1198
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,280
I got somethin' for ya.

1199
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,960
This watch I got here...

1200
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,120
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather...

1201
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,360
during the First World War.

1202
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,640
It was bought
in a little general store...

1203
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,880
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1204
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,440
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1205
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,520
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1206
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,720
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

1207
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,280
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

1208
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,400
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

1209
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,840
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1210
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,160
And when he'd done his duty...

1211
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,320
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

1212
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,600
took the watch off...

1213
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,520
put it in an old coffee can...

1214
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,800
and in that can it stayed...

1215
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,520
Till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge...

1216
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,040
was called upon
by his country...

1217
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,800
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1218
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,320
This time they called it
World War II.

1219
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,880
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

1220
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,240
to your granddad for good luck.

1221
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,160
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1222
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,680
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

1223
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,440
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

1224
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,720
Your granddad was facing death.

1225
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,600
He knew it.

1226
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,240
None of those boys
had any illusions...

1227
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,640
about ever leaving
that island alive...

1228
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,640
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

1229
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,640
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

1230
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,000
name of Winocki...

1231
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,440
a man he had never met
before in his life...

1232
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,600
to deliver to his infant son...

1233
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,640
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

1234
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,120
his gold watch.

1235
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,200
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

1236
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,160
but Winocki kept his word.

1237
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,080
After the war was over...

1238
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,440
he paid a visit
to your grandmother...

1239
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,600
delivering
to your infant father...

1240
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,440
his dad's gold watch.

1241
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,160
This watch.

1242
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,240
This watch
was on your daddy's wrist...

1243
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,240
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1244
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,640
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1245
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,600
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1246
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,000
they'd confiscate it...

1247
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,240
take it away.

1248
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,640
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1249
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,280
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1250
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,440
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

1251
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,320
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

1252
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,760
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1253
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,720
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

1254
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,320
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

1255
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,640
Then... after seven years...

1256
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,520
I was sent home to my family.
And...

1257
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,960
now...

1258
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,440
little man,
I give the watch to you.

1259
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,960
It's time, Butch.

1260
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,880
...weighing 210 pounds...

1261
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,760
Floyd Ray Wilson!

1262
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,200
It's official.
It's official. Wilson is dead!

1263
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,840
Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest...

1264
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,240
and the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen.

1265
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,720
Coolidge left faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer...

1266
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,880
leave the ring.

1267
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,320
Do you think he knew
Wilson was dead?

1268
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,520
My guess would be yes, Richard.

1269
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,160
I could see
the frenzy in his eyes...

1270
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,640
give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

1271
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,560
I think any man would have
left the ring that fast.

1272
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,880
Do you feel this tragedy...

1273
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,600
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing?

1274
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,920
Such a tragedy can't help
but shake the boxing world...

1275
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,280
to its very foundations...

1276
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,760
but par amount importance is
during the sad weeks ahead...

1277
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,720
the eyes of the WBA remain...

1278
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,360
Mia.

1279
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,600
Marsellus?

1280
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,480
I didn't do it, man.

1281
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,480
How you doin'?

1282
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,560
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.

1283
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,240
What you got?

1284
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,200
He booked.

1285
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,680
His trainer?

1286
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,360
Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

1287
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,080
Think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

1288
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,560
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

1289
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1290
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,320
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1291
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,800
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

1292
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,440
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1293
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,080
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1294
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,520
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1295
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,320
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1296
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,200
I will take care of it.

1297
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,040
Mister?

1298
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,200
Hey, mister?

1299
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,160
What?

1300
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,960
You were in that fight.

1301
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,840
The fight on the radio.

1302
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,320
You're the fighter?

1303
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,240
Now, what gave you that idea?

1304
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,640
No, ho, come on.

1305
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,880
You're him.

1306
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,320
I know you're him.

1307
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,720
Tell me you're him.

1308
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,440
I'm him.

1309
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,960
You killed
the other boxing man.

1310
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,640
He's dead?

1311
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,880
The radio said he was dead.

1312
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1313
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,520
What does it feel like?

1314
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,640
What does what feel like?

1315
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,560
Killing a man.

1316
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,400
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1317
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,040
Are you a weirdo?

1318
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,560
No.

1319
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,080
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1320
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,600
You are the first person
I've met...

1321
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,320
who has killed somebody.

1322
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,680
So...

1323
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,560
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1324
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,480
I'll tell you what.

1325
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,280
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1326
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,080
and I'll tell you all about it.

1327
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,640
So...

1328
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,280
Esmarelda...

1329
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,480
Villalobos.

1330
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,640
Is that Mexican?

1331
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:49,800
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1332
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,440
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1333
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,320
Thank you.

1334
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,920
And what is your name?

1335
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,040
Butch.

1336
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,400
What does it mean?

1337
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,160
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1338
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,480
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1339
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,480
What is it you wanna know?

1340
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,760
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1341
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,200
I couldn't tell ya.

1342
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1343
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,920
Now that I know he's dead...

1344
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,840
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1345
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,280
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1346
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,960
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1347
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,320
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1348
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,240
the odds went through the roof.

1349
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,880
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1350
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,320
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1351
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,560
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1352
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,760
He never laced up his gloves...

1353
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,440
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1354
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,320
he'd still be alive.

1355
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,520
Yeah, well...

1356
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,520
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1357
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,080
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1358
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,800
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1359
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,760
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1360
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,160
All eight?

1361
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,160
How long to collect?

1362
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,880
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1363
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,160
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1364
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,920
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1365
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,040
that is great news, man.

1366
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,560
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1367
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,200
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1368
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,280
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1369
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,960
OK, my brother.

1370
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,480
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1371
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,560
All right, Scotty.

1372
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,920
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1373
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,320
Be cool, brother.

1374
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,640
45.60.

1375
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,400
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1376
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,560
Now...

1377
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,360
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1378
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,440
what are you gonna say?

1379
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,720
The truth.

1380
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,440
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1381
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,880
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1382
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,280
Buenas noches, Butch.

1383
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,040
Keep the light off.

1384
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,000
Is that better,
sugar pop?

1385
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:48,960
Oui.

1386
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,120
Hard day at the office?

1387
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,960
Pretty hard.

1388
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,240
I got in a fight.

1389
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,560
Poor baby.

1390
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,280
Can we make spoons?

1391
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,800
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1392
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,480
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1393
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,840
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1394
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,680
Let me take this jacket off.

1395
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,360
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1396
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,680
Uh-huh.

1397
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,080
I wish I had a pot.

1398
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,360
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1399
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,080
and you wish you had some pot?

1400
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,960
A pot.

1401
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,920
A pot belly.

1402
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,040
Pot bellies are sexy.

1403
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,880
Well, you should be happy...

1404
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,360
'cause you have one.

1405
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,680
Shut up, fatso!

1406
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,680
I don't have a pot.

1407
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,400
I have a bit of a tummy...

1408
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,240
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1409
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,760
It's not the same thing.

1410
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,480
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1411
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,400
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1412
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,920
The difference is huge.

1413
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,400
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1414
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,160
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1415
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,880
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1416
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,760
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1417
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,080
The rest of you is normal.

1418
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:08,320
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1419
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,440
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1420
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,840
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1421
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,400
to accentuate it.

1422
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,320
You think men
would find that attractive?

1423
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,200
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1424
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,520
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1425
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,720
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1426
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,360
If you had a pot belly...

1427
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,280
I would punch you in it.

1428
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,720
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1429
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,720
Ah! I'd smother you.

1430
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,040
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1431
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,000
You'd do that?

1432
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,560
Yes. Yes.

1433
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,600
Did you get everything?

1434
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,120
Yes, I did.

1435
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,240
Good job, sugar pop.

1436
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,400
Did everything go as planned?

1437
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,480
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1438
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,040
You didn't listen to the radio?

1439
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,960
I never listen to your fights.

1440
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,280
Were you the winner?

1441
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,600
I won, all right.

1442
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,160
Are you still retiring?

1443
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,480
Sure am.

1444
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,800
So, it all worked out
in the finish?

1445
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,120
We're not at the finish yet,
baby.

1446
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,760
Mmm.

1447
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,640
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1448
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,840
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1449
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,400
But they won't find us,
will they?

1450
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,680
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1451
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,320
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance, it's...

1452
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,520
Say it.

1453
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,520
Fabienne...

1454
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,000
I want you to be with me.

1455
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,280
Forever?

1456
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,880
Forever and ever.

1457
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,600
Do you love me?

1458
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,520
Very, very much.

1459
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,120
Mmm.

1460
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,840
Butch?

1461
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,920
Yes.

1462
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,640
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1463
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,400
Will you kiss it?

1464
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,200
But you first.

1465
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,560
OK.

1466
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,800
Mmm.

1467
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,680
Mmm.

1468
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,800
Butch.

1469
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,680
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1470
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,840
Mmm.

1471
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,560
I think I cracked a rib.

1472
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,880
Giving me oral pleasure?

1473
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,520
No, retard. From the fight.

1474
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,800
Don't call me retard.

1475
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
My name is Fabby.

1476
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,120
My name is Fabienne.

1477
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,400
Stop it. Stop it.

1478
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,720
My name is Fabienne.

1479
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,920
Shut up, fuckhead!

1480
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,800
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1481
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,840
OK, OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1482
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,160
I take it back.

1483
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,080
Would you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1484
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,680
Oh, I like that.

1485
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,720
I like being called a tulip.

1486
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,880
Tulip is much better
than mongoloid.

1487
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,320
I didn't call you a mongoloid.

1488
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,040
I called you a retard,
and I took it back.

1489
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,000
Uhh.

1490
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,280
Butch?

1491
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,040
Yes, lemon pie.

1492
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,320
Where are we going to go?

1493
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,520
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1494
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,680
Wherever you want.

1495
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,600
We're gonna get
a lot of money from this...

1496
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,600
but it ain't gonna be
the kinda money...

1497
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,560
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

1498
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,480
I was thinkin' maybe
we could go down...

1499
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,800
someplace
in the South Pacific.

1500
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,960
The kinda money
we're gonna have...

1501
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
is gonna carry us
a long way down there.

1502
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,560
If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?

1503
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,960
You betcha.

1504
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,200
And if after a while
you didn't dig that...

1505
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,400
go someplace else,
maybe Tahiti. Mexico.

1506
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,320
But I do not speak Spanish.

1507
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,320
Well, you do not speak
Bora Boran, either.

1508
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,280
Besides, Mexican is easy.

1509
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,880
Donde esta el zapateria?

1510
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,160
What does that mean?

1511
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,920
Where is the shoe store?

1512
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,080
Donde esta...

1513
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,320
Spit, please.

1514
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,320
Donde esta el zapateria?

1515
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,440
Excellent pronunciation.

1516
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,840
Mmm.

1517
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,480
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1518
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,920
Que hor a es?

1519
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,120
What time is it?

1520
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,400
Time for bed.

1521
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,520
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1522
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,080
Butch?

1523
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,880
Never mind.

1524
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,480
Ohh!

1525
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,440
Merde.

1526
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,120
You startled me.

1527
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,480
Did you have a bad dream?

1528
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,800
Shit.

1529
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,160
What is this you're watching?

1530
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,880
A motorcycle movie.

1531
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,520
I'm not sure the name.

1532
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,480
Are you watchin' it?

1533
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,960
In a way.

1534
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,600
It's a little early
in the morning...

1535
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,960
for explosions and war.

1536
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,080
What was it about?

1537
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,800
How should I know, Fabienne?

1538
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,920
You were the one
who was watchin' it.

1539
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,000
No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?

1540
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,360
I don't know. I don't remember.

1541
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,960
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1542
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man...

1543
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,680
in the morning.

1544
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,480
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1545
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,880
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast?

1546
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,120
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1547
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,680
Mmm.

1548
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,760
Satisfied?

1549
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,160
Yep.

1550
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,480
Then get up, lazy bones.

1551
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,720
Ohh.

1552
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,760
God. Unh.

1553
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,240
What time is it?

1554
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,360
Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1555
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,400
What time does our train arrive?

1556
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,800
11:00.

1557
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,800
You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?

1558
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,240
What, lemon pie?

1559
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,720
I'm gonna order a big plate...

1560
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,000
of blueberry pancakes
with maple syrup...

1561
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,320
eggs over easy,
and five sausages.

1562
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,760
Anything to drink with that?

1563
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,840
Ah, that looks nice.

1564
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,280
To drink...

1565
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,840
a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1566
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,480
After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.

1567
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,400
Pie for breakfast?

1568
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,120
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1569
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,280
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1570
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,120
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese...

1571
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,280
Where's my watch?

1572
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,520
It's there.

1573
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,560
No, it's not.

1574
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Have you looked?

1575
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,640
Yes, I fucking looked.

1576
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,400
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

1577
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,120
You sure you got it?

1578
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,400
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1579
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,960
On the little kangaroo?

1580
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,480
Yes.
It was on the little kangaroo.

1581
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,600
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1582
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,400
Well, it should be.

1583
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,120
It most definitely should be,
but it's not here now.

1584
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,120
So where the fuck is it?

1585
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,120
Fabienne...

1586
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,040
that was my father's
fucking watch.

1587
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,520
Do you have any idea
what he had to go through...

1588
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,520
to get me that watch?

1589
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,840
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1590
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,360
All this other shit
you could set on fire...

1591
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,080
but I specifically reminded you
not to forget the fucking watch!

1592
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,040
Now think.

1593
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,400
Did you get it?

1594
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,440
I believe so.

1595
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,840
You believe so?
What the fuck does that mean?

1596
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,720
You either did,
or you didn't get it!

1597
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,880
Then I did.

1598
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,080
Are you sure?

1599
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:29,960
No.

1600
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,880
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1601
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,320
Motherfucker!

1602
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,560
- Motherfucker!
- Aah!

1603
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,680
Do you know how
fucking stupid you fucking are?

1604
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,600
No!

1605
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,040
It's not your fault.

1606
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,280
If you left it
at the apartment...

1607
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,680
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1608
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,640
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1609
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,840
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate...

1610
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,280
how personal the watch
was to me.

1611
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,600
If all I gave a fuck about
was the watch...

1612
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:20,720
I should've told you that.

1613
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,680
You're not a mind reader,
are you?
