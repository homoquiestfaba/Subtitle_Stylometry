of the rainbow!

Go on, honey,
tell US what you saw.

336
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:43,009
They're at
the new farmer's place.
He grew a whole field of them.

337
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:47,146
I don't know how he did it,
being that he didn't use
no water.

338
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,982
But they grew
on a regular stalk
just like corn.

339
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,351
Only it wasn't corn.
I'd know corn if I saw corn,

340
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,255

not corn.

that this new farmer,

342

grew a crop...

Yes.

And what exactly
did he grow?

345
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:11,904

Big round ones everywhere.

Yeah. I saw a ton
of rip two-shot red ones.

Why don't you have your friend
bring his magic wand here?

353

I'm sure he'll have no trouble
with our plain ol' corn crop.

- It's no joke, daddy. But you
