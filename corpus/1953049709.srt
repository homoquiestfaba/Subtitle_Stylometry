1
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,986
Now we just have to deal
with the cold and the wind

2
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,422
for the party tonight
at Times Square

3
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,960
High wind warning in
effect till midnight

4
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:50,895
acting with temperatures below zero.

5
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:52,932
Senior Correspondent
Stan Brooks says folks

6
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,490
are already camped
out on in Times Square.

7
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:58,060
It's going to be freezing.
It's going to be jam-packed...

8
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,048
'Out of the Blue' by
Ray Guntrip & Tina May

9
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,973
So I was with her for a long time...
I think she's kissing someone now.

10
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,382
Dude! Shut. Up.

11
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,467
What the...

12
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,708
Yeah?

13
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:59,308
So, you are not a hooker...

14
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,384
You are not a chick I could
pick up at the bar obviously

15
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,355
because you had
eight sets of guys hit on

16
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,483
you all night and you
still just sat there.

17
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,857
You might have been
five drinks but you spoke

18
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,328
in perfectly beautiful sentences.

19
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:14,634
You probably did get bored in
your room and came down for a drink.

20
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,530
What does that tell me?
I don't know. But...

21
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,002
My name is Turiya and
guess what? Happy New...

22
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:25,801
Oh, f*** off.

23
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:28,812
Thanks dudes.

24
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,015
Will you look at this guy?

25
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,348
That is sweet.

26
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:12,857
You know what you
could have just stayed home

27
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,757
if you were going to pass out.
You know what I mean?

28
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,747
Think she's calling now...

29
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,494
Aah, I'm not usually this
creepy but I had a little

30
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,937
bit to drink and then JC introduced
me to the prettiest girl I've seen...

31
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,637
...this year!

32
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:11,315
I'm flattered. Ummm...

33
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:16,021
Which one of the eight
sets of guys are you?

34
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,918
I guess the 1.45 bunch

35
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,829
Oh yeah. The two
guys and the dope-head.

36
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:25,956
Uh... Which one of the two are you?

37
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:29,433
Oh, I'm the cute one. My
friend's always grumpy.

38
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:30,833
Kiss my a**.

39
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,462
See what I mean.

40
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:33,699
Hmmm...

41
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,004
How did you get my number?

42
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:40,906
I'm glad that you called.
Why did you call? I'm glad...

43
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:44,378
Insomnia. Jet lag.
Quarter-life crisis.

44
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:48,046
Ah! So you are in need of my
entertainment services then.

45
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,553
Well, considering you
woke me up in the middle

46
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:53,615
of the night just as I had
fallen asleep, I guess that does

47
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,786
make you responsible
to entertain me...

48
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,921
...Or put me back to sleep.

49
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,693
Oh, you are in luck then
because when I entertain people

50
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,458
they fall right back asleep.

51
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:04,997
Which is good enough.

52
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,801
So what can I do?

53
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,834
I can play some music. Do you
want to listen or something.

54
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,937
You know I have an
IPOD here and a TV set.

55
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,675
What I really want to hear about is
that bit where you said you saw the

56
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,777
prettiest girl that
you ever seen and I am

57
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,617
going to forget you said this year.

58
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,550
Ah yeah. She was gorgeous,

59
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,994
she had the most
beautiful eyes and she was hot.

60
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:31,696
What do you mean hot?

61
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,892
Hot... you know, hot.

62
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,434
No, I don't know.

63
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:39,302
Actually she was just okay...
I mean she was like average...

64
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,605
I am just kidding.

65
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:46,503
She looked really
beautiful and I am sure if she

66
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,479
just took a little better
care of herself it would be

67
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,478
impossible for anybody to
take their eyes off of her.

68
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,882
What do you mean I
don't take care of myself?

69
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,749
No... I mean...

70
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:58,690
It's New Year's Eve and there
you were sitting alone swigging

71
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:00,989
shots of Tequila wearing
an overcoat that screamed

72
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,286
"Leave me alone, I'm boring".

73
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:06,298
It was written all over you that you
did not want to look pretty tonight.

74
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,300
And what would I wear if
I wanted to look pretty?

75
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:11,496
What would you wear if
you wanted to look pretty?

76
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,630
Speaker dude, put it on speaker.

77
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,333
What do you have?

78
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:21,509
Oh! Okay... Let me look.

79
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,741
Ok

80
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:29,415
I have a dull gold mid-length
sequined dress, a Moroccan tunic,

81
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:35,826
beige corset, a couple of tees,
jeans and you know G strings.

82
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,727
I am sorry... What?

83
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:39,993
What?
- What?

84
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,258
Yeah... what is a sequin?

85
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:44,598
Never mind.

86
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,696
You know what, why
don't you wear a corset?

87
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:49,799
I think that is body
hugging top sort of thing.

88
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,434
Really?
- Yeah

89
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,872
How long have you seen me?
All of a minute?

90
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,381
Uh... Yeah but you
had my full attention.

91
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,681
Well, I like that.

92
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:04,252
So how often do you
drunk-dial random strange women?

93
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,519
How often do you call
back random weirdos?

94
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,888
First time.

95
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,762
Ah virgin random weirdo-caller backer.

96
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,728
You haven't answered.

97
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,462
Oh, I am a virgin drunk-dialer.

98
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:22,597
Well, Mr. Virgin drunk-dialer,
where are you?

99
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:26,772
Uh... I'm at the l-can't-wait-to
- break-the-ice-with-you stage.

100
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:27,938
Go on.

101
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,414
So what's your name? You
haven't told me that yet.

102
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,452
Oh, you can call me
anything you like.

103
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,487
I'm yours for the night honey.

104
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,449
In that case, I'm not
telling you my name either.

105
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,319
Turiya. And your
friend's name is HUSSAIN

106
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,488
And the other one said
his name doesn't matter.

107
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,998
That's JC. But wait a second,

108
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,467
I thought you didn't
remember which set of guys we were

109
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:54,872
Okay, so you were the only set
of guys to hit on me tonight.

110
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,943
Oh! Just one of those nights huh?

111
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:01,503
No, I mean seriously what is a girl

112
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,014
like you doing alone
on New Year's Eve?

113
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,716
That's lame...

114
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,817
Or it's OK, I guess.

115
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,581
Travelling.

116
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,317
Who travels on New Year's Eve?

117
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,052
Someone who doesn't like New Year's.

118
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:16,761
Travel to forget about it, huh?

119
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:22,056
Well, I have to get back in
Mumbai by the 2nd and actually

120
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,294
my connecting flight got late so I
have a stop over for eight hours.

121
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:29,705
AH! So this is kind of
like a one-night stand, huh?

122
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,501
I thought guys liked
one-night stands.

123
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,441
Not over the phone.

124
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:41,484
Okay, curious... what would you have
done if I had joined you at the bar?

125
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,782
Spiked your drink.

126
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,915
Just kidding. Just kidding.
Just kidding,

127
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,485
I would have asked you your
name of course. I'm not crazy.

128
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:54,765
Ok. Let's say my name's Nona.

129
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:58,401
Nona... What kind of a name is Nona?

130
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,529
Stripper name

131
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,573
What kind of name is TURIYA?
Is that even real?

132
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,667
Yeah, It's the absolute truth.

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,642
In what language?

134
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,618
I don't know. You have to
ask Mr. Omprakash about that.

135
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:14,442
Think I should sue?
He was the one who...

136
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,488
Omprakash?
- That's my Dad.

137
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:17,648
Daddy
- Daddy

138
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,291
It means the fourth
state of consciousness.

139
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,763
Yeah. The other three are
sitting in the car with me.

140
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,527
Thank God the sober one is driving.

141
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,001
Driving to where?

142
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:33,430
Philly

143
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,564
What's going on there?

144
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,666
My life. I am a male escort.

145
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:41,703
Experienced women dig me.
They get laid. I get paid.

146
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:45,444
And I'm a stripper from
Vegas and a noted porn star.

147
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:49,614
In that case you get my entertainment
services for free from now on.

148
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,418
Tempting but I'll pass.

149
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,925
I'm not really a stripper
incase you didn't get that.

150
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,086
I just landed a corporate job

151
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,557
that is going to pay me
obscene amounts of money.

152
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,826
That's too bad. I was
looking forward to coming to Vegas

153
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,630
and being your pole.

154
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:05,565
Just a pole?

155
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,266
God, I thought you would want
to be more actively involved.

156
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:13,571
Well, why don't you suggest
something else for me to wear?

157
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:15,540
Lingerie... G-string

158
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:20,518
For that, I have to look in
your lingerie compartment...

159
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,014
Hmmm... You wish. Hang on...

160
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,484
Ok

161
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,358
She's naked.

162
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:28,655
What are you doing?

163
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:31,663
Just changing my top. It's too tight.

164
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:33,562
Okay, you shouldn't
have told me that.

165
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,691
Why not?

166
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,598
Because when you tell a guy
that you are changing your

167
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,365
top a guy pictures
you changing your top.

168
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,502
We see everything.

169
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:42,768
So did you like what you saw?

170
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,400
Mmmm... Tasty.

171
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:45,569
Thanks, JC

172
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:46,703
Dude!

173
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,437
So is this a telephonic orgy?

174
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:52,078
Look, I changed it back from...

175
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,909
It's alright. I went
to high school too.

176
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,350
So did you like what you saw?

177
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,654
To tell you the truth,
I didn't see much.

178
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,454
What do you mean you
did not see much?

179
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,659
I had my eyes closed.

180
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:09,667
Isn't that exactly how you
guys picture naked women?

181
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:15,804
Ok... This is the first time I
am doing something like this

182
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,275
Oh you poor boy.

183
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:19,836
That's ok.

184
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,310
I have got enough
experience for the both of us.

185
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,372
Yeah, I don't really
want to have an orgy,

186
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,543
a threesome... I mean phone sex

187
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,382
What? I can't hear you.

188
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,981
You want to have sex with all
three of us now, you sick b******!

189
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,625
Dude, I got a dead body
back here. My hands are full.

190
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:39,688
I wasn't implying phone
sex Mr. Virgin drunk dialer

191
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,494
or is it Mr.
"L-have-never-done-this-before".

192
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,365
Aah yeah, well! Boy!

193
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,495
Looks like it is going to snow.

194
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,408
Oh my God! You are a...

195
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,705
Virgins do exist?

196
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,945
You know if you worked
for my escort company

197
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,844
I would've had your a**
fired a long time ago.

198
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:59,043
I have a bad feeling
about the weather you know...

199
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:02,776
I bet you do virgin boy.
How old are you?

200
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,547
Tell me your name.

201
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,382
Don't change the subject.

202
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:07,824
Ok. I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm gay!

203
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,361
So gay.

204
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,658
Alright. Too much
information for a one-night stand.

205
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,824
You got to pull over. I
got the munchies real bad.

206
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,336
I could eat a horse. An ostrich.
A piece of A**.

207
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:20,304
We're hungry. We
should've eaten at the bar.

208
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:24,674
All of us. Are you hungry too?

209
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:26,843
Yeah. Me too.

210
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,380
Let me see what's in the fridge.

211
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:31,440
Get something for me too please.

212
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:34,849
Slim pickings.

213
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,355
Oh, there is a long banana here.
I bet you would like that!

214
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,755
No, I am more of a
melons guy. I like melons.

215
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,656
Ouch!! That's below the belt.

216
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:44,318
What are you talking about?
Wait a second.

217
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,728
No, I wasn't trying to say...

218
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,763
We know what you really meant!

219
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,027
It's ok. I don't have melons.

220
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:52,032
No, I wouldn't know anything that.

221
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,432
About what?
- About you know...

222
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,436
you know...
- Boobs?

223
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:02,311
Well... I wouldn't know... No.
I don't know they...

224
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:04,406
Oh you poor boy.
Would you like a preview?

225
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:09,380
Look, that's not what I meant.
I wasn't talking about...

226
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,447
Right! You said I was hot.

227
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,425
You said I should wear a corset.
What does that mean?

228
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,484
That means you checked me out.

229
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:20,555
No, no... I was just saying it
just like that. You know, just words.

230
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,967
So, then I am not hot?

231
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,936
No...

232
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,037
So then, tell me.

233
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:29,905
Tell you what?

234
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,876
Do you think I am hot?

235
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,573
Yeah.

236
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,045
So, what did you
mean you prefer Melons?

237
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,510
I just was saying it
because I liked...

238
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,850
You could've said
mangoes or apples or oranges

239
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,480
I mean why did you say Melons.

240
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:45,615
Who thinks of Melons?

241
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:46,919
I do. I like Melons.

242
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,052
I have always liked Melons
since the time I was a kid.

243
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:50,989
I liked watermelon,
winter melon, muskmelon.

244
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,298
I like jackfruit. I like honeydew,
cantaloupe. I like them all.

245
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,859
I mean... It was nothing to do
with you or your physicality.

246
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:59,461
I wasn't even talking
about your physicality.

247
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,403
So my physicality has
nothing to do with Melons?

248
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:04,932
What is the right answer
to this? I don't even know.

249
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,569
How do I answer this?

250
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:07,874
The truth. The absolute truth.

251
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,781
I like Melons and I
think I need another look.

252
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,942
So you admit there was a first look?

253
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,509
Oh boy you should have been a lawyer.

254
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:15,645
You would have been a great lawyer.

255
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,656
Thank you. But answer me.
You admit you looked.

256
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,515
Yeah, I looked.

257
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,651
And...

258
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,922
And they are nice.

259
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,429
They are perfect.

260
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:28,934
They are beautifully
round and gorgeous globes.

261
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,332
On a scale of 1 to 10?

262
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:31,495
Eight.

263
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,769
Eight. Why eight?

264
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,363
Well because I like the number eight.

265
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,806
There is two round
things that is together...

266
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,468
I like that.

267
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,709
Ok rapid-fire question time.
What's on your mind?

268
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,716
Actually you first.
What is on your mind?

269
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:50,548
I'm thinking they are fine too.
And I'm thinking I would love

270
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,456
to have some Waffles
with White chocolate and

271
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,620
maple syrup fresh from the oven.

272
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:01,861
Or mint and chocolate huh?
I love that. Do you?

273
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,868
Mint and Chocolate. I
love that. After eight.

274
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,801
No anytime of the day.

275
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:09,363
My friends got me for my birthday.
Bailey's Mint & Chocolate.

276
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,535
Sex in a glass.

277
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,668
Sex in a glass.

278
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,973
And how would you know?

279
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,908
Oh! Who is hitting
below the belt now?

280
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:21,341
No but seriously, I love liqueur.

281
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,718
I'm not saying that just in a
please be my friend kind of way.

282
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:30,422
But I can just picture myself sinking
into a tub full of Creme De Menth.

283
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:34,533
Now I can picture you
doing that too. Remember?

284
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:38,564
So how old are you?
You didn't tell me.

285
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,798
You didn't tell me your name.

286
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,040
Do you remember that
movie where two strangers

287
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:50,805
spend the entire night in the
streets of Vienna and just talk?

288
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,712
Before Sunrise! It's my
favourite movie. I love that movie.

289
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,755
Hey maybe we're doing this
coz we saw them do that right?

290
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:57,914
Okay, that's lame.

291
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,687
No wait. Just hear me out.
Everything we see in the movies,

292
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:06,425
read in books, things established
as facts by society and the news,

293
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,933
all become a part of our existence
so that somewhere down the line

294
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,265
we forget where we
even heard it or saw it.

295
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,765
So the entire length of
the movie Before Sunrise,

296
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,306
I have been in Ethan Hawke's shoes.

297
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:18,707
I have lived his life.
I have become that.

298
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,640
Oh God! Somebody
thinks he's Ethan Hawke.

299
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,649
No, no. Wait, wait... You
have seen When Harry Met Sally.

300
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,310
You must have
thought you were Meg Ryan

301
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,579
when you watched the movie.

302
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,252
I got it the first time.

303
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,925
You are not Billy
Crystal short either are you?

304
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,522
Elizabethtown - Cameron Crowe.
It's like he knows me.

305
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:45,802
Oh is he on the other line?
Is that him on call waiting?

306
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,302
No Cameron Crowe is
the director who made...

307
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,842
Yeah, I know I know. Jerry Maguire.
It's a cute rom com (romantic comedy).

308
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:55,377
Aargh! Jerry MaF***ing
Guire is not a rom com.

309
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:58,576
It is the celebration of
being the man who you want to be.

310
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:01,719
Which happens to be being
the man we want him to be.

311
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,254
Hence, it's a rom com.

312
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:04,846
Oh God! So wait,

313
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,450
according to you, The
Godfather is some family

314
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:11,223
soap drama and the
Matrix is what some fashion

315
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,525
show of black trench coat with

316
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,657
technology thrown in
or something like that.

317
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:19,334
Just when I thought we were
starting to have something in common.

318
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:22,732
Anyone who likes the
Matrix is suffering from

319
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,673
a serious case of the
Emperor's New Clothes.

320
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:27,871
Oh, Anyone who doesn't like
the Matrix is suffering from Oh,

321
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:30,643
Poor Me, I got left out of the cult,
so let me bitch about it.

322
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:39,288
I dare you. Explain The Matrix to
me in four lines. No more. No less.

323
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,788
Explain the Matrix in four lines.
It's not that simple.

324
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,421
Trinity, we need to find a hard line.

325
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:47,364
Look in your pants Mr. Anderson

326
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,664
Thanks Morpheus and Agent
Smith or JC and Hussain.

327
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,534
See Matrix has that
effect on us. Think about it,

328
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:57,042
we grew up in the nineties name a film
that went to be the Star Wars or The

329
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,573
Godfather of the nineties.
You can't name one.

330
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:03,411
The Matrix is the single most
definitive film of our time.

331
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:08,283
Amore. I think Friends is the most

332
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,810
single most
definitive show of our times.

333
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:14,726
Well Friends... That
whole sitcom, it was on TV.

334
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:15,919
I am talking about film.

335
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:19,590
The Matrix is deep and
loaded like Star Wars.

336
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:20,893
Stories are meant to be simple.

337
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,059
No matter what kind of bells
and whistles they come with.

338
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,031
Harry and Sally. They meet.
They become friends.

339
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:28,830
Over time, they fall in love.
Now explain The Matrix to me.

340
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:32,435
The Matrix is not just
a sci-fi action film.

341
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:36,413
It's about how everyone has a
chance to search and find the truth

342
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:40,082
and that's what Neo does. He
has a chance to find the truth,

343
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,912
he takes the pill and
finds out that's the truth

344
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:48,858
is a dream fabricated by
someone else... Hello...

345
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:56,365
Blah Blah Blah... I
said simplify in English.

346
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,069
Oracle. Clones. Conflict. Bullshit.

347
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,966
Lets just agree to disagree.

348
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,368
You know even love
stories are about conflict.

349
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,514
The conflict being?

350
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:14,281
Well some loves flourish because
of the conflict not in spite of it.

351
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,986
Through all the disagreement and
going through all the hardships

352
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:21,049
together some loves
become great love stories.

353
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:25,591
Love stories also end
because of conflict.

354
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:31,296
Hmm... That's true but it might not
have happened if not for the conflict.

355
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:33,527
Are you in the mood for a story?

356
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:42,040
Considering I am talking to a stranger
about absolutely nothing sure,

357
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:44,407
why not? Just throw in
some sex and I'm good.

358
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:50,846
Ok, here we go... There was a boy...

359
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,935
Why is the geek always a guy?

360
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,336
Ok. You're interrupting.

361
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,307
Come on, that's a silly stereotype

362
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,403
Ok, fine...

363
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,617
See, it's not working.

364
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:29,854
Yeah, ok

365
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:34,561
So what kind of music do you like?

366
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,625
Techno
- That is so nineties

367
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,836
I used to like techno but
now I like the other stuff.

368
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,843
Like pop?

369
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,410
Yeah, yeah like pop

370
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,074
That is so gay.

371
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,375
I know.

372
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:58,083
I'm sorry but what
kind of music do you like?

373
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,657
Rock... the new rock.

374
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:02,421
Like Coldplay?

375
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:08,799
Yeah, like that.

376
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:13,827
I love them. Hey do
you listen to Floyd?

377
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:18,268
You know I was going to
ask you the same question.

378
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,538
I do actually.

379
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:27,442
Ah, so you are into
boy bands too then.

380
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,751
Pink Floyd is not a boy band.

381
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:32,848
But it is "PINK" isn't it...

382
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,856
Not funny. So what's
your favourite number?

383
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:53,702
It's like you know
me so well. Really.

384
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,448
Yeah well I know. So when do
we take it to the next level?

385
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,943
You can come over tomorrow if you
want, Mom's not going to be home.

386
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,452
Yeah, I would love to come home
tomorrow. That would be great.

387
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:08,722
But what time
because I am free all day.

388
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:12,321
It's not like I don't have
a job or anything coz I do.

389
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:17,427
I am very employable but I
am free tomorrow all day.

390
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,396
Ok

391
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,763
For now.

392
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:32,808
Guys often pretend to be who they
are not and girls always want to

393
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:37,049
be wicked and crazy because
that's their idea of romance.

394
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,988
We just like to challenge
the natural order of things.

395
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,323
You know gives us a
sense of accomplishment.

396
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,660
Plus everybody wants a
taste of the forbidden fruit.

397
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,331
Apples.

398
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:50,561
Or in your case Melons.

399
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:57,033
Hey, do you believe in God,
faith, destiny.

400
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,438
Do you think God
knows why things happen.

401
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:04,713
I don't think God knows.

402
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,879
I mean what if God is
reinventing as he goes on?

403
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,652
I think God has a plan for us.

404
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,385
He probably doesn't want us to know

405
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,824
but he wants to roll it
out to us in good time.

406
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,555
I roll it out in good time.

407
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,655
I mean think about it religion
was invented what about 2000

408
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:23,725
years ago but the full
truth is about 13.7 billion...

409
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:24,996
There is no full truth.

410
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,534
Everything would disappear if
an asteroid hit us tomorrow.

411
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:31,934
Exactly, Dinosaurs... Gone.

412
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:38,349
You know when I was a little
girl I thought asteroid was a gland.

413
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,416
Because it rhymes with Thyroid?

414
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,385
I was so confused

415
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:50,492
Back to religion. Actually
have you studied accounting?

416
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:52,488
No.

417
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:57,001
Okay, in accounting, there's
something known as Suspense Account.

418
00:25:57,402 --> 00:25:59,632
When you can't
explain where the money's

419
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:01,935
gone and you are
unable to balance the sheet,

420
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,874
you create a suspense account
temporarily and put all your money

421
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:07,468
into that... so that once you
investigate and find where the money

422
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,606
is gone you can transfer the money
from the suspense account to the

423
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:11,808
actual account.

424
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:16,252
Now as science starts
explaining various phenomenon

425
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,891
you immediatelytransfer credit from
the God account to the Science account.

426
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,257
So Let there be light
becomes the Big Bang Theory...

427
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:26,989
I love that TV show. Oh my
god it's about these geeks

428
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,257
who live next door to
a blonde waitress

429
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,767
who works in a cheesecake factory.

430
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:33,566
Yeah. You know men are
the smart ones.

431
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,569
Well yes, of course. You know we women
we prefer to stay home and watch

432
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:42,042
life happen in a little pictures
while you big boys you are

433
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,373
concerned about the
big picture out there.

434
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,349
Exactly. Us big boys.

435
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,482
Kidding, you jerk.
Ever heard of radium?

436
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,955
Madame Curie. Helen Keller.
Mother Teresa.

437
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,893
Ever heard of Britney Spears.
Paris Hilton. Sex tapes

438
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,931
Justin Timberlake.
George Bush. Bill Clinton.

439
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,257
No why are you talking
about our differences.

440
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,428
We are all the same race.

441
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:07,464
We are all born with
the same raw materials...

442
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,498
a little sperm, eggs a
little sex and weeks later,

443
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:14,568
there's this seven pound form of
life that is ejected from a vagina.

444
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:15,908
Vagina

445
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,539
How different are we really?

446
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,579
I object. We could
want different things.

447
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,247
We could want different
things from the same relationship

448
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:28,282
Like for example what if
your geek boy wasn't geeky and

449
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,729
what if the girl really liked him
and what if they had a great honeymoon

450
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:39,601
period getting to know each other
but then things don't turn out so rosy

451
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:43,937
Do you want to hear a story?
Straight from Bollywood.

452
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,803
Bollywood!

453
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:50,040
I love you.

454
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,549
I love you.

455
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:03,287
Shit. I never thought I
would say this to someone.

456
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:06,395
But I... I really love you.

457
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:14,906
Shit... I hope I get
myself to say this to her.

458
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:19,808
I wanted to say this to her
so often but couldn't get the

459
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:26,317
courage and whenever I meet her
I decide to, but... somehow...

460
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,579
Tell who?

461
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,289
Tina... who else? Let's do this again,

462
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:38,023
I will be Rahul, you be Tina.
Look up.

463
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,397
I love you

464
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:57,481
I love you too.

465
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,752
She will say the same
thing won't she?

466
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,858
Yes

467
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,256
Come here.

468
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:14,992
Shall I tell her?

469
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,601
Shall I go right now?

470
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,301
Do you really believe this
shit you are selling me?

471
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:52,899
I mean what did you think?

472
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:56,273
You had no idea that I
liked you all this time

473
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,741
and you are just
leading me on for this?

474
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:00,410
I mean who do you think I am?

475
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,777
Some kind of doormat that
you can just wipe your feet

476
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:04,816
over every time you come and go.

477
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,884
Some sorry story who is
going wait around for you

478
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:11,752
and cry and come to your
wedding and wish you all the best.

479
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,584
Well you know what, FFFUUC *BEEP*

480
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,064
People are different. Some times,
they just want different things.

481
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:22,796
No I'm talking about
the bigger picture.

482
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:26,701
You know life is much more than
one or two failed relationships.

483
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,806
We all want the same things...
We all want

484
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:33,740
happiness, love, family,
friends... I'm sure you want love.

485
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,608
I'm sure you just want to
get into her pants dude.

486
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,342
I heard that! No thank you.

487
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:39,775
I'm done with romance.

488
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:42,318
Besides I don't think we have
to take love out of one person

489
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,786
to give it to another.

490
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,790
Love is a bottomless glass.

491
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:51,059
Oooh, so you are a sensualist.
You like believe in free sex.

492
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:52,956
That's why you
didn't want to pay for it.

493
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,362
I wasn't talking about sex.

494
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,434
All I am saying is
that we need people.

495
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,634
So why not just make great
friends all over the world?

496
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,866
Why do you need romance?

497
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:06,005
Well I don't know. Life is short.

498
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:10,341
We are all insecure. Love
makes us feel secure, committed.

499
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,511
I used to be you.

500
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:16,546
You know when you call in a
friend they are always there.

501
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,282
It doesn't matter if
it has been eight years,

502
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:19,823
it doesn't matter
if it has been 20 years.

503
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:22,052
They welcome you with open arms.

504
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:25,425
Yeah, they may welcome you they
may want to have coffee with you,

505
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,294
they may invite you in
for dinner they may

506
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,833
even have you in for 2 weeks...

507
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,299
...in their house but at
the end of the day

508
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,031
everyone goes their
separate ways.

509
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,998
But seriously, you don't believe
that there's a love of your life?

510
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,314
No. I mean I used to.

511
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:46,312
I used to think that
the love of my life is

512
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,409
a guy who made me nervous.

513
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,317
Then I found out that
Prince Charming

514
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:52,583
only belongs in fairy tales.

515
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:56,323
Some time after that I thought
the love of my life was

516
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:58,522
a guy who made me happy.

517
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,997
Tall, Dark, Handsome,
great sense of humour.

518
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,298
Then I found out he belongs in
Mills and Boons and your rom coms.

519
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,268
Some years after that I
thought it was just

520
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:10,899
about finding Mr. Compatible...

521
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,466
Mr. Right for me.

522
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:15,845
Then I found out people change...

523
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:19,283
and sometimes in a drastically
pull the rug right out

524
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,911
from under you kind of way.

525
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,746
So change being the
only constant I know...

526
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,814
...now there is no such
thing as a perfect match.

527
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,427
The only person who is
the love of my life is Me!

528
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:34,828
Wow! I think I'm more of a giver.

529
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,890
I want to give everything
to the love of my life.

530
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,299
I want to give unconditionally.

531
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,700
You are like a doormat, right?

532
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,908
The shoulder to cry on...
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,740
I have no right judging you.

534
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,478
It's okay. I mean guess I
have thought about that too.

535
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:58,819
Is giving all yourself to
someone being a doormat?

536
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:05,957
Love is a form of faith,
it's like a religion.

537
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,766
You give unconditionally
to someone.

538
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:14,737
You make a commitment and then
you hope that it pays dividends.

539
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,305
What did that work for you?

540
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,277
Yes. It took it eight years
but she finally said Yes...

541
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,973
It lasted one year.

542
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:24,709
It was best thing to
happen to me ever.

543
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:25,941
And then?

544
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,948
And then she came up
to me and she is like

545
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:34,321
You obviously love me more
than I love you... Long story,

546
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,450
we will talk about it later.

547
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,552
But anyway I mean seriously I
had enough love for both of us...

548
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,326
No... That doesn't work
like that. It has to be equal.

549
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,697
How would you like it if
she did that to you...

550
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:45,598
I would've loved it. It
would have been perfect.

551
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,996
No, no, no... You have to
actually image switching places.

552
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,674
If you were her and she was
would that would that feel right.

553
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:53,802
I don't think so.

554
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:57,439
I mean in any relationship
even a beautiful friendship...

555
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,644
...people have to have to
you know give equal effort.

556
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:06,723
Effort! Love should be easy. It's
not about effort. Work is effort.

557
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:10,352
Maybe it started
becoming work for her.

558
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:13,725
I don't know I just think
if things have to work out...

559
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:17,564
both people have to have
equal intentions for each other.

560
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,296
They have to meet halfway.

561
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:26,966
Halfway. Actually I think we are
halfway from you. 50 miles right.

562
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,437
50 miles.

563
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:34,451
So in that case if you and I
had a long distance thing...

564
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:38,349
you would be the kind of guy
who would travel 50 miles...

565
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:42,059
to see me and if I were the love
of your life I would be like

566
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:43,794
Oh My God, why is he doing that.

567
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:47,558
Please don't do that. I can't
get myself to do that. Right?

568
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,294
Are you talking about
yourself or are you putting

569
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,766
yourself in her shoes?

570
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:52,969
Well, I'm speaking
for her obviously.

571
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:54,935
Well, What about you?

572
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:58,073
If we lived 100 miles
away from each other,

573
00:34:58,343 --> 00:34:59,435
would you meet me halfway?

574
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,741
I would come 50 miles but
you know that's just me.

575
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:04,515
Or we could meet each other
100 miles every other week.

576
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:07,482
Long distance success stories
are a work of fiction my boy.

577
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,417
Oh! Pessimist.

578
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:13,286
Pessimist! You are the pessimist,
I'm the optimist.

579
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,584
I mean there's so much love in the
world why would you hold back...

580
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
for somebody who is away.

581
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:20,657
No, no people come and go
and you know we are all meant...

582
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,962
...to be companions for a
little while or a longer while.

583
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:26,668
It could work if you
wanted it to.

584
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:31,368
I am sorry my boy but long
distance relationships don't work.

585
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,270
I don't know what you're thinking,

586
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:39,043
I dont know if you think
I'm serious coz I am not.

587
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,751
I mean its not like I am trying
to pick you up or something?

588
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:44,687
Not trying to make you fall in
love with me over the phone...

589
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:45,882
Long distance success...
- You are not?

590
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,753
No no... I don't
even know your name.

591
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:49,724
Does it look like I want to?

592
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:52,485
Does it look like
I am interested?

593
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:55,624
You are not?

594
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,833
No. I mean you brought
up this whole hypothetical

595
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:00,799
long distance
relationship sort of thing...

596
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,931
Yes, yes... I mean it was.

597
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,338
It was completely hypothetical.

598
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,400
I was just trying to explain...

599
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:10,876
how long distance relationships
require equal effort...

600
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,542
to sustain a healthy
relationship.

601
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:13,743
I mean I don't even believe
in relationships

602
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:15,012
forget long distance.

603
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,978
That was really what
I was trying to say

604
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,389
which has nothing to do with you.

605
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,692
Yeah. It's no wonder that
you wouldn't meet me halfway,

606
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,733
where I am is like middle
of nowhere Timbaktuland.

607
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:34,937
We are at a lookout point
in a town called New Hope.

608
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,499
I guess George Lucas
must be the Mayor.

609
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:42,345
Because Star Wars.
Episode 4. A New Hope.

610
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,472
Stop.

611
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,284
Okay, what you just
basically said was that

612
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:48,808
I'm not interesting enough...

613
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,354
...for you to want to
know my real name. Right?

614
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:54,283
No, that's not what I said,

615
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,351
I mean obviously I have
a lot of baggage...

616
00:36:57,562 --> 00:36:59,928
...that I cant put down
and you are probably

617
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:01,522
just thinking about getting...

618
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:04,397
...a good night sleep and make that
flight in the morning. Right?

619
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,937
Hang on would you.
I mean I didn't even say...

620
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,263
I was interested and you are
like rejecting already me.

621
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,566
What are you talking about?!

622
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:14,635
I am not rejecting you. Who
would reject somebody as hot...

623
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,608
...and as intelligent as you are?

624
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,506
Seriously.

625
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:26,350
You know what I need to go to bed.

626
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:28,654
Oh, is it something I said?

627
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:32,262
No! I don't even know
you enough to take offense

628
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,991
to anything you say.

629
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,264
I'd really don't care.

630
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:40,304
Wait! Hold on a second...

631
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,831
What's the point?
Give me one good reason

632
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:45,771
...and make it quick, I
need to catch some sleep.

633
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:50,845
No, I just think it is
rather awkward for us to after...

634
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,281
...this to long conversation
to hang up so abruptly...

635
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,581
I want to get to know you.

636
00:37:55,653 --> 00:38:01,421
I'm boring and I am tired
and I have a lot of luggage.

637
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,653
So I need to get to
the airport early.

638
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:06,728
Okay, what about Facebook?

639
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:10,991
No but I don't know your name
and I don't know your email.

640
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:12,702
How am I going to find you?

641
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:18,335
Good question. I guess you have a
lifetime ahead of you to find out.

642
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,405
True happiness lies in
pursuit of truth anyways right?

643
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:24,811
Must be something I said.

644
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:30,615
Keep guessing. Good bye.

645
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:33,680
No don't say Good bye. Hello...

646
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:36,384
Good bye.

647
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:40,387
Hello... Bad connection.

648
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,528
Leak-time.

649
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,428
Me too. Let's go feed those fish.

650
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:37,874
Yes, I finally have signal.

651
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,481
Yo T, take a time out man.

652
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:43,553
I got to listen to some music.
Rest your battery, yes?

653
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,323
Yeah, I probably should
save my battery,

654
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,858
but maybe I can borrow
JC's phone.

655
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:51,018
You can borrow my underwear, man.

656
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,339
Guess what?

657
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:12,507
What Nona...

658
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:17,046
Okay, first of all,
my name isn't Nona.

659
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,355
Well, you are Nona to me.

660
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,887
Well, that wasn't
the real me. I'm MOIRA.

661
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:26,893
So how's MOIRA any
different than Nona?

662
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,926
Well, for one thing she's
not wearing any clothes.

663
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:34,563
So how do I get to
know this MOIRA?

664
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,438
You wouldn't like to know MOIRA.

665
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:40,977
She would've never have done
anything as crazy as this.

666
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:42,774
She's a cynical bitch.

667
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,981
Oh come on, she
sounds interesting.

668
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:46,676
I mean no clothes and all.

669
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:50,517
Why don't you
introduce me to her? Please.

670
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:52,021
And what would the intro be?

671
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:55,752
Meet TURIYA, virgin escort?

672
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:59,893
Actually, I am an insurance agent,
but don't tell other girls that.

673
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:03,525
Every time I tell that to
somebody, it's over. Game over.

674
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:05,296
They would walk away.
- You're kidding?

675
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,861
No, I am serious.
I am an insurance agent.

676
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,340
I make a living telling people

677
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,036
What would happen to
them if they died tonight?

678
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:17,837
So when you saw me at the bar,

679
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:19,746
you weren't thinking hot chick,
you were thinking

680
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,284
Ah, potential client.

681
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:22,512
She looks like the kind of
girl that would go into the

682
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:24,054
next room and slit her wrists.

683
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:25,955
No, I wasn't thinking that.

684
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:30,460
But maybe I saved your life.
You owe me one.

685
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,853
I wasn't going to kill myself.
Are you crazy?

686
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:34,489
I love myself too much.

687
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,299
So are you really going
to India or was

688
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,667
that something you just said?

689
00:42:40,738 --> 00:42:43,536
Well, I don't really
know anybody in this town

690
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:49,707
and you when you called
honestly I was so bored and

691
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:54,514
I just thought nobody
knows me here

692
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:57,748
so I could be
anybody and I became Nona.

693
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,316
Did you like being NONA?

694
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:06,623
Yeah, you know because Nona has
no past and she has no future.

695
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,261
Her validity expires at 8.30 in

696
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:11,301
the morning when
she boards the flight.

697
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:12,996
She travels light.

698
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:15,469
You could be Nona every
single day of your life.

699
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,972
It's not that simple.

700
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,406
We have our responsibilities,

701
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,842
you know you see
insurance all day

702
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:25,645
but tonight you are the
world's only virgin escort

703
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,880
who specializes in entertainment
services over the phone.

704
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,484
Okay, lets play a game.
Twenty questions.

705
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,292
Okay. But wait, what is this for?

706
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,062
You are still not
over your ex right?

707
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:45,359
Just say Yes, No, Maybe,
I don't Know.

708
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:46,967
Yes, No. Maybe. I don't know.

709
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:48,630
Just answer one.

710
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:52,974
Ok. But let's make
this more interesting.

711
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,774
Whatever you ask me you
have to answer first yourself.

712
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,814
Fair enough. I am
not over my past. You?

713
00:43:57,882 --> 00:43:59,076
Completely over it.

714
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,374
Really?

715
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:01,679
Hmm.

716
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,846
How can you be sure, so sure
that you are over something?

717
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:10,524
Okay. Let me tell you a story.
Fictitious, of course.

718
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:12,290
Hope it has lots of sex

719
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:16,761
All right, I am not
going to tell you the story

720
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:20,361
Why? Is it something bad or dark?

721
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,963
Yeah... too dark.

722
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:25,742
Well... dark sex. I like that.

723
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,574
Okay, I'm definitely never
going to telling you the story.

724
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,046
Come on, please tell me.
You can't stop now.

725
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,946
Okay, boy meets girl.

726
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:37,420
Boy is a rich and
pin-up politician.

727
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,922
- Oooh! Pin-up! -
Boy and girl have sex.

728
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:41,822
Lots of sex.
- Ah aah. Good good.

729
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:43,019
More sex than you can handle.

730
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:45,660
I don't think so but...

731
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,664
Listen! Would you?
- Ok.

732
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:13,593
She survived to live
another life.

733
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:18,998
The girl I was talking
about was the love of my life.

734
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:22,538
He wasn't.

735
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,611
I thought he was but
I know he wasn't.

736
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,308
I mean how do you know?
How can you know?

737
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:34,584
It's funny you know. We
live like 70 or 80 years and

738
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:39,356
we meet somebody in our
twenties and we decide that

739
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,830
they are the love of our lives.

740
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:45,902
And that we would
never love like that again.

741
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:49,838
At least not with that much
passion, not that much depth.

742
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:53,941
That's true though isn't it?

743
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:55,673
I guess,

744
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,277
...in the sense that you
don't love your Mom

745
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,714
the way you love your Dad...

746
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,310
or you don't love your flings
the way you love your soul-mates.

747
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:04,547
Each is different.

748
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:06,856
But I don't think you
can attribute the accolade

749
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:08,255
the "love of my life"

750
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:12,284
so quickly not when you have life
2/3rds of your life left to live.

751
00:49:13,297 --> 00:49:14,559
I think the love of your life...

752
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:16,793
. is going to be the
woman you are sitting with...

753
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:19,233
...on your veranda with
a cup of coffee in

754
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:21,794
the sunset of your life...

755
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,236
and you tell her how you
almost mistook someone else

756
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:26,868
to be who she is

757
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:29,374
The love of your life.

758
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,884
I invested eight years of my
life in that relationship.

759
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:37,580
Are you telling me my
faith in love was misplaced?

760
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:43,249
This isn't one your
insurance policies that...

761
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,727
...matures after a few years
and pays you your dividends.

762
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:48,959
Cheap shot. You still
haven't told me what you do.

763
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:54,026
Legal consultant.
- Aah! I knew it.

764
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:55,902
I was just kidding.

765
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:59,768
I just completed my
thesis in Chicago...

766
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:01,970
...waiting to get my
Ph. D (doctorate)...

767
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:03,843
...and I am headed to
Mumbai for a new project.

768
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:07,281
Wow! Dr. Moira!
- No, not yet.

769
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:09,342
Not at least until
the panel makes sense...

770
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,717
...of my dissertation
on New Media

771
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:12,779
...and it's impact in
shaping personalities...

772
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,653
...and influencing
human relationships.

773
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,290
Okay that went over
my head obviously

774
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,021
I am not a Ph. D (doctorate).

775
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,656
Well it's just about how
New Media Technology...

776
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,825
...basically has made our
lives about instant fixes.

777
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,927
Control C, Control V,
Control x, Control Alt Delete.

778
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:29,529
We pretty much live our
lives on those principles.

779
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,336
System failure? Reboot.

780
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,808
And also New media technologies
has made it possible for us...

781
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:36,778
...to transcend beyond geographical
and physical boundaries,

782
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:39,941
...beyond zeroes and ones
and make personal connects...

783
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:42,383
...across nations,
across cultures,

784
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:45,388
...across even religions
and cultures.

785
00:50:45,456 --> 00:50:47,515
Yes, sort of like
this phone call...

786
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:50,082
...we are talking across so
many miles of open space.

787
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:51,828
Yes. Sort of...

788
00:50:51,895 --> 00:50:54,921
Now just imagine if I
was a robot designed...

789
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:59,628
...to respond to your
most deepest interests...

790
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,737
based completely on a
comprehensive behavioral study

791
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,671
of your personal
preferences and choices...

792
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:08,004
I would ask you first
what did I do wrong?

793
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,911
What's wrong?

794
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,517
Well. You didn't.

795
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,588
You just haven't found
the love of your life.

796
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:23,492
Relationships take
time to be defined.

797
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,425
Sometimes, even a
lifetime isn't enough...

798
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,363
Enough about me.

799
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:30,894
You still haven't told me
since you love yourself so much...

800
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:33,368
...what were you doing
alone on New Year's Eve?

801
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:35,837
Being with myself.

802
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:37,933
I mean its not liking I
am living in the past.

803
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:40,943
I am only remembering
only the good stuff.

804
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:44,904
I mean the bad stuff is
done with. It's buried.

805
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,741
Think of it this way. If you
really did everything you could...

806
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,581
...then you know absolutely
that it's not your fault.

807
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:57,590
It's not that easy. I
haven't been able to delete...

808
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:59,526
...her messages from my inbox.

809
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:03,664
How long has it been?

810
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:04,792
Since what?

811
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:07,836
Since you guys broke up.

812
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,271
Three years.

813
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:13,909
Hang on. Are you serious?

814
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:15,902
Dude, she could have
had a baby by now!

815
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,571
Don't say that.

816
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:20,009
God! Look at me I have so
much baggage. I have baggage.

817
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:21,649
You have to let it go.

818
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:23,582
I don't want to.

819
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:28,582
Okay, here's something
from my thesis.

820
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:31,326
The SMS inbox
reflects your mind-space...

821
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:33,795
It has every bit of
memory you want to hold on to.

822
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:35,627
The reason you have not
able to start afresh is

823
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:37,326
because you haven't
deleted messages...

824
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:38,993
You have to empty your inbox...

825
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:41,299
...in order to make
space for new memories

826
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:43,564
No. It's a part of me.
I need to keep it.

827
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,307
I can't just let it go.

828
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,800
Well, keep the good stuff.

829
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:51,711
All I am saying is let it rest.
Give it its funeral.

830
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,409
Forgive unconditionally.

831
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:57,818
Get over the mourning period and
just come alive and stay alive...

832
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:01,756
...instead of digging up decomposed
remains that haunt your life.

833
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:05,353
I don't want to run away.
I can't escape reality.

834
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,260
And the reality is
I still love her.

835
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:08,628
She was the love of my life.

836
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,268
Do you realize you
always keep saying

837
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,531
she "Was" the love of your life.

838
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,700
That's the point now isn't it?

839
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,471
The scars would remain but you
need to learn to live with them.

840
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:23,308
They are like the
sign of a warrior.

841
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,879
They heal over time but they
become a part of you and one day...

842
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,981
...someone notices and asks you
and it all comes back to you...

843
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:34,387
...the motion picture of
your life in surround sound...

844
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,653
The love story you
were once a part of...

845
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:41,460
...you smile because you
remember the good times...

846
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,929
...and you feel a little
bad that it had to end...

847
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,697
...and then you put the
DVD back on the shelf.

848
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,534
You put it back on the
shelf and you let it go.

849
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:52,308
You're crazy.

850
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:55,004
Si Amigo

851
00:53:57,347 --> 00:54:00,714
So New Year's Eve is
one of your scars huh?

852
00:54:02,486 --> 00:54:05,319
Well, it was until now.

853
00:54:06,557 --> 00:54:09,424
From hereon, I am going to
remember New Years Eve as this...

854
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,285
...night that I had
this wild conversation...

855
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:13,920
...with a random strange boy.

856
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:16,898
Seriously, aren't you
going to remember tonight

857
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:19,435
as this night when
you got a little high

858
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:21,767
and called a girl in
the middle of it

859
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:24,769
to talk about boobs and
existence in one breath.

860
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:27,709
I mean what would
existence do without boobs?

861
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,644
There we go again...

862
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:33,747
so then, how come
you didn't get any?

863
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:41,550
Love me.

864
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,051
I do.

865
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:44,891
Show me.

866
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:47,996
Okay. Not like this.

867
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,290
You're drunk.

868
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:06,706
God! What's wrong with this boy?

869
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:13,019
Do you think you
will ever love me?

870
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:15,683
I do.

871
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:30,467
No. That's not going to work.

872
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:34,276
How am I supposed to
love you if you don't do me?

873
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:36,711
Did she really say do me?

874
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,975
Let me rephrase that.

875
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:40,608
How am I supposed to
know where we are going...

876
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:41,810
...if you don't make love to me?

877
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:45,048
How am I supposed to make love
to you if you don't love me?

878
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,659
Ok. I'm convinced you are gay.

879
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,301
Oh Absolutely,

880
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,964
I'm with three guys on New
Year's Eve and I am feeling happy

881
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,835
and by the way that story
was completely fictitious.

882
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:10,870
Sex complicates relationships.

883
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:14,443
Well, after everything
you turned out okay.

884
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:18,386
Well, he wasn't the first guy
I slept with. That's different.

885
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:21,724
The first guy I slept with was
when I was nineteen years old...

886
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:23,688
...and that was a horrible breakup.

887
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,284
We were together for 5 years...

888
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:27,286
. and that's when I realized that...

889
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,797
...the most important
part of a relationship...

890
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:31,595
...is not how it
starts but how it ends.

891
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:34,629
How many boyfriends
have you had?

892
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:39,498
Okay, I know I sound
like a slut...

893
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:43,535
...but I've really only
had like two...

894
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:47,916
...serious relationships.

895
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:50,009
My first one was really cute.

896
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,811
It was in high school and
we were just holding hands...

897
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,550
...and pecking each other on
the cheek, really really cute.

898
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:58,394
I've just had one. I guess
my life is simpler than yours.

899
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:01,726
Hmm. And you have a full inbox.

900
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:06,263
Okay. I will do it
in my time okay.

901
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:11,001
Hey don't do it for
anybody else but yourself.

902
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,572
It's really just a matter of
time before you realise that...

903
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:16,242
...Iove is something that
human beings just

904
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:17,905
concocted to find security.

905
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:22,451
No. Love's not just about
providing security alone...

906
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:26,379
You know we talk about love
like it's the most natural thing

907
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:28,583
and the puritans would
jump up with the argument that

908
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:31,354
child loves its mother
before it even knows her

909
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:32,691
but that's not true

910
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:35,459
coz a child wouldn't have
love gushing out of its veins

911
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,261
if it saw its mother
on the streets one day

912
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,597
if it never knew her.

913
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,430
I mean love is always a choice...

914
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:44,770
...and love by another definition
is at best hypocritical.

915
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,900
I mean think about all the
cities that have been destroyed...

916
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:48,638
...all the lives that are ruined...

917
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:50,976
...all the shrinks that are paid...

918
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:54,574
...for something as
un-definable as this feeling...

919
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,448
...which is relative at best...

920
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,948
...and yet when you are in love
its supposed to be incomparable...

921
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:02,287
which throws out the
test of relativity too.

922
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,551
I mean I used to believe
in love and Santa Claus,

923
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,887
but you know you grow up.

924
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:11,923
Yes. No the great thing
about love is that it's...

925
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,664
...about the road trip it's
not about where you're headed.

926
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,461
It's as wonderful as a birthday...

927
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,407
...but you get to experience it
every single day of your life.

928
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:22,604
Its that warm feeling
in your heart...

929
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,580
...the knowledge that you
have something that can make...

930
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:29,710
...the worst possible day
turn into something awesome...

931
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,817
And what's Christmas
without Santa?

932
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:35,346
You know you should start
writing for Mills & Boons...

933
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:37,751
. give up your insurance
selling job.

934
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:41,330
Go ahead, sell it
to 16 year olds...

935
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:43,866
...con the world of the
product that doesn't exist.

936
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:48,026
Yeah, I know I sound like a
loser holding on to some girl...

937
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:50,830
...who didn't even want me
and probably didn't care...

938
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:53,732
...anything about
what I had for her.

939
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,839
Can I be completely
honest with you?

940
00:58:58,481 --> 00:58:59,743
Yes

941
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:01,443
You know I think
it was sweet of her...

942
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:04,715
...to even try to
respect your feelings.

943
00:59:06,323 --> 00:59:07,881
Most of us we just...

944
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:09,949
we just settle for love
wherever we get it...

945
00:59:10,227 --> 00:59:11,990
. if we don't get it
from where we want...

946
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:14,230
like water you know when
you are thirsty or

947
00:59:14,297 --> 00:59:15,889
a burger when you're hungry.

948
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:18,731
Do you really believe all
the things that you say?

949
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,702
Yeah. 200 per cent.

950
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,000
I mean you could convince
yourself of anything in a second.

951
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,238
You could decide that
you are going to be

952
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:27,606
a great actor or a singer.

953
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:30,373
Sign up for classes and
actually believe you are.

954
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,639
Exactly, and you can
just believe...

955
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:34,445
...you are going to
start falling in love.

956
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:36,413
And by the way,
I'm a great singer.

957
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:38,718
Oh boy! Is that a threat?

958
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,619
Okay. Let's see. Who do you like?
I can sing anything.

959
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,349
For the moment, Elvis.

960
00:59:43,426 --> 00:59:45,360
Okay, I am now tuning
into my Elvis channel

961
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:46,986
Going way back to 1958...

962
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:48,697
Oh wait, wait...
I want Britney Spears

963
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:50,892
Hit me baby one more time...
- Pussycat dolls. Wait, wait

964
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:52,526
Shakira Shakira.

965
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:55,436
Actually, I found the
perfect song for the occasion.

966
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:00,760
Guys!

967
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:05,264
Oh my god... That was awful,?

968
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:06,639
But your energy saw you through.

969
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,441
Thank you! And you were also Ok.

970
01:01:11,648 --> 01:01:14,412
You know I'm so glad I don't have
that endure that again in my life.

971
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:15,746
I don't think I could take it.

972
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:17,286
What are you talking about?
You are just scared...

973
01:01:17,354 --> 01:01:19,845
...of my charm and sex appeal.

974
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,052
Did you say sex appeal?
- Yeah.

975
01:01:22,325 --> 01:01:25,317
All right, that is the funniest
thing you have said all night.

976
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:27,590
You know I've been saving
myself for someone special.

977
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:30,790
I don't think you even know how.

978
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:33,301
I do. I've been
practicing on walls

979
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,565
and trees since I was 13... Okay,

980
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:37,964
no, no. Kidding,
kidding, kidding.

981
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:40,942
I don't know if you
are kidding but...

982
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,878
...the surface of walls and trees
is very different from women.

983
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,040
I mean I could tell you more
at the risk of endangering...

984
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:47,783
...your retail store mannequins.

985
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:49,883
Well, please enlighten me.

986
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:51,411
Okay,

987
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:55,455
The world out there
it's round not flat

988
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:57,550
and there is dangerous
curves ahead.

989
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:58,753
Mmmmm! Yummy!

990
01:01:58,995 --> 01:01:59,984
Down boy!

991
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:02,590
I'm sorry, go on.

992
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:06,863
Ok, so then imagine
this was our first date.

993
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:09,028
How intimate would you get?

994
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:12,466
We stop in front of
my house. What next?

995
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:14,603
Would you ask me to come in?

996
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:16,542
Hmmm! Maybe.

997
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:18,945
And only because the
conversation was interesting.

998
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:22,280
Damn! If I was there, I
would've got to first base.

999
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:25,612
I would've gotten you to first
base just to get done with it.

1000
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:28,282
Purely as charity. High
time you got there, man.

1001
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:31,293
May your tribe increase.
Especially since I'm ready now.

1002
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:32,658
You are?
- I think I am.

1003
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:34,794
Okay, kiss me.

1004
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:37,363
Yes and close your eyes.

1005
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,298
Whatever!
It's dark out there anyway.

1006
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,930
Kiss her, man. Kiss her.

1007
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,970
Boobs.

1008
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:51,310
Ask your friends to
look outside the window.

1009
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:56,576
They are all asleep except
for HUSSAIN who I hope is not.

1010
01:02:57,587 --> 01:02:58,645
So you ready?

1011
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,082
Music!

1012
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:02,288
You realise you suck
at this right?

1013
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:05,350
You got to seize the moment, not
wait to arrange background score.

1014
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:07,727
It's my first time in
a long time.

1015
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,567
Ok. You there? Hello!
Did you hang up one me?

1016
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:14,893
Shut up and kiss you ass!

1017
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:17,839
Hey! But you made the jump.

1018
01:03:17,907 --> 01:03:22,367
Yes. You know I feel
stupid kissing a phone.

1019
01:03:23,046 --> 01:03:25,810
I am sure the guys are very
happy you stopped with the phone.

1020
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:28,683
Is this just a phone thing

1021
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:31,686
or would you have actually
kissed me if I saw you tonight?

1022
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,588
I would have kissed you.
My good deed for the day.

1023
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:38,286
You would really kiss
a guy like me?

1024
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,894
What's wrong with
a guy like you?

1025
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,559
I probably would've
cried all night.

1026
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:50,402
I would have cried asked you
to hold me and never let me go.

1027
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:53,442
Mayday... Mayday...
Going down. Abort!

1028
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:01,015
Hold on, I got to pee.

1029
01:04:13,963 --> 01:04:17,399
Hey, sorry I had to go.
That was uncontrollable.

1030
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:19,958
Hey, when you got to go,
you got to go.

1031
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:24,269
I hope the snow
doesn't delay my flight.

1032
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,533
What time is it?

1033
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,907
It's five minutes to six.

1034
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,506
What time do you have to go?

1035
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:33,048
I need to be at the
airport by seven thirty.

1036
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:35,011
Which means I need to
leave in a half hour.

1037
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:36,782
Are you done packing?

1038
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:39,321
I'm in transit.
Just have to change.

1039
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,791
We are almost home
and my phone's dying.

1040
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:48,293
Soon we'll go back
to our own worlds...

1041
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:52,027
...and remember the crazy night
that almost changed our lives.

1042
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,993
Yes. It changed mine for sure.

1043
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:56,768
How did it change yours?

1044
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:00,533
Well, that will always
be my little secret.

1045
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:03,504
Hello?

1046
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:04,570
Hello
- Hello

1047
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:06,345
Hello?

1048
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:08,977
Damn it!

1049
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,653
Dudes, my phone died again.

1050
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:16,247
Dude!

1051
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,520
Don't look at me.

1052
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:20,759
Come on dude. You don't need
your phone anymore for GPS.

1053
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,956
I need my phone.

1054
01:05:21,998 --> 01:05:23,966
No. Come on.
Give it to me please.

1055
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:25,728
What do you need it so much for?

1056
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:28,965
Dude! Is this any phone
call doing you any good?

1057
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:30,934
Not sure yet.

1058
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:33,673
You want to complicate
your life?

1059
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:37,474
No, man, no.
Just help me out huh.

1060
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,372
Just help me out.

1061
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,315
One condition.

1062
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,846
If you ever...
ever talk about your failed

1063
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,046
f***ing eight year romance...

1064
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:47,983
It's over. It's dead.
I'll never do it.

1065
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:49,683
Ever.
- Never.

1066
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,624
You can kick me in the
b***s if I ever do...

1067
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:54,625
Kick me... Just hard.
In the b***s.

1068
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:57,763
Like a little girl.

1069
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:09,011
Hey sorry, JC's phone died
as well. This is HUSSAIN's.

1070
01:06:09,846 --> 01:06:11,370
I thought I said something wrong.

1071
01:06:11,447 --> 01:06:13,244
No, no. Hey truth or dare?

1072
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:15,642
Ok... Dare.

1073
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:18,682
I dare you to tell me
what your little secret is.

1074
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,020
Ok, what's Truth?

1075
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:24,457
I want to know the truth
about what your little secret is.

1076
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:26,757
And please hurry up this
is going to die as well...

1077
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:30,924
Okay,

1078
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,869
I wish you hadn't said
what you did.

1079
01:06:36,673 --> 01:06:37,833
But you did.

1080
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,774
And that makes this
that much more difficult.

1081
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:43,509
What are talking about?

1082
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,981
You make me feel
like it's my birthday.

1083
01:06:54,957 --> 01:06:56,447
Do you have to go?

1084
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:58,793
Can you change your flight?

1085
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:01,659
Go some other time, go tomorrow,
day after I don't care.

1086
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,628
Don't go tonight.
- I wish I could.

1087
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,003
Actually, I could but I
shouldn't and I wouldn't.

1088
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:10,968
Because?

1089
01:07:11,808 --> 01:07:15,403
Because, that would make
this that much more difficult.

1090
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:17,874
Ok.

1091
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:19,879
I know I am going to
feel stupid saying this...

1092
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:21,974
...and it might be
extremely irrelevant...

1093
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:27,917
But all I want from
life is to be anywhere...

1094
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,884
...and be a bum but be
with the girl I love...

1095
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:33,352
...and that she loves me.

1096
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:48,674
You know I have always needed
wanted to prove myself to my Dad.

1097
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:51,674
I have always needed
him to understand

1098
01:07:51,748 --> 01:07:54,945
that I am ok and I
am going to go places.

1099
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,850
He was so proud of me

1100
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:00,821
when I told him that I am
almost done with my Ph D

1101
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,915
and I am finally coming
back to India.

1102
01:08:03,693 --> 01:08:08,858
He was so happy and
everything felt so right.

1103
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:11,557
My life was like back on track.

1104
01:08:14,704 --> 01:08:15,966
And suddenly...

1105
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:19,867
...now...

1106
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:24,237
...it doesn't seem
to matter remotely.

1107
01:08:26,582 --> 01:08:28,311
Life's a bitch, right?

1108
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:34,820
Hang on. I need to change.

1109
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:36,949
I told you,
you shouldn't do that...

1110
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:39,788
You are harmless.

1111
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:41,990
Besides, we've done this before.

1112
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:43,754
Hey, wait.

1113
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:48,001
You are a beautiful woman.

1114
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:51,907
I'm not sure if this
is even real or what

1115
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:54,637
...but I'm scared that
I'm going to wake up...

1116
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,645
and find out that
this was just a dream.

1117
01:08:58,448 --> 01:08:59,540
Beautiful.

1118
01:09:00,316 --> 01:09:01,442
Dream.

1119
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:06,455
All it takes is a moment for
them to start doing something.

1120
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,790
All it takes is a
moment for them to stop.

1121
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:14,822
Yeah. I know I sound fickle.

1122
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:16,859
...beginning of this phone call...

1123
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:19,800
...I was holding on for
dear life to some girl...

1124
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:23,396
...for three years ago and now
I'm pleading with another one.

1125
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:24,797
Are you?

1126
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:28,740
No, I am not pleading but...

1127
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:31,610
Thank God! I

1128
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,906
would've felt like the
world's cruelest bitch

1129
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,417
if you told me not to go.

1130
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:36,911
No...

1131
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,682
When you got to go,
you got to go.

1132
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,885
I will always cherish tonight.

1133
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:48,458
No matter where we go.

1134
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,766
Nothing can change this.

1135
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:54,528
It's been the most perfect night.

1136
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:58,931
I want you to do one
thing before you go.

1137
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:01,670
What?

1138
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:03,041
Call me from the landline.

1139
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:06,977
Why? - No, my phone's
going to die in any moment.

1140
01:10:07,049 --> 01:10:08,880
Just call me from
the landline ok.

1141
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:11,579
Okay.
- Ok. Bye.

1142
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,294
Hi - Hello. May I speak
with Mr. Turiya Omprakash?

1143
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:21,023
Wow. You remember my surname.

1144
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:24,533
I remember every bit of tonight.

1145
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:27,996
I wanted you to clear your inbox.

1146
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:32,467
Oh. You didn't really send
me any messages, loverboy.

1147
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:34,069
That's true.

1148
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:38,808
Okay, you're never going to
use this phone again, are you?

1149
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:41,347
No.
- Ok.

1150
01:10:41,417 --> 01:10:45,581
I want you to remove the SIM card.
- Okay.

1151
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:49,754
Ok?
- Taking out the SIM card

1152
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:51,452
Thank you.

1153
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:53,760
Now go to the bathroom.

1154
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,524
Alright. Going to the bathroom.

1155
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:58,927
Good.

1156
01:10:58,968 --> 01:11:00,993
Now just flush it down the toilet.

1157
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:04,798
What?! Why?

1158
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:06,837
Because.

1159
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:08,433
What if I want to call you again?

1160
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:09,972
That's why.

1161
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:13,812
You don't want me to call you?

1162
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:19,013
No, I want us to have a clean
break. I want us to travel light.

1163
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:24,653
Okay.

1164
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:40,839
Fast learner.

1165
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:46,947
Oh guess it is time
for you to leave...

1166
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:49,450
...and my battery is
going to die in any moment.

1167
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:58,454
Thank you for doing that.
I know you did that for me.

1168
01:11:58,527 --> 01:11:59,789
What?

1169
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:03,821
Help me clear my mind space.

1170
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:15,038
So, I guess this is it.

1171
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:16,738
Yes

1172
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:20,544
Goodbye.
- No. Don't ever say Goodbye.

1173
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:23,978
Goodnight.

1174
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:28,882
Good Morning.

1175
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:54,816
Put on some music guys.

1176
01:13:29,919 --> 01:13:31,614
Think she would've
gotten it by now.

1177
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:33,746
What's that?
- The Waffles.

1178
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:07,886
You actually got those delivered?
- Yep.

1179
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:10,789
Well I got to say I am impressed.

1180
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:16,625
But she's gone and you are moving
on and I am glad that you are.

1181
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,365
You know I have never said this...

1182
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:23,837
...but I am so glad
that you were right...

1183
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:25,840
...all those times
that you abused me.

1184
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:27,503
Thank you brother.

1185
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:31,043
Do her man. Do her.

1186
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:33,675
Ok.

1187
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,475
Hi. This... This is TURIYA,

1188
01:15:00,543 --> 01:15:02,636
single and alone on
New Year's Eve.

1189
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:04,879
Just like you.

1190
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:06,881
LISTEN! I am not a hooker.

1191
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,009
I am not some chick
you can pick up at a bar.

1192
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:10,980
I'm not the girl that
you are going to take home.

1193
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:13,016
I am not even going to
give you my phone number.

1194
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:15,880
I am five drinks down and

1195
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,357
I can still speak in
complete sentences...

1196
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:19,951
...making total sense and perfect
logic with flawless grammar.

1197
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:21,795
Did you guys
consider the possibility...

1198
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:23,695
...that maybe I was just
sitting in my room bored...

1199
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,028
...and stepped out for a drink.

1200
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,598
Well... Well...

1201
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,269
You are like the eighth
set of guys to hit on me over

1202
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:29,326
the last two hours

1203
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:30,599
and I am still sitting here,
ALONE!

1204
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:32,538
By myself.
What does that tell you?

1205
01:15:32,608 --> 01:15:36,635
That... you talk a lot, sister.

1206
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,474
It's always a great
ride while it lasts.

1207
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:18,620
Most people know when to get off.

1208
01:16:19,355 --> 01:16:22,017
But me, I am a sucker.

1209
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,653
I do it every time.

1210
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:27,019
Despite the futility of it all.

1211
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,453
The icebreaker

1212
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:30,991
The honeymoon.

1213
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:33,031
The reality check.

1214
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:34,830
The break up.

1215
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:36,369
The patch-up.

1216
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:38,034
The confiding.

1217
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:40,366
The great friendship.

1218
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,435
And the killing confusion.

1219
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:47,005
We always want more
but we can't have it all.

1220
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:51,811
So we run away from the
very things we once chased.

1221
01:17:50,346 --> 01:17:53,941
And then one day, you find
someone you can walk with.

1222
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,915
We are all companions anyway.

1223
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,854
For a while. Or a longer while.
