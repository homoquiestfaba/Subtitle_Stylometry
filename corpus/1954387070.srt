1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,955
<i> I'm not sure if we're even on the air.</i>

2
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,998
<i>Uh...this is uh...</i>

3
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>...a series of explosions...</i>

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,002
<i>This is a major incident...</i>

5
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,628
<i>The emergency is a major incident...</i>

6
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>That's a meteor hit.</i>

7
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,594
<i>It does now appear to be a major attack...</i>

8
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,263
<i>Since they landed outside Hamburg five years ago,</i>

9
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,349
<i>they have steadily advanced across Europe.</i>

10
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,184
<i>We've suffered millions of casualties and yet...</i>

11
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,896
<i>The evacuation of key government officials continuing...</i>

12
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,482
<i>Nothing we have done
has been able to stop their advance...</i>

13
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,150
<i>Human costs, the Europeans....</i>

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,360
<i>-  ...have paid the highest...
- They appear to mimic...</i>

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,487
<i>and even anticipate our actions...</i>

16
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,614
<i>We could not defeat them in France,</i>

17
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>we'll be fighting them in the streets of London,</i>

18
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,076
<i>then New York, then Tokyo.</i>

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>All of humanity is at stake.</i>

20
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,539
<i>After five years, we finally have a victory.</i>

21
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>These pictures are just in from Verdun.</i>

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>...and the coalition victory
was how low casualties were...</i>

23
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,589
<i>We have seen a stunning victory here today.</i>

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,466
<i>The United Defense Force...</i>

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,717
<i>How do you convince people...</i>

26
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,804
that this is a fight that can be won?

27
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,597
This is an alien invasion and a global war.

28
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,308
<i>With the new jack in technology
and limited amount of training,</i>

29
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,519
we've been able to create super soldiers.

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,063
<i>Look at Rita Vrataski, The Angel of Verdun....</i>

31
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,898
<i>They're calling her "The Angel of Verdun"...</i>

32
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,860
<i>You can see that's the new hope for this war...</i>

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,572
With the new jack in technology
and limited amount of training,

34
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,784
Rita Vrataski was able to kill hundreds of Mimics...

35
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,007
<i>She was able to kill hundreds of Mimics
on only her first day in combat.</i>

36
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,634
Imagine any army of Rita Vrataski's.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,470
We're managing to hold them back
at the English Channel,

38
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,180
<i>- but for how long?
- It is a dangerous task</i>

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,058
<i>...and it's easy to understand
why people are so suspicious about this....</i>

40
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,185
<i>Over seventy nations
are joining the United Defense Force,</i>

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,729
<i>which hopes to push them back once and for all.</i>

42
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:29,150
We've got 'em contained, and with this new technology,
we're gonna defeat 'em.

43
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:33,237
Operation Downfall is going to be
the largest mechanized invasion in the history of mankind.

44
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,697
We will be victorious.

45
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,865
We fight.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,241
That's what we do.

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,954
LONDON

48
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,423
Major William Cage.

49
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,759
United Stated military.

50
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,094
Welcome to London, Major.

51
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,179
UNITED DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS

52
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,269
The General will see you now.

53
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:49,522
Thank you.

54
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,817
Operation Downfall,

55
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,861
the entire might of the UDF invading from France,

56
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,071
the Mediterranean, Scandinavia,

57
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,156
relieving pressure in the Eastern front and allowing

58
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,992
the Russians and Chinese to push the enemy back,

59
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,536
and we all meet in the middle,

60
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,914
exterminating this Mimic scourge along the way.

61
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,042
A lot of good soldiers
are going to die tomorrow, Major,

62
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,920
and when the smoke clears
and the body bags start coming home,

63
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,797
people tend to look for someone to blame,

64
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,173
someone like me.

65
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,384
Ideally I'd prefer a different scenario.

66
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:20,928
Please.

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,015
A best selling memoir perhaps?

68
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,268
Maybe a career in politics?

69
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,356
Off the top of my head, I would go with the...

70
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,191
"The Sense of Manifest Destiny"

71
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,694
"Rags to Riches: Rags Rise Through The Ranks."

72
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,404
"Born to Deliver."
You see people.

73
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,281
Well, they'd love that sort of thing.

74
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,741
You misunderstand, Major.

75
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,535
I didn't ask you here to sell me,
I want you to sell the invasion.

76
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:45,661
Okay.

77
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,580
You ship out to the coast in one hour.

78
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,290
Your comrade is standing by.

79
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,417
You'll be on the beach with the first wave.

80
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,212
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,464
The first wave, the beach?

82
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,340
You mean...

83
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,132
The front?

84
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:58,883
France.

85
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,927
Satellite show minimum
enemy movement down the coast.

86
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,471
Little resistance.

87
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,098
It'd be exciting,
something to tell your grandchildren.

88
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,143
Well, I appreciate the confidence, General.

89
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,937
I do...I do this to avoid doing that.

90
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,027
I...I...I was an ROTC in college,

91
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,447
and war broke out,
I lost my advertising firm and...

92
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,282
here I am.

93
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,533
I do what I do.

94
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,869
You...you do what you do.

95
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,537
But,...

96
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,041
I'm not a soldier really.

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,335
No, of course you're not.

98
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,338
That's why I'm embedding you
with several hundred thousand men and women who are.

99
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,341
Well it is an honor, General.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.

100
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,010
I can't stand the sight of blood,

101
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,845
not so much as a paper cut.

102
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,977
Uh...but,

103
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,772
uh...it's sitting here thinking about this,

104
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:00,069
a couple of names come to mind
that I feel like I could recommend to you inste...

105
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,113
It's not an offer, Major,
it's an order.

106
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,828
General, I'm an officer in the United States Military.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,287
You don't even have that authority...

108
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,164
I've spoken to your C.O.

109
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,874
You are now under my command.

110
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,669
You will retain your present rank of course.

111
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,380
My secretary has all the details.

112
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,634
Do a good job, Major.

113
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:25,720
Good luck.

114
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:26,846
Dismissed.

115
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,153
General.

116
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,324
I just inspired millions of people...

117
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,160
to join your army.

118
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,622
And when the body bags come home,

119
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,208
and they're looking for someone to blame.

120
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,087
How hard do you think
it would be for me to convince people...

121
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,714
to blame you?

122
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,427
I'd imagine a General would prefer to avoid that.

123
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,557
Are you blackmailing me, Major?

124
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,810
I would prefer...

125
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,357
not to be filming acts of heroism
and valor on that beach tomorrow.

126
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:33,829
You won't be.

127
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,710
I'm glad we could uh...work this out.

128
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,128
Now, if you'll excuse me, General, I...

129
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,510
Thank you.

130
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,262
Arrest this man.

131
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,473
What?

132
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,269
Stop running!

133
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,468
<i>Flight closing in 10 minutes.</i>

134
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,194
On your feet, maggot!

135
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,534
Now that's no way to address an officer, Sergeant.

136
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,455
That's how I address a slack-jawed recruit
right before I bust his hole with my boot heel.

137
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,164
Maggot!

138
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,623
Hold up there, son.

139
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:02,877
Can I help you, sir?

140
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,921
Where the hell am I, Sergeant?

141
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,882
Forward Operating Base, Heathrow.

142
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,176
You just came in with the fresh recruits.

143
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,969
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?

144
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,597
No, sir, you do not.

145
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,683
My name is Major William Cage,
I'm an American officer...

146
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,434
Officer?

147
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,643
This is Processing.

148
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,396
There's no officers down here.
I got this, Sergeant.

149
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,025
How the hell did you end up in Processing?

150
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,402
What was it?

151
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,738
Poker night?
Bachelor party?

152
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,698
If it's all the same to you, Sergeant.

153
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:36,035
I'd like to explain that to my
Commanding Officer in Washington.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,578
So if you just take me to the phone...

155
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,496
Haven't you heard?

156
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,456
We're t-minusing our whole S.H. out,

157
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,501
we're fixing to invade France.

158
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,421
This whole F.O.P is on lockdown,
no calls, in or out.

159
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,509
You're name's Farell?

160
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,635
That's right.

161
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,803
Master Sergeant Farell.

162
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,346
Master Sergeant Farell,
you're an American.

163
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,556
No, sir.
I'm from Kentucky.

164
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,434
Okay, well...

165
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:01,644
Look at me.

166
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,562
And look at where I am.

167
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,482
I've been railroaded.

168
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,860
It's obvious, I don't belong here.

169
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:12,405
So please, Sergeant.

170
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,116
There has to be a way
I can make a phone call.

171
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

172
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,582
Thank you.

173
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,875
Right this way.

174
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,260
- Where are you from in Kentucky, Sergeant?
- Little town called Science Hill.

175
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,553
- Heard of it?
- I have now.

176
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,972
- How about you, where are you from?
- Cranbury, New Jersey.

177
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,807
They grow our cranberries there, do they?

178
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,559
Tomatoes, best I've ever had.

179
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,102
Why do they called Cranbury then?

180
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,062
Why do they call it Science Hill?

181
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,731
Never asked, don't care.

182
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,403
After you.

183
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,784
You're not taking me to a phone,
are you, Sergeant?

184
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,119
No, I'm not.

185
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,832
Seems about the only honest thing
you've said to me so far is your name.

186
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,794
Says here you're a deserter.

187
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,048
Says here you were caught impersonating an officer,

188
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,925
It says here you'd likely try to make an outside call,

189
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,844
even compromise security of this operation.

190
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,472
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.

191
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,515
But that's not gonna happen.

192
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:22,725
Ever.

193
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,727
Private Cage.

194
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,491
Rumor is a terrible thing.

195
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,494
And not following these men,
we'll all reach the same conclusion.

196
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:45,498
That you're a coward and a liar,
putting your life above theirs.

197
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,291
The good new is there's hope for you, Private.

198
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,002
Hope in the form of glorious combat,

199
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,546
battle is the great redeemer,

200
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,758
fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,803
The one place where all men truly share the same rank,

202
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,014
regardless of what kind of parasitic
scum they were going in.

203
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:04,934
Squad!

204
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,144
This here is Private Cage.

205
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:08,979
Private Cage.

206
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,106
J Squad.

207
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,774
Isn't that an Officer's uniform?

208
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,652
Or he's showing off us the cufflinks.

209
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,282
I see everyone is having a productive morning.

210
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:23,744
You know it gives me a swell of pride
knowing soldiers of your...

211
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,373
caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow.

212
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:28,791
Tip of the spear.

213
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,710
Edge of the knife.

214
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,421
Crack of my ass.

215
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,634
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gambling in the barracks?

216
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,094
Dislike it, Sergeant Farell.

217
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,637
Nance, why do I dislike it?

218
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,724
Cause it maintains the notion that our fate
is in hands other than our own.

219
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,893
And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate?

220
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,352
Chorus.

221
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,148
Through readiness and discipline, we are masters of our fate.

222
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,153
You might call that notion ironic,

223
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,696
but trust me,

224
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:00,281
you'll come around.

225
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,326
Private Cage is a deserter.

226
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,748
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

227
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,876
He will be combat ready at 06:00 tomorrow.

228
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:12,626
Combat ready?

229
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,129
Private Cage is under the delusion
that he does not belong here,

230
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,882
we must dissuade him of this delusion.

231
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,342
If he tries to run,

232
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:22,178
feel free dissuade him until he can't piss standing up.

233
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:23,471
You have to listen to me,

234
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:24,305
I will never be combat ready...

235
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,222
I envy you, Cage.

236
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,061
Tomorrow morning you will be baptized,
born again.

237
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,189
PT, ten minutes!

238
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,244
You're not in uniform...Private.

239
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,963
It's a new day, people!

240
00:13:58,673 --> 00:13:59,924
Destiny calls.

241
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,760
The world expects only one thing from us,

242
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,761
that we will win!

243
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,595
Come on, Kimmel! Let's have it!

244
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,561
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Kimmel!

245
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,354
I gotta be free, man!

246
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,816
Alright, man. Let's get this show on the road,
I gotta suite up.

247
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,443
What's that noise? That...

248
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,444
Let's go!

249
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,238
Listen, man!

250
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,447
I've never been in one of these.

251
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,741
Yeah, well, I've never been with two girls
at the same time before.

252
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,035
But you can bet when that day comes,
I'll make it work.

253
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,204
Uh...Kimmel?

254
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,664
It's Griff.

255
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,791
Griff. Griff, listen to me.

256
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,126
Think about this, man.

257
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,336
I could hurt somebody.

258
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,088
Not with the safety on your one.

259
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,798
What?

260
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,050
Where is the safety?

261
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:28,135
Exactly!

262
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,095
DO NOT CROSS

263
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,188
It's time.

264
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,051
Bloody hell! It's the full metal...

265
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:10,969
Move!

266
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,514
- Griff.
- Serge?

267
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,016
Take care of Private Cage!

268
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,434
What, all day?

269
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,686
Something tells me he won't be needing it that long.

270
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:01,853
Griff!

271
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,063
Cage!

272
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
Cage!

273
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>We lost Germany.</i>

274
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:30,716
<i>We lost France.</i>

275
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:34,886
<i>If we lose today we won't get to fight in battle.</i>

276
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,764
<i>Now I know the pressure on you is enormous.</i>

277
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,641
<i>Two minutes to drop.</i>

278
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,185
<i>It's alright to be scared. .</i>

279
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,605
Remember, there's no courage without fear.

280
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,025
Hey!

281
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,985
Oy, mate!

282
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,903
I think there's something wrong with his suite!

283
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,405
Yeah!

284
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,657
There's a dead guy in it.

285
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,203
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

286
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,914
No one else will.

287
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,458
<i>One minute!</i>

288
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,876
<i>One minute to drop!</i>

289
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:12,883
Hey!

290
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,718
Hey!

291
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,385
What?

292
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,681
How do I turn the safety off of my weapon?

293
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:20,432
What?

294
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,726
How do I turn the safety off...

295
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,187
Oh, my God!

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,652
Everybody!

297
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,445
Thirty seconds to drop!

298
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,031
On my mark!

299
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,408
Standby to deploy!

300
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,118
Activate drop ride!

301
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,410
Remember...

302
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,461
Drop! Drop!

303
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,006
Drop! Go!

304
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,300
Let's go! Let's go!

305
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,388
Drop! Drop!

306
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,018
Cage, drop or die!

307
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,397
Yeah! Wooh!

308
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,898
We made it!

309
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,859
Squad, we made it! Yeah...

310
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:14,713
What the...?!

311
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,086
Private Cage!

312
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,713
You're going the wrong way!

313
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,214
You're gonna miss your moment!

314
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:22,966
What the hell?

315
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,802
They're not supposed to know we're even coming.

316
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,013
It's a slaughter house, man!

317
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,014
It's a slaughter house!

318
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,642
Pull yourself together, Ford!

319
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,101
On your feet, people!

320
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,437
Get in line!

321
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,189
Nance, get me a sitrep!

322
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,273
Safety?

323
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,650
Griff, Ford, go to the front!

324
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,985
My safety?

325
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,738
How do I get my safety...?

326
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm waiting, Nance!

327
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,785
I got traces!
Five hundred meters and they're coming in fast!

328
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,286
Son of a bitch.

329
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,457
Put a line if you want to stay that way.

330
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,376
On your position!

331
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,961
Move!

332
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,630
Here they come.

333
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,049
Mean as hell and filthy as grass.

334
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,259
Wait till the other ride's on us!

335
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,135
Few more seconds!

336
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,305
Hey!

337
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,473
Hey!

338
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,522
Fall back!

339
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,921
<i>Reload!</i>

340
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,797
<i>Reload!</i>

341
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,663
On your feet, maggot!

342
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,921
Get in line before I bust your hole
with my boot heel, maggot!

343
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,589
Hold up there, son.

344
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,636
Can I help you, sir?

345
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,265
Sergeant Farell...

346
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,517
That is my name.

347
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,478
I think I get it.

348
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,814
What was it?

349
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,940
Poker night?

350
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,108
Bachelor party?

351
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,193
I'm not sure.

352
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:30,779
It happens.

353
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,533
I'll get you sorted out, sir.

354
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,493
Let me take those for you.

355
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:39,913
What...what day is it?

356
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,540
For you...

357
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,460
Judgment day.

358
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,714
The good new is there's hope for your, Private.

359
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,383
Hope in the form of glorious combat,

360
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,594
battle is the great redeemer,

361
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,387
the fire and crucible...

362
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,265
- in which the only true heroes...
- in which the only true heroes are forged.

363
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,977
Did you just interrupt me, Private?

364
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,816
Sergeant.

365
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,613
You're...you're not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.

366
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,614
No, I'm not.

367
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,908
Now, where was I?

368
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,536
The Fire and crucible.

369
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,830
The Fire and crucible...

370
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,040
in which
the only true heroes are forged.

371
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,085
The one place where all men
truly share the same rank,

372
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,589
regardless of what kind of parasitic
scum they were going in.

373
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,053
Squad! This here is Private Cage.

374
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,183
Private Cage. J Squad.

375
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,060
Isn't that an Officers uniform?

376
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,853
He's showing off us the cufflinks.

377
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,565
You know it gives me a swell of pride
knowing soldiers of your...

378
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,610
caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow.

379
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,153
Tip of the spear.

380
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,112
Edge of the knife.

381
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,490
Crack of my ass.

382
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,369
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gambling in the barracks?

383
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,954
Dislike it, Sergeant Farell.

384
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,580
Nance, why do I dislike it?

385
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,667
Cause it maintains the notion that our fate
is in hands other than our own.

386
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,837
And what is my definitive position
on the concept of fate?

387
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:11,964
Chorus.

388
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,883
Through readiness and discipline
we are masters of our fate.

389
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,929
You might call that notion ironic,

390
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:20,847
but trust me.

391
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,057
You'll come around.

392
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,434
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Kimmel!

393
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,852
I gotta be free, man!

394
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,855
Alright, man. Let's get this show on the road,
I gotta suite up.

395
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>Disengage.</i>

396
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,363
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you, man?

397
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,575
Haven't you been in one of these before?

398
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,077
Maybe.

399
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,788
Do you know where the safety is?

400
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:47,749
I'm not sure.

401
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,334
Good.

402
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,713
<i> Now I know the pressure on you is enormous.</i>

403
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,215
Two minutes to drop.

404
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,718
It's alright to be scared.

405
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,137
Remember, there's no courage without fear.

406
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,390
Hey, Oy, mate!

407
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,309
I think there's something wrong with your suite!

408
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,185
Yeah!

409
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,770
There's a dead guy in it.

410
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,484
Hey, watch your back out there, sir.

411
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,944
No one else will.

412
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,031
Clean, bitch!

413
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,663
On my mark!

414
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,248
Standby to deploy!

415
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,583
Activate drop ride!

416
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,084
Thirty seconds!

417
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,294
- Remember...
- Hey!

418
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,287
Yeah! Wooh! We made it!

419
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,122
Behind you!

420
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,290
Watch out!

421
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,498
Incoming!

422
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,127
I'm hit!

423
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,420
I'm hit!

424
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,298
How bad is it?

425
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,260
Is there... a lot of blood?

426
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,013
You have a hole in your chest.

427
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,348
Really?

428
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,641
Yeah.

429
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,275
Did you just take my...my battery...battery?

430
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,280
Oh, no, no!

431
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,281
Holy fuc...!?

432
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,122
On your feet, maggot!

433
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,582
Sergeant Farell!

434
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:34,666
Sergeant Farell!

435
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,044
Can I help you, sir?

436
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,462
My name is Major Will Cage.

437
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,671
U.S. Army Media Relations.

438
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,632
I wasn't at a bachelor party or a poker game!

439
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,008
You have an order in your left pocket

440
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,427
that says that I'm a deserter impersonating an officer.

441
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,887
but what it doesn't say is that your...

442
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,766
Your name is Master Sergeant Farell
from Science Hill, Kentucky.

443
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,101
And if you'll give me thirty seconds
to explain how I know

444
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,896
that you may just save the lives
of every soldier on this base.

445
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,400
You have to listen to me!
They know we're coming!

446
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,693
They're waiting for us!

447
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,236
I have been there!

448
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,738
I've seen it!

449
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,405
You're all doomed!

450
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,823
You're doomed!

451
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,200
Okay, I'm calm.

452
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,910
Okay, I'm fine. I'm fine.

453
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,704
This is J Squad, yes?

454
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,705
This is J Squad, yes.

455
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,958
Not that I should know that, but okay.

456
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,502
Have any of you met me before?

457
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,628
Bitch, I don't know you.

458
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,171
Exactly! Yes!

459
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,047
Thank you.

460
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,423
Your name is Nance.

461
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,216
You're Bimmel...

462
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,425
Kimmel! Kimmel!

463
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,469
You fight balls out, literally.

464
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:28,720
Ford.

465
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:29,513
Skinner.

466
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,389
Griff.

467
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,515
You're...

468
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,142
He doesn't talk much.

469
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,728
But there's a card game under the bed...

470
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,729
Thanks a lot, asshole.

471
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,523
Uh...Kimmel's winning on a flush.

472
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,441
Uh...spades, no clubs.

473
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,321
And you're gonna make them
eat those cards. Am I right?

474
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,163
Now, what I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.

475
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,165
It's true.

476
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,711
And you have to listen to me.

477
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,008
You're very lives depend on it.

478
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,721
1 minute!

479
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,814
What is he saying?

480
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,357
Nance!

481
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,567
What is he saying?

482
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,162
On my mark!

483
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,080
Standby to deploy!

484
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,334
- Activate drop ride, thirty seconds!..
- This ship is about to explo...!

485
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,547
<i>Disengage.</i>

486
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,931
Yeah! Wooh! We made it!

487
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,557
Squad, we made it!

488
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,519
<i>...or I'll bust your hole with my boot heel!</i>

489
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,024
We made it!

490
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,026
Squad, we made it!

491
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,889
I'm sorry!

492
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,182
I'm trying to save you.

493
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,308
We're getting slaughtered.

494
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,394
You need to get us off this beach.

495
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,318
We have to go.
This drop ship is about to explode.

496
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,528
We have to go now!

497
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,405
Wait.

498
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:58,912
Come on!

499
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:10,674
Come on!

500
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,429
Come on!

501
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,848
This ship is going to explode!

502
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,017
What are you doing?

503
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,060
Find me when you wake up.

504
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:23,979
What?

505
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,606
Come find me when you wake up...

506
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,360
On your feet, maggot!

507
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,492
Get in line before I bust your hole
with my boot heel, maggot!

508
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,870
The good new is there's hope for your, Private.

509
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,413
Battle is the great redeemer.

510
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,333
Te fire and crucible in which
the only true heroes are forged.

511
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,753
The one place where all men truly share the...

512
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,426
Squad this here is...

513
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,427
Private Cage.

514
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,428
You must me J Squad.

515
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:58,805
It's good to meet you.

516
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,807
Isn't that an officer's uniform?

517
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,100
- These sure ain't officers...
- These sure ain't officers...

518
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,101
...cufflinks.

519
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:06,772
Keys.

520
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,274
In the left pocket...

521
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:09,983
Probably.

522
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,948
Private Cage is a deserter.

523
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,118
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.

524
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,372
He will be combat ready by 06:00 tomorrow.

525
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,917
Private Cage is under the delusion
that he does not belong here.

526
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,169
We must dissuade him of this delusion.

527
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,088
- If he tries to run, feel free dissuade him until...
- Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm...

528
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,881
I'm not gonna run from you guys.

529
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,676
- It's uh...not a chance.
- ...he can't piss standing up.

530
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,969
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.

531
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,275
What next?  A little uh...

532
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,734
PT?

533
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,694
<i>PT!</i>

534
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,528
<i>Ten minutes!</i>

535
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:55,404
Left.

536
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:56,780
Left.

537
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,407
Left.

538
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,617
What do you stand up?

539
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,743
A warrior!

540
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,245
What do warrior's do?

541
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:03,870
Kill!

542
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:04,913
What are you gonna do?

543
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:05,622
Kill!

544
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:06,832
What are you gonna do?

545
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:07,666
Kill!

546
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,002
This is gonna be my twentieth battle tomorrow, man.

547
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,004
You haven't been in twenty battles, man.

548
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:12,671
I have, too!

549
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,756
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach tomorrow.

550
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,427
Why don't you two get yourselves
a nice hot cup of shut the hell up?

551
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,595
You funny, girl.

552
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,888
But I bet you I set some iron record tomorrow.

553
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,307
Busting his hand moving back when he falls forward

554
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,225
slipping in your shit.

555
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,436
Knock off the grab ass!

556
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:29,896
Grab this, Serge!

557
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,189
Hold up!

558
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,777
Private give me...

559
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,655
Fifty, Serge?

560
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,700
That's right.

561
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:42,910
Fifty.

562
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,037
Platoon.

563
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,164
Drop and give me fifty.

564
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,832
Compliments of Private Cage!

565
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,500
Thank you, Serge.

566
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,085
- And one!
- One!

567
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:53,712
- And two!
- Two!

568
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:54,922
- And three!
- Three

569
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,185
Oh! What the hell were you thinking?

570
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,728
There's hope for your, Private.

571
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,647
Hope in the form of glorious combat.

572
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,941
Battle is the great redeemer.

573
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:14,441
<i>Two.</i>

574
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,359
<i>Three.</i>

575
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,111
DO NOT CROSS

576
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,741
Excuse me, Sergeant Vrataski?

577
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,288
Excuse me.

578
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,082
Sergeant Vrataski?

579
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,353
Excuse me.

580
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,104
Ya?

581
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,814
Yes! Who said you could talk to me?

582
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,775
Have I got something on my face, soldier?

583
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,944
You did. You did.

584
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,571
Tomorrow, at the beach.

585
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,615
Tomorrow, at the beach.

586
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,576
We meet.

587
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,412
You said to find you when I wake up.

588
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,292
You do know what's happening to me.

589
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:56,919
Come with me.

590
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,296
Now.

591
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,007
You don't talk to anyone about this but me.

592
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,010
cause the best case scenario
is you're gonna end up in a psych ward.

593
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,138
The worst case you'll get
dissected for study.

594
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:08,847
Are we clear?

595
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,015
Yes?

596
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:10,849
Yes.

597
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,351
First time you died, what happened?

598
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,644
You killed a Mimic?

599
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:13,852
Yes.

600
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,228
Describe it.

601
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,064
Uh...it was different.

602
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,106
It was a bigger.

603
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,566
Blueish.

604
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,485
And you got covered in its blood.

605
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,321
As a matter of fact, I did.

606
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,948
They know we're coming.

607
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,157
On the beach tomorrow.

608
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,909
It's a slaughter, isn't it?

609
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,662
How do you know this?

610
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:33,789
Could you just...

611
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:34,414
Wait!

612
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,624
Wait! Wait!

613
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,170
Would you please just explain
to me what the hell is happening?

614
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,922
What happened to you happened to me.

615
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,758
I had it, I lost it. Okay?

616
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,719
I mean, that's great, there's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?

617
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,221
First I need your help.

618
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,348
Help with what exactly?

619
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,059
Winning the war.

620
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,019
Let's go, come on!

621
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,267
Rita, what is this?

622
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,811
Rita, what are you doing here?
You've got to give me some warning.

623
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,520
Who's this?

624
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,231
He's me, before Verdun.

625
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,399
He's gonna help us.

626
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,864
What, you mean, he's...?

627
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:49,740
Yes.

628
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,078
- When did he die? Where?
- On the beach, tomorrow.

629
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,541
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?

630
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,209
How should I know that?

631
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,587
Okay.

632
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,090
So this is the first time
we've had this conversation?

633
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,592
We should try this on him?

634
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,719
- What the hell is that?
- It doesn't work.

635
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,182
- Has he had any visions yet?
- Visions of what?

636
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,308
Okay, so there's still time.

637
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,352
- Yes.
- Time? Look, I...I'm sorry.

638
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,353
What...who is this?

639
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,395
Who are you?

640
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,397
I'm Dr. Carter.

641
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,858
Particle Physics Advanced Microbiology.

642
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,070
He's also the only other person
who'll believe what's happening to you.

643
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,781
No one understands Mimic biology, better than him.

644
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,574
He's a top analyst at the Whitehall.

645
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,702
Ye...well, I mean, I was
until I met Rita and now I'm just a...a

646
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,080
"mechanic with psychiatric delusions."

647
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,540
Carter, show him.

648
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,552
Right, the first of all, you're not fighting an army.

649
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,973
You have to think of this as a single organism.

650
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,726
Now these common drones, they act like its claws.

651
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,730
That Alpha's, like the one that you killed,
are much more rare.

652
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:07,067
Yeah, they're like one in six point one eight million, by my guess.

653
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,652
They act as the enemies...

654
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,529
They're like its central nervous system

655
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,905
But this...

656
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,199
is the brain.

657
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,076
It controls them all.

658
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,203
And this is the Omega.

659
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:21,957
And the Omega has the ability to control time.

660
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,085
Whenever an Alpha is killed,

661
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:28,297
an automatic response is triggered.

662
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:31,341
The Omega starts the day over again.

663
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,678
but you see this time it can remember
what's going to happen,

664
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:36,263
just like you do.

665
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,099
It-it knows exactly what we're
going to do before we're gonna do it.

666
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,643
And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.

667
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,107
But if that's true, how did you win in Verdun?

668
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,026
We were allowed to win.

669
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,529
This thing wants us to believe we can win.

670
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,782
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.

671
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,869
Operation Downfall isn't our end game.

672
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,370
It's the enemy's.

673
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,749
The thing you've got to understand is this is a...

674
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:07,628
perfectly evolved world conquering organism.

675
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:11,965
For all we know, there are thousands,
millions, of those asteroids...

676
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,593
floating around the cosmos like a virus.

677
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,013
And it's just waiting to crash land
into a world with just the right conditions.

678
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:22,351
All they need is for the dominant
life form to attack and...

679
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:25,771
And they'll be nothing to stop the Mimics
from conquering the rest of the world.

680
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,566
Unless you change the outcome.

681
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:31,401
Me?

682
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,696
When you killed that Alpha, you inadvertently
entered the enemy's nervous system.

683
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:35,906
Cage.

684
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,660
You've seized control
of the Omega's ability to rest the day.

685
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:42,454
How is that even possible?

686
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,623
Perhaps this organism's only vulnerability...

687
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,918
its...its only vulnerability... is humanity.

688
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,380
Regardless of that, you control the power now.

689
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:54,007
Just as I did in Verdun.

690
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,176
So I'm resetting the day?

691
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,638
Okay.

692
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,140
How do I control it?

693
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,270
You have to die.

694
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:08,397
Every day.

695
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:10,857
Until the Omega is destroyed.

696
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:26,915
Fist of all, that was a terrific presentation.

697
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,792
Terrific.

698
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,712
I know the General.

699
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,338
We should take this to him.

700
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,550
You just tell him everything
you told me, he would know...

701
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,719
I went to see the General, Cage.

702
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,345
Many number of times.

703
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,640
Psyche ward, dissection.

704
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:44,641
Remember?

705
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,688
What are you expecting from me?

706
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,568
Have you seen anything strange?

707
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,321
Is he shitting me?

708
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:58,614
Visions.

709
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,407
Visions! Have you seen any visions like that?

710
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,828
The Omega centers when its losing control of its power.

711
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,289
Even now its mentally searching to find you.

712
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,834
When its close to finding you,
you will start having visions.

713
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,336
You'll start to see that.

714
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:13,962
You'll even see where it is.

715
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,008
And you had these visions?

716
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,301
Yes.

717
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:26,516
But eventually you saw it,
I mean, you actually saw it. Right?

718
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:30,854
Never in the flesh.

719
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,444
So this is all just some...

720
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,404
theory?

721
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,241
You don't know if this thing even exists.

722
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:45,118
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.

723
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,119
I could see it!

724
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,789
I...I just...

725
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:51,667
lost the power before I could get to it.

726
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,795
And by the time we took Verdun,

727
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:57,589
the Omega was gone.

728
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,681
Okay, so all I have to do is wait to have these visions,

729
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:09,142
and then tell you where this Omega thing is?

730
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:10,352
No, Cage.

731
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:12,813
You're gonna get me there,

732
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,023
and I'm gonna kill it.

733
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:17,693
Get you there?

734
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,822
I mean, I'm not even trained for combat.

735
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:38,880
<i>Reload.</i>

736
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:40,591
<i>Reload.</i>

737
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,278
You alright, Cage?

738
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:03,697
I think I broke something.

739
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:04,865
What?

740
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:06,700
My back.

741
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,495
The only thing I can feel are my lips.

742
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:14,541
Now listen carefully.
This is a very important rule.

743
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,376
This is the only rule.

744
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:20,297
You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.

745
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,132
Why?

746
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,092
Last time I was in combat,

747
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,677
I was hit.

748
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,056
I was bleeding out, just not fast enough.

749
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:32,851
I woke up in a field hospital
with three pints of someone else's blood

750
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:33,977
and I was out.

751
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,023
I lost the power, do you understand?

752
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,401
Then you better start over, don't you?

753
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,277
What?

754
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,700
<i>No one knows what happened to Private Cage?</i>

755
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,245
Skinner, you dumb ass,
he was right next to you,

756
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:53,247
you're telling me you don't know
where that slippery son of a bitch went?

757
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:54,706
No, Serge!

758
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:55,916
Alright.

759
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,835
- Let's do another fifty, shall we?
- Oh, no!

760
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,128
And one!

761
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:01,630
No! Wait, wait!

762
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:02,839
My name is Will Cage.

763
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,549
I...we met on the beach.

764
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:05,759
We meet on the beach, tomorrow.

765
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:07,261
I have what you had.

766
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:14,810
Alright, let's go again.

767
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,357
You don't have time to think.

768
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:23,986
Remember, it's now enough knowing
where they're going to be,

769
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,113
you have to know how to kill them.

770
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,869
That's it...hold on! Hold on!

771
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:34,413
Listen! Listen!

772
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,374
Okay, do it.

773
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,294
On your feet, maggot!

774
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:45,424
Stop!

775
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:46,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

776
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:48,969
Stop! Wait!
Wait a second!

777
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,220
Wait a second!

778
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,014
Wait a second!

779
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:53,849
You know, I've been thinking.

780
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,477
I mean, this thing's in my blood.

781
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:01,773
So maybe there's some way I can transfer it to you.

782
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:03,984
I've tried everything,
it doesn't work.

783
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:05,569
And have you...

784
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:08,238
You know?

785
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:12,159
Tried all...all the options?

786
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,243
Oh, you mean sex?

787
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:14,244
Yep, tried it.

788
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:16,330
How many times?

789
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,289
Alright.

790
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,585
Left, left, left, left!

791
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:26,924
Keep your eyes open.

792
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:30,636
Again!

793
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:32,304
Again!

794
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:33,555
Again!

795
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:37,434
Again!

796
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,694
Just wait, wait! I think I'm okay.

797
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:51,573
On your feet, maggot!
Maggot! Maggot!

798
00:49:51,782 --> 00:49:54,076
Now, I'm done being nice to you, maggot! Now move!

799
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:58,080
You okay, Cage?

800
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,831
Oh, yeah! Yeah, I'm good! I'm good!

801
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:01,250
You're leg's broken.

802
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,585
No! I...I can still feel my toes.

803
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:06,630
Oh, come on!

804
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,361
Rita! Rita! What is this?
What are you doing here?

805
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:30,779
Look, who's this guy?

806
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,031
- He's me... before Verdun.
- ... before Verdun.

807
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,241
What...what do you mean? He's...?

808
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:35,242
Yes! Yes!

809
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,410
When did he die? Where?

810
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:37,786
On the beach, tomorrow.

811
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:39,121
I'm Will Cage,
you're Dr. Carter.

812
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:41,999
We've had this conversation before.
You have two fingers behind your back.

813
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,333
I've had the visions.

814
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:44,585
I've seen the Omega.

815
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:53,635
It's... pretty much game over tomorrow,

816
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:55,345
So can we move this along?

817
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:56,680
Okay.

818
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:58,390
Where?

819
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,810
There's a dam,
it's in the mountains.

820
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,811
I saw German writing.

821
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:05,063
Do you think you can work out where that is?

822
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:05,188
Well, I mean there can't be
too many places that fit that description.
Do you think you can work out where that is?

823
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:08,525
Well, I mean there can't be
too many places that fit that description.

824
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:09,818
I'll see what I can do.

825
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,486
Training's over.

826
00:51:11,862 --> 00:51:12,988
I'll see you tomorrow.

827
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,949
- We don't even know where we're going.
- We will, soon enough.

828
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,536
In the mean time, you need to figure out
a way to get us off that beach.

829
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:43,644
What next?
Where are we going?

830
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:45,312
- Yeah...
- Which way? Focus!

831
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:46,021
Which way?

832
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,022
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

833
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:47,940
Okay...

834
00:51:48,065 --> 00:51:48,857
Oh, man!

835
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:50,984
How far do we make it?

836
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:54,780
Well, it's... hard to say.

837
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:57,366
Hold!

838
00:51:57,658 --> 00:51:58,367
Hold!

839
00:51:58,992 --> 00:51:59,952
Okay, go!

840
00:52:01,787 --> 00:52:02,913
Son of a bitch!

841
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,998
- I thought stepping left, ducking.
- Fine.

842
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,124
Just for the record, stepping left...

843
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,210
- Stepping left, ducking right.
- It was pretty specific.

844
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,796
Stepping left, ducking right.

845
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:11,964
Move on.

846
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:16,426
Hold on!

847
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,763
Now remember, across the trench, twelve o'clock,

848
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,889
then look to your right.

849
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:30,023
- You're not being specific, you understand?
- Oh, okay.

850
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:32,609
You need to be specific,
otherwise I'm dead.

851
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:33,610
Rita.

852
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:36,613
Cage!

853
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,867
That takes us up to the top and then the trench.

854
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:43,495
I'm gonna step left, there's gonna be
a Mimic there which I'll kill...

855
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,924
There's an explosion, I'm gonna run
thirty paces to the north west.

856
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:59,052
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench,
and then I'm gonna turn left.

857
00:53:08,604 --> 00:53:10,022
I got something on my face?

858
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:13,358
No!

859
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:22,367
<i>Cage!</i>

860
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,328
<i>We've been looking everywhere for you!</i>

861
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:26,163
Cage!

862
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:29,499
Guys.

863
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,252
Guys can we just...

864
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:34,379
not do this today?

865
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,839
What are you talking about?

866
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:39,259
Farell almost strung us up
by our bullocks for losing track of you!

867
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:42,721
Okay, Skinner.

868
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:43,931
Watch this.

869
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:46,600
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.

870
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,435
- Ready?
- Yeah.

871
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:58,362
I didn't mind the extra push ups.

872
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:09,790
<i>It's a new day, people!</i>

873
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,084
Destiny calls.

874
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:14,753
The world expects only one thing from us:

875
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:15,879
That we will win!

876
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,691
<i>The current situation on the front line
show heavy casualties...</i>

877
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:38,610
<i>It's about time we showed
those things what we're made of. </i>

878
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:41,238
<i>My father flew in the battle of Britain,</i>

879
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:44,074
<i>three years before the yanks came into the war.</i>

880
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:47,744
Couldn't be broken, backbone.

881
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,289
My Uncle George landed
on the beach of Normandy, yeah.

882
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:54,251
In their day, this war
would have been over by now.

883
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,086
What do they want with us anyway?

884
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:58,171
It's obvious, isn't it?
Minerals.

885
00:54:58,297 --> 00:54:59,131
Minerals?

886
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,549
- Yeah, minerals.
- Oxygen, they want.

887
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:01,425
Oxygen?

888
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:01,717
Think about it...

889
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:02,676
What difference does it make?

890
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,637
They're here, they're winning.

891
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,890
And whatever it is, they're gonna get it.

892
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:10,642
Shouldn't you be over there?

893
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,061
I've been over there.

894
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:15,606
More times than anybody.

895
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,152
As a matter of fact,
I'm usually long dead by now.

896
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:24,072
Coward.

897
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:30,495
- What's going on?
- The power's gone.

898
00:56:38,772 --> 00:56:41,400
I found the Omega. I found it.
It has to be here.

899
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,610
Großer Dam, Germany.
This as got to be it.

900
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,695
It fits the description perfectly.

901
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,196
Yes, you found it.

902
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,322
Again.

903
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:51,994
What difference does it make?
Cause we're never gonna get there.

904
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:54,246
No matter what we do,

905
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,541
no matter how carefully we plan,

906
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,127
we can't get off that beach.

907
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,432
You can do this.
You can.

908
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:16,602
You keep coming here everyday
and I'll train you.

909
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:21,148
You already have.

910
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:41,627
I'm waiting, Nance!

911
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:43,587
Five hundred meters and closing fast!

912
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:45,672
What the...?!

913
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:55,724
<i>Reloading.</i>

914
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:08,820
What's next?

915
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:12,282
Straight shot.

916
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:13,575
Up the hill.

917
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:14,826
Okay.

918
00:58:15,786 --> 00:58:16,828
Hey, Serge.

919
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:17,996
The new guy,...

920
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:20,082
what's his name again?

921
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:26,380
We need a vehicle to get further inland.

922
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:27,714
Then what's the problem?

923
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,469
The problem is the ambush waiting for us down there,
they kill before we find a working car.

924
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:34,429
Okay, so what's the current plan?

925
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:37,182
- The two cars I haven't tried are the Minivan...
- Yep.

926
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:38,475
- and the green SUV.
- Okay.

927
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:42,312
I'll head for the SUV, draw the Mimics to me.
You go for the Minivan.

928
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:44,648
You get it started, just go, take off.

929
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:46,483
- Do not wait for me.
- Okay.

930
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,029
Well...just don't forget to disconnect
the caravan before you take off.

931
00:58:51,154 --> 00:58:52,406
You are going to be in a hurry,

932
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:54,366
you don't want any dead weight.

933
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:20,601
Come on.

934
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:36,867
Come on, Cage!

935
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:44,333
Can't see!

936
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:47,586
Did you...?

937
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,680
<i>Stay where you are, remain calm.</i>

938
00:59:59,306 --> 01:00:03,018
<i> If you are in a vehicle,
please lock the doors and stay inside.</i>

939
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,654
<i>The enemy has reached London.</i>

940
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:14,321
<i> Repeat.</i>

941
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,448
<i>London is under attack.</i>

942
01:00:21,453 --> 01:00:22,537
That's good driving.

943
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:24,831
I forgot to unhook the trailer.

944
01:01:10,669 --> 01:01:12,296
You don't talk much.

945
01:01:13,422 --> 01:01:14,506
Not a fan.

946
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:15,841
Of talking?

947
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,135
Not a fan of talking, no.

948
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:21,888
You know, you eventually do talk to me.

949
01:01:24,308 --> 01:01:27,728
It's usually around Lyon, you tell me
about the time you went there with your family.

950
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:29,813
Your brother got lost.

951
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:33,775
I've never been to Lyon.

952
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,069
You tell me your middle name.

953
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:38,697
Peyton.

954
01:01:41,074 --> 01:01:42,284
That's not my middle name.

955
01:01:47,915 --> 01:01:50,042
You found your brother in the arcade, by the way.

956
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:54,796
Well maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.

957
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:55,839
But you do talk to me.

958
01:01:56,256 --> 01:01:58,216
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.

959
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,094
And if you knew what was good for you,
you wouldn't want to get to know me either.

960
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:03,597
It's the only way you make it through this thing.

961
01:02:04,932 --> 01:02:06,892
What about Hendricks, you get to know him?

962
01:02:07,768 --> 01:02:08,894
How do you know that name?

963
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:10,395
You mention him.

964
01:02:10,896 --> 01:02:12,022
That's not possible.

965
01:02:12,356 --> 01:02:14,316
- Then how do I know his name?
- When did I mention him?

966
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:15,317
Under what circumstance?

967
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:19,529
Is he why you won't talk to me?

968
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:25,285
Don't ever mention his name again.

969
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:27,996
Why...

970
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:28,997
- are you in love with him?
- He's dead!

971
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:34,962
And I watched him die three hundred times,

972
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:38,840
and I remember... every detail,
I remember everything.

973
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:41,009
So I don't need to talk about it.

974
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:47,432
I'm sorry.

975
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:48,892
It's just war.

976
01:03:52,497 --> 01:03:54,541
There's nothing here, keep going.

977
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,483
We have to find the keys.

978
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,110
Let's just siphon the gas.

979
01:04:22,236 --> 01:04:24,279
And why drive when we can fly?

980
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:26,114
In that thing?

981
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,075
Let me guess, you're afraid of heights.

982
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,743
I'm afraid of crashing.

983
01:04:30,077 --> 01:04:31,578
I'm not at all ashamed to admit it.

984
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:33,914
You'll be fine, Cage.
You'll learn.

985
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:37,876
- What is it?
-  It's nothing, I'm fine.

986
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:40,254
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

987
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:41,546
Rita.

988
01:04:45,676 --> 01:04:46,593
Let me see.

989
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,032
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.

990
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:10,826
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

991
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:13,495
You know the heli's full of fuel,

992
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:15,205
I found a hose.

993
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:17,332
We're flying, Cage.

994
01:05:21,753 --> 01:05:24,464
Well, let's just say we find keys, you know?

995
01:05:25,257 --> 01:05:26,842
Get that helicopter started.

996
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:29,428
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.

997
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:31,638
And it's gonna be dark in a few hours.

998
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:36,810
Might be better just going back to the farmhouse,

999
01:05:37,185 --> 01:05:41,106
seeing what we could salvage.
You know, spend the night there.

1000
01:05:41,648 --> 01:05:42,691
Come back here in the morning.

1001
01:05:42,774 --> 01:05:45,652
And curl up by the fire
and open a bottle of wine?

1002
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,033
We should just reset.

1003
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,243
- It's a dead end.
- Hey, hold...just...

1004
01:05:53,368 --> 01:05:54,453
If it's all the same to you,

1005
01:05:54,703 --> 01:05:57,331
I'm tired, I'm in pain.
I'd rather just start fresh.

1006
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:00,000
I'll tell you what, take a few minutes.
Coffee's ready.

1007
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:02,210
I'll look around for the keys, that's productive.

1008
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:03,420
Ten minutes.

1009
01:06:03,712 --> 01:06:04,171
Okay.

1010
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:05,631
And then I'm killing you.

1011
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:07,382
Fine.

1012
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:12,679
I can't believe you found coffee.

1013
01:06:15,057 --> 01:06:15,974
Thank you.

1014
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:20,729
Oh. Sugar, right?

1015
01:06:21,188 --> 01:06:21,813
Yeah.

1016
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:28,570
Thank you.

1017
01:06:28,779 --> 01:06:29,780
Hold on, three.

1018
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:30,989
You like three.

1019
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:46,964
There's a shirt over there,
it should be your size.

1020
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:57,349
How many times have we been here?

1021
01:07:03,897 --> 01:07:05,065
How many times?

1022
01:07:06,275 --> 01:07:07,484
Where are the keys?

1023
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:10,445
- Where are the Goddamn keys?
-  Okay.

1024
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:15,534
You can fly it, can't you?

1025
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:16,910
No. Well...yes.

1026
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:19,871
I mean, I can take off,
I'm still working on my landing.

1027
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,832
What are we still doing here?
You're wasting time!

1028
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:22,791
Rita.

1029
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,293
You start that engine, you die!

1030
01:07:28,463 --> 01:07:29,923
This is as far as you go.

1031
01:07:30,382 --> 01:07:31,717
No matter what I do.

1032
01:07:32,926 --> 01:07:34,678
This is as far as you ever make it.

1033
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,856
There's a Mimic buried twenty yards away.

1034
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:48,233
It attacks when you start the engine.

1035
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,987
Get your weapon
and get in the helicopter, Cage.

1036
01:07:52,321 --> 01:07:54,114
There's more than a field battle there.

1037
01:07:56,742 --> 01:07:58,201
Only one of us ever makes it.

1038
01:07:58,410 --> 01:07:58,911
Get in.

1039
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,914
The only thing we haven't tried is a version
where you walk away, just go back to the farmhouse.

1040
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:05,375
There's food, you wait there until I get back.

1041
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,501
You'll be safe.

1042
01:08:06,627 --> 01:08:08,795
I'm a soldier,
I volunteered.

1043
01:08:08,837 --> 01:08:09,838
I'm not walking away.

1044
01:08:09,963 --> 01:08:11,089
You die here!

1045
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:12,299
Right here!

1046
01:08:14,718 --> 01:08:15,844
I...can't save you.

1047
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,722
And if I go on and kill the Omega.

1048
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:19,890
You're dead.

1049
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:21,099
Forever.

1050
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:23,435
Why does it matter what happens to me?

1051
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,484
I wish I didn't know you.

1052
01:08:33,028 --> 01:08:33,987
But I do.

1053
01:10:05,454 --> 01:10:07,080
My middle name...

1054
01:10:08,332 --> 01:10:09,333
is Rose.

1055
01:10:29,895 --> 01:10:31,521
On your feet, maggot!

1056
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:44,993
<i>Looks there's hope for your, Private. </i>

1057
01:10:45,118 --> 01:10:47,412
<i>Hope in the form of glorious combat.</i>

1058
01:10:48,247 --> 01:10:49,623
<i>Battle is the great redeemer.</i>

1059
01:10:49,873 --> 01:10:52,000
<i>the fire and crucible
in which the only true heroes are forged. </i>

1060
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,001
<i>The one place...</i>

1061
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:05,764
Yes?

1062
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:08,684
Who said you could talk to me?

1063
01:11:12,646 --> 01:11:14,481
Do I have something on my face, soldier?

1064
01:11:18,193 --> 01:11:19,736
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sergeant.

1065
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:44,469
Alright, man. Let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suite up.

1066
01:11:47,556 --> 01:11:48,724
Where's your helmet?

1067
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:51,810
I'm not gonna wear one.

1068
01:11:52,269 --> 01:11:53,520
It's a distraction.

1069
01:11:56,189 --> 01:11:56,940
Have you been drinking?

1070
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:59,610
I need three more clips of five-five-six,

1071
01:11:59,651 --> 01:12:02,112
eight grenades and an extra battery.

1072
01:12:06,283 --> 01:12:07,200
Get it!

1073
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:15,083
Oy!

1074
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,251
Oy, mate!

1075
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:19,087
I think there's something wrong with your suite!

1076
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:22,007
There's a dead guy in it.

1077
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:24,051
<i>Yeah!</i>

1078
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:24,968
Wooh-hoo! We made it!

1079
01:12:24,968 --> 01:12:27,304
Thank God, we made it!
Yeah...!

1080
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:30,928
Finish it!

1081
01:15:25,566 --> 01:15:27,150
It isn't there.

1082
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,860
What do you mean
the Omega isn't there?

1083
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,195
My guess is it never was.

1084
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:31,613
They knew we were coming.

1085
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,157
They ambushed us.
The visions were a trap.

1086
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:38,203
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.

1087
01:15:39,955 --> 01:15:41,498
It could have killed me, but it didn't.

1088
01:15:41,873 --> 01:15:42,791
It's after my blood.

1089
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,543
So they know who you are, they...

1090
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:47,170
They want their power back.

1091
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,880
And they're gonna get it one way or another,

1092
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,799
unless we find the Omega.

1093
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:53,093
There...there isn't any other way, we're finished!

1094
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,887
No, we're not finished.

1095
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,680
It doesn't work.
I can't get it to work...

1096
01:15:56,722 --> 01:16:00,392
- You built a prototype at Whitehall.
- Yes! And I got fired for it, thank you very much.

1097
01:16:01,226 --> 01:16:02,895
- What is this thing, anyway?
- It's a transponder.

1098
01:16:02,895 --> 01:16:06,523
You stick it into the Alpha and it taps
into the wavelength connecting it to the Omega.

1099
01:16:06,523 --> 01:16:08,025
That's the idea anyway.

1100
01:16:08,358 --> 01:16:11,236
But I can't get it to work,
not with the equipment I have on hand.

1101
01:16:13,864 --> 01:16:15,073
How do we get you what you need?

1102
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:16,533
Well, that's the thing. I mean,...

1103
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:19,536
when I was at Whitehall I built one,
I was even ready to test it,

1104
01:16:19,786 --> 01:16:21,204
but when I told my superiors about it,

1105
01:16:21,204 --> 01:16:22,205
well I lost my job.

1106
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:23,916
They thought he was crazy.

1107
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:25,918
So all we need to do is go to Whitehall.

1108
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,921
He'd be arrested ten feet from the front doors.

1109
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:30,672
Psyche ward dissection, remember?

1110
01:16:31,798 --> 01:16:32,966
Hey, hey, hey! Aren't you forgetting something?

1111
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:35,969
The transponder requires
a live Alpha to make it work.

1112
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:37,429
We don't need one.

1113
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:39,681
We got the next best thing.

1114
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,896
When the Chinese delegation comes out,
you pick up the pace.

1115
01:16:48,232 --> 01:16:50,901
There's a guy with a yellow arm band
that always recognizes you.

1116
01:16:51,026 --> 01:16:53,654
So just keep your head down
and stay to my right.

1117
01:17:00,452 --> 01:17:02,037
Nicely done.

1118
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,374
One.

1119
01:17:05,582 --> 01:17:06,291
Two.

1120
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,501
Hold.

1121
01:17:22,015 --> 01:17:22,683
Turn.

1122
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:25,644
Okay, keep walking.
Just go straight ahead.

1123
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:28,772
<i> Robinson</i>

1124
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:31,108
I've asked not to be disturbed.

1125
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:32,317
This had better be critical.

1126
01:17:32,568 --> 01:17:33,652
Fate of mankind.

1127
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:34,861
Critical enough?

1128
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:36,905
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

1129
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:38,740
I've had more than my share of that.

1130
01:17:39,616 --> 01:17:41,660
Sit down, General,
and stay away from your desk.

1131
01:17:42,619 --> 01:17:44,746
I'd take her very seriously if I were you.

1132
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,208
I have to hand it to you, Major.

1133
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:51,795
when you left this office today,
I never imagined you'd be back,

1134
01:17:51,795 --> 01:17:53,922
let alone with my most decorated soldier.

1135
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,424
I'm here to tell you a story, General.

1136
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:58,844
and at first it's gonna sound ridiculous,
but the longer I talk the more rational,

1137
01:17:58,844 --> 01:17:59,720
it's going to appear.

1138
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,221
Tell him you'll call back.

1139
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:02,264
Tell who?

1140
01:18:02,472 --> 01:18:04,266
Major General Beaumont calling from Halifax,

1141
01:18:04,266 --> 01:18:05,475
His plane's just been delayed.

1142
01:18:05,684 --> 01:18:06,310
Bad weather.

1143
01:18:07,144 --> 01:18:07,769
Yes?

1144
01:18:11,398 --> 01:18:13,066
Thank you, Beaumont.
I'll call you back.

1145
01:18:15,903 --> 01:18:17,321
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.

1146
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:21,158
I'm dead within five minutes of landing on that beach,
along with every other soldier you are sending.

1147
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:23,869
And that's because
the enemy knows we're coming.

1148
01:18:24,286 --> 01:18:25,579
Now how do I know this?

1149
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:27,289
Before I died I killed a Mimic,

1150
01:18:27,289 --> 01:18:28,290
only this one was different.

1151
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:30,667
It passed something
onto me in my blood.

1152
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:33,337
Now I relive the same day
over and over again.

1153
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:34,755
Just like they do.

1154
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,174
Just like Sergeant Vrataski at Verdun.

1155
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:39,384
Tell your secretary everything's fine.

1156
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:41,678
I beg your pardon?

1157
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:47,142
Oh, I'm sorry, General.
I thought you were alone.

1158
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:47,976
It's fine.

1159
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:50,354
She typed up those orders for you to authorize,

1160
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:52,898
but she left out the word
eferring to the fuel duct in Greenwich.

1161
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:56,443
Your name is Iris.

1162
01:18:56,693 --> 01:18:58,237
You're birthday is September 17th.

1163
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,574
The General probably pulled some
strings stationed your only son in Australia,

1164
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:04,284
as far from the war as possible.

1165
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:07,120
Tell the General his dinner's been canceled,
the call came in just now.

1166
01:19:09,331 --> 01:19:10,916
Your dinner was canceled.

1167
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,418
You forgot the fuel duct.

1168
01:19:14,253 --> 01:19:16,213
Thank you, Iris.
That will be all.

1169
01:19:24,012 --> 01:19:26,473
- Cage, Let's go.
- Rita.

1170
01:19:26,598 --> 01:19:27,849
- Let me just...
- What are you doing?

1171
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,142
Please, don't shoot him yet.

1172
01:19:29,893 --> 01:19:31,270
Okay? Just...

1173
01:19:35,607 --> 01:19:36,275
General.

1174
01:19:36,608 --> 01:19:39,069
Th...this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

1175
01:19:39,069 --> 01:19:42,406
Cause that's...because you're...you're stubborn.

1176
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:46,118
You won't believe me when I tell you
that Dr. Carter was right,

1177
01:19:46,118 --> 01:19:49,037
That the enemy can manipulate time.

1178
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:50,205
The invasion will fail,

1179
01:19:50,414 --> 01:19:52,958
no matter how many bodies you throw at it.

1180
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,793
And the only way to win this war,

1181
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:57,838
is by finding this power source within the cord

1182
01:19:57,838 --> 01:19:58,755
and killing it.

1183
01:19:58,755 --> 01:20:00,716
And the only means of finding it

1184
01:20:00,882 --> 01:20:02,426
is in that safe right there.

1185
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:06,972
No matter how many times
that we have this conversation,

1186
01:20:07,222 --> 01:20:10,309
you refuse to accept that the enemy
breaks through to London tomorrow,

1187
01:20:10,434 --> 01:20:11,685
and we lose.

1188
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:12,895
We lose everything.

1189
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:22,404
Let's say for the moment,

1190
01:20:23,822 --> 01:20:25,616
that I can't rationally explain...

1191
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,827
your impressive parlor tricks.

1192
01:20:31,288 --> 01:20:33,332
Dr. Carter told me...

1193
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:36,209
this device requires a live Mimic to work.

1194
01:20:36,418 --> 01:20:37,419
What use is it to you?

1195
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,464
- That's my concern.
- On the contrary.

1196
01:20:40,881 --> 01:20:43,175
According to you, this concerns the whole world.

1197
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,511
Well what would you do if you believed
everything I just told you?

1198
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:50,224
- I would locate this...
- Omega.

1199
01:20:50,349 --> 01:20:51,683
And bomb it out of existence.

1200
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:53,560
You're not mentally equipped
to fight this thing,

1201
01:20:53,685 --> 01:20:54,728
and you never will be.

1202
01:21:12,329 --> 01:21:13,914
What do we do now?

1203
01:21:14,831 --> 01:21:16,541
I don't know.
We've never gotten this far.

1204
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:24,633
That was easy.

1205
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:26,134
Stop! Stop right there!

1206
01:21:26,343 --> 01:21:27,177
Don't move!

1207
01:21:27,469 --> 01:21:28,428
Nobody move!

1208
01:21:30,389 --> 01:21:31,098
Drop it!

1209
01:21:40,148 --> 01:21:41,233
How am I supposed to do this?

1210
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:42,234
Stick it in your leg!

1211
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:43,652
Do it!

1212
01:22:02,212 --> 01:22:03,505
<i>Cage, what happened?</i>

1213
01:22:04,715 --> 01:22:05,674
<i>Talk to me!</i>

1214
01:22:06,383 --> 01:22:08,802
<i> I feel it, it...it's taking me there.</i>

1215
01:22:09,553 --> 01:22:10,762
<i>What do you see?</i>

1216
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:14,016
<i>It's...it's the Louvre.</i>

1217
01:22:14,141 --> 01:22:15,392
<i>Where? Where else?</i>

1218
01:22:16,059 --> 01:22:18,103
<i>I'm inside now. It's flooded.</i>

1219
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:22,482
<i>I'm going down a garage,
a garage underneath the museum.</i>

1220
01:22:22,774 --> 01:22:24,234
<i<The Omega, do you see it?

1221
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:32,159
It's in Paris!

1222
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:50,719
Rita!

1223
01:23:32,553 --> 01:23:34,054
What have you done?

1224
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:35,973
What have you done?

1225
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:40,686
You'll be fine.
You just needed blood.

1226
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:43,272
You don't know what you've just done.

1227
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:45,274
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

1228
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:46,858
I was with someone.

1229
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:50,654
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?

1230
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:52,614
Rita Vrataski?

1231
01:23:53,282 --> 01:23:54,074
Please.

1232
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:56,118
Just tell me that.

1233
01:23:58,954 --> 01:24:00,080
Please tell me.

1234
01:24:01,206 --> 01:24:01,957
I'm sorry.

1235
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,535
I was out of those things in three minutes flat, Cage.

1236
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:42,452
What's wrong with you?

1237
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:45,622
I thought you were dead.

1238
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:47,249
Not yet.

1239
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:53,505
I'm sorry, Cage.

1240
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:54,715
No! Wait, wait, wait!

1241
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,425
I'm out! I'm out!

1242
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,593
They gave me blood!

1243
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,140
I lost the power.

1244
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,310
I feel it.

1245
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:09,480
I can't reset the day anymore.

1246
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,954
We have to kill the Omega,

1247
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:27,998
before the invasion starts.

1248
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,626
That gives us less than three hours.

1249
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,254
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.

1250
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,840
We need more soldiers too.

1251
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,551
No one's crazy enough to follow us to Paris.

1252
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,392
Cage!

1253
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:48,560
Cage!

1254
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:49,520
Guys!

1255
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,395
We've been looking everywhere for you!

1256
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:51,855
Just listen...

1257
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,566
Farell almost strung us up by our bullocks
for losing track of you!

1258
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:55,818
Just listen.

1259
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,903
But you're gonna want to hear this story.

1260
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:02,241
Now it's gonna sound ridiculous at first,
but the longer I talk the more rational it's going to appear.

1261
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:03,325
Yeah?!

1262
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,244
He named the school I went to,

1263
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,622
and then he tells me
my second grade teacher

1264
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,082
was called Miss Pollyhook.

1265
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,251
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom,
made his wet his pants.

1266
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,044
Shut up!

1267
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:18,006
Look, I'm telling you, he know everything...

1268
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:19,842
about all of us.

1269
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:20,759
Bullshit.

1270
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,177
Yeah?

1271
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,847
He says your name ain't really Ford.

1272
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,349
He says Ford was your friend,

1273
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,268
died in combat on his first day.

1274
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:32,229
You took his place,
send your checks to his family.

1275
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:34,565
You slippery bitch.

1276
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,692
Cage says the enemy knows us too.

1277
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,402
They're waiting for us on the beach,

1278
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:39,611
and we all die.

1279
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,196
The whole invasion is a slaughter.

1280
01:26:58,406 --> 01:27:00,950
But it means coming with me, right now.

1281
01:27:01,368 --> 01:27:02,410
Listen, pal.

1282
01:27:02,619 --> 01:27:05,330
I don't really care
what you think you know about us.

1283
01:27:05,747 --> 01:27:06,956
We just met you.

1284
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,877
Come on, why would we
follow him into combat?

1285
01:27:15,966 --> 01:27:17,467
I don't expect you to follow me.

1286
01:27:18,343 --> 01:27:19,844
I expect you to follow her.

1287
01:27:24,391 --> 01:27:25,517
That's the full metal bi...

1288
01:27:25,517 --> 01:27:26,184
J Squad.

1289
01:27:27,686 --> 01:27:28,937
This is Rita Vrataski.

1290
01:27:29,854 --> 01:27:30,689
Otherwise known as...

1291
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:31,731
Yeah, yeah.

1292
01:27:32,607 --> 01:27:34,109
The Angel of Verdun.

1293
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:46,121
Okay.

1294
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:56,923
<i>It's a new day, people!</i>

1295
01:27:57,424 --> 01:27:58,550
Destiny calls.

1296
01:27:59,092 --> 01:28:01,428
The world expects only one thing from us:

1297
01:28:01,428 --> 01:28:02,470
That we will win!

1298
01:28:02,637 --> 01:28:04,597
Rest assured they enemy will thank you

1299
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:06,308
for not giving a hundred percent today

1300
01:28:06,683 --> 01:28:07,517
Squad!

1301
01:28:10,895 --> 01:28:12,022
Where's J Squad?

1302
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:31,583
Right, okay.

1303
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:34,127
So this Omega, it controls time?

1304
01:28:34,336 --> 01:28:36,588
Exploding it into pieces and sending
its bullocks back to where it came from!

1305
01:28:36,796 --> 01:28:37,797
And then we go home!

1306
01:28:38,798 --> 01:28:40,091
Right, it's guarded by an Alpha...

1307
01:28:40,133 --> 01:28:41,760
Just kill it, okay?

1308
01:28:42,302 --> 01:28:43,219
No!

1309
01:28:43,386 --> 01:28:45,013
You head what Cage said.

1310
01:28:45,055 --> 01:28:46,264
Do not kill an Alpha.

1311
01:28:46,473 --> 01:28:48,892
If we kill an Alpha, the Omega
will reset this whole day.

1312
01:28:49,893 --> 01:28:51,561
We'll never even remember
we had this conversation.

1313
01:28:51,853 --> 01:28:52,854
They're gonna know we're coming.

1314
01:28:52,896 --> 01:28:55,982
So what am I supposed to do
if one of those Alpha's is about to kill me?

1315
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:57,609
Take a hit for the team.

1316
01:29:01,529 --> 01:29:02,739
When we're on the ground,

1317
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:05,367
there's not gonna be much time
before they know we're there.

1318
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:08,703
We're gonna need eyes up here.

1319
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:11,873
I'm going in, Cage.

1320
01:29:23,426 --> 01:29:24,844
Thirty seconds, still contact.

1321
01:29:41,903 --> 01:29:42,654
Kimmel.

1322
01:29:42,862 --> 01:29:43,863
No!

1323
01:29:52,372 --> 01:29:53,915
Ford! Let's go!

1324
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:54,791
Cage!

1325
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:57,002
We gotta go!

1326
01:29:57,002 --> 01:29:58,128
Drop!

1327
01:29:57,585 --> 01:29:59,671
Cage, they know we're coming in!

1328
01:29:59,963 --> 01:30:00,630
Drop!

1329
01:30:00,839 --> 01:30:01,840
Drop!

1330
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:03,049
Drop!

1331
01:30:05,051 --> 01:30:05,677
Drop!

1332
01:30:05,885 --> 01:30:06,886
You're not hooked in!

1333
01:32:25,358 --> 01:32:26,735
What took you so long?

1334
01:32:29,654 --> 01:32:30,864
Where are the others?

1335
01:32:35,744 --> 01:32:36,870
<i>Kita kehabisan amunisi.</i>

1336
01:32:36,995 --> 01:32:38,496
<i>We're low on ammo,
I've got one claymine.</i>

1337
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:39,956
<i>Ford, you're out.</i>

1338
01:32:40,081 --> 01:32:42,917
<i>Griff has only got half a magazine left
and he can hardly move.</i>

1339
01:32:43,209 --> 01:32:44,711
I thought you could see the future?

1340
01:32:44,836 --> 01:32:46,212
I haven't lived this day.

1341
01:32:47,547 --> 01:32:48,840
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1342
01:32:49,341 --> 01:32:50,759
It doesn't matter.

1343
01:32:51,092 --> 01:32:52,761
What matters is we finish this.

1344
01:32:53,595 --> 01:32:54,596
With what?

1345
01:32:55,639 --> 01:32:58,683
I mean, Griff can't even walk.
We're three men down.

1346
01:32:58,892 --> 01:32:59,517
Come on!

1347
01:32:59,517 --> 01:33:01,936
Look, we're running out of time.
Collect your ammo.

1348
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,689
There must be a thousand Mimics
between us and that pyramid.

1349
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:07,359
So what are we gonna do?
Just walk up to the front door, is that it?

1350
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,943
If we stay here, we die.

1351
01:33:09,069 --> 01:33:10,028
Yeah?

1352
01:33:10,236 --> 01:33:11,237
We'll never get through.

1353
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:12,989
We could.

1354
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:16,159
In that.

1355
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:19,412
That ship will never fly.

1356
01:33:20,622 --> 01:33:21,998
It doesn't need to fly.

1357
01:33:22,749 --> 01:33:25,085
It just needs to get us across there,

1358
01:33:25,293 --> 01:33:26,294
with speed.

1359
01:33:26,753 --> 01:33:30,465
If the engines are still running,
we could steer with the power levers.

1360
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:32,676
Skinner.

1361
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,469
Clear a path.

1362
01:33:40,183 --> 01:33:41,810
- Try it again now.
- No, it's not reading.

1363
01:33:42,018 --> 01:33:43,186
Condition lever low.

1364
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:51,695
Electrical power on.

1365
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:55,740
Griff!

1366
01:33:57,075 --> 01:33:58,535
We gotta go!
Come on!

1367
01:34:01,746 --> 01:34:03,623
I'm not gonna be any good in there, mate.

1368
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:06,251
Let me buy you some time.

1369
01:34:11,589 --> 01:34:12,382
The power's on.

1370
01:34:13,591 --> 01:34:14,592
This is gonna work.

1371
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:15,802
Hey!

1372
01:34:16,636 --> 01:34:18,805
Hey, come on, man!
We gotta go!

1373
01:34:19,347 --> 01:34:20,682
Don't wait for us!

1374
01:34:21,016 --> 01:34:23,143
Skinner, Griff, come on!

1375
01:34:24,394 --> 01:34:26,896
- We're good to go, where are they?
- Where's Skinner and Griff?

1376
01:34:27,522 --> 01:34:28,606
They're not coming!

1377
01:34:42,162 --> 01:34:44,414
Go, brother. You gotta go, man.

1378
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,167
I'll see you in the next life.

1379
01:34:52,297 --> 01:34:53,256
Bullocks!

1380
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:57,636
Move over! Move over!

1381
01:34:59,387 --> 01:35:00,680
We gotta go!

1382
01:35:00,972 --> 01:35:02,515
No, we gotta go now!

1383
01:35:06,144 --> 01:35:07,437
They're coming, Cage.

1384
01:35:14,986 --> 01:35:16,613
Die you bastards!

1385
01:35:16,863 --> 01:35:17,906
Die!

1386
01:35:18,198 --> 01:35:19,115
<i>Reload</i>

1387
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:20,533
<i>Reload</i>

1388
01:35:21,326 --> 01:35:22,077
<i>Reload</i>

1389
01:35:34,172 --> 01:35:35,715
We've got incoming!

1390
01:35:44,891 --> 01:35:46,518
Come on!

1391
01:35:54,067 --> 01:35:54,818
<i>Cage!</i>

1392
01:36:06,621 --> 01:36:08,123
You have to take over!

1393
01:37:01,092 --> 01:37:02,135
Rita!

1394
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,847
Push it! Push it!

1395
01:37:43,885 --> 01:37:45,178
We've been through worse.

1396
01:38:24,718 --> 01:38:25,885
Okay.

1397
01:38:27,637 --> 01:38:28,388
It's there.

1398
01:38:30,056 --> 01:38:31,099
In the water, there.

1399
01:38:58,668 --> 01:39:00,295
That's an Alpha.

1400
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:03,006
I'm gonna draw that thing away.

1401
01:39:04,257 --> 01:39:05,675
You kill the Omega.

1402
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,843
No.

1403
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:10,138
You won't make it ten feet
before that thing kills you, Cage.

1404
01:39:10,347 --> 01:39:11,139
I can do it.

1405
01:39:11,264 --> 01:39:12,182
Take the grenades.

1406
01:39:12,182 --> 01:39:13,141
I can do it.

1407
01:39:13,892 --> 01:39:14,893
Listen to me.

1408
01:39:15,018 --> 01:39:16,102
Listen to me.

1409
01:39:16,686 --> 01:39:19,314
Neither one of us is getting out of here.

1410
01:39:42,587 --> 01:39:43,588
Thank you.

1411
01:39:45,006 --> 01:39:47,133
For getting me this far.

1412
01:39:52,138 --> 01:39:53,598
You're a good man, Cage.

1413
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,144
I wish I had the chance to know you better.

1414
01:43:27,812 --> 01:43:29,356
Welcome to London, Major.

1415
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:31,149
I'm Corporal Montgomery,

1416
01:43:31,274 --> 01:43:33,568
the liaison to General Brigham's press office.

1417
01:43:34,486 --> 01:43:35,654
Very good to have you.

1418
01:43:37,072 --> 01:43:38,490
Have you heard the news?

1419
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:49,709
<i>Just before sunrise this morning,</i>

1420
01:43:50,335 --> 01:43:53,171
<i>a large surge of energy
was detected in Paris.</i>

1421
01:43:53,672 --> 01:43:56,508
<i>We do not know exactly what this signifies,</i>

1422
01:43:57,258 --> 01:44:01,930
<i>but the result appears to be a total collapse
of the enemy's capacity to fight.</i>

1423
01:44:03,098 --> 01:44:06,101
<i>Russian and Chinese troops
are now moving across Europe.</i>

1424
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:07,769
<i>without resistance.</i>

1425
01:44:09,104 --> 01:44:11,606
<i>Tomorrow we advance on the Western front.</i>

1426
01:44:12,065 --> 01:44:15,568
<i>We believe we are marching
to claim a victory for ourselves</i>

1427
01:44:16,277 --> 01:44:17,612
<i>for our loved ones,</i>

1428
01:44:17,988 --> 01:44:19,406
<i>for our countrymen,</i>

1429
01:44:19,698 --> 01:44:21,157
<i>for the entire human race.</i>

1430
01:44:21,658 --> 01:44:23,076
<i>What are you?</i>

1431
01:44:23,201 --> 01:44:24,077
I'm a warrior!

1432
01:44:24,202 --> 01:44:25,328
What do warriors do?

1433
01:44:25,453 --> 01:44:25,870
Kill!

1434
01:44:25,996 --> 01:44:26,830
What are you gonna do?

1435
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,497
Kill!

1436
01:44:27,539 --> 01:44:29,499
You haven't been in twenty battles, Ford.

1437
01:44:29,499 --> 01:44:30,500
I have too!

1438
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,752
You're gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach tomorrow, Ford.

1439
01:44:32,877 --> 01:44:36,172
How about you two get yourselves
a nice hot cup of shut the hell up?

1440
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:37,966
You funny, girl.

1441
01:44:37,966 --> 01:44:40,260
But I bet you I set
some kind of record tomorrow.

1442
01:44:40,468 --> 01:44:41,970
Fastest time moving backwards for...

1443
01:44:42,095 --> 01:44:44,097
slipping in your own shit!

1444
01:44:47,183 --> 01:44:48,810
<i>Who are you standing for??</i>

1445
01:44:48,852 --> 01:44:50,020
<i>A warrior!</i>

1446
01:44:50,061 --> 01:44:51,104
<i>What do warriors do?</i>

1447
01:44:51,187 --> 01:44:51,855
<i>Kill!</i>

1448
01:44:54,316 --> 01:44:55,233
Attention!

1449
01:45:35,565 --> 01:45:36,566
Yes?

1450
01:45:37,817 --> 01:45:38,610
What do you want?

1451
