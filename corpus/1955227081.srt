[Music playing]

2
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,228
I used to work in a
video store in Baltimore...

3
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,397
And then I happened to
come across the Troma

4
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:32,200
Web page, which I've been a big
fan of for many, many years.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,468
I drove seven hours to
get here from Connecticut.

6
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,504
I got here, they
started me working.

7
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:40,241
I'll go back to selling
shoes when the movie's over.

8
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,676
Kevin, you're from
a faraway land.

9
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,477
Yes.

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,678
Where'd you come from?

11
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,513
England.

12
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,514
I'm from Sweden.

13
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:47,315
Really?

14
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,582
Yeah.

15
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:52,786
And how does this differ
from movies in Germany?

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,722
Actually that's my first time
working on a movie, though.

17
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:55,789
I can't really tell.

18
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,064
[Yelling]

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,407
So we have this church?

20
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,542
Yeah.

21
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,745
The downstairs, with a
stage and an auditorium.

22
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,548
Lots of little rooms to
do costumes and effects.

23
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,050
What's the best thing
about this location?

24
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,984
The space.

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,952
It's huge.

26
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:25,753
It's really great.

27
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,261
Arbie!

28
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,496
You're the best darn
humper in school!

29
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,236
Choke it, choke it.

30
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,838
What the hell's
going on in here?

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,639
Oh!

32
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,545
I'm going home!

33
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,482
Wendy, wait-come back!

34
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,649
Did that go well?

35
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,450
Yeah.

36
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,823
Kinky girl.

37
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,325
Robin Watkins.

38
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,260
Joshua Olatunde.

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,261

Rose Ghavami.

43
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,968
I was possessed by a
chicken monster today.

44
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,672
Maybe three or four of them.

45
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,974
It looks so sweat shop when
everyone's sewing at once.

46
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,444
I know.

47
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,445
Thumbs up.

48
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,318
Ow!

49
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,992
[Inaudible] didn't work.

50
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,194
Gabe, our producer.

51
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,895
What, are you running
some kind of school here?

52
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,831
Well, I want them
down to five minutes

53
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,933
For each chicken zombie.

54
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,236
If we want 80 or
200 chicken zombies,

55
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,570
We've got to have speed.

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,871
Speed and quality.

57
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,241
Speed over quality maybe.

58
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,676
So this is a sweatshop
zombie school.

59
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,378
What time is it now?

60
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,647
It's late, it's maybe
1:00 in the morning.

61
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,914
What's the date?

62
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,717
The date, I have no idea.

63
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,654
I don't know what day
of the week it is.

64
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:10,324
I can't believe I left Arbie
for someone as horrible as you.

65
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,259
Oh, Arbie.

66
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,293
I was such a fool to leave you.

67
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,158
I'm trying to fucking act!

68
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:45,959
Cut it off!

69
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,433
I just want to get this
fucking shit over with.

72
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,888
I think day will go OK.

73
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,558
Just a lot of dialog, right?

74
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,927
Small effects.

75
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,129
A little dialog.

76
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,163
The acting's good.

77
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,166
The camera crew is here.

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,136
The set looks good.

79
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,272
The walkie talkies seem to work.

80
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,074
Hopefully all the
props are here today.

81
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,379
How do you feel about it?

82
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,147
I think it's going to be good.

83
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,415
A little worried.

84
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,816
Lloyd's not here yet.

85
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,552
He said we can feel
free to start without him

86
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,353
If we're ready.

87
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,554
Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

88
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:47,355
Yeah?

89
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,357
Yeah, that's fine.

90
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,459
Yeah, he likes that.

91
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,027
It's a lot of metal stuff.

92
00:04:54,127 --> 00:05:00,033
Metal on metal, should not
make any sounds at all.

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,435
Hey, Lloyd Kaufman.

94
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,236
Yay, morning everyone.

95
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,738
How are you?

96
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:09,109
[Inaudible] Where's your...
That's all right, keep going.

97
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,011
Going to be the best
shot of the movie.

98
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,415
Now we're just about ready to
get the first shot of the day

99
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,215
Up.

100
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,823
You the manager?

101
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,824
I wouldn't have cut it.

102
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,258
I would've kept going.

103
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,894
Sound two.

104
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,795
Action.

105
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:28,696
You're hired.

106
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,765
I won't take no for an answer.

107
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,634
It's yours.

108
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,969
So you want to play
hardball, huh mister?

109
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,237
Two can play at this game.

110
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,174
Cut.

111
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:41,975
You had camera noise.

112
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,644
Do you want to do it again?

113
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,778
No!

114
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,046
Don't raise those issues.

115
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,147
What's wrong with you?

116
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,750
You want to move the
thing, quietly tell me.

117
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,618
You don't yell it out.

118
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,952
You tell me very quietly, OK?

119
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:52,753
Now I know.

120
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,554
I didn't know.

121
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,588
It's Tromaville.

122
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,057
We don't even care
if it's in focus.

123
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,293
Roll sound.

124
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,294
Speed.

125
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,231
Sound five.

126
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,200
Sound five and action!

127
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,235
So what happened?

128
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,607
It stopped by itself.

129
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh.

130
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,878
There are not that make
technicians who can handle

131
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,312
Working on a Troma movie.

132
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:23,283
You know, these guys are
sleeping on air mattresses.

133
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,418
They're living the Troma style.

134
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,087
They're certainly not
getting anything close

135
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,590
To what they get on
commercials or documentaries.

136
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,526
Everybody, sound is ready.

137
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,727
OK.

138
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:34,995
Standing by.

139
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:35,963
Action!

140
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,398
Action, chicken, action!

141
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,366
More jiggling.

142
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,333
Bigger, bigger!

143
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,541
The instant we try it,
explodes everywhere.

144
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,010
Oh fuck.

145
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,512
How did that happen?

146
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:56,984
This is downright dumb.

147
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,487
This is very dumb.

148
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,421
Is there anyone doing
anything other than this woman

149
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,656
Holding her finger in it?

150
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,857
Yes.

151
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,259
Lets do the dialog facing
this way while they're...

152
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,060
No, no.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,261
We'll do this dialog.

154
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,631
Stop it up, get
fucking out of here

155
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,100
And we'll do Arbie's dialog.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,569
Welcome to Tromaville.

157
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,070
You've got a guy testing
who's working this,

158
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,071
He's never done it before.

159
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,573
Richard's been doing this...

160
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,541
No, he hasn't been doing it.

161
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,543
He did the last rehearsal.

162
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,011
Good, Larry.

163
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,513
Get Larry's boom.

164
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:29,983
Caleb, this... this is...

165
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,451
The posters are
sweating off the walls.

166
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,087
Well, that's why they should've
been put up three weeks ago.

167
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,422
I'm just trying to
stay out of the way.

168
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,391
You know what I mean?

169
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,393
You can handle that business?

170
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,862
Just tape the shit over it!

171
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,363
Who has tape?

172
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,333
So how can we go up on
top there without tape?

173
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,002
Where's Humus's prayer rug?

174
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:49,803
We have that.

175
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,038
Well, it should be here!

176
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,107
Why didn't you notice
there's no fucking... why did

177
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,776
You not notice it's not there?

178
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,245
He's starting to lose it.

179
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,215
We've been here since 6:45 in
the morning, and it's 6:45 PM.

180
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,686
So, a 12 hour shoot so far,
and we're still not done.

181
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,724
Slate in.

182
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,592
Speed.

183
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,392
Sound 33.

184
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,531
Action.

185
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,534
If this is the way it
goes on a scene like this,

186
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,670
I mean, I can only imagine,
on like a fight scene.

187
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,972
With, like, blood
and guts... it's

188
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,574
Going to take like 24 hours.

189
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,809
It's starting to rain.

190
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,243
It's starting to rain, Lloyd?

191
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,311
Yes.

192
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,246
So we could have filmed
in the graveyard.

193
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,182
For some reason we didn't
film in the graveyard.

194
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,184
This would've been perfect
to film in the graveyard.

195
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:41,689
Thunder, lightning,
electricity, naked people.

196
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,858
Would've been the perfect
way to open the movie.

197
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,295
[Thunder]

198
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:51,732
Magic hour.

199
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,339
So, yeah, it's really early
and we're all wet right now.

200
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,610
We're all stinky,
because we just woke up.

201
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,979
And... it's a nice surprise.

202
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,380
I'm sorry, so
please, do it again.

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,381
From the top.

204
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:20,994
The idea of this is to
have both these wacky gags

205
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,997
As well as sexy stuff.

206
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,465
Great, this is
what we do, Gabe?

207
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,499
Yup.

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,701
Could start here, then...

209
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,440
This is the hottest
scene that has ever

210
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,909
Been recorded in film history.

211
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,346
OK, now Micki, you
can't stop yourself.

212
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,848
Good Wendy, good Micki.

213
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:41,882
Go more like a doggie.

214
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,383
There, that's it.

215
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,551
Can you see it, Brendan?

216
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:45,352
Is it funny?

217
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,286
Yes.

218
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,087
Ready, action.

219
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,761
Perfect.

220
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:54,862
Thank you very much.

221
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:55,863
Thank you.

222
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,830
Now cut it, cut it, cut it.

223
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,831
That's great.

224
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,932
It was very, very good.

225
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,769
But your body should
be, you know, like that.

226
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:10,143
And there wasn't enough
of the... oh, come on.

227
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,113
[Music playing]

228
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:20,020
Of course these are not
professional dancers.

229
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,957
By the looks of it, they
don't work out a lot.

230
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,895
You should be having an orgasm.

231
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,031
Want to take a picture
of me, going like this?

232
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,334
The key is to build it
up to a beautiful orgasm.

233
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,671
So that at the end... like
the end of music videos...

234
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,007
At the end it's
quiet and you go down

235
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:47,047
And Micki's having a
huge throbs of orgasm.

236
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:47,848
OK?

237
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,551
The last... OK, we got it.

238
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,054
All right, very cool, so...

239
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,523
What's going on in here?

240
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,026
We got... one of
our lead actresses

241
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,029
Looks like she wants to
kill herself between takes.

242
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,032
And we're a little
worried about her.

243
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,500
Has Lloyd talked to her yet?

244
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,802
Lloyd doesn't notice.

245
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:13,006
All Lloyd sees is 10 pair of
tits around him right now.

246
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,041
But it came out.

247
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,243
I think it's going to be great.

248
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,878
It's something I've
never seen before.

249
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,913
The whole scene.

250
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,883
And just your shot
is just, you know.

251
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,484
- Pornographic?
- No!

252
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,618
Oh, come on.

253
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:29,489
Orgasm, Allyson, have a
good orgasm right now.

254
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,859
It's good, trust me.

255
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,326
It shall be good.

256
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,294
[Singing]

257
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,262
And, heavy breathing.

258
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,638
[Applause]

259
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,607
Very cool.

260
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,212
Now, when do the eat
clam behind come in?

261
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,651
Well, it's the third
day of filming.

262
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,187
This is the night shoot.

263
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,822
It was supposed to
be the first night,

264
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,391
But it was canceled
due to thunderstorms.

265
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,260
Now we're finally
here at the fabulous

266
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,497
Ancient Indian cemetery.

267
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,666
It's very noisy around here.

268
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,402
People stop, people honk.

269
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,571
Causing a big ruckus
in this small town.

270
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,540
But hopefully
we'll pull through.

271
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:36,723
And... move a little
bit... and action!

272
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,726
Make your move to go
on top of her... action.

273
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,094
All right, cut.

274
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,430
Instead of saying cut, we like
to have the lights shut off.

275
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,564
Conserve energy, right?

276
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,532
It's very good.

277
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,300
Good.

278
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,268
There we go again.

279
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,502
Wow, they really
like to save money.

280
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,280
Well, it's midnight.

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,651
We're never going to make
it to the end of the night.

282
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,986
We have a lot to do.

283
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,655
I think it's time to
start ripping pages up,

284
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,058
Because this is like
an eight hour movie.

285
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,360
Every scene is taking
twice as long as it should.

286
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,100
[Inaudible]

287
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,301
What keeps happening
to the light,

288
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,402
Are you getting kick outs?

289
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,037
I think it's the
crap equipment.

290
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,978
The famous Troma
high-tech equipment.

291
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,781
What's going on behind the
future site sign over there?

292
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,583
I just noticed this
like halfway through.

293
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,986
Like about 45 minutes
ago I was like, oh look,

294
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,588
It's John Karyus
getting into position.

295
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,756
When I just looked over
there, and after all this shit

296
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:48,661
That's been going on, to
be the exact same position.

297
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,130
I could put this on
fucking time lapse.

298
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,598
We'll see the sun go up.

299
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,168
There you go.

300
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,369
Now you come around.

301
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,006
Does that make sense,
without kicking the cable?

302
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,540
That's it.

303
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,341
Say Arbie.

304
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,277
Hey Arbie.

305
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,278
Yeah!

307
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,648

Very good.

311
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,590
The night is about
three quarters finished

312
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,393
And we've done about
10% of the work.

313
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,394
Get in there.

00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,195

right, then cut.

adding days to the schedule.

you don't test stuff,

themselves on fire.

Did you get all that?

00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,400
Oh my God.

340
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,601
Are you OK?

341
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,402
What is that?

I think it went very well.

I kept my cool, as I always do.

I'm really pissed.

I can't tell you
how pissed I am.

hear it tomorrow.

I know I will.

00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,382
It went very, very well.

wonderful team here.

See what I have here?

359
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,239
I have a list of...
Because we want

360
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,241
The actor persons
to feel nice... so I

361
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,976
Have a list of their names.

362
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,179

00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,017
Torie.

367
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,085
Torie, I'm sorry.

368
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,389
How we doing this morning?

369
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,358
Fan-fucking-tastic.

370
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,560
The whole reason why we need
you here during rehearsals

371
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,830
Is so I don't have to waste time
explaining, do you understand?

372
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,399
All I need to know is
what your first shot is.

373
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,767
Yeah, but if you were
here at rehearsals

374
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,968
You wouldn't have to ask me.

375
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,204
If you have the camera
up during rehearsals?

376
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,372
Yes.

377
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,339
Yes.

378
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,308
I've had this camera
up for an hour.

379
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,209
It's just a car.

380
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,977
We can get the sound later.

381
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,779
We work together
on doing a shot.

382
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,482
If you're not around to
help us and work with us,

383
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,550
I can't help you now.

384
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,986
Fine, lets just do this
and get it over with.

385
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,989
Everyone knows except you.

386
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,424
Fuck this, man.

387
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,725
All I want to know
is what your opening

388
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,627
Angle is you fucking moron.

389
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,497
This whole shoot's
been crappy audio.

390
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,432
Has it really been that bad?

391
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,633
It's going to echo like crazy.

392
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,235
It's going to sound like shit.

393
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,035
No, no.

394
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,737
Dude, go away.

395
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,672
Is anybody going
to listen to me?

396
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:26,146
It's not your fault. It's just
the surroundings and whatnot.

397
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,248
Standing by!

398
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,583
Uh, cut.

399
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,518
It's a bigger problem.

400
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,253
The problem with
daytime shootings.

401
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,888
You have clouds,
things like that.

402
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,726
It changes the
exposure in the camera.

403
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,762
It doesn't really matter, but
the directors of photography,

404
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,796
They think it matters.

405
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,864
It doesn't.

406
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,400
Nobody's going to
notice that this shot is

407
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,369
Slightly differently exposed.

408
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,139
Are we legally blocking
off Bailey here?

409
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,174
Well, I'm pretty sure
that guy over there, Sal,

410
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,776
Isn't an actual police officer.

411
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:57,944
But we do have an orange bucket.

412
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,484
I think that is the
seal of legitimacy.

413
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,618
That's all right, one second.

414
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,757
Action!

415
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,159
What do we want?

416
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,927
For the evil,
devil-worshiping [inaudible]

Conglomerates to
cease the destruction

418
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,998
Of our beloved country.

419
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,068
And replacing
corporate [inaudible]

420
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,471
With more cookie-cutter
retail spots!

421
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,772
How do you think
that went, Debbie?

422
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,740
It's just a first shot, but...

423
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,641
It's so hilarious.

424
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,542
It's so good.

425
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,344
These guys are great.

426
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,646
It was amazing, there
wasn't a single mistake.

427
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,149
It's the best prepared
Troma movie, for sure.

428
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,650
Kept singing and dancing,
it's so elaborate.

429
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,553
Yeah, we've been able
to rehearse this stuff

430
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,522
For a number of weeks.

431
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,390
Yeah!

432
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,191
Woo!

433
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,959
[Applause]

434
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,998
Perfect, great.

435
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:52,999
What's in the bag, John?

436
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:53,766
Ice.

437
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,670
Thank you.

438
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,387
I'm most concerned
about my camera work.

439
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:19,125
I'm concerned that I got
so wrapped up in just

440
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,594
Keep the thing going
that I wasn't focusing

441
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:22,662
Enough on the camera work.

442
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,633
Roll camera, and slow jiggling.

443
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,268
A little more toward camera.

444
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,036
Face me better.

445
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,373
And now faster.

446
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,941
OK, back up, slow down.

447
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,345
My breasts on camera, close
up, are something that is not

448
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,814
All that un-commonplace,
particularly on home

449
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,250
Videos of me and my friends.

450
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,917
So, might as well
make it public, right?

451
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,852
Fair enough.

452
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,687
Hey!

453
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,389
What's the big blood effect
that we're doing today?

454
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,658
We're going to completely
drown the kitchen

455
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,262
Area in blood from the meat
grinder when Packard falls in.

456
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,128
Think it'll work?

457
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,163
Absolutely.

458
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,198
Nothing's gone wrong so far.

459
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,368
I couldn't imagine this
being any different.

460
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,742
[Music playing]

461
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,015
We're fucked.

462
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,952
So put it back in and
we'll shoot it wide.

463
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,388
The whole scene too.

464
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,758
Yes!

465
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,734
So is this your
first stunt, ever?

466
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,336
Yeah, it is.

467
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,770
And action!

468
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,639
One, two, three.

469
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,707
Balls!

470
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:41,741
There are all the
regular concerns when

471
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,843
You jump into a meat grinder.

472
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,713
Along with that, we
don't have running water.

473
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:51,017
And our first aid kit consists
of like two band aids.

474
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,320
Oh good, so that's
on my list too.

475
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,121
Fall!

476
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,055
Shake the legs!

477
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,089
Shake your legs!

478
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:57,890
Slow!

479
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,258
Go in, go in slow.

480
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,660
Go in slow.

481
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,594
Cut!

482
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:02,529
Absolutely fucked up.

483
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,630
No blood.

484
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,433
Guy goes in, in one
second he disappears.

485
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,435
It's exactly total bullshit.

486
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:11,938
We're fucked.

487
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,406
I think it's over.

488
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,575
I really do, unless
you can get your act

489
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,910
Together with these people.

490
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,381
[Music playing]

491
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,100
OK, cut!

492
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,238
Very nice, so now we've
got to get the dialog.

493
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,875
You spraying him with Lysol?

494
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,712
At his request.

495
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,682
The biggest problem
is that you haven't

496
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,518
Gotten to this stupid
dance, and now Caleb's

497
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,952
Thing with the chickens.

498
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,255
We're going to be
another day behind.

499
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,591
So that's very complicated.

500
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,096
You ought to have him test now.

501
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:10,897
Is Devlin here?

502
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,198
Yeah, he's here.

503
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,567
Are they doing it?

504
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,702
Seriously, you should have...
No.

505
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,103
Yeah.

506
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,739
They should do blood... do it out
in the parking lot, whatever.

507
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,441
Film it at lunch time.

508
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,709
Right?

509
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,413
No, film it now and we'll
look at it at lunch time.

510
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,213
Right?

511
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,448
Is anybody listening?

512
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,315
I can't see.

513
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,755
They said you can take
smoke breaks every two hours.

514
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,490
They say a lot of things.

515
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,491
Yeah, yeah!

516
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,461
I even read that in the manual.

517
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,430
You know?

518
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,432
You look young.

519
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,033
You know?

520
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,267
You know?

521
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,168
You look young.

522
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,202
I'm the young one.

523
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,003
I know that!

524
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,405
I'm trying to fucking act!

525
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,740
Cut it off!

526
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,908
No, I'm not nervous, I just
want to get the day moving.

527
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,244
The thing I'm concerned
about on my dancing

528
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,012
Is the acting part of it.

529
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,950
Forget the dance, dance is
performance with your face.

530
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,753
You know, alone.

531
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,521
And all that stuff.

532
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:09,355
I should be doing it.

533
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,157
I keep forgetting to do that.

534
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,292
Happy face, sad face, gay face.

535
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,495
That has as much to do
with it as the movement.

536
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:22,469
I'm too wrapped up
getting the... this stuff.

537
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:28,641
I'm too wrapped up in the moves
and I forget about the moved.

538
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,877
(SINGING) A bachelor of
fine arts is the [inaudible]

539
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,613
Of [inaudible], but
for me, it's just

No, I'm soaring on the
wings fried gold and brown,

birds I run this town.

[Laughter]

544
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,740
Does he not know that
his balls are hanging out?

545
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,841
They just told him.

546
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,075
And he still hasn't...

547
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,410
I've never seen anyone
like that before in my life.

548
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:24,731
[Applause]

549
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,800
Don't eat pizza,
peanut butter and jelly,

550
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,973
And jalapeno dip right before
you come to a morning shoot.

551
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,308
You want to see proof?

552
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,544
In there.

553
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,179
This is going to
be a puke orgy.

554
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,682
We crowded 50 people into
the restaurant, filled

555
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:45,217
Up 50 cups of vomit, and I don't
think we know what we're doing.

556
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,485
Where's Gabe?

557
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,120
In all the eight directions.

558
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,522
Some ideas.

559
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,290
Nobody's to be seen.

560
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,028
All right, well we're screwed
now, so do the best you can.

561
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,864
I guess we'll just
do this one piece.

562
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,600
Marlene, maybe
you'll start it off.

563
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,801
You vomit this way.

564
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,836
Everybody ready?

565
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,304
Roll and action!

566
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,580
Cut.

567
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,552
What do you think of the vomit?

568
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:20,352
It's hilarious.

569
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,654
It's like a porn movie.

570
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,589
Do you find it disgusting?

571
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:23,556
It's gross.

572
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:24,791
I love it.

573
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:25,858
It's frigging nasty.

574
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,828
I hope it doesn't
come anywhere near me.

575
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,297
I think our failure
so far has been

576
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,799
We haven't been
able to duplicate

577
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:36,636
The "Tromeo and
Juliet" funny spewing,

578
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,870
Where it just kept coming.

579
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,172
And that's rather a pity.

580
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,275
But we soldier on.

581
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,178
Just like the shuttle, those
tiles keep falling off.

582
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,686
[Screaming]

583
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,056
Gabe, you putting him
jerking off in the bathroom?

584
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,958
He's just reading a
dirty magazine, yeah.

585
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,861
But everyone's lined up
outside for the toilet

586
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:02,929
Because they're all throwing up.

587
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,863
That's the humor.

588
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:04,997
That's the joke.

589
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,265
I don't get... no, no,
I don't want to do this.

590
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,433
Hey, come on, man.

591
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,401
That's the script.

592
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,536
The script is
different than your...

593
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,938
No, but I'm
looking at the scene

594
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:13,706
And it's not working for me.

595
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,207
What does this have
to do with lighting?

596
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,575
Just out of curiosity.

597
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,544
It has to do with continuity!

598
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,647
The guy is just reading
a dirty magazine.

599
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,049
We're not going to
do a prolonged scene,

600
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:27,086
And try and do a story where a
guy's on the toilet jerking off

601
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:27,887
Right now.

602
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,055
Do you want to do that?

603
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:31,758
No, but I wouldn't mind
seeing the magazine.

604
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,893
What's the problem with
the way it's scripted?

605
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,427
This is the wrong
magazine, too.

606
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,495
This was not the one I approved.

607
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,764
No, that's the right one.

608
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,098
Nope, nope, the one I
approved, you could read this.

609
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,099
I said to outline.

610
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,367
I said to outline.

611
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,836
I said green is
composed of blue.

612
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:44,971
Green has blue in it.

613
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,238
You're screaming at that point.

614
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,373
You were, like, in pain.

615
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,777
This should have either
black outline around it

616
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,244
Or it shouldn't be that color.

617
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,079
It should be yellow.

618
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,380
Like that.

619
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,116
We're supposed to
be doing a big effect

620
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,585
Scene where the general
wrestles a demon chicken.

621
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:05,057
We spent the past 45 minutes
arguing about a fake magazine.

622
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:09,095
I don't understand, do we want
to make this fucking schedule?

623
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,697
We're arguing about a magazine.

624
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:11,731
Lets just do it.

625
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:12,865
I don't just do
things on script.

626
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,834
I've got to film
something that works.

627
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,335
If it doesn't work,
I'm going to change it.

628
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,236
Because it had to be done.

629
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,537
Read the script first!

630
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,638
I don't just shoot scripts.

631
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:20,873
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's just...
- I should see.

632
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,374
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's
decide what we're doing.

633
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,518
CAMERAMAN: Why are you guys
sitting out here right now?

634
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,854
Because there's nothing
happening in there.

635
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:38,825
We're waiting for people
to stop discussing why

636
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:42,361
A person would be
masturbating on a toilet

637
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,031
While people are outside in
the main dining area vomiting

638
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,566
All over the place.

639
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,469
GENERAL: Boy, you've
been relieved of duty.

640
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,403
Ahhh!

641
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,239
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

642
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,473
Perfect.

643
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,274
Perfect.

644
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,576
(SINGING) I'm in heaven.

645
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,211
CAMERAMAN: So what shot
are you guys about to do?

646
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,346
What's that?

647
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,680
CAMERAMAN: What shot are
you guys about to do?

648
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:02,749
The chicken fight.

649
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,016
CAMERAMAN: And how
does it work basically?

650
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,417
It's a pretty basic
system, right?

651
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,820
Yeah, this operates
the head and the neck.

652
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,591
And then these three pulleys
here operate the wings,

653
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,894
The eyes, and the mouth.

654
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,395
CAMERAMAN: So you're
basically controlling it

655
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,797
And making it look at though...

656
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,232
Yeah, well, we have
to switch puppets.

657
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,367
This is the stunt puppet.

658
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,234
Say hello, stunt puppet.

659
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,535
Hello.

660
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,473
And we kind of... we have a
puppet that actually moves.

661
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:28,574
And we use that
for the closeups.

662
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,977
And then this is
the fight puppet.

663
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:31,911
DIRECTOR: Bite.

664
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,946
Two can play at
this game, mister.

665
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:34,747
Aghhh!

666
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,318
DIRECTOR: Let it
get on your face.

667
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,252
Argggh!

668
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:41,187
Argggh!

669
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:42,254
DIRECTOR: Spit.
MAN: Shake it.

670
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,055
Shake it.

671
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,456
You're fed up with it.

672
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,624
DIRECTOR: Throw
it on the ground.

673
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,592
Ahhh!

674
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,594
Ahhh!

675
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,561
Arrrrgghhhh!

676
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,563
DIRECTOR: Wipe your face.

677
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,532
[Coughing] [laughing]

678
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,302
It was fun.

679
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,303
Lots of damn fun.

680
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,005
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Kevin, how did it go?

681
00:28:59,105 --> 00:28:59,872
It went really well.

682
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:00,807
I was actually really happy.

683
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,174
The timing went well.

684
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,343
It started oozing out
soapy bubbles at first

685
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,378
And then blasted through
this ridiculously

686
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,514
Dark, green, icky liquid.

687
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,882
It couldn't have gone better.

688
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,818
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And what did you
use to make the liquid, Tom?

689
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:16,222
Well, the liquid is food
dye, soap and lots of water

690
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,190
And lots of soap.

691
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,828
I mean, we have
bubbly... a bubbly mess.

692
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,629
Today is... today is
a very effects-heavy

693
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:24,730
Day with the scene.

694
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:27,566
We have Joe Fleischaker,
who is a great guy.

695
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,769
But, you know, he's got
some physical limitations.

696
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,771
But that's all
right just as long

697
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:37,676
As we follow sort of what Tom
wants, I think we could do it.

698
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,983
I have a feeling it's going
to go very smoothly today.

699
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,118
CAMERAMAN: Joe, are you
excited for your role today?

700
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,519
Oh, absolutely.

701
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,454
I'm looking forward to it.

702
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,322
1, 2, 3.

703
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,224
We have to indulge
the fans, you know?

704
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,792
That's the real
reason why I do it.

705
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,228
[Music playing]

706
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,069
Wow!

707
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:03,836
Jared.

708
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,308
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Smile.

709
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,709
Mmm, big smile.

710
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,545
Open your eyes and smile... open.

711
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,847
All right, cut.

712
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,716
Now give me that low fat
sausage-flavor chicken

713
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,286
Meal with the General's
low-carb mashed potatoes.

714
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,487
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

715
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,222
Now you give me that
low-fat, sausage flavored...

716
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,123
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

717
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,858
Low fat mashed...

718
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:26,725
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again.

719
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,827
Take a breath and do it now.

720
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,196
Don't get skimpy on the low...

721
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,563
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
All right, cut it.

722
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,365
Someone better go through
the lines with Joe.

723
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,733
This should have
been done last night.

724
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,434
MAN: Do we need to
get the stool for him?

725
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,235
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No.

726
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,369
No, I don't need the stool.

727
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,837
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, let's
run to the next thing.

728
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,007
JOE FLEISCHAKER: Let's
do it one more time.

729
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,409
Man, you are an inspiration.

730
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,643
And you kept the weight off.

731
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:45,744
How did you do it?

732
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,447
It's all about
moderation, my boy.

733
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,850
Now you get my that low-fat
sausage-flavored chicken meal

734
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,220
With the General's
low-carb mashed potatoes.

735
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,323
Don't you even think of skimping
on the General's all-soy gravy.

736
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,124
JASON: You got it.

737
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,525
Do it once more.

738
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,927
Your pants have to be down.

739
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:09,101
Well, that's going to
be... I don't know how are

740
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,769
We supposed to... I was told...

741
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,338
LLOYD KAUFMAN: He can't
shit with his pants on.

742
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,340
Action and a shit.

743
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,241
[Wailing]

744
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,009
Eat, and shit, eat.

745
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:17,910
[Wailing]

746
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,280
Shake your head no.

747
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,152
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We just need
one shot from above, I think.

748
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,386
DIRECTOR: You don't
have to scream.

749
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,255
All you have to do is lie there.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

750
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,189
DIRECTOR: You can sleep.

751
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:31,523
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
you can't sleep.

752
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,959
But you can be...

753
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,493
I have to be in pain.

754
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,327
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Breathing.

755
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,662
Breathing and being...

756
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,130
DIRECTOR: You're not having
a heart attack, are you Joe?

757
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,465
I don't think so.

758
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,267
DIRECTOR: OK, good,
so you're just pink.

759
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,668
Yeah, just pink.

760
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:43,602
DIRECTOR: All right, if you're
really having a heart attack,

761
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,870
I'll take it serious.

762
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:45,938
Otherwise, fuck you.

763
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:46,738
OK.

764
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,739
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Here we go.

765
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,308
No, seriously, if
you're in trouble.

766
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,776
I'm not in trouble.

767
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:51,777
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, very good.

768
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:52,844
Ready?

769
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,246
I'm telling you that
I can't make it up.

770
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,948
Better put me back down.

771
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:56,915
Right here.
Ready.

772
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,217
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

773
00:31:58,317 --> 00:31:59,218
1, 23.

774
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,186
Go ahead, Joe.

775
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,687
Yeah.

776
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,688
I'm good.

777
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:03,655
All right.

778
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,157
MAN: Get Joe's chair ready.

779
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,625
[Applause]

780
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,696
He crapped up the scene.

781
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:11,897
Joe was awful.

782
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,166
He was horrible.

783
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,734
He didn't even have his lines.

784
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:16,602
I'm never using him again.

785
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,779
Apparently, Yoshi
is walking off set.

786
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,580
What happened?

787
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,516
I don't know.

788
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,317
Who is walking off set?

789
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,551
GABE FRIEDMAN: Yoshi.

790
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,585
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Why?

791
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,422
I don't know why...
Says I'm sarcastic.

792
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:37,389
I don't know why.

793
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,292
Seems to not the
way I talk to him.

794
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,427
This is my problem.

795
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:42,728
I'll deal with it.

796
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:43,929
GABE FRIEDMAN: All right,
so we don't have the shit...

797
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,564
BRENDAN FLYNT: No, you
don't have to do anything.

798
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,434
GABE FRIEDMAN: OK, great thanks.

799
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:50,336
Hey, come on, Yoshi.

800
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,770
Come on.
Yoshi.

801
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,738
That's not working, man.

802
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:53,872
Yoshi, no!

803
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,673
Yoshi.

804
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,474
Come on.

805
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,742
Come on, buddy.

806
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:57,743
Come on.

807
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,678
Stop it!

808
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:00,812
No, I'm serious.

809
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,114
You get that crap out of
your right now, buddy.

810
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:02,914
I'm serious.

811
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,016
Or I'll break the camera.

812
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,984
You don't do that shit.

813
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,686
You leave our men alone.

814
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,555
Brendan was fucking
running his mouth.

815
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,390
And finally Yoshi just snapped.

816
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,594
BRENDAN FLYNT: That's only twice
in about 70 movies I've done.

817
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,729
So it's not... it's not so bad.

818
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,265
CAMERAMAN: He was
definitely antagonizing him?

819
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:20,199
Oh, yeah.

820
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:20,899
CAMERAMAN: Brendan
was definitely

821
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,034
Was antagonizing him?

822
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,235
Yeah, Yoshi was saying,
getting away from me.

823
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,136
Don't talk to me.
Brendan was running his mouth.

824
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,471
Yeah, congrats, Brendan.

825
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,339
Good job.

826
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,375
Yoshi is a great
fucking guy, you know?

827
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:30,609
And I'm looking
forward to working

828
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,844
With him again... definitely
not with Brendan Flynt.

829
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,814
Like, if you see a documentary
about what when I quit,

830
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,316
Then you'll know why.

831
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,784
CREW: Roll camera.

832
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,786
DIRECTOR: Action on.

833
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,788
And shit.

834
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,790
Shit!

835
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,958
Ah, Shit!

836
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,260
Cut.
Cut.

837
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,295
Cut.

838
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,863
Cut, rename the shit.

839
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,865
Rolling and action, Ron.

840
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,834
Shit!

841
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,835
Shit!

842
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,036
Look at that shit.

843
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,338
Lower your legs.
Lower your legs, Ron.

844
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,206
Low.

845
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:01,039
Low.

846
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,007
Shit.

847
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:02,974
OK.

848
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:03,942
Cut it.

849
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:04,943
Cut it.

850
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,378
Now, oh, fuck.

851
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,282
It looked like a
fountain, right?

852
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,050
Yeah.

853
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,452
CAMERAMAN: Are we
behind schedule already?

854
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,986
Yes.
CAMERAMAN: All right.

855
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:15,954
DIRECTOR: Action on it.

856
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:16,922
[Splat]

857
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,292
No.

858
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,260
Cut.

859
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,662
Cut it.

860
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,831
Has somebody got baby wipes?

861
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:26,832
Baby wipes!

862
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,300
MAN: I've got baby wipes.

863
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,801
Hit the shower.

864
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,704
Here is a puppet
heat Joe Fleischaker

865
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,175
That has grips built into it
so we can grab a hold of it

866
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,877
And shrink him down.

867
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:45,050
Action... cut.

868
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,518
Deflate... go.

869
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:50,956
Cut.

870
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:01,767
You guys have to test all
the day is a total waste.

871
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,101
And it's 7 o'clock.

872
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,903
And you've got Arbie and Penny
and the other people here.

873
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,406
And their day is
wasted for no reason...

874
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:10,108
Just because people are too
fucking lazy to test stuff.

875
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,543
I took you word for it.

876
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,945
That this worked.

877
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,381
This is ridiculous.

878
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,849
And it's taking
us, you know, it's

879
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,518
Throwing us off another day.

880
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,788
I don't know how we're going
to shoot the singing now.

881
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,291
Joe Fleischaker's supposedly
turning inside out.

882
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,559
There's no way you can
tell what's going on.

883
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,628
You know, if they think that
Brendan was tough with Yoshi,

884
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,163
They ain't seen nothing yet.

885
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,532
I'll push every button
there is because, you know,

886
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,700
It's not worth it.

887
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,835
The movie is young people
and special effects.

888
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:37,769
That's all there is.

889
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,172
Yeah, Gabe says we got music.

890
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:41,973
That's going to solve the
special effects problem.

891
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,609
We shouldn't worry
because it's got music.

892
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:44,776
People go... people
are going to buy

893
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,513
Tickets because of the music.

894
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,480
Yeah, right.

895
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,582
Our fans are going
to... the music

896
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,018
Is something to be discovered.

897
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,986
We should rewrite.

898
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,424
That's what we should
be doing is rewriting.

899
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:02,428
Or get that thing on... get
on film so we see what it is.

900
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,831
I beg you to get this thing
on film... on tape rather.

901
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,767
I beg... I beg weeks,
and weeks, and weeks.

902
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,537
Andy should talk to Tom and
in no uncertain terms, right?

903
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,708
Andy you should talk to
Tom and get it straight...

904
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,645
Get that fucking test on
test... on screen, now.

905
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,547
BRENDAN FLYNT: Great, let me
rehearse the exit, please.

906
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,582
There's got to be a fucking
transformation from the General

907
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,816
To that thing.

908
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,385
There's got to be something
for people to look at.

909
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:30,188
It cannot be shot after shot
of spraying brown water...

910
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,823
Or spraying red water.

911
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,325
So far we've got
two scenes... one

912
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,928
Where red water sprays and
one where brown water sprays.

913
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,298
You guys have to film it.

914
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,967
You guys have to get Andy
as a producer and maybe Kiel

915
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:43,802
To speak with Tom.

916
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,104
That General thing is
Tom's responsibility.

917
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:46,905
I've said my peace.

918
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:47,739
I've said it.

919
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,907
I've been saying it for weeks.

920
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,410
You have to film it,
test it, or you get shit.

921
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,210
You get schlock.

922
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,345
You can talk all you want.

923
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,513
You can meet all you want.

924
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,416
Kaleb can be his
cocktail party nice guy.

925
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,618
But you've got to
get it on tape!

926
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,819
You've got to get it on tape.

927
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,588
I've said it for weeks.

928
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:03,889
Brendan said it nicely.

929
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,457
There's no other way to do it.

930
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,526
And I don't want to be
slightly diplomatic.

931
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,160
I wouldn't blame
if you walked out.

932
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,196
I wouldn't blame you one
bit if you walked out.

933
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:11,997
I would.

934
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:12,998
But there's no other way.

935
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,065
I don't care.

936
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,335
I'd rather you did
than have this again.

937
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,136
You film it and see it.

938
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,671
And it better be good.

939
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,139
I know I'm right.

940
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,940
I know I'm right.

941
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,741
I know I'm right.

942
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,775
I know I'm right.

943
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,744
I know I'm fucking right.

944
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,545
Action!

945
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:34,953
We did rehearse this
Carl Jr thing a lot.

946
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,822
So maybe this will go
better than yesterday.

947
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,690
CAMERAMAN: How ready
are you guys today?

948
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,165
It's smells like beyond ass.

949
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,266
And they left it out.

950
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,168
And like I found
spiders all over it.

951
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,370
So I don't know if
there is a spider

952
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,005
Nest living inside of it.

953
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,607
You have to stick
your hand in here.

954
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,876
And it's a puppet.

955
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,045
But I don't want to
stick my hand in there.

956
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,351
It's very nice.

957
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,753
Doesn't look like a chicken.

958
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,455
But I guess you know it's
a chicken because you

959
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,957
Saw it just a little while ago.

960
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:13,258
I mean, it looks like a whale.

961
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,292
It's got the eyes on the top.

962
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,528
It's got that mouth
that a whale has.

963
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,830
It's got that big filter
for plankton that's getting

964
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,533
And going after plankton.

965
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,801
Well, can we give
them a line, maybe?

966
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,807
People... people
react to that stuff.

967
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,141
MAN: Larry, what happened?

968
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,945
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, maybe...
Yeah, what happened to you?

969
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,347
MAN: Larry, what
happened to you?

970
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,383
Well, what are you doing to me?

971
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:40,185
Maybe... Larry, what
are you doing to me?

972
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,121
Maybe that's the thing...
This cue for the bite.

973
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,189
Ahh!

974
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,491
Or has he already bitten you?

975
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:51,963
[Screaming]

976
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,658
I don't know if you
remember Lloyd freaking

977
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,661
Out about Tom Devlin's effects.

978
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,497
Let them know that he's
going to get canned.

979
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,565
Send him back to LA.

980
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,333
And we'll have to
come up with our own.

981
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,035
That's the end of the movie.

982
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,472
So we went back to see his
test of the egg hatching

983
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,706
Of the general monster.

984
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,609
And it was unfortunately
less than impressive.

985
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,812
Right now it's just a guy and
then like some pulsating shit.

986
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,313
Then all of a sudden,
there's an egg

987
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,281
There or something like that.

988
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,583
So we have to redo all that.

989
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:48,019
It's got to be much more
brutal than what we saw.

990
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,521
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No kidding.
DIRECTOR: Don't jerk.

991
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,956
Don't jerk.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't do that.

992
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:51,923
Just drink.

993
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,059
DIRECTOR: Let it
pour out by itself.

994
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,527
That's it.

995
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,996
[Music playing]

996
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,913
Now do a thing is if your
eyes were about to explode

997
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:15,714
Into the camera.

998
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,449
[Music playing]

999
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,357
DIRECTOR: Cut!

1000
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,859
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, yeah, Rose.

1001
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,210
[Coughing]

1002
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,786
Seriously, like, I'm
going to pass out.

1003
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:58,990
Thank you.

1004
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:05,764
Cut.

1005
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,899
Good, OK.

1006
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,434
Thank you, Rose.

1007
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,603
CAMERAMAN: You think
morale is real low on set?

1008
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,938
Right now, yeah.

1009
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,206
We need something fucking
great to boost it up... at least

1010
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:20,879
Boost up the morales of our
keys because it sucks right now.

1011
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,913
Anybody know what we're doing?

1012
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,214
MAN: Ron Jeremy Ron Jeremy.

1013
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,082
I have no idea.

1014
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,183
Oh, Ron Jeremy comes tomorrow.

1015
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,251
MAN: The crazy guy.

1016
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,387
Ron Jeremy comes
tomorrow and very cool.

1017
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,889
He's the crazy guy.

1018
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,759
So the crew will be very happy.

1019
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,126
The crew is... look
how happy they are.

1020
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,294
I want to meet Ron Jeremy.

1021
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,328
LLOYD KAUFMAN: He's cool.

1022
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,296
I got to go buy some
porn now, though,

1023
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,264
So he can sign it for me.

1024
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,936
CAMERAMAN: Have they told you
about your role yet so far?

1025
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,572
The only role
they told me about

1026
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:49,407
Was a roll and butter, which
they have over there waiting

1027
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,910
For me over at the coffee.

1028
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,579
Yeah, I play kind of
a crazy man, which

1029
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,147
Is great... the guy you see in
those movies warning you like

1030
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,816
Go back... go back.

1031
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,350
You know?

1032
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,653
Let's say you got a couple
of horny and stupid friends

1033
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,590
That want to go on a road trip
into the unmapped backwoods

1034
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,624
Of America.

1035
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:06,892
Take a look.

1036
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,661
Two spare tires... one fully
charged cellphone with

1037
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:12,097
Great range... with great range.

1038
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,164
And a couple of guns.

1039
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,702
Behold, I shall a
bury a sword upon you.

1040
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:19,805
I shall devastate your
higher places. [Burp]

1041
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,774
Oh, shit.

1042
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,275
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

1043
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,277
[Applause]

1044
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,781
[Screaming]

1045
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,418
Don't lean forward too
much when you're screaming.

1046
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,253
Yeah.

1047
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,088
OK, that was great.

1048
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,857
CAMERAMAN: Can we
have a quick shot?

1049
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:41,059
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Uh,
Caleb's pants came down.

1050
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,427
Who is the pants wrangler?

1051
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,228
KIEL: I am.

1052
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:44,763
Kiel, please.

1053
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,264
I told you to stand and
to pull up his pants.

1054
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:47,398
It's only in the pants...

1055
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,434
Kiel, now look, I want
you to listen carefully.

1056
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,402
I told you... you standby
to pull up Caleb's pants.

1057
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,203
Now pull them up.

1058
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,171
Pull those pants up.

1059
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,807
Pull my fucking pants up now!

1060
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,976
Jesus.

1061
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,745
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Sorry,
Caleb, I apologize.

1062
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:01,146
- All right.
- Come on.

1063
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:01,947
I touched it.

1064
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:02,748
I touched it.

1065
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,283
Now, all right.

1066
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,056
DIRECTOR: It's got to go over
his eyes... too much slime.

1067
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,991
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
we need a lot of it.

1068
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,259
All right, let's
turn the cameras on.

1069
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:15,393
It's going to go in his eye.

1070
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:16,394
DIRECTOR: It's going to
go right in his eyeball.

1071
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,495
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It
didn't last time.

1072
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,730
CREW: Well, he dumped
a shitload on there.

1073
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,765
Ready?

1074
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,599
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, we're going.
Action!

1075
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,467
Cameras!

1076
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:23,534
CAMERAMAN: Yeah, rolling.

1077
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,803
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Chin up.
Chin up.

1078
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:25,603
What are you doing?

1079
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,472
Oh, oh, then we got to cut.

1080
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,707
We got to cut.
We got to cut.

1081
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,641
No, it's OK.
It's OK.

1082
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:30,909
I can't... it's
no good like that.

1083
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:31,843
GABE FRIEDMAN: It's all slime.
You can't see anything.

1084
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:32,844
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's got to be...

1085
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,544
CREW: It's what we
were telling you.

1086
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:34,345
It's like a boat.

1087
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,715
Paper towels, please.

1088
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:37,983
They can't see any
of the makeup now.

1089
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,050
CREW: All right, never mind.

1090
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,351
CAMERAMAN: How's it
going today so far?

1091
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,419
It's fine.

1092
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,420
CAMERAMAN: It's all right?

1093
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,055
Yeah, a lot of waiting
around because I

1094
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,124
Have just this one
little bit in the scene.

1095
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:51,196
So it's, uh, interesting... it's
very... once you get slimed,

1096
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:55,834
There's not much you can
do... just sit here and wait.

1097
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,602
So it's Saturday.

1098
00:43:57,703 --> 00:43:59,570
And we're doing the
zombie mask scene,

1099
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,039
Section A, which
is when everyone's

1100
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,774
Faces get ripped off and stuff.

1101
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,442
I think we got here at 9
o'clock in the morning.

1102
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,111
It's now 1 o'clock
in the afternoon.

1103
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,379
Gabe is really around...
Pissed of as hell

1104
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,715
Because the effects
weren't ready.

1105
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,149
We've got a million
zombies running around.

1106
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,618
Half the people
here have turned up

1107
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,520
Who aren't even supposed
to be here today

1108
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,422
And asked if they could be in
a scene that's already been

1109
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:18,890
Blocked out like six weeks ago.

1110
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,525
So they've been made up as well.

1111
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,028
So god knows what the fuck they
are going to do in the scene.

1112
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,763
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,131
Yeah, it's in there
just knock them out.

1114
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,132
Better than before.

1115
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:29,067
CAMERAMAN: I don't
mean to alarm you.

1116
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,970
But you might have
something on your face.

1117
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,771
It's not yet.

1118
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,840
It's a work in progress.

1119
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,907
A little bit.

1120
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,575
Like, I have to sort
look at an angle.

1121
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,281
For some reason there's nothing
stuck to this side of my arm.

1122
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,716
I don't know why.

1123
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,617
They got someone to put
water in the Elmer's glue.

1124
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,154
Unfortunately that person...
They don't remember

1125
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:51,356
Who... couldn't
tell the difference

1126
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:53,458
Between water and cream soda.

1127
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,962
So every single person you
see with feathers on them

1128
00:44:57,062 --> 00:45:00,265
Is covered head to
toe in cream soda.

1129
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,867
Who is the fucking asshole?

1130
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:02,667
NICK: No one knows.

1131
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:04,635
What are you doing?

1132
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,237
My right arm.
Do it again.

1133
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:07,072
My good arm.

1134
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,539
Do it again, goddammit!

1135
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,008
Do it fucking again.

1136
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,009
Can you see blood?

1137
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,977
Is he bloody?

1138
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,578
CREW: Very bloody.
DIRECTOR: Roll it.

1139
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:14,679
Roll it.

1140
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,849
I just did my first
real effect in a feature

1141
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,318
Film... Troma's "Poultrygeist."

1142
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:23,922
And I didn't get yelled at the
entire three hours we shot.

1143
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,757
Every single person
gets yelled at.

1144
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,225
I don't know how
the hell I did it.

1145
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,693
CAMERAMAN: How's it
going today so far?

1146
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:30,896
Well, the effects
are looking great.

1147
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:33,198
But the problem... maybe
it's not a problem.

1148
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:34,933
But it's taking a long, long
time for the people sort

1149
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,034
Of waiting in their makeup.

1150
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,368
But they knew they were
going to be waiting.

1151
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,437
And we just go out there,
keep them occupied,

1152
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:43,074
And they are hanging in there.

1153
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,409
I can handle it all afternoon...

1154
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,784
Um, want a cigarette?

1155
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,887
CAMERAMAN: So how do you
think today is going?

1156
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:58,656
Oh, well, I've
been here 12 hours.

1157
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,027
They haven't use me...
Or 10 hours or whatever.

1158
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,428
They haven't used me.
So I pretty much...

1159
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:04,662
CAMERAMAN: And how many
times has this happened

1160
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,763
So far on this production?

1161
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,833
I can't remember.

1162
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:08,800
CAMERAMAN: Too many to count?

1163
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,801
Yeah.

1164
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,169
I think a lot of
things that goes

1165
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:18,176
On with Troma outside of actual
shooting is unprofessional.

1166
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,211
I made $100 for
all the work I do.

1167
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,446
CAMERAMAN: For your
role in this film?

1168
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:22,380
For my whole work.

1169
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,515
CAMERAMAN: Wait, wait, wait.

1170
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,917
Your role in this film...
Yep.

1171
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,285
CAMERAMAN: every hour?
- Uh-huh.

1172
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,686
CAMERAMAN: Living here.

1173
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,388
Moving here for the summer to
New York... you got paid $100?

1174
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:31,256
$100.

1175
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,690
CAMERAMAN: You got paid $100?

1176
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,192
You want to know
what Kit gets paid?

1177
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,162
Kit gets paid almost
double what Jason makes.

1178
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:38,997
And Jason makes $900.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We need touchup.

1179
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:39,797
CAMERAMAN: Total?

1180
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,732
Total.

1181
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,768
CAMERAMAN: Is it like per
something or just total?

1182
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,336
Total... $100 for
the whole film.

1183
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,172
CAMERAMAN: So do you not feel
appreciated on this film?

1184
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:48,173
I feel...

1185
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,007
CAMERAMAN: Or feel
underappreciated?

1186
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,508
I feel... financially, yeah.

1187
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,844
[Music playing]

1188
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,318
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let me see
people in the rear making out.

1189
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,719
DIRECTOR: Go back to making out.

1190
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,188
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
People in the rear.

1191
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,123
DIRECTOR: Melanie,
rub... rub yourself.

1192
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,058
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now I
can't see anything.

1193
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,127
DIRECTOR: Back to the
original position.

1194
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,428
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.
Position.

1195
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,030
DIRECTOR: All right.
- Oh!

1196
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,864
OK, excuse me.

1197
00:47:12,964 --> 00:47:13,831
DIRECTOR: Cut.

1198
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:14,665
Cut.

1199
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:15,833
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No more spraying.

1200
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,035
Let's just do making out.
DIRECTOR: All right.

1201
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:17,835
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

1202
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,240
There's no continuity
in this film.

1203
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,541
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We
can't see your faces.

1204
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,342
That's it.

1205
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,710
There you go.

1206
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:29,480
Perfect, now squirm with the
lube hit... a little tiny bit.

1207
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,448
OK, good.

1208
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,817
Now, and cut.

1209
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,785
OK, very cool.

1210
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:36,021
Very cool.
Thank you.

1211
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:36,821
Thank you.

1212
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:37,788
Here... in the ass.

1213
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:38,789
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now quiet!

1214
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,624
Get a wide shot.

1215
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,360
You may want to add a few PAs.

1216
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,161
Ready?

1217
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,930
And action.

1218
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,431
[Screaming]

1219
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,936
I'm not going to be
in this for six hours.

1220
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:53,204
This is ridiculous,
especially when I can't see.

1221
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,005
CAMERAMAN: I got to go.

1222
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,006
Lloyd's flipping out.

1223
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,207
All right, I'll be back.

1224
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:57,008
Move it.

1225
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:57,808
Move it.

1226
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:00,011
Move it.

1227
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,247
When can we look at something?

1228
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:03,414
I see her coming
in and coming out.

1229
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:04,916
What are you leading
her around for?

1230
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:05,716
Where's Tessa?

1231
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:10,355
You shoot it.

1232
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,490
Shoot it.

1233
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,960
Do you mind shooting it, please?

1234
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,826
CAMERAMAN: Where'd she go?

1235
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:24,569
Sorry you had to stay in
costume for seven hours or so.

1236
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:25,570
Come in.

1237
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,974
Do you mind be interviewed?

1238
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,575
What happened?

1239
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:31,542
Oh, you don't want it filmed?

1240
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,311
All right, then don't film it.

1241
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,812
[Crying]

1242
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,153
I just want to get this
fucking shit over with.

1243
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:42,988
Come down.

1244
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,122
Tessa will be right here still.

1245
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,490
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, all right.
Where is she?

1246
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,457
Have her sit there.

1247
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:47,392
Put her there.

1248
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:48,826
And then we're in good shape.

1249
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,261
I know it's fattening.

1250
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:54,065
But I love this flesh.

1251
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,600
I love the squash, what?

1252
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,069
WOMAN: You said
I love this part?

1253
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,237
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
I love the skin.

1254
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,171
WOMAN: I love the skin?

1255
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,606
Dammit.

1256
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,508
Action!

1257
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:04,942
Put your hands out...
Your right hand out.

1258
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:05,876
All right, cut, cut, cut.

1259
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:06,844
God dammit!

1260
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,646
Action at that table, Jessica.

1261
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,048
Action, Jessica!

1262
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,082
I can't see anything.

1263
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,183
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go
over to your right.

1264
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,151
Now, stay up!

1265
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,119
Fuck!

1266
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,786
I know it's fattening.

1267
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,423
But I love the
skin. [Evil laugh]

1268
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,790
The biggest problem
with this stuff

1269
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,259
Is you have amateur actors.

1270
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,063
And when you have them, not
only do they screw up the movie,

1271
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,465
But they screw up the shots.

1272
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,433
MAN: Got it Lloyd?

1273
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:29,567
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
it was perfect.

1274
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,037
[Music playing]

1275
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:38,976
[Screaming]

1276
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,449
[Applause]

1277
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:48,919
DIRECTOR: Ready?

1278
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,887
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

1279
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:50,888
CREW: Slice.

1280
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,857
Blood.

1281
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,859
Slice.

1282
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:55,860
Slice.

1283
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,827
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

1284
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,764
DIRECTOR: Blood.

1285
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,299
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Get going
over the [inaudible].

1286
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,240
CREW: Yeah, there's blood now.

1287
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,712
DIRECTOR: All right, in the
sink... up... in the first dunk.

1288
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:15,680
Up.

1289
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,681
Second dunk.

1290
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:18,183
[Gasp]

1291
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:19,350
[Screaming]

1292
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,151
Third dunk.

1293
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,152
Leave him in.

1294
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:22,153
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Dunk him again.

1295
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,121
Sorry, dunk him again.

1296
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,122
DIRECTOR: One more time.

1297
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,056
Ahh! [Bang]

1298
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:25,890
DIRECTOR: Oh!

1299
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,824
CAMERAMAN: Are you all right?

1300
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:27,625
Of course he's not.

1301
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:28,959
That's a nasty little cut.

1302
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,396
I saw we skip this... go
to the next... don't do it.

1303
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,167
CAMERAMAN: Let me see it.

1304
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,336
What happened exactly?

1305
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,105
Um, I'm not entirely sure.

1306
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,772
But I was doing this stunt.

1307
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,274
And I think I slipped.

1308
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,375
Now, that's dedication.

1309
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,477
What producers do you
know that sacrifice

1310
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,379
Their own face for the movie?

1311
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,847
Andy, she knows
exactly where it is.

1312
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:50,948
Oh, great.

1313
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,884
I'm actually getting
you to Sister's or ECMC.

1314
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,155
The Sister's Hospital.

1315
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,357
OK, you can be
in place... you're

1316
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:00,958
Getting killed instead of Andy.

1317
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,160
You're getting your
face deep fried.

1318
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,196
I mean, yeah, your
face deep fried.

1319
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,798
MARIA GISMONDI: So it's a rough
night in Tromaville, Buffalo.

1320
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,867
Um, we have a
quadrillion people.

1321
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,337
I think, actually, the
numbers close to 200 extras

1322
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:16,474
Who have been here since 3:00
PM, who are in various stages

1323
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,543
Of zombie makeup and dress.

1324
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,979
We also have a cast and
crew who are basically,

1325
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,781
At this point, at their wits
end, considering the fact

1326
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,416
That all of us were here
until about 2 o'clock

1327
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:26,384
In the morning last night.

1328
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:27,952
And now, once again,
we're preparing

1329
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:29,487
For about the same tonight.

1330
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,557
We've got producers whose heads
are like exploding as we speak.

1331
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:37,428
We have a... a director who... who
appears to be rapidly losing,

1332
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:38,663
Um, sanity.

1333
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,865
Don't tell me what I'm
doing and what am not doing.

1334
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:41,732
I know what I'm doing.

1335
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,068
And I know what I'm not doing.

1336
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:47,238
Uh, Basically all of this.

1337
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:51,209
And we've only got about...
About a very brief period

1338
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:54,111
Of time left before we have to
get all of these shots wrapped.

1339
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:57,047
And it's nearing
midnight now as we speak.

1340
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,450
CAMERAMAN: So Allyson, how do
you feel about, uh, tonight?

1341
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,851
How do you think
it's going to go?

1342
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,652
Awesome.

1343
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:02,853
It looks great.

1344
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,389
You're trying to act like
a chicken like they are.

1345
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,790
They are just going
to be doing like this.

1346
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,558
They are minding
their own business.

1347
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,860
And then you just walk
very quietly through there.

1348
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,198
And you walk like a chicken.
[chicken sound] You're going

1349
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,299
To be doing a little of that.

1350
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,941
All right, keep going Allyson.

1351
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,943
MARIA GISMONDI: Actually, this
is one of my favorite dances.

1352
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:29,614
So... and I think this is one of
the people's favorite dances.

1353
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:30,981
These guys have been amazing.

1354
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,351
They've been rehearsing this
stuff when they don't have to.

1355
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,321
They have been meeting
up outside of, uh, calls

1356
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:38,088
To... to dance.

1357
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,490
MAN: Oh, jeez.

1358
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,561
That really bums me out because
we don't need to do this dance.

1359
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,462
CAMERAMAN: It's not.

1360
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:45,630
You never wrote it
into the script?

1361
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,465
GABE FRIEDMAN: No.

1362
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,066
We're going to be
in the basement.

1363
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,236
The General Monster
Is going to come out.

1364
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,671
And instead of
watching this one,

1365
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,540
I cut to this for a
minute and a half.

1366
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,807
GABE FRIEDMAN: No.
- Yes.

1367
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:57,775
GABE: No.

1368
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,644
CAMERAMAN: What time
is it right now?

1369
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:00,945
It's 1:32 AM.

1370
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:05,416
CAMERAMAN: And how much more
do we still have to film?

1371
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,784
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Standing by.

1372
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:13,157
[Music playing] Frightened human
faces... bodies strewn about.

1373
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:14,925
Would you like a
last request before I

1374
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,760
Peck your eyeballs out?

1375
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,829
MARIA GISMONDI: 5, 6, 7, 8, 1.

1376
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:19,930
Hey.

1377
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,566
Good.

1378
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,533
Hey.

1379
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:23,334
Hey.

1380
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,640
Draw a circle.

1381
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,641
Deep out.

1382
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:31,709
Pull in.

1383
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:34,379
Circle.

1384
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:35,280
Deep side.

1385
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,080
Zombie.

1386
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,818
CAMERAMAN: Where's
our DP right now?

1387
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,153
The DPs not coming out.

1388
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,656
If we can't film, what is the
purpose of your being here?

1389
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:46,624
Unless you want to be here.

1390
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,825
No no, no.

1391
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,093
Your purpose is you got
to discuss the next scene.

1392
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:49,960
You work on that, man.

1393
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,995
Well, now he's coming.

1394
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,897
Here he comes.

1395
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,432
No, you're asking
us to eat cold pizza

1396
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,966
And work for three more hours.

1397
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:56,901
CAMERAMAN: Right.

1398
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,369
And we haven't
eaten since 8:00.

1399
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,270
You know what time it is?

1400
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,170
CAMERAMAN: 4:00?

1401
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,038
Yes.

1402
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:02,440
Here's the choice.

1403
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,277
We we can either wrap and then
get... or we can bring in some...

1404
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,012
Try to get hot food here.

1405
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,714
But it's not going to
be instant because they

1406
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:10,815
Have to make the hot food.

1407
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:11,516
BRENDAN FLYNT: I
understand that, yeah.

1408
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:12,517
So we can keep working.

1409
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:13,884
And then the hot food will come.

1410
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,520
And when it comes, we
stop and eat the hot food.

1411
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,254
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We'll stop
and eat the hot food, yeah.

1412
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:18,155
And then we finish up.

1413
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,023
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No problem.

1414
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:19,957
Or we can just wrap.

1415
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,292
BRENDAN FLYNT: Whatever.

1416
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:22,560
But I can't ask my crew...
No, no, I can agree with you.

1417
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,394
To eat cold pizza and
keep working for three hours,

1418
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,261
You know?

1419
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,396
There's a diner
right down there

1420
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:28,265
You can get like burgers

Whatever.

Come up with a plan
and propose it to us.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hot food.
When it comes, we break.

00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:32,870
Meanwhile, we'll keep working.
I don't know.

1425
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,940
I'm too tired to figure
out the catering.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Well, you want to...

1429
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,811
If you want me to handle
catering, I'll leave the set

1430
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:41,879
And handle it.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: You
want to keep working?

00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:43,748
Don't you want me to
do this on the set?

1433
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:44,882
Yes, let's keep doing this.

BRENDAN FLYNT: Or you
want me to do catering?

1435
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:47,552
So I'll take... as long as
you don't mind like hamburgers

1436
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:48,419
And french fries.

1437
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,954
Can we do it?
Yeah, you know?

00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,389
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK,
I'll do the catering.

So I don't know what
the big fucking deal is.

1442
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:00,631
I got people here getting
paid nothing, having no food.

01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:20,718
TIM CRONIN: Fight
choreography is

1596
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,753
Fucking... it's been
slashed and beaten

1597
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:24,521
And thrown out the window.

1598
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,957
CAMERAMAN: So you did
all this work for what?

1599
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,826
For this... get this.

1600
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:29,626
CAMERAMAN: Whoa.

1601
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:30,427
MAN: Get that shit?

1602
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,434
LLOYD KAUFMAN: So Tom is
going to give us a talk

1603
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:39,069
Now on what's coming
out of what orifice.

1604
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:42,940
Yeah, a little bit.

1605
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,408
CAMERAMAN: Is that OK
to have dry ice coming

1606
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:48,045
Out that close to the face?

1607
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,247
Why not?

1608
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:51,048
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

1609
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,116
Roll cameras.

1610
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:53,951
Action.

1611
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:58,055
Jiggle, you die, Caleb.

1612
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,023
Is smoke coming out?

1613
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,791
Is stuff coming out of him?

1614
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,292
Keep doing it.
Smoke.

1615
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,460
We need the smoke.

1616
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,628
And that's the stuff
coming out of his cheeks.

1617
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:09,433
Your beaks.

1618
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:10,234
Your beaks.

1619
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,936
Your beaks.

1620
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,939
The beak... and cut.

1621
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,907
It looked very... it
looked like nothing.

1622
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,408
I didn't see it.
It looked like nothing to me.

1623
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,443
Well, hold it.

1624
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:22,112
When does he die,
too... the alcohol...

1625
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:23,781
Nothing came out of
his mouth or his beak.

1626
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:25,816
It all came down his sides.

1627
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,417
GABE FRIEDMAN: The tube
with the smoke fell out.

1628
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,986
And you weren't listening.

1629
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,154
Oh, you should
have yelled it out.

1630
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:31,555
I was screaming it.

1631
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:33,824
I was so looking forward to
today because it's so much

1632
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,226
Easier than being [inaudible].

1633
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,195
Y'all cut.

1634
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,196
GABE FRIEDMAN: You all cut.

1635
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,365
You both flipped out.

1636
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:42,399
No, and then so what?

1637
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:43,200
We...

1638
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,168
The tube fell out.

1639
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,102
The tube fell out.

1640
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,303
The tube has fallen out.

1641
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:47,772
You got to put up
with us flipping out.

1642
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:49,473
Because then you say
why you said that.

1643
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,841
I don't know how you
couldn't understand

1644
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:51,641
When I was screaming.

1645
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:52,943
I don't hear you.

1646
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,479
It was [mumbling] and the
cameras is whirring around.

1647
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,914
That's why he said cut.

1648
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,383
Yeah cut you understand
or stop or something.

1649
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:00,184
Cut means cut.

1650
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,485
Or emergency or something.

1651
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:02,953
Yeah, you might have to put
up with us yelling at you.

1652
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,254
But then afterwards
you explain why.

1653
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,322
Then we say OK.

1654
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:06,523
It's just a fucking
excuse, right?

1655
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:08,392
Someone could have said
it properly, right?

1656
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,659
You aren't making this easy.

1657
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,829
I heard you say, I said,
yes, I know the tube fell out.

1658
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:12,997
I'm going to just go on anyway?

1659
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,301
LLOYD KAUFMAN: (ON
CAMERA) Cut, cut, cut.

1660
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,235
OK.

1661
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,437
Oh, shit, when did it fall out.

1662
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,873
Now, I do whatever
is next, please.

1663
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:23,707
The tube fell out.

1664
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:24,942
We got eight people saying it.

1665
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:25,675
DIRECTOR: (ON CAMERAS)
We're going to the arm now.

1666
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:26,811
I don't see that.

1667
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,178
I still don't see it.

1668
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,513
There I never heard
him say that either.

1669
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:30,981
Oh, come on, seriously.

1670
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:31,782
I didn't.

1671
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:32,582
I didn't.

1672
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:39,489
[Rain]

1673
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,627
This is Troma plays
with death... number 37.

1674
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,062
And why is that?

1675
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:46,997
Well, because if
this water comes

1676
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:50,067
Through into the electrical
thing, the whole thing blows.

1677
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,002
CAMERAMAN: Still have that
nice, little blankets up there.

1678
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,772
Yeah, that's a quick fix.

1679
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:57,707
But we're investigating
a permanent fix.

1680
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,680
Can you get a broom up here?

1681
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,581
CAMERAMAN: A broom up here.

1682
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:05,983
Yeah, this one's awful.

1683
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:06,917
CAMERAMAN: We need a broom.

1684
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,585
Somebody bring a
broom to the back.

1685
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:09,719
Good work, Kiel.

1686
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,720
I didn't do that.

1687
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:11,721
Thanks for locking it up.

1688
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:12,689
Weren't you supposed
to lock it up.

1689
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,158
- I did.
- It's your responsibility.

1690
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,625
Hey, asshole.

1691
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:18,128
Stay the fuck off the
mic while we're rolling.

1692
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,164
CAMERAMAN: You want to answer
that because I got cursed that.

1693
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:21,131
MAN: What did he say?

1694
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,332
CAMERAMAN: He
said, hey, asshole.

1695
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,201
Stay the fuck off the mic
while we're recording.

1696
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,035
There it is.

1697
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:25,836
Andy.

1698
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:31,508
CAMERAMAN: Figure out what
your real face looks like.

1699
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,943
Yeah.

1700
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:34,278
CAMERAMAN: How
many days in a row

1701
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,445
Have you been in this business?

1702
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,313
Mmm.

1703
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,647
10, 11, 12?

1704
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,648
I don't know.

1705
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,984
I lost track.

1706
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:40,951
CAMERAMAN: So you've been
going at this for a good week

1707
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:41,852
Now being a chicken zombie.

1708
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,287
Yeah, underneath it all.

1709
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:46,023
But, uh, and became
accustomed to it.

1710
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,657
So... it became
very... it actually

1711
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:48,658
Started to become comfortable.

1712
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,927
I started to get
used to photographing

1713
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,997
And being a zombie was...

1714
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:54,764
But the cool thing is
when I asked him today

1715
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,200
Rather him saying,
oh, I'm so tired,

1716
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,434
And it's itchy, and all that.

1717
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:58,502
He says, I'm great.

1718
01:03:58,602 --> 01:03:59,603
I'm great.

1719
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,138
And then that's the
mood of the whole group.

1720
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:02,206
It's so wonderful.

1721
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:04,241
It's such a nice,
uplifting experience,

1722
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,777
Even for a broken down,
drunken, old, low budget

1723
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:08,778
Filmmaker like me.

1724
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:12,016
CAMERAMAN: How are
enjoying your job?

1725
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:14,418
I'm ready to ride.

1726
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,354
I think I didn't know
what I was getting into.

1727
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,589
Lack of sleep... lack of food.

1728
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,226
18 hours day, seven days a
week... sleeping on the floor

1729
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:24,761
With 50 people... not showering.

1730
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,263
CAMERAMAN: No one talked
to you about the way

1731
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,398
Troma was before you
came to work on the set?

1732
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:29,934
No.

1733
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,168
No, they manipulated me.

1734
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:33,103
CAMERAMAN: And you're
saying you don't

1735
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,638
Like living in a
run-down McDonald's

1736
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,473
In the middle of the ghetto?

1737
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:37,908
With a hose for a shower?

1738
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,009
And no potty for pooper?

1739
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,210
And no sink?

1740
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,478
CAMERAMAN: Think
you'll ever be back...

1741
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:42,312
Fuck no.

1742
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,848
CAMERAMAN: for another movie?

1743
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,716
This battle is not for me.

1744
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:50,754
I got some coffee.

1745
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,356
I got a decent amount of
sleep last night... more than I

1746
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:54,258
Got in the past two days.

1747
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,325
A lot of love in the air today.

1748
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:56,526
We're going to make
a decent fucking

1749
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,228
Movie... not a good
movie, not a bad movie,

1750
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,596
But a decent fucking movie.

1751
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,734
Fucking General monster, dude.

1752
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,005
This is the fucking
apex of the movie.

1753
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:11,141
The hardest thing to do is
like being in a creature suit

1754
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,843
And be directed because
you can hardly hear... you

1755
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:15,145
Can hardly do any motion.

1756
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,347
So of course we chosen
the person on the set who

1757
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:18,882
Can speak the worst English.

1758
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:20,917
Oh, it's a camera.

1759
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:21,785
CAMERAMAN: How's it going?

1760
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:23,553
It's that suit pretty hot?

1761
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,189
Super-hot.

1762
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,291
Super... it... when it's...

1763
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,561
Why do they pick a French guy?

1764
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,396
He comes out.

1765
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,563
He's like this.

1766
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,699
And then we cut.

1767
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:36,500
Tell him that.

1768
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,467
Do that.

1769
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:38,802
Otherwise he's
going to do nothing.

1770
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:40,904
I believe that he is doing
that but [speaking french]

1771
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,640
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look at
the right because that's

1772
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,275
Where the heroes will get...

1773
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:48,512
DIRECTOR: 1, 2, 3, action.

1774
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,514
[Speaking french]

1775
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,350
DIRECTOR: Action!

1776
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,285
CREW: [speaking french]

1777
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:10,034
Just I was afraid because
of the hat because she fell,

1778
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,168
You know?

1779
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:16,040
And that's why I am not
completely satisfied.

1780
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,274
But it's OK.
I love it.

1781
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,208
Yeah, it's really great.
CAMERAMAN: No, no.

1782
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,076
Looked pretty good, man.

1783
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,344
Looked pretty good, man.

1784
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,812
LLOYD KAUFMAN: When you're
making low-budget movies,

1785
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,283
It's very hard to find
old people... I mean,

1786
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:28,085
Mature people who can act.

1787
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:31,221
And if they are any good,
there in the union or they're

1788
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,289
Successful.

1789
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:33,923
And in this particular
part of old Arbie,

1790
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:35,592
It's fairly physical.

1791
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,294
Ah!

1792
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,496
You have to wear this
mask and, uh, makeup.

1793
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:43,733
And so there are probably no
old person who could do it.

1794
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,303
[Mumbling]

1795
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,340
[Laughing]

1796
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:55,879
BRENDAN FLYNT: There's supposed
to be smoke here, I think.

1797
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:58,948
CREW: Did you unplug it?

1798
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:00,550
CREW: We're about to use it.

1799
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,351
CREW: Oh, OK.

1800
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,890
How could you
not laugh with us?

1801
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:07,691
Like a ballerina.

1802
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,696
CAMERAMAN: Allyson, you
look beautiful today.

1803
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,064
Did you do something
with your hair?

1804
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:14,864
Cut your hair?

1805
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,671
Why are you putting the
plastic bag over your head?

1806
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:33,483
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Quiet!

1807
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,018
Shut the fuck up.

1808
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,454
To the bases.

1809
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,422
Let's go!

1810
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,357
[Screaming]

1811
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:46,863
Get up high in the back.

1812
01:07:46,963 --> 01:07:47,764
Get up high.

1813
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:48,598
That's it.

1814
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:49,999
Lots of chicken... chicken too.

1815
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,934
Chicken.

1816
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:52,702
You're not doing
chickens, folks.

1817
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:01,345
I don't know.

1818
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:02,646
I'm freaked out.

1819
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,980
LLOYD KAUFMAN: They're
not even made up.

1820
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,515
They are not attempted
to be made up.

1821
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:06,716
Can you get somebody
with black...

1822
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:07,817
CREW: This?

1823
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:08,785
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No, not that.
The black stuff.

1824
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:09,953
DIRECTOR: What
camera roll is this.

1825
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,155
You guys should
be watching this.

1826
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:13,056
We do it every night, every day.

1827
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:14,324
I say watch the thing.

1828
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,627
It's the scene featuring
zombies reaching.

1829
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,796
And they all have these
hands that are white as snow.

1830
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,169
Make sure to
fuck up their hair,

1831
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,436
Then the undersides
of their arms,

1832
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,672
And the backs of their necks.

1833
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:31,007
And if we're in a big hurry,
then maybe if everyone

1834
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,376
Is not done, there's a reason.

1835
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:36,380
But these people have been here
since 2:00 in the afternoon.

1836
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,914
So the thing we just did.

1837
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,150
It's going to look
like a student movie.

1838
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,386
But I'm not re-shooting
it because we

1839
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:43,353
Don't have enough film.

1840
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,154
MAN: [inaudible]

1841
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:51,094
Good.

1842
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:52,429
All right, go away.

1843
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,269
Maybe you and the priest
go because my guess

1844
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:02,739
Is we're going to get very
little done on our scene.

1845
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:07,143
And, uh, I'm so concerned
you may be uncomfortable.

1846
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:08,144
What do you think?

1847
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:12,115
What time is it?

1848
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:15,952
It's 12:40.

1849
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,560
Yeah, it's just I'm fearful
that we won't make it.

1850
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,462
And then you'll
be uncomfortable.

1851
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,997
Lloyd, I've been in this
for 12 hours already.

1852
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,899
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, but why
not get an hour and a half...

1853
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,435
Why not do it tonight?

1854
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,169
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't think
we're going to make it.

1855
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,137
ALLYSON: Yeah, it's your call.

1856
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,439
Look, there's no
attempt being made.

1857
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:38,575
Caleb is here watching like
as if he saw a car wreck.

1858
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,345
And, uh, and they are
not doing... I just

1859
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:43,012
Have a feeling it's been
like this all night.

1860
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:43,813
There's no movement.

1861
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,718
I think it's wise to do that.

1862
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:59,229
Yeah, maybe next time if you're
going to put flour, water,

1863
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,198
Peanuts, dirt, and shit,
literally, with gnats and stuff

1864
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:06,436
In someone's hair,
maybe think three days

1865
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,639
In advance instead of three
days after to use a wig.

1866
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:14,811
Looks like a punk, feels like
a sneaker... ch, ch, ch, chi!

1867
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,746
Ch, ch, ch, chia motherfuckers!

1868
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:17,747
Yeah!

1869
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:18,715
Ha!

1870
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:19,716
Ha ha!

1871
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:20,684
Woo!

1872
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:21,485
Hoo!

1873
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,652
Woo!

1874
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:23,853
Yeah!

1875
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,889
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, now
you have your celebration.

1876
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,457
It's not stopping.
Wait.

1877
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,258
[Screaming]

1878
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,828
I can't get it to stop.

1879
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,229
I didn't know this thing locks.

1880
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,264
So I put it in lock.

1881
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,232
And I didn't know
how to turn it off.

1882
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,805
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, action.

1883
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,340
CREW: But it has to be...

1884
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,274
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

1885
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:45,208
OK.

1886
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:46,610
CREW: But it has to be her.

1887
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,677
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, I agree.

1888
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:48,678
But who knows.

1889
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:51,481
I just don't [inaudible]
you never know.

1890
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,049
Oh, god, Wendy,
that is just sick...

1891
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,217
Having sex with a corpse?

1892
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:58,988
CREW: He thought she was dead.

1893
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:02,826
A corpse is... a corpse is...

1894
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:08,698
CREW: No, it's not.
- It just lays there.

1895
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:09,833
It does nothing.
A dead person can walk.

1896
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,000
He's a very stupid guy.

1897
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,402
I think it's a funny line.

1898
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:13,570
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That
makes no sense.

1899
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,339
GABE FRIEDMAN: Neither
does a penis chicken.

1900
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,973
Well, are you OK with this?

1901
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,443
And the master if it squirts?

1902
01:11:19,543 --> 01:11:22,346
She does not want to
do the penis monster?

1903
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:23,279
CAMERAMAN: Why not?

1904
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,381
WOMAN: She thinks
it's too gross.

1905
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:27,116
It's pornographic and
demeaning to women.

1906
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,487
And I just... I mean, I'm not
the biggest feminist on earth,

1907
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:31,355
But like...

1908
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,188
CAMERAMAN: No.

1909
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,089
I have my limits, I guess.

1910
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:33,890
CAMERAMAN: No, no, no.

1911
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,091
That's understandable.

1912
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:37,861
After much conversation,
she said that she'll do it

1913
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,196
As long as no cum
gets in her face...

1914
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:45,001
Maybe the boobs... around the
head... nothing in the face.

1915
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:47,371
That way at least her
parents will respect her.

1916
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,172
CAMERAMAN: What's the solution
that they came up with?

1917
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,508
The solution is to have it
happen to Jason instead of me.

1918
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:52,576
CAMERAMAN: Seriously?
- Mhm.

1919
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:53,377
CAMERAMAN: OK.

1920
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:54,711
It comes out.

1921
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,814
It's still going to leak green
vaginal fluids, of course.

1922
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,949
And then nothing happens
until Arbie comes in

1923
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,451
And it says, oh, my god.

1924
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:02,452
Get off my girlfriend.

1925
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:03,553
And he grabs it.

1926
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,422
And he says, get
off my girlfriend.

1927
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:06,823
How can I get you off?

1928
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:08,692
I think it'll be funnier.

1929
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:09,926
And it still we be in bad taste.

1930
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:12,496
But it won't be
just misogynistic,

1931
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:13,363
Which we don't want.

1932
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:14,163
Ah!

1933
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:16,566
I will get you off!

1934
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,334
Maybe I need to beat you off.

1935
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:20,003
Oh, it's going to
be greenish, right?

1936
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:21,104
It's not going to be white.

1937
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:22,305
KIEL: Yeah, it's got
to be covered in slime.

1938
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:23,239
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What's
coming out of it's mouth?

1939
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,040
Milk.

1940
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,941
No, come on.

1941
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:25,742
Puts some color in it.

1942
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:26,843
Why is it milk?

1943
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:27,777
CREW: OK, green then.

1944
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,480
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, green milk.

1945
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,748
GABE FRIEDMAN: Dude,
let's just shoot.

1946
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:32,549
Fuck you.

1947
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:33,683
Come on.

1948
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:37,320
It's not a porno film...
You sophomoric people.

1949
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:38,522
I told you green.

1950
01:12:38,622 --> 01:12:41,725
Green is a chicken color
unless they are shitting,

1951
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:45,228
In which case it has corn in it.

1952
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:47,363
You have to have rules
in these things, right?

1953
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,466
Are you rolling?

1954
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:50,867
This is totally
my favorite scene.

1955
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:51,668
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action.

1956
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,481
I kill myself so that
democracy can survive.

1957
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:08,284
May Allah bless America.

1958
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,088
I kill myself so that
democracy can survive.

1959
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:15,091
I kill myself so
democracy can survive!

1960
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,693
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You look
like you're embarrassed.

1961
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:18,127
You want some tips?

1962
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:18,928
Like that.

1963
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,299
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Try
it again, please.

1964
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,534
Dancing.

1965
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:28,071
(SINGING) I [inaudible]
faces, bodies strewn about.

1966
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:30,940
Would you like a
last request before I

1967
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,041
Peck your eyeballs out?

1968
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,543
I'm a professional dancer.

1969
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:34,811
I know what to do.

1970
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,246
[Music playing] You white
devils are a vegan breed.

1971
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,249
You know that love
just step in greed.

1972
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,085
But I love Arbie, yes it's true.

1973
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:42,886
They do the chickens.

1974
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:43,687
We love them too.

1975
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:44,821
I think it's important.

1976
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,758
I think somehow... no,
that was good, Faith.

1977
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,259
The only time it
looked bad was when

1978
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:51,294
You weren't doing something.

1979
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,462
She was awful.
In half the scene.

1980
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:53,997
She would be just be
sitting there like this...

1981
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,131
Like a pipe cleaner doll.

1982
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:58,401
[Music playing] Would
you like a last request

1983
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:00,336
Before I peck your eyeballs out?

1984
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,772
Mr. Chicken, I
have a confession.

1985
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,708
Before our bones,
you start mashing.

1986
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,676
Can't you see that
we're in love?

1987
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,178
Sorry, I don't give a fuck.

1988
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,080
We just came to cluck shit up.

1989
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,983
You show no love
for the redskin man.

1990
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,919
You came, you saw,
you raped our land.

1991
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:18,421
Home run, KW.

1992
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:19,956
Home run.

1993
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,825
Are you giving me
the beak or the claw?

1994
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:24,093
I don't know which one
I'm supposed to give you?

1995
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,562
CREW: It's going to
start out with a closeup

1996
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:30,166
Of his fingernails digging
for a scratch and popping off.

1997
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:32,769
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
we're not exactly...

1998
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:33,603
Looks like something...

1999
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,076
BRENDAN FLYNT: The
General blew up.

2000
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,110
Supposedly the General blew up.

2001
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,079
And it just went
[explosion sound]

2002
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,216
Blood all over, right?

2003
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,017
Yep.

2004
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:52,021
So it can blow up right here.

2005
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,523
That's fine.

2006
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:54,991
He's going to blow!

2007
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,032
That was anti-climactic.

2008
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:09,739
We just made a company
move to our flat plain

2009
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,675
Which Brendan wants.

2010
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:13,342
The way Brendan is
going to shoot it,

2011
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,544
It's going to look
they are driving.

2012
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,880
He's going to frame out
this off the ground.

2013
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,448
If you see a tree or a
house, then obvious the car

2014
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:20,850
Is not moving.

2015
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:24,353
So we angle the car so that my
camera angle will get more sky

2016
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,521
And not see the treeline.

2017
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:32,128
I'm not sure how you make
a car look like it's moving.

2018
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:36,499
Let's have someone tell the
kid to let her sip the stuff.

2019
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,467
Or pretend to sip it or chug it.

2020
01:15:38,568 --> 01:15:40,303
And then just crush
it with your hand.

2021
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:41,738
- No, don't crush it.
- OK, don't crush it.

2022
01:15:41,838 --> 01:15:42,538
No noises.

2023
01:15:46,943 --> 01:15:48,745
Now, these we
put it on a dolly.

2024
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:52,081
And we just rock it back
and forth a little bit

2025
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,250
To look like we're driving
next to it as it's moving.

2026
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,051
Never look right.

2027
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,823
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Because
we are perfectionists,

2028
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:02,558
We are going to re-shoot
in the graveyard.

2029
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,493
And it shows you
that we are serious.

2030
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:06,663
We want to really make
the scene, uh, good.

2031
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,831
We end where we began.

2032
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:10,533
LLOYD KAUFMAN: And action.

2033
01:16:10,634 --> 01:16:12,268
[Music playing]

2034
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,008
It felt like I was on "Oz."

2035
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:19,809
I felt violated.

2036
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:24,013
I'm glad it worked.

2037
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:25,448
I hope it was in focus.

2038
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:26,883
Uh, is that focused?

2039
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:31,688
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
I don't know yet.

2040
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:33,089
John, you got to keep
your feet planted.

2041
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:44,467
Oh, fuck.

2042
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,035
CAMERAMAN: So how are
you feeling today, Lloyd.

2043
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,637
Oh, very good.
Thank you very much.

2044
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:48,571
How are you?

2045
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:49,505
CAMERAMAN: I'm good.

2046
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,439
Yep.

2047
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:51,474
CAMERAMAN: Excited about today?

2048
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:54,878
We still have a
final... final surprise.

2049
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:57,947
On the last day.

2050
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:01,350
All we have to do is film two
seconds of this stupid fucking

2051
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,352
Shithole.

2052
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,722
I was minding my own
business shaving this morning.

2053
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:08,958
And I get a phone
call of Andy saying,

2054
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,159
I have some disturbing
news for you.

2055
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,095
GABE FRIEDMAN: Lloyd,
do you want to see this?

2056
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:16,465
Hello, yes, Andy, what?

2057
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:17,801
What?

2058
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:19,769
Today's the day that we had
to do the establishing shots

2059
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:23,973
Of the American Chicken Bunker
and the exploding building

2060
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,075
With the matt shot... the same
thing we did in "Toxi IV"

2061
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:27,610
Where you take a
photo of the building

2062
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:29,512
And you line it up with
the actual building.

2063
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:31,114
Then you blow it up.

2064
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:33,649
But this morning, I got a call
from Ryan who said that when

2065
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,919
He woke up, the sign was gone.

2066
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:37,253
And it turns out
that the man who

2067
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,789
Installed them decided to
take them down and figured we

2068
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:40,824
Were done.

2069
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:41,991
What the heck... why
did you take it...

2070
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,493
Who told them to take it down?

2071
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:45,895
Why did the guy
take the sign down?

2072
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,530
What gave him the
idea to take it down?

2073
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,565
Whose bright idea was that?

2074
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,968
Which efficient
Troma person told

2075
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:54,037
Them to take the sign down when
we're going to be shooting it?

2076
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,275
This was supposed to
be very quick, easy day.

2077
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,745
And as everything
goes in Tromaville,

2078
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:03,246
It's completely fucked.

2079
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:04,447
We've used different actors.

2080
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:06,382
We got a kabuki car that's
got a different color.

2081
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:07,851
It doesn't matter.

2082
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:09,652
Nobody is going to be
looking for a sign, right?

2083
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:11,287
They are just going to
see a place blow up.

2084
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:13,089
People want to see
things blow up.

2085
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,825
So let's make it happen
no matter what, please.

2086
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:18,928
So the sign is
40 feet by 5 feet.

2087
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,397
It weighs more than
Joe Fleischaker.

2088
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:22,732
And um...

2089
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:24,901
CAMERAMAN: And you've
got to sit on this thing.

2090
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:25,935
The corner of the thing.
It's on the corner.

2091
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:26,736
We're breaking it.

2092
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:27,570
We're breaking it.

2093
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,372
There's literally no support.

2094
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:30,406
I mean, you drop.

2095
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:31,741
Look... look how fast
that thing flies.

2096
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:32,608
MAN: Yeah, I know.

2097
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,077
[Drilling]

2098
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,415
Beautiful.

2099
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:40,549
OK, I got it.
Got it.

2100
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,350
Got it?

2101
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,151
Great.

2102
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:42,952
Yeah, thank you.

2103
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:43,920
BRENDAN FLYNT: OK, listen up.

2104
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:44,854
For the...

2105
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,222
Quiet everybody.

2106
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,025
BRENDAN FLYNT: Listen up for
the explosion, all right?

2107
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:49,959
I was trying to think.

2108
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:54,297
Just do two.

2109
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,264
Just break it up.

2110
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:56,199
And put the powder in it.

2111
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,000
