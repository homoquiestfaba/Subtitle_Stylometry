How about...

00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,643
something a little more classic?

18
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,773
That is the one.

00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,358

Sorry, yeah. Um, I'm looking
to get a present for my girlfriend.

28
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,386
I was hoping that one of those blue boxes
would do the trick.

29
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,638
Okay. Anything specific you had in mind?

30
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,973
Not really.

31
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,434
Uh, just hopefully something
that's reasonable.

32
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,979

- No, no, I'm fine.
- Yep, you're okay.

00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,065
Hmm.

52
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,402
Mmm!

53
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,279
You needed harissa. Perfect.

55
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,950
- Great. Actually...
- Are you talking to your fish again?

56
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,328
- No.
- Uh-huh.

57
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,746
I'm talking to my soup.

58
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,831
Oh, okay. Well, I come bearing Eureka.

59
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,291
Oh, my God, thank you.

60
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,084
Yeah. That's just the type of friend I am.

61
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,128
You just asked for lemons,
but I know you like...

62
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,130
BOTH:
Eureka!

63
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,757
Yeah, 'cause you like doing that.

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,925
Had to.

65
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,635
Okay, wow!

66
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,845
Casual at-home anniversary, huh?

67
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,555
Ha ha.

68
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,308
Rach, I love that you finally framed this.

69
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,144
I will always love our firstborn.

70
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,315
Even if that one critic did say the
ambiance reminded him of a gas station.

71
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,194
I personally like gas stations.
They have really good snacks.

72
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,029
God, you have such a good attitude.

73
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,447
- It's terrifying.
- (laughs)

74
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,782
Um, I need to change.

75
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,575
Can you simmer the soup
in like two minutes, please?

76
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,619
Okay. You got, uh, food
in your hair, by the way.

77
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,956
- Yeah, right there.
- Hmm? Oh. Oh.

78
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,834
Yo, it's amazing what a mess
you're capable of making.

79
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,629
It looks like you taught a cooking class
to a bunch of toddlers.

80
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,589
Yeah, that's the vibe I was going for.

81
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,385
Um, you should get going 'cause
Gary's gonna be here around 7:00.

82
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,389
Okay, so I guess I'll leave
in, what, like two, three hours, then?

83
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,225
That's hilarious.
What are you, a stand-up comedian?

84
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,726
I been working on a tight five.

85
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,894
(chuckles)

86
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,188
By the way, I saw his write-up
in <i>New York Magazine.</i>

87
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,358
- You did?
- New York's freshest tattoo artist.

88
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,068
I assume you helped with that?

89
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,279
- Hmm.
- Okay, I did.

90
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,032
What? So I sent him
a bunch of our cannoli.

91
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,159
I was like, "Maybe you can put in
a good word with the culture editor,"

92
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,079
- and they did.
- Hmm. Aren't you generous.

93
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,082
You can bribe people with cannoli.
Good to know.

94
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,252
Terri, you haven't said anything
about my outfit.

95
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,545
What do you think?

96
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,880
- You look incredible.
- It's a lot.

97
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,008
It's a lot, but I'm thinking
it's sort of giving off

98
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:03,345
a J.Lo picking up her kids from school
on the way to the Grammys vibe.

99
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,972
He definitely won't notice
this messy-ass kitchen.

100
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,890
No, he won't.

101
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,726
- (phone vibrating)
- (laughs) Oh, your phone's ringing.

102
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,186
- Oh.
- It's Gary.

103
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,313
(singsongy):
Looks like I'm having fish tonight.

104
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,441
- Terri.
- What?

105
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,526
Hi, honey. You on your way?

106
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,197
I'm sorry, who's this?

107
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,908
What?

108
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,326
(tablet ringing)

109
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,328
I can't find it anywhere.

110
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,706
If I help you find your phone,
will you give me one as a thank-you?

111
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,417
Don't start. And don't tell her,
because you know she hates it.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,585
Hey, hey!

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,795
- VANESSA (over tablet): Aloha.
- Mahalo.

114
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,505
- Girl.
- Oh, please.

115
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,382
Like you've never seen <i>Moana.</i>

116
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,217
- How is it going over there?
- It's the best.

117
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,887
All the trees are lit,
we went ice-skating,

118
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,597
and we saw a guy get hit by a car.

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,599
- Oh, my God.
- No. It was a good... really good day,

120
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,435
minus the guy and the car,
but he's fine, I-I think.

121
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,978
You know, we could do it all again
once you get here.

122
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,063
No need.

123
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,774
Yeah, I remember very well,
you know, the crowds, the smells.

124
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,901
I actually like all those things.

125
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,320
- When's your flight get in?
- Uh, tomorrow night at 5:00.

126
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,447
What are you guys gonna do until then?

127
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,242
Well, Daisy's gonna hang out with Nina,
who she hasn't seen since the first grade.

128
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,869
Oh, fun. Okay.

129
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,704
Yeah, while Dad has his meeting.

130
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,499
- What meeting?
- WOMAN: Vanessa, margarita time!

131
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,625
I'm coming.

132
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,337
Okay, I have to go, but I will see you
guys so soon with lots of presents, okay?

133
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,964
DAISY: Have fun on the last day
of your girls' trip.

134
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:27,179
(sighs) So, here's the thing about
not telling Vanessa about the meeting.

135
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,305
What's wrong?

136
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,267
You said you "think" that man's okay.

137
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,394
Look, sweetie... (stammers)

138
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,647
the ambulance got there really quickly.

139
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,857
But sometimes people aren't okay.

140
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,859
What if he's not?

141
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,570
You're right.

142
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,573
I think he's fine, but in the morning,

143
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,202
we can go to the hospital
and-and check up on him.

144
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,703
Okay.

145
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,789
- (monitor beeping steadily)
- RACHEL: The doctor on call last night

146
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,457
told me that he had a concussion.

147
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,875
How bad is it?

148
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,753
- How do you feel?
- I've felt worse.

149
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,464
Concussion's mild.
You know, no broken bones.

150
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,715
Maybe a bruise here and there.

151
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,717
- That's it?
- That's it.

152
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,719
(sighs) Damn it.

153
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,556
- My phone.
- Your what?

154
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,057
It's cracked.

155
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,976
- (chuckles)
- Yeah, you're right.

156
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,477
It seems like he's gonna be just fine.

157
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,396
All right, well, Rita's got it from here.

158
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,897
- Okay.
- All right.

159
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,569
Okay, so we're holding him for an MRI
because he has some memory loss.

160
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,737
Memory loss? She didn't say anything...

161
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,447
You don't remember
what happened last night?

162
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,324
Not really.

163
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,659
I mean, that can't be good.
That sounds bad.

164
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,536
Is that... is that serious?

165
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
He's gonna be fine.

166
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,540
So I should be getting seen
any minute now, right?

167
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,293
Uh, looks like not until tonight,
um, worst-case tomorrow.

168
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,713
- You should go.
- No.

169
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,381
I'm not leaving you here.

170
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,674
Come on. Really.

171
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,301
You should be more worried
about my phone right now.

172
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,719
Stop it.

173
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,262
It's broken.

174
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,722
I'm totally fine.

175
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,973
You should be at the restaurant.

176
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,725
Seriously.

177
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,935
- You sure?
- Yeah.

178
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,896
Okay.

179
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,566
- Bye.
- I'm gonna take your stuff.

180
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
This is it.

181
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,236
Take good care of him.

182
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,322
- I love you.
- Love you.

183
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,656

Hey, what's the snack situation here?

185
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,453
Hmm?

186
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,832
No, no, we're not family.
We just... we wanted to check up on him.

187
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,460
All we know is that he was hit by a cab.

188
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,712
I'm sorry, I can't release information
on patients,

189
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,088
especially if you don't even
know his name.

190
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,799
Please. We just want to know if he's okay.

191
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,594
All right? He came in last night.
He was hit by a cab in SoHo.

192
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,930
My dad brought him back to life.

193
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,224
No. (stammers)
Um, no, that's-that's not...

DAISY:
But you did. It was because of you.

195
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,518
Excuse me?

196
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,229
- That's not exactly what happened.
- Hi.

197
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,688
Hi.

198
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,817
Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard you...

199
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,195
Were you guys there last night
with the guy that got hit by the taxi?

200
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,488
You know you don't
have to disclose anything.

201
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,407
Oh, no, I know. His name's Gary.
He has a concussion.

202
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,409
- Oh, no.
- Oh, but it's so small.

203
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,119
- He's gonna be totally fine. Yeah.
- ETHAN (sighs): Oh, good.

204
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,913
We're glad to hear that. You hear that, D?

205
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,122
What happened?

206
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,541
Uh, I'm sorry, you guys can't linger here.

207
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,753
If you want to finish this conversation,
you're gonna have to take it elsewhere.

208
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,465
- Are you and Gary married?
- Uh, no, no. We're...

209
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,008
We are... we're...

210
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,010
- Best friends.
- Well...

211
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,428
Are you a stripper?

212
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,972
- What? (chuckles)
- ETHAN: Wow.

213
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,890
Do you live in New York?

214
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,184
Yeah, I live in, uh, Queens.

215
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,394
- What about you?
- DAISY: L.A.

216
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,314
But we used to live here,
uh, and we might come back.

217
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,316
Well, that's cool.
You can work from either city.

218
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,818
Bicoastal. Fancy.

219
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,903
Uh, kinda.

220
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,240
You know, I-I'm a creative writing
professor at UCLA.

221
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,200
- Cool.
- DAISY: But he's also an author,

222
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,327
and he wants to write another book.

223
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,288
All right. So, yeah.

224
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,831
We probably should bounce

225
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,458
before Rachel here leaves
with our Social Security numbers.

226
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,585
At least I didn't ruin the proposal.

227
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,464
I heard nothing.

228
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,216
I heard absolutely nothing.

229
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,054
I'm losing it. I should go get some sleep,
put on human... human people clothes.

230
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,015
I'm wearing heels in a hospital.

231
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,184
That is what I'm... doing. I got to go.

232
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,228
Sleep sounds most important right there.

233
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,480
- I think you're right.
- Yeah, I think so, too.

234
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,900
So, if you guys find yourselves
in Bryant Park at all,

235
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,611
my restaurant has, uh, a little spot
in the Christmas market,

236
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,490
and I would really love to
properly thank you with a meal or...

237
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,950
- Oh, for real? Yeah.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,160
What's it called?

239
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,078
It's called Gillini. It's a bakery.

240
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,456
- Bakery?
- Uh-huh. And a restaurant in Little Italy.

the biggest consumer of bread in America.

- Yeah.

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,216
And, uh, yeah, thank you for getting that.

338
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,218
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Have a great one.

339
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,928
- Is it coming out or... Oh, man.

341
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,514
- Uh, would you...
- Oh, sure.

342
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,475
- All right, all right.

343
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,185

00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,395
- WOMAN: I'll take one of those.
- Got it.

345
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,688

346
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,315
- Okay, great.
- Thank you very much.

347
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,858

- (chuckles) Okay.

348
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,526

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,403

00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,292

Oh, no.

361

I have a little hot chocolate left.
Would you like a cup?

362
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,563
Sure.

363
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,568
Do you want regular old hot chocolate,
or do you want hot chocolate a la Gillini?

364
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,778
(Ethan chuckles)

365
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,948
(laughs) Whatever the chef recommends.

366
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,617
This is what the chef recommends.

367
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,453
- Ah, oh.
- (laughs)

368
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,288
Okay.

369
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,581
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,501
You are my friend.

371
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,546
You're delicious, and you make me happy.

372
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,548
We're gonna pour a little bit of you.

373
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,091
- (laughs)
- And a little more of you.

374
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,968
- Okay.
- I have a small tendency

375
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,345
of talking to my culinary creations.

376
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,848
I talk to myself all the time
when I write.

377
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,725
Well, mostly yell at myself,
but same same.

378
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,017
- Cheers.
- Mm.

379
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,145
- (chuckles)
- Cheers.

380
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,815
- Shit.
- Good, right?

381
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,817
What?

382
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,902
Well, as a thank-you...

383
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,075
...for you.

384
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,665
What?

385
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,128
Uh, my late wife and Daisy,
they used to bake bread together.

386
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,379
Right around Christmas.

387
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,964
Was she a baker?

388
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,674
- No, it was... the bread was awful.
- (laughs)

389
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,884
The bread was awful.

390
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,635
- Bread is hard.
- Really hard.

391
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,347
(sighs) I hadn't thought about it
in a while.

392
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,934
What was she... like,
if you don't mind me asking?

393
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:45,148
No. She was like, uh, like a song.

394
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:49,444
Like a song that you wanted to play
over and over again.

395
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,947
The risk of love is loss, right?

396
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,285
That's something my mom used to say.

397
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,206
When did you lose your mom?

398
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,749
Uh...

399
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,086
I had just turned nine, so...

400
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,048
(sighs)

401
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,217
Well, that's all the time
that we have here, so...

402
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,343
(both laugh)

403
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,719
I'll invoice you.

404
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,387
(laughs)

405
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,476
How'd you decide that this is
what you wanted to do, though?

406
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,602
Like, to bake.

407
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,812
It was never really, like,
a firm decision.

408
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,314
I just kept falling
more and more in love with it.

409
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,567
It's like a meditation,
it's a love language all in one.

410
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,902
It's messy, but I just...

411
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,030
I love that something beautiful
always comes out of the mess.

412
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,282
I like that. It's cool.

413
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,577
I don't mean to pry.
What was... what were you...

414
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,329
Daisy was saying you're writing a book?

415
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,414
- Another book, yeah.
- Oh, so there was a first?

416
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,834
Yeah, it was a disaster,
the <i>Titanic </i>of books, yeah.

417
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,794
(laughs) I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

418
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,379
Well, nobody died from it.

419
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,674
You know, Gillini was not
my first go-around.

420
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,553
My first go-around,
my first restaurant was a big flop.

421
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,931
Huge. Embarrassing.
Disastrous. Bankrupting.

422
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,057
- You get the point.
- (laughs): Yeah.

423
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,769
If yours was the <i>Titanic</i> of books,
mine was the <i>127 Hours</i> of restaurants.

424
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,980
- Wow. (laughs)
- But Gillini...

425
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,691
Gillini was always my dream, you know?

426
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,401
Toss this out.

427
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,695
Okay.

428
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,988
Do you know what this is?

429
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,155
A croissant.

430
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,617
First of all, this is a cornetto.

431
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,120
(laughs):
Okay. All right.

432
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,831
Little-known Italian cousin
of the renowned croissant.

433
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,332
Thank you very much.

434
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,002
You know why it tastes so good?

435
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,255
Because it was baked with love,
not strategy.

436
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,883
- And probably a shit-ton of butter.
- Oh, yeah.

437
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,554
Maybe you need to start
doing things with your heart.

438
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,763
Not your head.

439
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,058
(chuckles)

440
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:48,605
Well, I do have this one idea
that I... I really love.

441
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,898
Tell me. What is it?

442
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,234
I kind of got to show you to explain it.

443
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,154
If you, if you have time, we could...

444
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,866
I don't know, um... Yeah.

445
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,200
I mean, I guess I have a little time.

446
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,411
We could drop these off at the shelter
and then check it out quickly.

447
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,787
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

448
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, that-that'd be great.

449
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,625
Okay.

450
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,878
My secret spot.

451
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,421
What do you think?

452
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,924
- Well...
- Yeah, it's like, can you believe

453
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,634
no one is ever here?

454
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,344
That's, um...

455
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,390
I mean, that's-that's crazy.

456
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,975
Have you been here?

457
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,686
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

458
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,356
Um... yeah, maybe a few times, but...

459
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,109
- Wow. Dang.
- (laughing)

460
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,321
Well, great minds think alike.

461
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,657
No, I love it here.

462
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,867
This is what inspired my idea.

463
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,869
Go on.

464
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,162
Tell me.

465
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,165
It's a novel about light and dark
based in New York City.

466
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,875
It's this little girl.

467
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:55,838
She finds her imaginary friends
in the shadows of the city buildings.

468
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,967
So it's all about how
she creates this world where

469
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,681
people overlook the shadows, but
that's where she finds beauty and life.

470
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,267
This...

471
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,727
This is your cornetto.

472
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,980
Yeah, maybe it is.

473
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,815
I think it is.

474
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,694
(phone vibrating)

475
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,779
Oh, it's Gary. Um, one sec.

476
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,447
Hi, honey. How you feeling?

477
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,075
(phone dings)

478
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,369
Oh, my God, that's great.
That's great. Okay.

479
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,329
Well, I'm close, so I-I'll be right there.

480
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,707
All right, I love you. Bye.

481
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,834
Gary just got out of his MRI.

482
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,877
Yeah, Vanessa just, uh, text me.

483
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,005
Her flight just got here,
so I should probably go.

484
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,131
Okay.

485
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,674
Thanks for everything tonight. (chuckles)

486
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,467
Yeah. I'm glad Gary's okay.

487
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,302
Uh, M-Merry Christmas.

488
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,679
Merry Christmas.

489
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,389

Oh, good. Thank God. Okay.

00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,830
Hey, babe, um, why don't you pause

We have Chrismukkah presents to open.

Are you sure you don't want to eat first?

521
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,853
Because when eggs sit on the stove,
bacteria festers,

522
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,189
and that bacteria gets much worse,
like, more deadly

Wait, there's only two tickets.

683
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,738
Dais, you can handle yourself, right?

684
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,824
I figured a girls' day might be in order.

685
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,993
Wow. And what are you gonna do?

686
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,079
That three-story Olive Garden
in Times Square looks fun.

687
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,872
(laughs):
Nah, nah.

688
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,417
I-I think I'm gonna try to write.

689
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,714
Yeah, I haven't done it in a while, and
the city is really inspiring me right now.

690
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:26,468
Wait, you're gonna (chuckles)
write on our vacation?

691
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,137
I-If that's cool.

692
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,806
You know, uh, I asked for
a girls' day out anyway.

693
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,474
So I feel like I could use one.

694
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,934
- Thanks, Dad.
- (sighs)

695
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,895
Yeah. I-I feel very honored.

696
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,856
Um, I will get dressed,
and we will head out.

697
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,941
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

698
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,820
- Thank you. Wish me luck.
- Okay.

699
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,866
(door opens, closes)

700
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,160
Please don't tell me
you forgot your phone again.

701
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,954
You got to go get the ring back.

702
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,914
Just remember not to say anything.

703
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,875
I won't say anything.

704
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,668
I won't. Promise.

705
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,424
(door opens, closes)

706
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,968
- TERRI: Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

707
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,304
What did you need again?
It was, uh, black truffles and...

708
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,181
Porcini mushrooms.

709
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,265
Oh, and I talked to the wheelman.

710
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,267
He said he's gonna get the entrées
out of the window much faster tonight.

711
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,269
Perfect. I'm gonna get some more focaccia.

712
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:18,604
Okay.

713
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,526
TERRI:
Porcini.

714
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,781
- Hi. Uh, sorry, yeah.
- Hi.

715
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,617
Um, I'm-I'm looking for Rachel Meyer.

716
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,577
And who might you be?

717
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,537
- (laughs) Sorry, I'm Ethan.
- Ethan.

718
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,625
Hello again. (chuckles)

719
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,834
Hi.

720
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,920
Mr. East River. Ooh.

721
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,338
Yeah, this is... th-th...

722
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,131
this is Terri, my business partner.

723
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,009
I also identify as her best friend.

724
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,345
Business partner, best friend.
She does it all.

725
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,056
I was actually looking for Gary.

726
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,474
Oh.

727
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,851
Uh... okay.

728
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,520
What do you need Gary for?

729
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,315
Yeah, no, sorry.
I-I thought maybe I could meet him here

730
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,693
or you could connect us,
just to check up on him.

731
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,444
How is he, actually?

732
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,571
- Um...
- You're quite the detective, aren't you?

733
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,823
And fine as hell, too.

734
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,700
- What are those, hazel?
- Terri. Oh, my God. Terri.

735
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,076
- Huh? What?
- (laughs)

736
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,495
I need you... we need... can...
We need more focaccia.

737
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,996
Can you go inside
and get some more focaccia?

738
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,915
I know for a fact that
we don't need more focaccia.

739
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,543
But you know what?
I'll go get some ciabatta.

740
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,627
Thank you so much.

741
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,629
- Good day, fine sir.
- Thank you.

742
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,966
- (chuckles): Good day.
- Sorry about that. (laughs)

743
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,094
Um, I'm actually about to go grab a bite
with Gary around the corner.

744
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,595
You want me to give him your number?

745
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,598
Well, I-I was actually hoping
I could meet him.

746
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,017
Oh. Want to eat with me and Gary?

747
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,603
Yeah, that could be cool.

748
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,605
Or I could walk with you.

749
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,650
- Whatever. (chuckles)
- Okay. Sure. Sure.

750
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,193
Absolutely.
I'm gonna put these in the back.

751
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,195
- Okay. (chuckles)
- We'll head out.

752
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,780
Awesome.

753
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,086
- RECEPTIONIST: Gary.
- Oh.

754
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,046
Got time for one more?

755
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,007
(sighs) I should really get going.

756
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,801
Are you sure? This guy requested you, man.

757
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,765
- Ah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

758
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,645
I'm sure Gary will be here any minute.

759
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,441
(sighs) You know, all good.
I could just wait until he gets here.

760
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,198
Hmm?

761
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,367
(chuckles)

762
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,995
Uh... wow.

763
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,538
Oh! Yes.

764
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,791
I forget that it's... yes.

765
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,334
Wow.

766
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,003
Christmas morning.

767
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,005
That's... it...

768
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,258
That looks beautiful on you.

769
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,552
Thank you. Just such a big gesture.

770
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:59,139
It was very unlike Gary, but what a ring.

771
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,849
It's the most beautiful ring
I've ever seen in my life.

772
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,476
Uh-huh.

773
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,852
(chuckles):
Yeah.

774
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,771
No, what about you?
How'd your proposal go?

775
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,147
(clicks tongue)

776
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,440
(exhales heavily)

777
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,566
It didn't.

778
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,151
Oh.

779
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,529
But it will.

780
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,615
(phone dings)

781
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,038
Gary.

782
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,458
Seems like he got caught up at work,

783
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,377
so I don't think he's gonna be able
to make it, actually.

784
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,715
But we could stay if you want.

785
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,384
Sure, yeah.

786
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,469
Sorry about that.

787
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:41,098
Um, how did you and Gary meet?

788
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,517
Actually, this.

789
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,727
I wanted to get a tattoo of my mom's name,

790
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,439
and a few friends recommended this
one shop, and he was the artist available.

791
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:50,774
Which is so funny.

792
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,570
I mean, I know it sounds kind of cheesy,

793
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,905
but now sometimes I wonder if it was fate.

794
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,408
Yeah. It's fun...

795
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,534
- Weird.
- Mm-hmm.

796
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,703
(stammers) Let me ask, uh...
Here's a good question.

797
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,956
- Mm-hmm?
- Gary's a good guy, right?

798
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,041
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

799
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,627
Like... (stammers) like, would he, say,

800
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:14,464
return fi... a five-dollar bill
if someone dropped it?

801
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,549
What?

802
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,343
Yeah, no. That's... Yeah. That is...

803
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,805
Um, I was just trying to, you know,
g-get to know him a little.

804
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,641
- (chuckles)
- How do I describe Gary?

805
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,894
Gary is an artist.

806
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,146
He's super talented.

807
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,982
On the surface,
he can come across a little self-absorbed,

808
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,401
but there's so much more to him.

809
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,987
Nobody stood by me quite like him
when my first restaurant fell apart.

810
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,780
He was amazing.

811
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,365
I'm trying to think of what else.

812
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,326
I mean, there's a lot to say. Uh...

813
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,578
Oh! Another example.

814
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,079
This bracelet was my mom's.

815
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,789
I wear it everywhere.

816
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,416
I do not know
what I would do if I lost it.

817
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,418
It's very precious to me.
You get the point.

818
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,880
I took the bracelet off when
I was in the chair getting my tattoo,

819
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,049
and when I got home,
I realized I didn't have the bracelet.

820
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,594
I panicked, I ran to the station,

821
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,845
and there was Gary.

822
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,224
He rode all the way out to Astoria.

823
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:10,187
And I remember looking at him, being like,
"Wow, this is the kind of guy that he is."

824
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,525
So if I ever... well, when I get frustrated
that he's late or misses dinner

825
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:20,614
or (laughs) is wrapped up in his own stuff
or always on his phone,

826
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,451
I remember that he's the guy that went
eight subway stops out of his way for me

827
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,869
when he didn't even know me.

828
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,871
So, sorry. In the longest answer ever,

829
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,248
yes, he is the kind of guy
who would return five dollars.

830
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,959
(clicks tongue) Wow.

831
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,127
You really do have a thing for bread.

832
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,838
(laughs):
I do. Yeah. I'm sor... Yeah.

833
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,341
- Uh, number one fan.
- Numero uno.

834
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,301
- Number one fan.
- That's you.

835
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,512
DAISY: I can't believe
how they just move all together like that.

836
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,557
I mean, the kids in my grade have a hard
time just getting into alphabetical order.

837
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,310
Yeah, well, you know,
I was jealous that they were so flexible.

838
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:54,064
I do Bar Method three times a week,
and I can barely touch my toes.

839
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,066
- Brian?
- Vanessa.

840
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,818
Hey, how are you?

841
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,278
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good, good.

842
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,363
Uh, I'm sorry.

843
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,073
- This is my colleague David.
- Hey.

844
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,492
David, this is Vanessa Randall.

845
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,246
She was in-house PR for
the YA division before she abandoned us

846
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,248
for the dark side... L.A.

847
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,582
- Ah.
- Well, you know,

848
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,961
three years of slush and street garbage
was plenty for me.

849
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,587
No argument there.

850
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,090
- Uh, this is Daisy, Ethan's daughter.
- Hi.

851
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,551
Brian actually introduced me to your dad.

852
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,345
It's true. You know, he showed me
a picture of you the other day.

853
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:28,140
Listen, I'm so excited Ethan came in.

854
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,934
You know, I've been telling him for ages
to give it another shot.

855
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,436
I bet it was your encouragement.

856
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,109
Uh, I-I always encourage him,
but, you know, you know Ethan.

857
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,111
He just needs to forge ahead.

858
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,821
You know, none of us have
a crystal ball, right?

859
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,407
- Yeah.
- We just got to do our best.

860
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,867
Uh, good to see you.

861
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,326
- You, too. Bye.
- Nice to meet you.

862
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,078
- Bye.
- Bye.

863
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,957
(sighs):
Okay.

864
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,669
(groans) God.

865
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,130
- And these are new.

867
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,303
GARY:
Hey, T.

868
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,264
Well, lookee lookee who it is.

869
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,350
She's mad, huh?

870
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,105
- Well, I came to surprise her.
- Mm.

871
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,315
Got her these flowers.

872
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,442
- Mm.
- Pretty nice, huh?

873
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,569
Yeah, they're from the bodega.

874
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,987
Uh, is she here?

875
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,363
No.

876
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,200
I actually haven't seen her
since she left to meet you.

877
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,952
Mm.

878
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,663
Mm-hmm.

879
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,708
You know what I was thinking about
earlier today?

880
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,710
- What?
- The book you're gonna write.

881
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,879
Ah, well, I hope I write it.

882
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,255
What do you mean, you hope?

883
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:46,968
It's a lot of (sighs) procrastination
mixed in with self-loathing.

884
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,678
I've got a great therapist.

885
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,473
You just got to go for it.

886
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:55,310
I can't wait to be walking by a bookstore
one day and see it in the window.

Um, you're the guy from the accident.

- Yeah.

938
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,664
Um, thank you so much
for what you did, man.

939
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:46,499
It was nothing, man.

to catch up on in here, so...

...thank you again so much
for what you did...

947
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,368

00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,124
The ring that was supposed to be
on my girlfriend's hand right now,

951
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,460
but I saw Rachel wearing it last night.

952
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,796
You saw Rachel last night?

00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,548
Okay. You...

Yes, you do.

959
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,857
You can't be serious
about letting her keep it.

- Mazel.
- Thank you very much.

982
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,206
And I-I just...
I-I wanted to ask you, like,

983
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,124
ab-about cleaning it, keeping it clean.

984
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,960
I've never had anything quite this fancy,
so I don't want to mess it up.

985
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:37,504
Very common question we get.

986
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,547
I have a jewelry care kit that we sell.

987
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,965
Would you be interested in one of these?

988
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,092
Yes, that'd be perfect.
I bake a lot, and I just...

989
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,053
You know, I don't want,
I don't want to ruin it. (chuckles)

990
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,722
- I knew you'd say yes.
- What do you mean?

991
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,475
- I never forget a ring I sell.
- You sold the ring?

992
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,602
He made the right choice.
And it was a tough one.

993
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:53,686
It was?

994
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,139
People around here
say I have a sixth sense.

995
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,731
(laughs)

996
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,816
- About couples.
- Oh, okay.

997
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,945
Anyway, seeing him,
I knew right then, that was the one.

998
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,448
- You did?
- Congratulations again.

999
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,158

1001
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,496
Well, your fiancé's daughter.
She's quite a spitfire.

1002
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,415
- Oh, no, he doesn't have a...
- What was her name?

1003
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,126
I can almost think
it's like a flower... Daisy.

1004
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,962
Daisy.

1005
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,089
Yeah, Daisy's the one
who picked that ring.

1006
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,925
We looked at the cushion cut,
the princess cut,

1007
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,177
- but that was the one for you.
- Um...

1008
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,473
Whoa. What about your care kit?

1009
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:33,685

- T.

1010
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,436
What did you do?

1011
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,689
Uh, wh-what do you mean?

1012
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,234
Uh, I mean she's on
her third batch of rye.

1013
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,236
Well, it is a bread store.

1014
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,530
We don't need that much rye.

1015
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,824
That's her thinking bread.

1016
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,450
What did you do?

1017
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,619
I didn't do anything.

1018
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,581
- Today.
- Oh.

1019
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,583
Yeah.

1020
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:01,879
Gary, get your ass in that kitchen
and fix this, okay?

Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

1026
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,108
A client came in late.

1027
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,027
And, I mean, you know how it is.

1028
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,237
I don't like to say no to the walk-ins.

1029
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,367
Part of that is because of you.

1030
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,494
'Cause of the <i>New York Magazine </i>article.

1031
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,830
Because you're the best.

1032
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,459
(sighs)

1033
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,462
How did you get the ring, Gary?

1034
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,672
What?

1035
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,674
It's...

1036
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:49,552
so extravagant, it's so beautiful,

1037
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,221
you know, I can't help but wonder,
how did you manage that?

1038
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,308
I mean, you did buy it, right?

1039
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,437
Gary?

1040
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,814
You know.

1041
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:04,025
Yeah, I know.

1042
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,443
How?

1043
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:08,946
That doesn't matter, Gary.

1044
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,783
Look, Rachel, I messed up.

1045
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,660
Yes, you messed up.

1046
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,329
But also... (sighs)

1047
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,955
Also, what?

1048
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,042
It's like when I wake up
in the middle of the night

1049
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,878
with some crazy idea for a tattoo.

1050
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,047
Once I sketch it, it becomes obvious.

1051
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,342
When I saw you open that ring box,

1052
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,762
it was the most obvious thing
I'd ever seen.

1053
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,431
What was your plan, though?

1054
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:39,185
What, were you gonna wait until we were
in a nursing home to tell me this story?

1055
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,687
What were you thinking?

1056
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,147
You gave me
somebody else's engagement ring.

1057
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,692
- That's crazy.
- I know. I know.

1058
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,194
It's crazy. I don't know what happened.

1059
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,613
I don't know what happened, Rachel.
I didn't have a plan.

1060
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,699
And then I saw that ring on your finger,

1061
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:57,537
and I realized this is the thing
I want the most in the entire world.

1062
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,623
(sighs) How could I give that back?

1063
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,380
What if there was no ring?

1064
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,507
What do you mean?

1065
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,134
I'm giving it back.

1066
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,302
So I'm asking you right now,
not half-concussed,

1067
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,931
no ring you have to hide behind, like...

1068
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,725
do you still want to marry me?

1069
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,769
Yes.

1070
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,021
Of course I want to marry you.

1071
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,983
I see a future with us.

1072
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,361
If you just give me one more chance,

1073
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:33,072
I will be so much better.

1074
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:34,323
I promise you.

1075
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:38,578
As a matter of fact, I think we should
celebrate the shit out of it. (chuckles)

1076
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,289
Let's have an engagement party.

1077
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,459
I mean, really. We should have
this huge New Year's party here.

1078
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:49,464
My cousin Finn will be in town,
and we can invite everybody that loves us.

1079
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,550
- (laughs)
- (sighs) Because I love you, Rachel.

1080
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,679
Remember to let me do all the talking.

1081
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,848
Why can't you just ask for the ring back?

1082
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,433
It's complicated, honey.

1083
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:04,979
Sometimes, when there's a mix-up, you
got to be careful of people's feelings.

1084
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,898
What about your feelings?

1085
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,197
East River.

1086
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,865
I feel like I should be
more surprised to see you.

1087
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,658
Hi, Terri.

1088
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,494
This is my daughter Daisy.

1089
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,287
Hi. Uh, my dad's gonna do all the talking.

1090
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,791
Don't worry, kid.
I don't know social cues yet either.

1091
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,877
You here to see Rachel? Again?

1092
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,087
Yeah, she-she texted me
and told me to come by.

1093
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,714
Oh, yeah, she's in the back.

1094
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,132
Dad, can I go say hi?

1095
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:35,009
Yeah, go ahead.
She's right around the corner.

1096
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,894
So, um...

1097
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,064
do you have something you want to tell me?

1098
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,316
Or...?

1099
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,318
You know?

1100
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:55,196
I know that something feels off,

1101
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,534
and I have a feeling that
you have something to do with it, so...

1102
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,285
I want to know what's going on.

1103
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,162
For Rachel.

1104
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,875
- Hi, Rachel.
- RACHEL: Hi, Daisy.

1105
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,836
- Hi.
- Is your dad out front?

1106
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,004
- Yep.
- Your dad's here?

1107
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,048
Are you making bread?

1108
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,258
Can I help?

1109
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,426
Of course you... abs...
I need help. That'd be great.

1110
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,928
Um, do you want to grab an apron?

1111
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,471
- Yeah.
- Right there.

1112
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,391
- Can I talk to you for one sec over here?
- Yeah.

1113
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:28,229
What do you want me to do?
Want me to talk to him?

1114
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,482
- I'll handle it.
- Really?

1115
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:35,945
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

1116
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,281
- You're the best.
- Right.

1117
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,032
Well, I'll meet you
at the apartment later tonight.

1118
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:43,286
Maybe we can go over ideas
for New Year's Eve.

1119
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,787
- Yeah?
- Yeah. (laughs)

1120
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,956
- I love you so much.
- Okay.

1121
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,084
I promise I won't mess this up.

1122
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,461
Okay. Bye.

1123
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,547
I'm gonna sneak out back.

1124
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,466
(clicks tongue) All right.

1125
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,801
What?

1126
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,845
He got my ring, I got his present.

1127
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,851
Wow. That is way worse than I thought.

1128
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,770
And I-I tried to tell her the other night,
but I couldn't.

1129
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,439
I just...

1130
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,109
I didn't want to break her heart.

1131
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,404
RACHEL:
All right. Perfect.

1132
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,156
You can get your hands in there.

1133
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,908
Make a little mess.

1134
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,118
(both laugh)

1135
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,621
Yours is way better than mine, PS.

1136
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,788
(both laugh)

1137
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,624
DAISY:
So, how long does this take?

1138
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,709
Takes a while.

1139
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:35,838
Oh. What do you do
while waiting for it to be done?

1140
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:37,715
I don't know. That's a good question.

1141
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,801
What do I do while I wait...
I do a lot of thinking

1142
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,638
while I wait for my bread to bake.

1143
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,223
Well, I also spend a lot of time thinking.

1144
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,314
You know, when I was about your age,
I lost my mom, too.

1145
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:58,736
Do you like thinking about your mom,
or does it make you...

1146
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,529
make you kind of sad?

1147
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:04,116
- A little of both.
- Me, too.

1148
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,953
Can I teach you a little trick
that's helped me?

1149
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,330
- Okay.
- Okay, so you find one thing

1150
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,583
that you did with your mom
that was really special,

1151
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,836
and you make sure
to do that thing once every year.

1152
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,465
And at least for me,
it feels like she's right there with me.

1153
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,093
Mm. Do you have anything like that?

1154
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:26,138
Well, every year, on Christmas Eve,

1155
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:30,017
the three of us would pick out
these really ugly sweaters for each other.

1156
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,852
I mean, they were always so funny.

1157
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,313
But...

1158
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:38,109
we... haven't done it
since she's been gone.

1159
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,694
Uh, yeah.

1160
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,988
You can't stop doing it
'cause she's not here, though.

1161
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,825
You got to keep the tradition alive
because of her.

1162
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,035
- Right?
- Right.

1163
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,621
Your mom sounds like she was pretty cool.

1164
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,291
(softly):
She was.

1165
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,714
Hey.

1166
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,426
RACHEL:
Thank you so much for coming.

1167
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,721
Oh, yeah.
What, uh, what are y'all up to here?

1168
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,556
My God, it looks like I'm in heaven.

1169
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,018
(chuckles) Well, I'm helping make it.

1170
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,270
Yeah? You ask for a paycheck?

1171
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,814
Oops. I forgot. Sorry.

1172
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,359
Can I talk to Rachel for a little bit?

1173
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:22,695
Yeah. I'll invoice you, Rachel.

1174
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,238
(Rachel laughs)

1175
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,323
(Daisy chuckling)

1176
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:31,495
I will just cut right to the chase.

1177
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,997
I know about everything.

1178
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,959
And I know it's insane.
All of it is insane.

1179
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:40,296
(sighs)
I just wanted to say I am so sorry.

1180
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,672
No, I am.

1181
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:44,383
I-I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

1182
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,762
I just didn't think
it was my place to say anything.

1183
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:51,098
Thank you for being
exactly who you are through all of this.

1184
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:53,976
You're a really, really good person.

1185
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,146
I appreciate that.

1186
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,066
I just wanted to apologize myself.

1187
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:03,444
Gary's gonna reach out to you, obviously,

1188
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,821
give the ring back, and, um...

1189
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,866
...then we can all just move on.

1190
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,293
I, uh... I made this one special
for you all to share together.

1191
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,635
Thank you for this.

1192
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,178
Yeah.

1193
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,101
Okay. Well...

1194
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,064

That's it.

1228
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,290

Gary's not perfect either.

1232

I know that, but you don't turn your back

how to tell you that a ring they could
never afford just ended up in their lap.

And I think you got to love people
when you can,

1237

1246
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:22,601
So, there I was, stranded in Brooklyn,
on a Zoom, trying to get a Lyft,

1247
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,478
but it was impossible
because it was rush hour.

I'm a little, a little peckish.

1367
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,398
This is fine. This will do.

1368
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,527
That's why you c...

1369
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,071
(quietly):
you came out to Astoria that night?

1370
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,781
Not to give me my bracelet back?

1371
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,283
Rachel, that isn't fair.

1372
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,909
We weren't even dating yet.

1373
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:15,704
That's so absolutely beside the point.

1374
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,165
You let me think
that it was because of me.

1375
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,500
D-Do you get that?
Do you get why that is hurtful?

1376
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,919
- That was three years ago.
- Exactly.

1377
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,088
It was three years ago. It was last week.

1378
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:26,757
It was yesterday. It was today.

1379
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,384
- We're good.
- We're not.

1380
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:31,303
If we're not good, then we can work on it.

1381
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,263
Gary, this is not working.

1382
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,642
It's just too hard.

1383
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,562
I'm-I'm not saying that it should be easy,
but it shouldn't be this hard.

1384
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,359
You keep digging these holes,
and I keep throwing you rope,

1385
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,778
and I can't do it anymore.

1386
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,241
I can't do it anymore.

1387
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,746
I can't.

Rachel.

1389
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,420
I'm definitely eating
all this dessert tonight.

1390
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:06,880
Well, as long as you're paying.

1391
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,716
- Daisy got it.
- (scoffs) In your dreams.

1392
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,553
Wait, what are we doing here?

1393
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:14,721
You'll see.

1394
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:16,848
- GARY: Please, Rachel, talk...
- What?

1395
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:18,725
GARY:
What the hell is he doing here?

1396
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,019
Hi.

1397
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:22,729
Hey, what...

1398
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,106
I made a reservation.

1399
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,692
I saw this going way differently
in my head.

1400
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,068
What'd you do?

1401
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,113
Do you know these people?

1402
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:35,659
Uh, yeah, that's Rachel
and Gary, the guy Daddy helped.

1403
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:38,995
Oh, hi. I'm Vanessa, Ethan's fiancée.

1404
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,039
There. See?

1405
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:44,209
He proposed to her, she got the ring, and
everything can go back to the way it was.

1406
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,586
No, Gary, no.
Just... What are you talking about?

1407
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,797
Sorry, the ring...
Are you talking about mine?

1408
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,841
Oh, my God.

1409
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,175
Uh, they're getting married.

1410
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:55,178
We actually discussed it.
We're not getting married anymore.

1411
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:56,430
Wait, you're not?

1412
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,348
No, we just broke...

1413
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,685
Does it matter?

1414
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,896
Why do you care
if I marry her or not, hmm?

1415
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,356
I mean, what is it to you?

1416
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,442
Well, I didn't say that,
but you did steal the ring.

1417
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,026
- He didn't steal the ring.
- You cannot prove that.

1418
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,154
- Wait, actually, did you steal the ring?
- No.

1419
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,281
- What is happening?
- I don't...

1420
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,615
Okay, Ethan, what is going on?

1421
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,744
Oh, hey, that night that
Gary got himself hit by a cab...

1422
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:22,038
- I get hit by a car, and it's my fault?
- Probably, but...

1423
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,206
- Terri.
- Okay.

1424
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,000
I bought you that ring.

1425
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,544
He bought Rachel those earrings.

1426
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:31,047
Th-The earrings that I opened
on Christmas?

1427
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,675
That's where you went?
Trying to get the ring back?

1428
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,470
Is there spinach in this?
'Cause, um, I'm allergic.

1429
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,055
Dude, read the room.

1430
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:40,682
All right. That's my bad.

1431
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:44,227
So, did you know about this
the whole time?

1432
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,021
No. I mean, yes.

1433
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,522
Not until recently. Yes, I knew.

1434
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:51,109
And I assume you're the one
who put it in the bread.

1435
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:57,407
Um, did you even mean
to propose that day or...

1436
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,702
- Babe, I... Not that day, but I...
- Okay.

I don't know. I-I don't know.

1450
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,200
I felt like an idiot, Ethan.

1451
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,286
I didn't know you were
gonna make a reservation there.

1452
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,538
Wait.

Just so we're on the same page,
that's what you think the problem is here?

1454

Not the revelation that
you didn't even mean to propose?

1455
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:54,256
Okay. I d... I did mean to propose,
on Christmas Day.

1456
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,716
I fully expected the ring
to be in that bag.

1457

Why didn't you tell me?

I don't know. I... (sighs)

01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:05,350
And what about that meeting the other day
with Brian Harrison?

1460
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:08,019
I ran into him with Daisy the other night,

1461
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:11,648
and he talked to me about
your... your new book?

1462
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:16,069
Y-You didn't mention any of that to me.

I mean, why? Like...

1465
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:24,452
I'm really, really trying
to figure out a good reason,

1466
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:27,038
and I can't come up with it.

1467
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,792
I don't know.

1468
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:33,461
Okay, but, Ethan,

1469
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:36,256
if on any level you do...

1470
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,092
...then just say it.

1471
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,762
Fine. Okay, fine. I...

1472
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:45,432
You're not always supportive.

1473
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,393
Uh, you-you change the subject
every time I talk about my writing.

1474
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:52,314
I thought that maybe you'd think
it was gonna be another failure,

1475
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:56,318
and you'd just be embarrassed of me.

1476
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,946
Well, that's... I mean...

1477
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,909
That sucks.

1478
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:11,625
Look, just forget all of this
for a second, okay?

1479
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,127

01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,602
I want to write another book.

1483
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:36,608
Yeah, I-I want to take another shot.

1484
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:38,568
I feel like I have to.

1485
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:40,737
And...

1486
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,866

Ethan, I...

1488
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:00,590
I hate it here.

1489
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:04,594
I-I don't even like it
when it's 70 and sunny.

1490
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:07,639
Hey, it's... it's too much for me.

1491
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,809
I know.

1492
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,107
And even if it were with you and Daisy...

1493
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:21,194
...I can't move back.

1494
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,826
And I think we both know what that means.

1495
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,164
(Rachel sighs heavily)

1496
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,215
So you just had that ready to go?

1497
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,842
Yep.

I don't understand.

1501
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:55,020
Why did you do that?

1502
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:58,064
Why did you take their reservation
on the night of my engagement party?

I don't know.

1505
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,071
It was dumb.

1506
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,992
I just always had
this bad feeling about Gary, and...

1507
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,870
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just made a mistake.

For what it's worth,

1510
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,261
Ethan just didn't want to crush you.

1511
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,096
That's why he didn't tell you.

1512
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,683
I was gonna be crushed
no matter what, so...
