1
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,142
Help me! Help me. Help me.

2
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,249
<i>My cake is ready.</i>

3
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,061
<i>Time for the show. Everybody on stage.</i>

4
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,278
Ruby?

5
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,322
Is that you?

6
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,620
Goddamn it.

7
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,740
Ruby?

8
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,188
Ruby?

9
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,027
Ruby?

10
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,655
Ruby?

11
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:15,092
If that's you, Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

12
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,135
Ya hear me?

13
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,984
I told you, it's over!

14
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,577
I'm out! Ya hear me?

15
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,226
You're on your own now!

16
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,125
I-

17
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,290
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

18
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,259
Oh.

19
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,199
Huh?

20
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,366
<i>Hello!</i>

21
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,711
Hey!

22
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,806
<i>- Ah! It's hot out here.
- Honey, you ought to stay in the car out of the wind.</i>

23
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,582
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

24
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,817
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

25
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,384
- Get up, jackass.
- Bobby!

26
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,066
Oh. Hey.

27
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:32,661
<i>- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.</i>

28
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,605
Hey!

29
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,008
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

30
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,613
You okay?

31
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,846
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

32
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:52,323
<i>- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
- Doug, relax, please.</i>

33
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,258
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

34
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,263
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

35
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,299
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

36
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,166
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

37
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,802
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

38
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,344
Huh?

39
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,553
<i>Aw, it's okay.</i>

40
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,350
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

41
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,223
<i>Don't see too many travelers around here.
Where y'all headed?</i>

42
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,524
- San Diego.
- California?

43
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,429
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Sure didn't take the fastest road.</i>

44
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,660
<i>Oh, no. We absolutely
had to see the desert.</i>

45
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,135
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

46
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,968
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

47
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,008
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

48
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,601
Yeah.

49
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,647
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

50
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,515
Yeah.

51
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,986
<i>Come here. Come on.
He's a good little piggy.</i>

52
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,855
<i>Little baby piggy.
Little baby piggy.</i>

53
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,986
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

54
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,725
<i>Oh, my God.
That's so random.</i>

55
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,994
You two make a perfect pair.

56
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,263
Hey.

57
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,532
You're sweet.

58
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,302
<i>Yeah.</i>

59
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,242
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

60
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,182
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

61
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:30,187
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

62
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,382
Geez.

63
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,759
She's so uncomfortable
in this heat. I told you to use cloth diapers.

64
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,891
<i>- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.
- Look at those little cheeks.</i>

65
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,132
<i>- I know, sweetheart.
- Yes, she is. It's okay.</i>

66
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,231
<i>I think she's getting hungry again.</i>

67
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,709
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal out here.

68
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,119
No, I don't.

69
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,021
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

70
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,060
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

71
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,653
<i>Honey, you've been on the phone
since we left, really.</i>

72
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,131
<i>Well, sweetheart,
I've been gone two days.</i>

73
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,964
<i>I have to make sure that
my store's not burning to the ground.</i>

74
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,334
<i>Oh, God.</i>

75
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,345
<i>Thanks, Brenda.</i>

76
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,943
What the hell, Brenda?

77
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,988
Damn it!

78
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,488
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

79
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,494
<i>How far are we from I-88?</i>

80
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,496
- Freaking perv.
- What?

81
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,692
<i>- You're at least five or six hours.
- You hungry, sweetie?</i>

82
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,429
<i>- Why couldn't we have gone through Santa Fe?
- It's nasty out here.</i>

83
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,940
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

84
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,033
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

85
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,546
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88. From there...

86
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,140
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

87
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,085
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

88
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,622
<i>I used to work the night patrol
for 15 years.</i>

89
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,658
Is that right? You a cop?

90
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,557
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

91
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,393
- I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.
- Uh-huh.

92
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,330
You a cop too, mister?

93
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,460
<i>No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.</i>

94
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:30,065
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

95
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,077
<i>- Everything's fine. Oil's okay.</i>

96
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,080
<i>Beauty, come back here!</i>

97
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,743
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

98
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,116
Uh, $46 even.

99
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,554
<i>Oh, hey, Bob, here.
Let me take care of that.</i>

100
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,388
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

101
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,359
That's not what I meant.

102
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,023
<i>Beauty?</i>

103
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,159
<i>Beauty?</i>

104
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,872
Beauty?

105
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,402
Beauty? Come on, girl.

106
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,149
Beauty?

107
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,981
Beauty? Come on, girl.

108
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,159
Hello?

109
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,423
Is anyone there?

110
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,228
Beauty!

111
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,572
Beauty, what are you doing?

112
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,980
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

113
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:50,112
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

114
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,123
<i>- Lynn, we're leaving!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.</i>

115
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,458
<i>- Bobby, she keeps getting out.</i>

116
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,698
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

117
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,506
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

118
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,136
<i>- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!</i>

119
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,181
Do you need something?

120
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,810
No, thanks.

121
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,014
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!</i>

122
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,023
<i>Honey, we're on vacation.</i>

123
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,324
Yeah?

124
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,900
You know, uh...

125
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,437
it's not on the map,
but if you...

126
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,804
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

127
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,810
- Uh-huh.
- It'll lead you through the hills.

128
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,040
<i>Probably save you
a couple of hours.</i>

129
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,744
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

130
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,184
<i>Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

131
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,415
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

132
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,516
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

133
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,595
Thank you.

134
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,664
<i>Dad, I hate your singing.</i>

135
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,665
<i>Guys, no.</i>

136
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,068
<i>- Stop!
- Imagine the first people to cross this desert.</i>

137
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,074
<i>They didn't know
where they were.</i>

138
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,339
<i>- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.</i>

139
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,007
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

140
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,381
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

141
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,386
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>

142
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,082
<i>- This is so fucked!
- Excuse me?</i>

143
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,319
Watch your language, young lady.

144
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,419
<i>I would like
a little backup here.</i>

145
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,499
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

146
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,161
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

147
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,105
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

148
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,836
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

149
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,277
<i>- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.</i>

150
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,849
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

151
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,317
- Dad.
- Stop that.

152
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:17,254
<i>Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...</i>

153
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,092
<i>with a broken air conditioner.</i>

154
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,099
<i>Great vacation.</i>

155
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:27,229
<i>I'm glad you came because
I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.</i>

156
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,137
Yeah. So bored.

157
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,279
Oh. Give up on that, man.

158
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,440
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

159
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,450
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

160
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,214
There.

161
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,452
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

162
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,459
<i>It's disconnected.</i>

163
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,758
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

164
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,666
<i>Hey, I thought you quit smoking.</i>

165
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,071
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

166
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,337
Fuck your sister.

167
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,349
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

168
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,578
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

169
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,586
<i>- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

170
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,713
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

171
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,282
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

172
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,587
Uh-uh.

173
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,166
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

174
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,828
I think she did that
a long time ago.

175
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,905
I think you're right.

176
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,904
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

177
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,812
<i>Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.</i>

178
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,010
<i>The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?</i>

179
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

180
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,649
<i>Jesus! Hang on!</i>

181
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,731
Watch the baby!

182
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,177
Honey? Where's the baby?

183
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,214
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

184
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,284
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

185
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,945
<i>- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?</i>

186
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,888
<i>- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.</i>

187
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,950
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

188
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,997
He's all right.

189
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,328
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

190
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,834
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.</i>

191
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,303
Son of a bitch!

192
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,807
<i>- Okay, okay, we're all right.
- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.</i>

193
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,969
Come here, guys.
Come here.

194
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,741
<i>- Beauty!</i>

195
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,782
<i>Beast!</i>

196
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,327
We are so fucked.

197
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,837
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

198
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,840
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

199
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,433
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

200
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,535
I hope he's enjoying himself.

201
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,048
Doug, don't start.

202
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,812
- Maybe somebody will need a
rent-a-cop around here. - Doug!

203
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,784
- What?
- Come on.

204
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,654
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

205
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,320
<i>- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
- It's my fault?</i>

206
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,193
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

207
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,699
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

208
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,463
<i>General, what's the damage?</i>

209
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,507
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

210
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,077
Can we fix it?

211
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,908
What?

212
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,411
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

213
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,010
<i>- With what? I mean-
- There she is.</i>

214
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,521
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

215
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,683
No signal. I tried.

216
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,729
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt you're gonna get anybody.

217
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,857
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

218
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,060
So, what are we gonna do?

219
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,165
Excuse me.

220
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,813
Bob? What are we doing?

221
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,717
We walk.

222
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,555
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

223
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:49,193
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

224
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,135
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

225
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,900
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

226
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,942
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

227
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,741
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

228
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,840
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

229
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>There you go. Ah, good boy.</i>

230
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:25,631
I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

231
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,796
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

232
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,397
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,342
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

234
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,576
<i>- You know, I saw- Mom?
- What?</i>

235
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,448
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,522
- I saw a documentary on desert snakes-
- Uh-huh.

237
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,319
<i>On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...</i>

238
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,156
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

239
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,595
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

240
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,132
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

241
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,499
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

242
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,471
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

243
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,872
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

244
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,876
Well, some things never change.

245
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,470
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

246
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,143
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

247
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,215
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

248
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,122
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

249
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,388
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

250
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,865
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

251
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,336
<i>Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here. Just one shot.</i>

252
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,872
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

253
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,966
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

254
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,341
You know, he's right.

255
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,813
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

256
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,690
- Hey, "B."
- Hey.

257
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,494
How you holding up?

258
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,933
I am thrilled.

259
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:09,029
Yeah. This is a total drag.

260
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,371
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

261
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,878
Next year, I am going
to Cancún with my friends.

262
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,381
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

263
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,748
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

264
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,381
And if you want to go to Cancún,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

265
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,857
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

266
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,528
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

267
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,056
Oh, yeah.

268
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,634
<i>Honey? Can you bring me my jacket?</i>

269
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,407
I'll be right there, honey.

270
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:09,587
Bobby!

271
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,461
Fucker!

272
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,796
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

273
00:26:13,902 --> 00:26:17,133
<i>Aw.</i>

274
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,724
- Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

275
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:39,885
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

276
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,520
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

277
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,395
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

278
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,866
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

279
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,064
I don't need a gun
to find help.

280
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,664
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

281
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,141
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

282
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:58,610
<i>- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.</i>

283
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:02,878
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles, just come back.

284
00:27:02,985 --> 00:27:05,317
All right?

285
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,082
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

286
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,489
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

287
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,892
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

288
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:18,228
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be back
with a tow truck before nightfall.

289
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,324
<i>- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Nope.</i>

290
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:23,996
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

291
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:26,574
<i>Listen up. Your brother is
in charge, all right?</i>

292
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:30,076
<i>- So don't tease him.
- I think we should pray before you go.</i>

293
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:34,114
<i>- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?</i>

294
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:36,446
<i>- Yes.
- Come on.</i>

295
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,451
Damn it.

296
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:41,522
We're waiting.

297
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,682
Thank God no one's watching us.

298
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:46,927
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

299
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,554
- Stop.
- Thanks.

300
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:52,792
Please bless us at this time...

301
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:55,267
and send your guardian angels...

302
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,500
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

303
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,940
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

304
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:03,978
- Amen.
- Amen.

305
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,570
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

306
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:09,707
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

307
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:13,754
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

308
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:16,415
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

309
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:18,789
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

310
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:21,055
I love you too. Bye.

311
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,173
<i>Hi.</i>

312
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:36,142
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

313
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:39,372
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

314
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,415
Are you hungry?

315
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:45,384
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

316
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:48,183
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

317
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,657
<i>You know, honey, really...</i>

318
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,490
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

319
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:57,463
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

320
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:01,468
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

321
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:09,199
I can't believe that we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

322
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:12,303
- Hmm.
- You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

323
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:14,473
we'd be in California right now.

324
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,451
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

325
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:21,920
- The beach.
- A massage.

326
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:24,389
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

327
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:26,723
- The chronic.
- The what?

328
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:29,092
<i>Brenda!</i>

329
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:31,688
What?

330
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,700
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

331
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:36,635
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly.</i>

332
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:41,107
<i>- Who smokes pot?
- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?</i>

333
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,975
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

334
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,380
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

335
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,884
<i>- Why are the dogs so excited?</i>

336
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:55,081
- There's probably some rattlesnakes somewhere around.
- Ew.

337
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,751
<i>You know how Freud would have interpreted
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?</i>

338
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,987
Bobby!

339
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,155
<i>So bad.</i>

340
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:05,756
<i>- Bobby Carter! Stop that!
- That's gross!</i>

341
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:09,462
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

342
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,335
<i>- I apologize to the entire table.
- Well, thank you.</i>

343
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,604
<i>I'm really glad that
we all came on this trip together.</i>

344
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:20,169
<i>Ah, well, that makes one of us.</i>

345
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:24,149
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

346
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:28,086
No.

347
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,852
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

348
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,052
<i>- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
- Bobby.</i>

349
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:35,095
- Bobby?
- Sorry.

350
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:38,166
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

351
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,291
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

352
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:44,304
- Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

353
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,640
Beauty!

354
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:58,986
Beauty!

355
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,804
Beauty!

356
00:32:06,388 --> 00:32:08,356
Beauty!

357
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:09,984
Fuck!

358
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,429
What the hell?

359
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:26,713
Look at that. Huh.

360
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:01,266
Hello?

361
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:06,046
Hello?

362
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:09,450
Hey, buddy.

363
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:25,498
Hello?

364
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:34,969
Hello!

365
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:50,323
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

366
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,129
Yo!

367
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:04,729
I grabbed some water, all right?

368
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,399
Uh-

369
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:14,141
It's dead. Damn it.

370
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:17,479
Yo, my friend! Hey!

371
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,917
You here?

372
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:22,114
You home?

373
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:57,484
Hello?

374
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,260
Hello?

375
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:15,693
Weird son of a bitch.

376
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:29,082
Yeah.

377
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,680
<i>Jupiter!</i>

378
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:42,360
I got buckshot, ya hear?

379
00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:44,954
Hey, mister.

380
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:51,327
<i>You don't understand
what's going on here.</i>

381
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,407
Hey!

382
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,736
<i>The kids...</i>

383
00:41:57,845 --> 00:42:02,111
<i>grew up in the mines
like wild animals.</i>

384
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:04,184
Open the door, slowly!

385
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,787
What kind of place
is that for children?

386
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:14,928
What kind of a place is that?

387
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:19,898
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

388
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:25,837
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

389
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,670
Hey!

390
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:33,809
<i>Daddy.</i>

391
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,884
<i>Daddy.</i>

392
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,154
<i>Daddy.</i>

393
00:42:42,723 --> 00:42:45,749
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

394
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,193
<i>Daddy. Oh, Daddy.</i>

395
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:51,697
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

396
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,324
<i>- Daddy. Daddy.</i>

397
00:42:54,435 --> 00:42:56,403
<i>Daddy. Daddy.</i>

398
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:06,106
<i>Daddy.</i>

399
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:30,796
<i>Would you give me that gun, Pluto!</i>

400
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:32,964
<i>- Give me the gosh darn gun!
- Get on over here!</i>

401
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:36,066
<i>That's right. Come on.
You oughtn't have a gun.</i>

402
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,526
<i>Brenda?</i>

403
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,165
<i>Brenda!</i>

404
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:07,604
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

405
00:44:10,177 --> 00:44:12,042
Bobby!

406
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:14,376
Bobby!

407
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:19,720
<i>Bobby!</i>

408
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:28,095
<i>Bobby!</i>

409
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:47,776
<i>- Bobby!</i>

410
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:56,248
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

411
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:58,450
It's just-

412
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,426
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

413
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:06,159
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

414
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:12,702
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

415
00:45:15,576 --> 00:45:18,773
- Did you- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

416
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:23,248
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

417
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,148
What breathing?

418
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:28,517
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

419
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,886
I'm sure it was just static.

420
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:35,951
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

421
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:39,931
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

422
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:43,936
Bobby! What-

423
00:45:44,038 --> 00:45:47,804
<i>- Honey?
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.</i>

424
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,944
What is wrong with him?

425
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,554
<i>What's he doing?</i>

426
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:19,873
Shit.

427
00:46:23,744 --> 00:46:26,178
<i>Beast! Beast!</i>

428
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,180
- Hey, Bobby.
- Jesus Christ!

429
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:32,582
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

430
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:36,122
- Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

431
00:46:36,223 --> 00:46:39,715
It's me! You okay?

432
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:43,456
- Yeah.
- God!

433
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:45,759
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

434
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:50,030
Look, I found this place out here.
You wouldn't believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

435
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:52,037
<i>- Hey.
- Is that Bob?</i>

436
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:54,039
<i>- It's Doug. It's okay.
- Ta-da!</i>

437
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:58,510
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

438
00:46:58,612 --> 00:47:02,104
<i>- No, I'm fine. Just exhausted. Look.
- Yeah.</i>

439
00:47:02,216 --> 00:47:04,116
<i>Look at all this stuff
I found.</i>

440
00:47:04,218 --> 00:47:06,584
There's a huge crater out there.

441
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:10,521
People must use it as a dump site.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

442
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:12,524
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

443
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,753
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

444
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:18,593
<i>- I thought you went to go find somebody.
- Road dead-ends in five miles.</i>

445
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:21,259
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

446
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,268
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

447
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,203
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

448
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:28,207
<i>Maybe we just missed a turn.</i>

449
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,278
- Honey, did you guys cook any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

450
00:47:31,378 --> 00:47:34,438
<i>- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
- Yeah?</i>

451
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:36,516
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

452
00:47:36,617 --> 00:47:39,677
<i>Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.</i>

453
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:42,620
<i>Do you use it
without telling me?</i>

454
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:06,403
<i>Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.</i>

455
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:09,505
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

456
00:48:09,617 --> 00:48:11,517
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

457
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:15,521
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

458
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:18,592
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

459
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:21,456
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

460
00:48:21,562 --> 00:48:24,895
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

461
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,661
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

462
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:32,102
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

463
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:35,369
<i>- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.</i>

464
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:40,739
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

465
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:44,011
<i>- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.</i>

466
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,518
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

467
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,716
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

468
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:53,122
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

469
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:56,025
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

470
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:59,725
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

471
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:03,894
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

472
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:06,336
<i>- Okay?
- Excuse me.</i>

473
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,704
<i>- Sorry.
- Did you get pillows?</i>

474
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,308
They're in the S.U.V.

475
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,081
Hey, hey, listen.

476
00:49:16,183 --> 00:49:19,584
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

477
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:21,882
<i>- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.</i>

478
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:24,287
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

479
00:49:24,391 --> 00:49:27,053
Good night.

480
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:30,289
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

481
00:49:30,397 --> 00:49:32,490
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

482
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:37,604
Hi.

483
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,800
Beast.

484
00:50:51,879 --> 00:50:53,847
<i>Beast?</i>

485
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:14,300
Beast?

486
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,936
Beast?

487
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,008
<i>Beast?</i>

488
00:51:24,812 --> 00:51:27,781
<i>- Beast?</i>

489
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,071
Beast?

490
00:51:53,874 --> 00:51:55,842
Beast?

491
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:58,741
Beasty? Come here, boy.

492
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:11,123
<i>Beast?</i>

493
00:52:35,883 --> 00:52:37,612
Hey. Guys! Guys!

494
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:40,186
<i>- Oh, good God. What-
- Jesus!</i>

495
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,017
<i>- Bobby.
- What is it, Bobby?</i>

496
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:47,184
- Guys, something- something is going
on around here, okay? - What is it?

497
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:49,922
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

498
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,430
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

499
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:55,195
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

500
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:59,466
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

501
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:01,803
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

502
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:06,039
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

503
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:09,673
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

504
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:12,581
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

505
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:16,622
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

506
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:22,093
But I'm telling you, there is something
going on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

507
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:26,256
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

508
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:30,730
<i>- We're not alone.
- All right, Lynn.</i>

509
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:33,271
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

510
00:53:33,373 --> 00:53:37,070
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

511
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:40,078
Now!

512
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,187
It's Bob.

513
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:51,917
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

514
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:54,391
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

515
00:53:54,494 --> 00:53:57,759
Dad? Dad!

516
00:53:57,864 --> 00:54:00,025
Brenda. Watch the baby!

517
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,720
No!

518
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,156
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

519
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:26,884
Get off! Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!
