I am so glad you're here.

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,571
I love Christmas.

00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,741
I admit it, I love everything
about Christmas time.

17

There's something that makes
people want to be more kind.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,341
At Christmas, they want to be
more compassionate,

19
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,276
More helpful, more generous.

20

Clothe them, feed them.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,823
And best of all, I think there's
something about Christmas

25
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:34,162
That all of us sense deep inside
that says,

26
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:40,134
"Something big happened,
and because of it,

27

Who would love to put a big
wet blanket on all of this.

32
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,824
They don't want us to love
Christmas so much

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,162
And celebrate it the way we do.

34
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:12,633
There's this one group over
here that says,

35
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,403
"Hey, if you want to sing
your songs and do your stuff"

36
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,438
At Christmas time,
that's fine, but tone it down.

37
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,807
Don't sing so loud."
Right?

38

"Just, you take
your private stuff"

39
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,845
And you just keep it
in your house.

Don't let it spill out
into the public

41

43

It has nothing to do
with Christmas.

49

just take all of that,

bad for us?

55

That the Druids invented it?

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,563
So what are we supposed to do?

57
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,531
I mean, it can get
pretty confusing.

58
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,433
And all this bickering
is definitely not

for our kids.

60
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:30,311
Maybe we need a word
from the outside.

who can remind us

62

Of the true meaning
of Christmas.

63

along the way,

00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,892
We lost sight of the real story.

65

Stories are tricky things,

Especially the ones that
we've heard lots of times.

79
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,520
There was a time when
we didn't mind hearing

80

The same stories over
and over again.

81
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,191
In fact, when we were children,

82
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:28,962
We insisted on hearing them
on an endless loop.

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,899
In fact, we'd even beg and plead
with our parents

84
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:36,370
Until they either gave up
or gave in.

85
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:39,139
Then we got older,
and we thought maybe

86
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,775
It's time for some new stories.

87
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,977
We wanted to be surprised.

88
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:48,148
We wanted more twists and turns,
and we'd roll our eyes

89
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,119
If something ever got
too predictable.

90
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,388
But then we had kids of our own,

91
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,457
And we found ourselves
telling them

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,959
The same stories our parents
told us.

93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,762
Only we thought that
maybe the stories

94
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,964
Were a bit too scary.

95
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:07,468
We got nervous that
the wolf or the witch

96
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,970
Might actually give them
nightmares.

97
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:16,677
So, we eased off on the bad guys
or even left them out entirely.

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,712
Our heroes got tamed

99
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,949
And cut down to more
manageable size.

100
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:27,555
They needed to be less intense,
more jolly.

102

shape us.

180
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,405
The list goes on and on.

181
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,809
Some people are determined
to see the worst

182
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,077
In even the best of things,

183
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:28,949
A big slap in the face to
the true meaning of Christmas.

184
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:34,021
[Distorted laughter]

185

[Intense music]

186
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,092
My man, Christian!

187
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,160
How you doing?

188
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,294
What's up, Deandre?

189
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,229
How you been?

190
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,497
You know me, blessed
and highly favored.

191
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,532
And?

192
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,100
Saved and sanctified,
filled with the Holy Ghost

193
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,403
And that with a burning fire!

194
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,404
And?

195
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,440
Made evident by speaking
in tongues, of course.

196
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,275
[Laughing]

197
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,844
You guys and your verses.

198
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,879
You really need to work
on your exegesis.

199
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,347
Extra Jesus?

200
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,448
Man, I've had my extra Jesus

201
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,583
Ever since I was baptized
for the second time. Ha!

202
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,118
You gonna give me some?
Yeah.

203
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,386
That's not what I meant...

204
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,389
- You get that memo?
- About what?

205
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,225
No more crazy shirt Fridays.

206
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,894
From who?

207
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,463
The man, corporate.

208
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,298
They think they gonna
tell us what to do.

209
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,132
We gonna go to HR.

210
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,533
I'm gonna take it
straight to HR.

211
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:21,401
You got to read your emails.

212
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,270
If we don't have
crazy shirt Fridays,

213
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,171
It's the end for us, man.

214
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,573
That's all we got!
What else do we get?

215
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,075
Floor two?
I don't want floor two.

216
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,143
You know what happens
down in floor two? I don't.

217
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,479
Don't want to find out
'cause I'm on floor four,

218
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,513
And I like it that way.

219
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,214
We gonna keep it that way.

220
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,849
We gonna march if we have to.

221
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,250
Straight power.
Me and you.

222
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,418
My people have been
through enough.

223
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,988
First they come in, start
telling us what we gonna do,

224
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,322
And then they start taking over,

225
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,891
Telling us we can't have
Fridays,

226
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:44,892
Then you can't have
Thursdays,

227
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,194
Then you can't have Tuesdays,
and what's left?

228
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,128
Wednesday. Hump day!

229
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,997
That's already a day.
That's not our day.

230
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,032
We need a day for us,
crazy shirt Fridays.

231
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,901
Do you know how many
crazy shirts I've got

232
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,435
That my wife gave me
for Christmas?

233
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,204
What am I gonna do with those?

236
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,271
- Are you listening to me?
- What?

237
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,172
I'm gonna get some
hot chocolate.

238
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,540
I'll send you the email again,
all right?

239
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,642
I'm out.

* "Deck the Halls"

241
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,582
And when we see someone
struggling around Christmas,

242
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,118
We should reach out.

243
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,154
Hey, Christian!

244
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,558
Nope. Not here.

245
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,429
Just Bill on the couch.

[Instrumental music]

247
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,703
And if that person goes missing
from the Christmas party,

248
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,339
Especially if it's
at his own home,

249
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:10,077
A good place to look would be
somewhere quiet,

250
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,279
Free from Christmas.

252
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,985
Ah, the car in the driveway.

253
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,452
See, if this were a story,

254
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,455
That's exactly where you
would expect to find him,

255
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:27,127
And you would know that this
character needs an intervention.

257
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,365
- Hey.
- Hey.

258
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,105
I was wondering where you were.

259
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,677
Just, you know... taking a break.

260
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,417
You okay?

261
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,622
Yeah.

262
00:15:55,655 --> 00:16:00,193
It just gets... noisy, yeah.

[Humming "Carol of the Bells"]

264
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,973
I was driving home today,
and, uh...

265
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:21,248
Right on Main,
everything's lit up.

266
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,488
I'm driving by a store,
and I, I see...

267
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,094
I see a little girl and her mom.

268
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:39,066
The little girl's got this look
on her face like... [whining]

269
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,302
And her Mom's looking at her
like, "Oh, it's okay, okay,"

270
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,737
And you know, the mom's
got bags with her.

271
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:48,808
You can tell they've been,
they've been shopping,

272
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,780
And the little girl is
just so upset.

273
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:58,751
Obviously, whatever she wants,
she's not getting.

274
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,521
Everybody just wants stuff.

275
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,224
And then, then I, come here

276
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,525
And I look at here,
and I look at the...

277
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,461
I look at the food,
I look at like, a ham.

278
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,463
I didn't even know we could
get a ham that big.

279
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,464
I see the presents.

280
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,633
I see, I see... I see the tree.

281
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,737
I see... I see Santa.

282
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,572
It's like, what are
we gonna do?

283
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,841
We're gonna open those presents.

284
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,343
Nieces and nephews are gonna
get all excited,

285
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,079
They're gonna tear through...

286
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,480
And it's like three weeks
from now,

287
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,848
No one's gonna be
playing with it.

288
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,085
And that money spent...

289
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:39,192
How many kids could we have fed?

290
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,629
How many wells could
we have dug?

291
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,397
Yeah.

292
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,599
That's Christmas.

293
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,536
Don't... don't...

294
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,574
I love your sister,
I love her to death.

295
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,412
And she loves,
she loves doing this.

296
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:05,618
She loves putting all
the lights up and...

297
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:11,491
But I look... I look
at what Christmas is.

298
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:20,267
I think to myself, "This cannot
be what God wants."

And deep... and deep
in the corner,

301
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:34,214
Stuck in the corner will be
a little snow globe,

302
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:38,718
A little nativity scene,
a little baby Jesus.

303
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,888
We stick it somewhere
in the corner,

304
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,891
Don't really see it,
and it's a trinket

305
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,660

just...

306

"I'm the big tree!"

I'm the big centerpiece

00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,834
And Santa's over there,
and over here...

310
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,703
"Yeah, let's just put Jesus
in the corner."

311
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,505
Let's put him right there,

312
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:02,642
And put a little glass thing
around him.

313
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,211
Shake it upside down.

314
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,144
It's winter.

00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,714
Snow falls all over,
all over baby Jesus.

316
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:14,187
And then finally, he was
not born in December.

317
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:18,691
This is not what Christmas
is all about.

318
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,693
I hear you.

319
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,530
- I get it.
- My man.

320
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,567

No.

About what?

325
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,557
About everything you just said.

326
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,392
I said a lot.

327
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,994

But you got the whole thing
wrong.

331
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,874
You, you drank the Kool-Aid.

332
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:13,546
You, you took the bait,
hook, line and sinker.

333
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,016
You swallowed the whole thing.

334
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,784
Guess what?

335
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,686
Everything you see
inside there,

336
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,853
It's all about Christmas.

337
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:27,960
It's all about Jesus, and you're
spoiling the whole thing.

338
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:33,433
Not just for your wife,

339
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,235
But for everybody
inside your house.

340
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,676
You're listening to
the wrong people.

341
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,778
Are we seeing the same party?

342
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,580
Are we seeing the same
everything

343
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,316
That's going on in there?

344
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,584
Yeah.

345
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:59,592
Okay, so, okay, so...
explain to me

346
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,394
How when I walk into
that Christmas party,

347
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,997
Which is going on all over
the world...

348
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,699
Uh-huh.

349
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:11,371
Explain to me how
that Christmas party

350
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:15,942
Honors and glorifies Jesus.

351
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,010
'Cause I'm not seeing it.

00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,480
Where do I start?

Let's start with
your snow globe.

354
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,855
The Nativity.

355
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,357
Now, I want you
to visualize this.

356
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,993
Close your eyes
and, and visualize this.

357
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,730
Okay, alright, I'll play.

358
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,632
I see it.

359
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,034
A baby is born.

360
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,872
If you had to pick
one valuable thing

361
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,442
In all of the decorations around
your house at Christmas time,

362
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,612
It would probably be
your Nativity set.

363
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,047
But Christian, I don't
even think you see

364
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,617
What's so amazing
about that scene

365
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,420
Because to think that
it's only valuable

366
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:01,954
Because the baby Jesus is there

367
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,092
Misses a huge part
of what's going on.

368
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,596
The birth of the baby
is valuable

369
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,665
Because of the story
he enters into.

* "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"

371
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:28,681
I want you to see a cave,
not a stable

372
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:32,519
Or some little prairie farm
barn thing.

373
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,688
First of all, a manger is
a feeding trough,

374
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:39,692
And it's probably going to be
carved out of a rock.

375
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,861
It's going to be in a cave,

376
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:47,099
And upon that rock you would
feed your animals.

377
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:55,808
* "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"

378
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,177
Now, move beyond the cute
and traditional

Where everything is
safe and soft,

380
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:03,750
Where everyone has white skin
and clean clothes.

See a cave, see a place
for food.

382
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,091
Now, let's get this story right.

383
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,762
This was a child that
was born into a world

384
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,130
Where the world power
wanted to kill him

385
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,999
Just for being born.

K of soldiers surrounding the

387
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,473
You need to think
of Herod's soldiers

388
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,207
Moving through the streets,

389
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,978
Finding babies
and murdering them.

390
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,147
And mothers weeping
for their children.

[Weapons clanging]

392
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,587
Let's set the stage.

393
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,789
We're very careful about
having Mary there,

394
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:47,694
Kneeling by her newborn miracle.

395
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:54,166
Joseph is there, surely amazed
at what had just happened.

396
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,603
Baby Jesus is there,

397
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,538
And the Bible draws
our attention

398
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:02,609
To something that we usually
think of as just a prop.

399
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:07,113
Let's take everything away
for a moment.

400
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:10,082
Let's take away Joseph,

401
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,620
Leaving just a young girl
and her newborn infant.

402
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:17,223
Now, let's take away Mary,
leaving the baby.

403
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:22,094
Let's even take away the baby
himself for just a moment.

404
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,530
Now, don't panic.

405
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:24,463
It's not because he isn't

406
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,533
The most important person
in the story.

407
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,234
He is.

408
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,670
But because by getting
a look at this prop,

409
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:36,108
We'll get a better idea of why
he was born in the first place.

410
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,778
Swaddling cloth.

411
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,047
What is this swaddling cloth?

412
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,617
Is it just a blanket for a baby?

413
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,919
We usually only think
of the baby Jesus

414
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,255
Being wrapped in cloths,

415
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,191
But the Bible brings these
cloths back into the story

416
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,094
One more time...

417
00:24:55,127 --> 00:25:01,601
At his tomb when they rolled
that stone away.

418
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,870
The cloth in the tomb was empty

419
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:07,974
Because it could not hold
the body wrapped inside.

420
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,044
Jesus escaped death as a baby
by the hand of God,

421
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,747
And he conquered death
as an adult

422
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,183
By that very same hand,

423
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:20,820
And because that cloth
could not hold him,

424
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,658
Death still cannot win.

425
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,693
Did you ever wonder
why the wise men

426
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:30,229
Brought frankincense and myrrh
at Jesus' birth?

427
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,264
Those are burial spices.

428
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,836
Why would they bring
burial spices to a baby shower?

429
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:42,842
The birth scene is a picture
of a coming burial scene.

430
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,878
The soldiers don't get to kill
the baby, though.

431
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:49,982
He came to die, but it was
according to his Father's plan,

432
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:55,021
In his timing and on his terms.

433
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:59,225
The death of Jesus was not
the tragic end to the story.

434
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,327
It was the plan all along,

435
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,764
To offer up his body as bread
for the hungry

436
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:09,869
And to shed his blood to cover
the sins of the guilty.

437
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,640
Now, put Jesus back
into that cloth

438
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:17,810
And let that image paint
the picture for you.

439

the appointed time.

the whole swaddling cloth thing.

I can look right there,
and I can go, "Oh, there it is!"

that whole thing like that's...

like little Herod soldiers

not in the Bible!

Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
Deuteronomy.

532
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,252
Did I miss it?

533
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,222
I miss Leviticus sometimes,

534
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,125
But I'm pretty sure
it's not in there.

535
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,861
That's the big thing I got
sitting in my house right now,

536
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,163
Is a big Christmas tree.

537
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,464
That's a pagan...

538
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:36,035
That's a pagan idol symbol
worshipping thingy.

539
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,304
You know that, right?

540
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,507
That's what they would
worship the god with.

541
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,275
You know, the gods.

542
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,178
- What gods?
- The gods.

543
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:47,379
Which gods?

it's always a Norwegian...

546
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,120
It's, that's what they would do.

547
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,588
It was winter, it was
the Winter Solstice.

548
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,892
News flash, it's December.

549
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,227
Jesus was not born in December,

550
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,130
And we're celebrating
his birthday in December.

551
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,164
Hello?

552
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,499
When was he born?

553
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,302
Probably, he was probably,
probably...

554
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,974
I don't know, but he wasn't
born in December.

555
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,608
Everyone knows that.
So, we're celebrating that...

556
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:20,079
And the trees are like,
it's about like,

557
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,248
The evergreen trees
represents eternal life...

558
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:25,451
- Yes.
- And fertility, fertility gods.

559
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,487
Wikipedia. Yeah.

560
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,192
And people would worship
these symbols then,

561
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,994
And they believed that if they
worshipped these symbols

562
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,562
And they laid down their
offerings and their gifts,

563
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,364
That they would inherit
eternal life.

564
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,165
You know this.

565
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:43,269
And this is...
this is all idolatry.

566
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:46,672
Yes, it's idolatry in my house.

567
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,707
How do your kids react
every morning on Christmas?

568
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,710
What do they do? Tell me.

569
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,980
What do they do?

570
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,249
I make my kids wait at
the top of the staircase.

571
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,952
I don't let them come
down the stairs

572
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,154
Until my wife and I get
everything ready, the tree,

573
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:05,992
And the anticipation builds,
and they run down the stairs

574
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,428
When I tell them they can,
and they run out to the tree,

575
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,298
And they just are blown away

576
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,334
By all the presents sitting
at the base of the tree.

577
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:19,105
That's exactly what
the Druids did.

578
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:23,075
- Right.
- Druids.

579
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,377
You look this up.
This is all history.

580
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:29,215
So, where, I ask again,

581
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:33,585
Where are Christmas trees
in the Bible?

582
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,586
I'm glad you asked.

583
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,154
I'll close my eyes again.

584
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,256
Here I go, I'm waiting.

585
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,657
Okay. What's the chapter?

586
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,691
What's the verse?

587
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:43,529
Do you have a weird, obscure
verse in Numbers?

588
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,765
Where... where am I going?

589
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,034
Where do I start in the Bible?

590
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,168
Christmas trees, I'm waiting.

591
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,537
Where do I go?

592
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,572
I'm glad my sister married you.

593
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,341
This is awesome.

594

[Humming theme to "Jeopardy"]

595
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,446
Bro, bro, look at me.

596
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,481
* Do, do, do, do, do

597
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,283
Where we going in the Bible?

598
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,086
Genesis.

599
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,192
* "Ding, Dong,
Merrily on High" *

600
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:18,597
The whole biblical story
starts in a tree lot.

601
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,301
The Garden of Eden was
full of trees.

602
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,537
Adam and Eve were given
the fruit of these trees to eat,

603
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,339
But the story calls
our attention

604
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,042
To two of these trees
in particular.

605
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:33,445
First, the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil

606
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,515
And then later the tree of life.

607
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,351
One tree was off limits
because by eating it,

608
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,387
Man would surely die.

609
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,124
But Adam ate from the first tree
and was thrown out of the garden

610
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,759
So that he couldn't eat
from the second.

611
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,495
Mankind would have to wait

612
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,365
Until the path to that tree
was reopened,

613
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,101
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

614
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,169
We'll come back to that later.

615
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,306
Let's talk about that
evergreen tree in your house

616
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,275
Decorated with stylized fruit
and lights

617
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,311
That's making you so nervous.

618
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:09,115
You're anxious because
you can't find it in the Bible.

619
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,617
Well, let me help you.

620
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,088
When God created the world,
he filled it with trees.

621
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,824
He hung fruit on the trees.

622
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:20,592
When it was time for him
to build his house

623
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:25,364
And make it beautiful,
God brought trees inside.

624
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:29,801
The walls of his temple were
frescoed with images of trees.

625
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:34,140
The lamp stand in his tabernacle
was an almond tree.

626
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,543
And guess what he placed
on the branches of the tree

627
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,346
In his house?

628
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,581
Lights.

629
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,851
Beautiful green trees
decorated with fruit

630
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,888
Shimmering with lights
inside a house.

631
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,859
That's God's idea,
not the Druids.

632
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,861
And the early church had
plenty of good reasons

633
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:59,231
To celebrate the birth of Jesus
on December 25,

634
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,334
And it had nothing to do
with the winter solstice.

635
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,636
By the way, last I checked,

636
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,638
It was God who made
the winter solstice

637
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:10,742
When he set the planets
on their path around the sun.

638
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,478
And it's actually quite fitting

639
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:16,582
That we celebrate the birth of
Jesus in the bleak, mid-winter

640
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,386
When the world appears
to be sleeping and dying,

641
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,554
The darkest and coldest time
of year.

642
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:27,926
Right then at that time, we're
proclaiming the turn of history

643
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,264
From darkness to light,
from coldness to warmth,

644
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:36,835
And from death to life.

645
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,737
So, enough with what pagans
want us to see.

646
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,874
Let's look at what God
wants us to see.

647
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,610
Let's go back to our story.

648
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,711
As I was saying,

649
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:49,448
Adam stole the fruit
from God's tree and ate it.

650
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,285
Now, when you steal something,
you're required to put it back.

651
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,786
But how could he?

652
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,921
Adam had already eaten it.

653
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:59,758
It had gone down inside,
and become part of him.

654
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,795
The only way that Adam could
put the fruit back on the tree

655
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,865
Would be, as crazy
as it sounds,

656
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:11,737
He would have to put himself
up on that tree.

657
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,405
Now, think.

658
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,574
What did Jesus do?

659
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,744
He was the last Adam.

660
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,881
Jesus was able to do
what Adam could not do.

661
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:28,354
He put himself up on a tree,
making us right with God.

662
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:33,359
Jesus was God's blessed fruit
hung on his blessed tree.

[Instrumental music]

664
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,766
Remember that swaddling cloth?

665
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:45,904
It comes back into the story
again at Jesus' burial.

666
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,640
Nicodemus brings all
the funeral preparations,

667
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:53,512
Frankincense, myrrh,
aloe and cloth.

668
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,914
And why is he
bringing the cloth?

669
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,251
To wrap the body of
our crucified Savior,

670
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:03,689
Jesus, put to death on a tree.

671
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,758
The Bible begins with trees.

672
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,796
Adam stole the fruit from
God's tree and ate it.

673
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:14,533
The fruit that the first Adam
stole was put back on the tree

674
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:20,439
By the last Adam when he,
himself, hung on a wooden cross.

675
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:26,578
[Instrumental music]

676
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:29,381
So, when you walk
into a Christmas tree lot,

677
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,851
I want you to see
hundreds of crosses

678
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:37,556
That will never be used because
of Jesus' finished work.

679
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,893
He paid the price that
we could never have paid.

680
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,763
He took the curse
that was rightly ours.

681
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,467
He reconciled us to God.

682
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,804
He is the light of the world
that has pierced the darkness.

683
00:37:52,838 --> 00:38:03,982
[Instrumental music]

684
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,652
So, when you see
empty Christmas trees,

685
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,086
See an empty cross.

686
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,389
And when you see
the empty cross,

687
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,959
See the empty cloth lying
in an empty tomb.

688
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,663
And when you see an empty
tomb, do what the disciples did,

689
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:23,502
Turn and run to tell the story
that Jesus is alive.

enough at...

I just didn't, I didn't,
I didn't see that.

Hey, I didn't see it either.

698

with you.

00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,563
Elf, Santa dude, like...

704
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,665
Reindeer pulling a sleigh?

705
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,168
Just tell me right now
you're not going to pull like...

706
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,670
Sliding down a chimney.

707
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:36,875
Zephaniah 4 or like
3rd Corinthians 15,

708
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,910
Like, "Oh, there's Santa Claus."

709
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,746
I didn't even see it
right there!"

710
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:41,647
Just tell me right now.

711
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,448
Okay, we're good, right?

712
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,549
That's not going
to happen, okay.

713
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,883
So, hold on, hold on.

714
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,018
So, I'm, I'm safe in saying

715
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,021
That there is no Santa Claus
in the Bible?

716
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,823
[Instrumental music]

717
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,992
No, there is no Santa Claus
in the Bible, but...

718
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,461
Okay. Hold, eh...

719
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,127
No, no, no, hold on.

720
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,195
Hold on, hold on.

721
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,965
Just think about it,
think about it for one minute.

722
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:08,206
That's the guy, Santa,
that's obliterated Jesus.

723
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,709
Jesus is gone!

724
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,711
The reason for the season
is Santa Claus!

725
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,146
What the kids are saying
all across the world is not,

726
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,850
"I'm so excited to celebrate
the birth of Jesus!"

727
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,051
No, they're saying,
"I'm so excited"

728
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,488
To get my picture taken
with Santa Claus!

729
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,955
"You're going to bring me
presents!"

730
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:24,990
S-A-N-T-A.

731
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,893
Rearrange the letters.
Satan.

732
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,228
Santa, Satan.
Same letters.

733
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,898
- Right?
- Right.

734
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,766
Coincidence?

735
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,002
[Instrumental music]

736
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,036
Yeah.

737
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:41,740
Okay, and who's completely
gotten rid of Jesus?

738
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,109
Satan. Santa.

739
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,511
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

740
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,679
Where's ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
in the Bible?

741
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,681
Ho, ho, ho. Bible.

742
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:51,216
* You better watch out,
you better not pout. *

743
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,984
* You better not cry,
I'm telling you why. *

744
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,920
* Santa Claus is coming
to town. *

745
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:55,787
What's the next line?

746
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,155
* He knows when you are
sleeping. *

747
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,724
* He knows when you are awake.

748
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,692
Right, omniscient.

749
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,160
* ...so be good
for goodness sake. *

750
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,595
Omniscience, omnipresence.

751
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:06,164
He rewards the good,
and he punishes the bad.

752
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,634
Last I checked, that was God.

753
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,802
By the way, this is works based.

754
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,939
Last I checked, saved by grace.

755
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,974
This is, this is a complete
hijacking.

756
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,843
This is a hijacking...

757
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:22,981
High-handed hijacking,
handedness jacking.

758
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,851
It's like a carjacking
but like of our religion.

759
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,218
And guess what,
Santa got in the car,

760
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,153
Kicked Jesus out and was like,

761
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:32,090
"Rolling, rolling, rolling,"
and took it.

762
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,525
Gone.

763
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,526
Christmas is gone.

764
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,695
It's all about Santa.

765
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:40,031
Where in the Bible?
Where in the Bible?

766
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,233
Where in the Bible?
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

767
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,969
Red letter, red letter,
red letter.

768
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:44,870
Where is it?

769
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,104
So, okay. Hold on.

770
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,806
I can't, I can't wait
for this one.

771
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,974
Here we go, here we go.

772
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,542
I'm ready. Eyes are closed.

773
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,010
I'm looking at, I see him.

774
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,745
Hold on, I see his face.

775
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:56,147
[Static noises]

776
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,849
Oh, I see his face.

777
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,785
[Static noises]

778
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:00,719
What do you see?

779
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,722
You see a little elf
and he's in a sleigh

780
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,657
And he's in a little red cap
with a little red,

781
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:06,491
Little red outfit.

782
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,425
- Yeah.
- He's got a sack over his back.

783
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,295
And he's being pulled
by a team of reindeer.

784
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,963
Right. Not in the Bible.

785
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,198
And he's gonna land on a roof,

786
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,166
And he's gonna slide
down a chimney,

787
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,868
And he's going to fill stockings

788
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,937
And put presents around
the base of a tree.

789
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,071
- Right.
- Right?

790
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:22,207
- Right.
- Okay.

791
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,912
[Static noises]

792
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,315
[Inhales]

793
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,151
Let me tell you about
the real Santa Claus.

794
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,587
Oh, I'm ready.

795
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,056
[Instrumental music]

796
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:42,994
The real Santa Claus was
a real bad, bad dude.

797
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:47,733
And when I say bad,
I mean bad in the good way.

798
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:53,338
So Christian, you want Christmas
to be all about Jesus?

799
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,607
You think you're fighting
the good fight

800
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,944
By scowling at decorations
and scoffing at presents

801
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,179
And mocking Christmas trees?

802
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:06,117
Let me show you how a real
defender of the faith does it.

803
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,920
Now, if I tried to show you
how this really happened,

804
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:12,357
You'd see a lot of guys in robes
wearing tall hats,

805
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,860
Carrying scepters and swinging
incense everywhere.

806
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,895
It'd be a mess.

807
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:22,768
[Knuckles cracking]

808
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:26,037
I want you to imagine this
a little more...

809
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,073
Lord of the Rings-y.

810
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,877
Sir?

811
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,981
Go away.

812
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,318
He's here, Sir.

813
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:46,892
[Fire crackling]

814
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:49,795
Where?

815
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:52,030
Here, at the Tavern.

816
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,834
[Instrumental music]

817
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,336
Grab my coat.

818
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:03,341
[Instrumental music]

819
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,978
His real name was Nicholas.

820
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,146
He was a devout Christian.

821
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:14,720
He was the Bishop of Myra,
a city in modern day Turkey.

822
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,923
He was left with a large sum
of money when his parents died,

823
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,858
And he became famous
for his kindness

824
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:24,796
Toward the poor and his generous
giving of gifts to children.

825
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:31,970
[Instrumental music]

826
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:36,174
He was there at the Council
of Nicaea in A.D. 325,

827
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,310
One of the most important events
of church history

828
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,880
Use one of the most
rtant doctrines of the faith

829
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,015
Was being challenged.

830
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,884
There were leaders in the church
that had begun

831
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,053
To deny the deity of Christ,

832
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:52,023
The doctrine that confessed
Jesus as the Son of God,

833
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,293
God in the flesh.

834
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,395
Nicholas did not take
kindly to those

835
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:01,833
Who wanted to reduce Jesus
to a mere man.

836
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,970
The Council of Nicaea ended up
producing what is known today

837
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,038
As the Nicene Creed,

838
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:10,809
A profession of faith used by
churches all around the world.

839
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,144
The Creed affirmed
the deity of Christ

840
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,346
And the three persons
of the trinity,

841
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,916
But that affirmation
didn't happen

842
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,820
Without Nicholas and a fight.

843
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:25,924
[Instrumental music]

844
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:30,028
He was a real man who
fought for a real truth

845
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,498
Against a real enemy
of the faith.

846
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:43,775
[Instrumental music]

847
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:50,081
[Instrumental music]

848
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:54,552
Leading the charge in this
heresy was a Bishop named Arius.

849
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,989
He was known as a charismatic
and compelling speaker.

850
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:01,259
He was traveling from region
to region spreading his heresy

851
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:06,164
Like a plague, saying that Jesus
was less than God.

852
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:11,937
[Instrumental music]

853
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,973
Nicholas had heard enough
of Arius' babbling.

854
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:17,508
He would be the shepherd
that protects his sheep

855
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,978
From the wolves.

856
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:23,148
[Instrumental music]

857
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,051
[Heavy thud]

858
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:39,898
In the beginning was the Word...

859
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:49,975
And the Word was with God
and the Word... was God.

860
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:55,280
And the Word was with God
and the Word... was God.

861
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,082
[Thunder crashes]

862
00:46:57,115 --> 00:47:00,185
The official record says
that at a critical moment

863
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:05,924
During the Council, Nicholas
put the heretic Arius to shame,

864
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:12,397
Not only by word but also by
deed, smiting him on the cheek.

865
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:26,611
[Intense music]

866
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,447
Now, of course, not everyone
at the Council was happy

867
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,117
With his less than jolly
actions.

868
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,985
In fact, they were
so displeased,

869
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,021
They removed his title
as Bishop,

870
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,389
But he was so loved
by the people

871
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,458
That they gave it back to him.

872
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,493
In fact, he was even sainted.

873
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:46,531
That's why we call him
St. Nicholas.

874
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,200
Those were difficult
and desperate times.

875
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:50,401
Truth was on the line,

876
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:54,405
And it was not the time for
this pastor to go soft on truth

877
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:59,144
Or stay quiet for the sake
of being politically correct.

878
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:03,414
Nicholas was a hero
who became legendary.

879
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:06,051

larger than life

And reached mythic proportions.

So, Christian, the guy
you think is distracting

898
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,584
Everyone's attention from
the birth of the Christ child

899
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:18,489

Who walks back into your house,
walks up to your wife and says,

So that every single thing
points to Jesus.

[Instrumental music]

1057
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,187
We need to tell our children
new stories.

1058
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,757
We need to be bold.

1059
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,326
Remember those soldiers
at the Nativity?

1060
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:27,331
These were Herod's strongest
warriors doing his bidding.

1061
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,900
Every toy soldier can be
a reminder

1062
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:36,073
Of the whole story of how a baby
was spared in his infancy

1063
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:38,008
To become the warrior
that ensured

1064
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:42,747
That death finally was killed.

1065

00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:00,330
So, bring the soldiers close.

1068
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:05,102
Let them be near the nativity,
and remind your children

1069
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:09,907
That every character
in God's story has a place.

1070
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:20,651
[Instrumental music]

1071
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:26,023
And if you've been that guy,
if you spent the holidays

1072
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,759
Terrorizing your family
and your friends,

1073
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:31,395
Scowling at Santa,
frustrating your wife,

1074
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:34,198
It's time to make it right.

[Instrumental music]

1076
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,343
Christmas, after all,

1077
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,915
Is ultimately about making
all things right.

1078

1079
01:00:57,121 --> 01:01:00,124
You okay?

1080
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:08,198
Honey, I've been a bit of a jerk
this Christmas season.

1081
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,435
Yeah, you have.

1082
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:14,338
[Instrumental music]

1083
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:19,176
You deserve so much better,

1084
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,177
And this Christmas, I want
to give you something

1085
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:26,050
I've been wanting to give you
for a long time.

1086
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,886
What do you got in mind,
big papa?

1087
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,288
Now, what happens in most
stories at this point?

1088
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,290
I mean, if you were writing
this story right now,

1089
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:35,092
What would you want
to have happen?

1090
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,795
The cliche kiss, right?

1091
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:42,499
But, if we learned one thing
in all this, let's not forget

1092
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:48,472
That sometimes our heroes
do the unexpected.

1093
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,775
I went ahead and just organized
a hip hop dance crew

1094
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:52,442
That encompasses all the joy
in gospel,

1095
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:54,879
Bursting in excitement
that I alone as one man

1096
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:56,847
Just cannot express.

1097
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:57,982
No, really, I did.

1098
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,184
Hit it, Deandre!

1099
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,252
Oh, man, I got just the track
for you!

1100
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:03,988
How about some
Family Force Five?

1102
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,025
Come on, people, let's do this!

1103
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,394
Yeah! I want to see
a choir in here.

1104
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,396
A God squad.
You know how we do.

1105
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,832
Ooh, Marshall Foster's
in the house

1106

grew hoarse,

scratched the surface

01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:23,232
I listen to nature,
mother nature, father nature.

1399
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:24,467
Your father hates you.

1400
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,804
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad,
what did I do?

1401
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,106
You know what you did,
call all your crew,

1402
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:33,009
Call your friends,
dress up in some baby blue.

1403
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,145
Come back, write an essay.

1404
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:38,414
Tunnel Rats,
that's what they say.

1405
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:42,018
Sleigh, sleigh, pray every day.

1406
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,987
Essential.

1407
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,154
Monumental.

1408
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:47,290
Environmental.

1409
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,893
Heart... control.

1410
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,895
They wanna take your soul.

1411
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,429
They wanna beat Solid Gold.

1412
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:55,198
I'm on a roll.

1413
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,902
They wanna say things
and think about 'em.

1414
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,770
I doubt 'em, bing!

1415
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,906
'Cause you know what it is.

1416
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,775
Music, Cameron, music,
movie biz.

1417
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:07,476
- Kirk, Kirk...
- Cameron.

1418
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:08,778
- Kirk,
- Kirk,

1419
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,780
- Kirk,
- Kirk Cameron.

1420
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,882
- It be the, be the...
- Kirk Cameron.

1421
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,083
- Camfam,
- Kirk,

1422
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:15,451
Kirk, Kirk Cameron.

1423
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:18,187
Kirk, Kirk, it ain't James.

1424
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,188
- Kirk,
- Kirk,

1425
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,525
Kirk, Kirk Cameron.

1426
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:23,459
Movement.

1427
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,962
We don't stop, baby.
All day, every day.
