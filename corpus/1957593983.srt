1
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:49,900
(speaking in foreign language)

2
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:55,600
(suspenseful music)

3
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,166
(intense music)

4
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:24,033
(suspenseful music)

5
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,133
- Isn't this where we're
supposed to meet the tour guide?

6
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,100
Oh Helen, they--

7
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,200
(gasps)

8
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,666
- Who was that, Susan dear?

9
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,366
- I don't know.

10
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,200
- The porter?

11
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,266
- Now Joe, don't start.

12
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:59,000
- Oh!
(clattering)

13
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,366
- Hey are you alright, man?

14
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,366
- Yeah, wife's
bag's a little heavy

15
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:05,066
and the bus fumes made
me a little dizzy.

16
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,400
- Milt, put the bags down.

17
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
- Alright.
- The bellhop'll get 'em.

18
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,733
- Well, the Hollys are here.

19
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,500
Boy I sure could
go for a little nip

20
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,366
of that Russian vodka,
I'll tell you that.

21
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:16,533
(clapping)
(suspenseful music)

22
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,566
- Please, leave luggage here.

23
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,333
The porters will take
them to the room.

24
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,466
- Her warmth is overwhelming,
don't you think?

25
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,366
- She can warm me up
anytime she likes.

26
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,966
- You must check
into hotel, please.

27
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,333
Thank you.

28
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,300
(suspenseful music)

29
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:52,533
(speaking in foreign language)

30
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:24,600
- [Susan] Could you
save my place, Helen?

31
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,666
I'll be right back.

32
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,866
- [Helen] Of course, dear.

33
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,000
(speaking in foreign language)

34
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,466
- I'll take them.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:05,066
- Thank you.

36
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,533
(speaking in foreign language)

37
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,733
- 30 rubles.
- 30, right, sorry.

38
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:13,500
- Yeah?

39
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,533
- How's the tour?

40
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,966
- Great.
- Come from Moscow?

41
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,766
- Yeah, yeah, it was great.

42
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,600
I mean I'd rather
be on my own, but...

43
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,133
- At least you
have a phrasebook.

44
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,533
Once I get past
borscht and strobanoff,

45
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,466
stroganoff, you
see, I'm useless.

46
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,500
- Well it's a
difficult language.

47
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
So you're not with the tour?

48
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
- No, I wish.

49
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,266
Monday I'm due at the
Ruske Bank in Moscow.

50
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,566
So that leaves me
the whole weekend

51
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,900
to see all of beautiful
St. Petersburg.

52
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,066
- That's all the
time we have too.

53
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,200
- Well at least
you've got somebody

54
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,466
to show you around.

55
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,400
- You could always tag
along with us if you'd like.

56
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:52,866
I'm Susan Dennison.

57
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,133
- Grant Ames.

58
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:08,933
(suspenseful music)

59
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:53,533
(cries out)
(dramatic music)

60
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,566
(groaning)

61
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,766
(suspenseful music)

62
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,400
(water running from faucet)

63
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,566
(buzzer buzzes)

64
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,166
- Be right there!

65
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,133
(suspenseful music)

66
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,366
Hi!
- Hi, you ready?

67
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,466
- Yeah, just about.

68
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,100
I gotta grab my
stuff, come on in.

69
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,866
- Sure.

70
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,333
Well you have a great
view from this room.

71
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,533
- Yeah, it's
beautiful, isn't it?

72
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,800
- Yeah.

73
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,666
- Okay, so I don't
forget anything.

74
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,866
(suspenseful music)

75
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:19,066
Key, camera bag,
purse, and that's it.

76
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,000
- You want me to
take that for you?

77
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
- Oh, great, thanks.

78
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,766
Let me get Joe and Helen, okay?

79
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:31,733
They're just across the hall.
(suspenseful music)

80
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,733
(knocks)

81
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,666
Hello in there.

82
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,466
- [Helen] Come on in.

83
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,066
- Hey you two, the bus
leaves in five minutes.

84
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,466
- Oh hi Susie dear.

85
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,900
We decided to stay
in this afternoon.

86
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,933
We're just not as
young as we used to be.

87
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,566
- Speak for yourself, Helen.

88
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,366
- Well is there
anything I can do?

89
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,400
- Bring me that tour
guide, Viktoria?

90
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,766
(laughing)

91
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:03,900
- You wouldn't know
what to do with her

92
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,766
if you had her, Joe.

93
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,933
Ooh, a handsome stranger.

94
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,466
You could introduce us, dear.

95
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,533
- Grant Ames, Helen
and Joe Meadows.

96
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,300
Grant's coming with
us this afternoon.

97
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,500
- Nice to meet you both.

98
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,066
You sure we can't
convince you to join us?

99
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,000
- You take good care
of Susie, you hear?

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,266
- Yes sir.

101
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,466
- Okay well I'll
see you guys later.

102
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:21,700
Take care, get
some rest, alright?

103
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,166
- Okay, have a good time.

104
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,100
We'll be fine.

105
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:33,366
(singing in foreign language)

106
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,333
(speaking in foreign language)

107
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,366
- I know she's coming.
- Alright, alright,

108
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,566
I'll save her a seat.

109
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,533
- [Molly] Well there she is now!

110
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,533
- Hey Susie!
- Hi guys!

111
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,766
- [Milt] How you
doing, how's it going?

112
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:44,566
- [Susie] Good, how
you doing, Milt?

113
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,366
- Well, raring to go.

114
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,566
Hey, let me ask you
a question, Susie.

115
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:52,666
Is it me or is the
plumbing here kinda funny?

116
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,933
When you flush your toilet,

117
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,333
does it make a
sound like stepping

118
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,466
on a tail of a dog,
kind of like (howling).

119
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,300
- Milt.

120
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,000
- Hey, buddy, how goes it?

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,066
Welcome aboard, you must be

122
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,533
the new member of the tour.

123
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,266
My name is Milt Holly and this
is my wife here, Molly Holly.

124
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,733
It rhymes, kinda like holy moly.

125
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,066
(laughs)

126
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,333
- Grant Ames, nice
to meet you both.

127
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,966
Molly, let me help you
out with that thing.

128
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,966
- [Molly] Why thank you!

129
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,066
- It really wasn't that heavy.

130
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,733
- Here, I threw that,

131
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,666
you want me to put this bag

132
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,766
maybe underneath the seat?

133
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,066
- Oh sure.

134
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,333
Just wanna get a
shot of the hotel.

135
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,400
- [Grant] From the
looks of all this stuff

136
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,466
you must really know
what you're doing.

137
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,533
- Not really.

138
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm a typical American though,

139
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,066
I wouldn't dream
of having a hobby

140
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,366
without going state of the art.

141
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:36,400
- [Milt] Hey Susie, you
pay retail for that?

142
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,533
- Yeah, why?

143
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,333
- Well my brother Ed's
got a store in Dallas.

144
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,400
- Hmm.

145
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,533
- I don't think Hillary
was this well-equipped

146
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,966
at Mount Everest.

147
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,000
- [Susan] I've gotta
get this other lens.

148
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,933
(speaking in foreign language)

149
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,133
- This was original fortress
built on the Neva River.

150
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,700
(suspenseful music)

151
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,466
This fortress of
Peter and Paul is

152
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,300
of great historical importance.

153
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,266
It was originally built as
a prison and a fortress.

154
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,733
It contains the remains
of all the tsars.

155
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:35,500
With the exception of the
last tsar, Nicholas II.

156
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,533
The body of Peter
the Great is here.

157
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,366
Please, follow me.

158
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,633
- So these are the
rulers of old Russia.

159
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,800
- I think I prefer Mount
Vernon and Monticello myself.

160
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
- Yeah but there's a sense
of romance and adventure

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,633
over here that I never
felt in the States.

162
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:56,966
Russia's fascinating.

163
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,666
- [Grant] Do you
travel very much?

164
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,133
- Not as much as I'd like.

165
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,933
The school year does not
end for teachers in June,

166
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:03,833
let me tell you.

167
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,066
(laughs)

168
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:05,800
- You teach, you teach,
what do you teach?

169
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,233
- Algebra, trig.

170
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,266
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

171
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,366
The really exciting stuff.

172
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:13,033
- You know, this reminds
me a lot of Graceland.

173
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,166
Remember that trip to Memphis

174
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,933
where you got sick on
them cheese corn dogs?

175
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,166
- Corn dogs?

176
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:17,933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

177
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:18,933
- Well, I do.

178
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,266
You barfed twice in the car.

179
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,866
- I don't remember anything.
- Well that's as usual.

180
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,566
(speaking in foreign language)

181
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,666
- We now come to the
area where the tsars

182
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,533
would imprison those
whom they did not trust.

183
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,000
Even their own family.

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,133
In this room, Peter the
Great's own son Alexei

185
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,333
was imprisoned and tortured

186
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,200
for defying his rule.

187
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,433
- My goodness, talk
about getting grounded
for the weekend!

188
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,600
- Hey honey.

189
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
(shackles clanking)

190
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,566
Remember that
night in the motel?

191
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:12,666
- Would you shut up?

192
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,566
I don't remember no motel!
- Alright.

193
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:14,066
- Okay?
- Sorry.

194
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,400
- Look at this crossbow.

195
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,233
Must be 300 years old.
(suspenseful music)

196
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,600
Wonder if it still works.

197
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,633
Hey Grant, stand next to this
thing, I'll get a picture.

198
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,033
- No, I've got a better idea.

199
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,633
Let me take a picture of
you here with these guys.

200
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,733
- Okay, okay great,
that'd be good.

201
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,000
There you go.

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,933
- Yeah, stand next to
the red monk there.

203
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,766
(dramatic music)

204
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,733
Hey!

205
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Hey!

206
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,600
Hey!

207
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,333
- Oh.

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
- I'm sorry Susan.

209
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
(engine rumbling)

210
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,033
- Unfortunately, you have
just had demonstration

211
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,366
of why it is necessary
to keep close watch

212
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,833
on all personal belongings.

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,600
Please.

214
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
- Well I think I'll
get a cab and see

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,566
if I can't pick
up another camera.

216
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:26,866
- Yeah, right.

217
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,066
- Do you have any plans?

218
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,766
- Well, I'm expecting
a fax from New York

219
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,033
back at the hotel.

220
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,733
- Oh, of course, business, yeah.

221
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,533
- Yeah.

222
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,433
- Okay.

223
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,566
- Will I see you at dinner?

224
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,600
- Absolutely.

225
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,366
So long.

226
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,200
(mysterious music)

227
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,000
(horns honking)

228
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:15,766
(suspenseful music)

229
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:49,000
(speaking in foreign language)

230
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
- Joe!

231
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Hey, Helen!

232
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,233
Hey, Joe!

233
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh.

234
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,833
(speaking in foreign language)

235
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,800
Hi.

236
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,633
Helen, Joe!

237
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,566
Joe?

238
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,233
Oh, hi.

239
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,666
Uh, English, you speak English?

240
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:30,066
(speaking in foreign language)

241
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,633
I'm looking for my
friends, Joe, Helen.

242
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,366
You were with them.

243
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,533
Are they here?

244
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, oh Father,
Father, excuse me.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
Father, do you speak English?

246
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
- Can I help you?

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,333
- Yes, oh yes please.

248
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,966
I'm looking for my
friends, Joe and Helen.

249
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,600
This man was with them.

250
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,766
Could you translate please?

251
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,666
(speaking in foreign language)

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
- He knows nothing.

253
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,266
- No but he was just with
them, I just saw him.

254
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,133
(speaking in foreign language)

255
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,133
- He does not know
any Americans.

256
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,866
- That's impossible, I
saw him on the street

257
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,133
talking with them.

258
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,000
And then he was
just with them now.

259
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,733
Hey, hey.

260
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,033
Hey!

261
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:30,800
Father.

262
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,800
What is going on here?

263
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,766
(suspenseful music)

264
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,666
- Pretty lady, pretty lady,

265
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,466
I have icons,
pictures of saints.

266
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:55,800
Pins, medallions.
- No, no thank you.

267
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,933
- Ah, you American!

268
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,966
Look, very beautiful,
very cheap.

269
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,666
- I'm not interested, thank you.

270
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,166
- You come to Russia,
see beautiful things, da?

271
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,633
You come with me now, I show
you many beautiful things.

272
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,000
- No please, I'm trying to read.

273
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,466
Please, leave me alone.

274
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,533
- What you read?

275
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,766
American book?

276
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:15,433
You want have, I am
very young, very strong.

277
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,400
Very unusual.

278
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,233
- I'm sure you are,
I'm not interested.

279
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,633
Thank you.

280
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,466
- Pretty lady, pretty lady.

281
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,666
- No, no, please, leave
me alone, thank you.

282
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,833
(suspenseful music)

283
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,466
Oh god.

284
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,166
Oh no!

285
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,566
(murmuring)

286
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,333
Excuse me, do you speak English?

287
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,166
(speaking in foreign language)

288
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,166
Excuse me, do you speak English?

289
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,733
- Yes.

290
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,266
But only a little.

291
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,600
- Can you tell me what happened?

292
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,766
- This would not be
interesting for foreigners.

293
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:22,533
Excuse me.

294
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,066
(speaking in foreign language)

295
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,133
- Ah, hi!

296
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:52,933
- Helen, Joe!

297
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,133
Thank God you're alright,
I was so worried about you!

298
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,666
- Oh my goodness.

299
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,166
- I saw you on the
street this afternoon

300
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:58,966
and then at the church.

301
00:21:58,966 --> 00:21:59,766
Didn't you see me?

302
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:00,766
I yelled to you.

303
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,466
- Why no dear.

304
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,766
- Oh and then when that
priest was murdered, I--

305
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:05,066
- Murdered?

306
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,066
- Oh you don't know about it.

307
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,966
Oh, oh I had just talked to him.

308
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,133
- Oh, how awful.
- What a world.

309
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,366
- Yeah.

310
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,766
I thought you guys
weren't gonna go out.

311
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,800
- Well I bounced back and
the wife said let's go.

312
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,333
So we go.
(chuckles)

313
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,766
- Well, the important
thing is that you're okay.

314
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,833
- Ah yes, I'll feel a lot better

315
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,233
with that Russian tour guide.

316
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,466
- Ooh!
(laughs)

317
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,800
- Hey, who was that man
you were talking to?

318
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
(suspenseful music)

319
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,566
- What man?

320
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,833
- The one on the street, he
was the creepy-looking guy

321
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,733
from the lobby this morning.

322
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,766
- I don't remember
anyone in particular.

323
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,033
Do you, Joe?

324
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,533
- Well maybe it was someone
we asked directions.

325
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,800
- Hiya, hey everyone,
hey, how you doing?

326
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,633
- Hi.
- Hey Joe, hey Joe,

327
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:40,966
you won't believe it.

328
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,466
They got a nightclub
down there, it's amazing.

329
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:45,133
It's like one of these
bars with these tassel bars

330
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,333
where they twirl and all that.

331
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,666
It's like being in Las Vegas.

332
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,800
- No kidding.

333
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,566
- Well listen you guys,
I'm gonna go freshen up.

334
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,833
Catch you later.

335
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,400
- We'll save you a
place at the table.

336
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:02,733
- Hey, listen.

337
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,033
You won't believe
what else happened.

338
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,366
This afternoon, this
little Russian boy

339
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,733
comes up to me and
he wants to sell me

340
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,366
one of them Davy Crockett
hats with hair on it.

341
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,166
- Did it have a tail?

342
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,866
- Um, no.

343
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:12,800
- Was it dead?

344
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,366
- Yeah, I believe it was.

345
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,633
- He offered him
1,000 rubles for it.

346
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,000
- Well it looked very nice on me

347
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,766
and plus I was just
trying to jack up

348
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:20,733
the global economy.

349
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,866
(laughs)

350
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,233
- Well let's all jack it up.

351
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
(suspenseful music)

352
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,466
(speaking in foreign language)

353
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,633
(elevator dings)

354
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,000
(dramatic music)

355
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,666
(suspenseful music)

356
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,333
- You've been going through
my things, I need to know why.

357
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,500
- I was just...

358
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,833
- What are you
doing here, Susan?

359
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,333
- I saw you coming out
of Helen and Joe's room

360
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,000
and then you were speaking
Russian with their maid

361
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,866
so I didn't know...

362
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:21,633
I was...

363
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:23,366
I couldn't...

364
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:24,133
- Just calm down.

365
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,900
Sit.

366
00:26:33,433 --> 00:26:34,466
(mysterious music)

367
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:35,233
Everything's okay.

368
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:39,333
But you must tell
me what you've seen.

369
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,900
- I saw a Russian passport.

370
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:43,933
Are you a Russian?

371
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:53,466
- I'm as American as
you are, it's a cover.

372
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,166
- You're a spy!

373
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,133
You're watching Helen and Joe!

374
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,133
- Cold War's over,
haven't you heard?

375
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:06,500
Before I tell you anything
more you have to swear to me

376
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,766
that no matter what I say

377
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:09,600
you'll keep it in the
strictest of confidence.

378
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,133
Understand I can hold you to it.

379
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:11,900
- I swear.

380
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,766
- I'm with the United
States Customs Service

381
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,466
working jointly with Interpol.

382
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,966
Since the break up
of the Soviet Union,

383
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,200
my Russian counterparts
and I have been following

384
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,400
the activities of the St.
Petersburg Monarchist Society.

385
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,733
A bunch of old folks
trying to whip up support

386
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,533
for a return to the
rule of the tsars.

387
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,066
To the Romanov dynasty.

388
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,900
Well, they're trying to get
the tsar's icon out of Russia.

389
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,266
- The tsar's icon?

390
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,066
It's valuable?

391
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,566
- It is to the monarchists.

392
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,000
It's a symbol they
can rally behind.

393
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,566
To the Russian government,
it's a valuable

394
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,333
piece of their history and
to the rest of the world

395
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,133
it's just a small
piece of religious art,

396
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:56,500
easily concealed, worth
about two million bucks.

397
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,800
(suspenseful music)

398
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,533
- And the Meadows are
trying to steal it.

399
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:00,600
- Mm, not exactly.

400
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,700
You see, Helen Meadows
fancies herself

401
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,866
a far distant relative
of the last tsar.

402
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:08,400
So they're loyal monarchists.

403
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,466
The Meadows are trying
to find the icon

404
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:15,100
and see to it the monarchists
get it safely abroad.

405
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,566
- So they don't have it yet?

406
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,566
- No, no, no, no,

407
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,900
those old monarchists
are very cagey.

408
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,800
You see, the icon is
in a church somewhere

409
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,366
in St. Petersburg, but no
one person knows which church

410
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:25,666
or where it is in the church

411
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,500
and the Meadows are
piecing the puzzle together

412
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,466
bit by bit and I'm just
trying to keep up with them.

413
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,666
- That man from the
cathedral, I saw them with him

414
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,800
on the street today.

415
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,666
(suspenseful music)

416
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,200
- What did he look like?

417
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
- Tall, skinny guy, he
was all dressed in black,

418
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,733
he had a ponytail.

419
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,666
- And eyeglasses
like Coke bottles.

420
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,766
- [Susan] Yeah,
yeah, you know him?

421
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,000
- Only by reputation.

422
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,866
I saw him in the
hotel this morning.

423
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:51,333
- So did I.

424
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,700
- Did you?

425
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,566
His name's Igor Blitzkov,
he used to be big time

426
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,300
with the KGB.

427
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,933
Now he's St. Petersburg mafia.

428
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,100
- Really, they
have a mafia here?

429
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,866
- Oh yeah.

430
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,733
I bet he's convinced
Joe and Helen

431
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:06,166
that he's a monarchist too.

432
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,900
Well believe me, he's
not, he's only out

433
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,366
for the icon for himself.

434
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,500
They're playing with
a very tough customer.

435
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,766
- So what do we do?

436
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,066
- We?

437
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,533
Not a chance.

438
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:21,566
- Why not?

439
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,566
I wanna do my part.

440
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:24,533
- Look.

441
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,566
This isn't James Bond.

442
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:29,533
Everything is not gonna
turn out okay in the end.

443
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,066
Three people have
already been murdered,

444
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:33,333
including a maid
in this very hotel.

445
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,500
- But Helen and Joe trust me.

446
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,600
I know I could help.

447
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
(bangs)

448
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,066
- Absolutely not, Susan.

449
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,533
- Look, I'll be
with them anyway.

450
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,466
All I'll do is I'll
stick real close to them

451
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,500
and I'll tell you
who they talk to,

452
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,400
where they went.

453
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,533
It's gotta help you, right?

454
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,666
(suspenseful music)

455
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,933
- You know, everything
inside of me tells me

456
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,200
I should go over there
and pick up that phone,

457
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,400
call the embassy and
have you shipped home

458
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,333
before you get yourself
in real trouble.

459
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,100
- But you're not
going to, right?

460
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,366
- You'll do exactly as I say.

461
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,200
- Girl scout's honor.

462
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,700
- What am I doing?

463
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,466
Still, you would give
me the perfect cover.

464
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,300
- Yeah.

465
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,666
- I'm not gonna be
on the tour tomorrow

466
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,733
to the Summer Palace.

467
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:17,900
I want you to keep an
eye on the Meadows.

468
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,266
But no matter what you
do, I don't want you

469
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:23,533
to find yourself alone with
them, do you understand?

470
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,766
- Fine, alright.

471
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,466
- Do you understand?

472
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,566
- Yes.

473
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:30,400
Yes.

474
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:34,533
- 'Kay.

475
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,400
(suspenseful music)

476
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,966
- The Summer Palace was Peter
the Great's lasting monument

477
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,533
to the city he built

478
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:46,600
and home to many other tsars.

479
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,466
Including the last
tsar, Nicholas.

480
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:56,200
We are now on the grand
staircase of the Summer Palace

481
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,600
which was built by
the tsars in 1751.

482
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,666
This room, commonly
known as the gold room,

483
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:13,500
is where Catherine II
would receive petitions

484
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,500
of a private nature.

485
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,200
- Must be worth
more than Fort Knox.

486
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,300
- Oh my, yes!

487
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,933
- Maybe we should
make them an offer.

488
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,300
- How much you
got in your purse?

489
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,666
(laughs)

490
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:28,533
- Oh, you're not feeling
faint again, are you Joe?

491
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:29,966
- What is it Joe,
you got the runs?

492
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:31,200
- [Helen] You want
me to call a cab

493
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,300
and we'll go back to the hotel?

494
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,466
- I think that's a good idea.

495
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,133
- Let me help.

496
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,800
- No, that's alright
dear, we can manage.

497
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,400
- No, no, I want
to, let me come.

498
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,866
- No, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

499
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,533
- You stay here and enjoy
yourself, we'll get a cab.

500
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,566
- Are you sure?

501
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,466
- Positive.

502
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, you're an angel.

503
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,866
(smooches)

504
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,900
- You know Joe oughta
get himself some Zs.

505
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:07,133
(mysterious music)

506
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:34,133
(speaking in foreign language)

507
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,733
- And now we are
in the grand hall.

508
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:45,966
This is the actual throne
of Peter the Great.

509
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:49,366
The throne was also used
by Catherine the Great

510
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:54,400
in the hall to receive official
delegations, ambassadors.

511
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,733
- Do you believe that?
- The hall was also--

512
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,566
- That was Peter the Great's.

513
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,400
- Big deal, it's just a chair.

514
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,933
- No, that was
his actual throne.

515
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,466
- Yeah, if it's his throne,

516
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,366
where's the toilet
paper and the magazines?

517
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,600
(mysterious music)

518
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:01,466
- That's it, Joe.

519
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,400
(suspenseful music)

520
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,500
Come on Joe, come on!

521
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,700
(shushes)

522
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:25,100
(speaking in foreign language)

523
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:28,533
Careful Joe, careful!

524
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,966
- [Joe] Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah.

525
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,533
- Come on Joe, come on.

526
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:48,400
Here, here.

527
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:58,566
(gasps)

528
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,666
(speaking in foreign language)

529
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,533
(dramatic music)

530
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,666
- We're nearly there, Helen.

531
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,333
- We don't have much
time, someone's onto us.

532
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,533
- Quit your bellyaching.

533
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,333
No one knows we're here.

534
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,500
- And the priest?

535
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,466
- He was doing his duty.

536
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:14,766
He was careless, that's all.

537
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:17,333
- He was a good man, he
didn't deserve to end up dead.

538
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,400
- There are some things
more important than life.

539
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,166
Here.

540
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,666
(suspenseful music)

541
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,533
- Oh, there's a man,
a man is following me!

542
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:35,533
(speaking in foreign language)

543
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,300
No, I, oh!

544
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:45,100
(speaking in foreign language)

545
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,733
(dramatic music)

546
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,466
(screams)
(horses neighing)

547
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,833
(screaming)

548
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,566
Help me!

549
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,300
Stop!

550
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:45,466
(speaking in foreign language)

551
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,500
(crashing)

552
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:56,733
Stop!

553
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,100
Stop!

554
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:18,933
(horses neighing)

555
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,533
Oh, oh my god, oh, oh.

556
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,933
That man Igor was chasing me.

557
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,700
He had a knife.

558
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,433
Oh my god, I'm shaking.

559
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,266
Oh jeez, I'm shaking.

560
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,866
Oh god.

561
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:39,633
- [Detective] So, Ms. Dennison.

562
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:43,366
Tell me once more please
how all this happen.

563
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:45,433
- [Susan] Well, it's
really like I said.

564
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,966
I mean, I was just sitting there

565
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:47,933
waiting for a ride

566
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,233
and the horses just took off.

567
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:51,333
I don't know what happened.

568
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,366
(speaking in foreign language)

569
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:58,900
- Your guide told that
everything was as you say.

570
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:06,866
(speaking in foreign language)

571
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:07,766
- I don't know
what you told him,

572
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,500
but whatever it was, thank you.

573
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,133
- Don't mention it.

574
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:13,133
Please, our bus is waiting.

575
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:14,900
Dinner will be served at hotel.

576
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:18,433
- I wonder what she told him.

577
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,133
- I thought we were agreed

578
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,733
you weren't gonna
be alone with them.

579
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,500
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

580
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,166
- But I didn't, thanks to you.

581
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,066
I couldn't believe how
you handled those horses.

582
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,900
You were amazing!

583
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,366
- I was pretty good, wasn't I?

584
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,833
- Incredible.

585
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,633
But why didn't you want me to
tell that detective anything?

586
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,666
Aren't you working with
the Russian police?

587
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,300
- Well not with the locals.

588
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,466
If I had to answer to every
law enforcement goon in town

589
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,366
I'd never get anything done.

590
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:44,666
- Hmm.

591
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,633
So do you know what
was on that page

592
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:46,700
they cut out from the book?

593
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,633
- I have a pretty good idea.

594
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,433
- Well are you gonna tell me?

595
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,233
- I don't know.

596
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,866
If you're nice to me.

597
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:54,900
- Is that so?
- Mm.

598
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,966
(Russian music)

599
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:13,733
(singing in foreign language)

600
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,700
(applauding)

601
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,700
- My mother taught me that.

602
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,333
- And Helen taught me.

603
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,566
- Really, really?

604
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:43,866
- You know Grant, it
was a miracle that you

605
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,633
were able to stop that horse.

606
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,766
- It was just dumb luck.

607
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,366
- No, you were very courageous.

608
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,133
- The most important thing
is is you're safe and sound.

609
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:57,666
And looking especially lovely.

610
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:01,566
(Russian music)

611
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,133
Would you make an
old man's night?

612
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:07,233
- I'd be delighted.

613
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,766
- Not too fast, Joe.

614
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,500
- What?

615
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
- Well?

616
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,533
- Oh, alright.

617
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:26,466
Let's dance, I guess.
- Yeah.

618
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:28,866
- Ow!

619
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,233
Those high heels.

620
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,866
- Oh, come on.
- Alright, alright, alright.

621
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,233
- May I have the honor?

622
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,066
- Oh, I couldn't.

623
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,300
- Oh come on.

624
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,566
Let's show 'em how it's done.

625
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:48,966
- But I haven't
danced in 30 years.

626
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,500
- That was the last time
the band learned a new tune.

627
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,566
Come on.

628
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:53,366
(laughing)

629
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:54,533
- Let's do it.

630
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:01,466
- Oh, you've done this before.

631
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:02,500
(laughing)

632
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,133
- Don't tell Helen.

633
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,966
I was voted the best dancer
for the class of '43.

634
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:08,966
- '43, well that puts you
right in sync with the band.

635
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,900
- Just what were you
doing in that carriage?

636
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,833
- I was just sitting there,
the horse just took off.

637
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:27,566
- Oh.

638
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,166
You're not some sort
of spy, are you?

639
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:35,700
(laughing)

640
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,266
I'm just pulling
your leg, Susie.

641
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:40,166
No really, you shouldn't go
where they don't want you to go.

642
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,866
They get mighty hot
under the collar.

643
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,033
- Joe, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

644
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:50,633
- May I cut in?
- Ooh.

645
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:52,466
Thank you.

646
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:53,433
- Oh, so?

647
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:56,633
- She doesn't know a thing.

648
00:44:56,633 --> 00:45:00,466
(speaking in foreign language)

649
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:07,500
You may end up being
Grand Duchess after all.

650
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,333
(suspenseful music)

651
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,266
- One more minute and
I would have screamed.

652
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:24,500
- The band could use a break.

653
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,866
- I think he's onto me.

654
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,066
He was asking me a
lot of questions.

655
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,100
Yeah.

656
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,100
But he also suspects Viktoria.

657
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,366
God, thinking of Viktoria,

658
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:35,100
do you think she's
lying to the police?

659
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,733
- Oh, the tour guide.

660
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,366
No, I doubt it.

661
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,900
- That page they
cut from the book.

662
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,466
Do you suppose it was
a map of the church?

663
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:47,533
- Probably, don't
worry about it.

664
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:49,100
- Oh, I could go
back to that library

665
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,866
and maybe pick up a clue.

666
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,733
- Bad idea.

667
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,700
(laughs)

668
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,666
- You're distracting me.

669
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,333
- I certainly hope so.

670
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,566
- Is this the part
where the conspirators

671
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:21,833
have a meeting of the minds?

672
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,100
- Or something.

673
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,300
- I hope this isn't
gonna be a problem.

674
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,300
(dramatic music)

675
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,066
- What?

676
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,733
Mixing business with pleasure?

677
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,366
- Yeah.

678
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:54,433
- I can handle it.

679
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:56,433

The Merry Widow Lounge.

bars in cheap motels?

00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,433
Took me a long time
to recognize that.

719
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:17,966
- Well, don't be so
hard on yourself.

720
00:50:17,966 --> 00:50:18,733
Anyway.

721
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:22,700
Russia's gonna give you
a whole new perspective.

722
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,866
♪ As the exception to ♪
- I hope so.

723
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:31,366
♪ The rule ♪

724
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:18,066
(clears throat)

725
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:22,933
(suspenseful music)

726
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,266
(intense music)
(muffled shouting)

727
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:42,433
(suspenseful music)

728
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:18,833
Grant?

729
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,933
- You know this coffee
tastes like mud.

730
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:34,033
- Just drink it and shut up.
- Alright.

731
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:38,700
- Good morning everyone.

732
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,633
- Good morning.
- Hey Susie,

733
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,033
you snooze you lose.

734
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,200
You know late bird doesn't
catch the worm on this trip.

735
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,800
- Good morning,
how did you sleep?

736
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,100
- Wonderfully.

737
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,033
You?
- Oh I tossed and turned.

738
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,900
- Hmm, is that right?

739
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,400
- For some reason I just
couldn't get comfortable.

740
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,600
- Probably just
miss your own bed.

741
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,200
- No, I don't think that was it.

742
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:05,833
- Whoa. (laughs)

743
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:08,200
- So where are Joe and
Helen, did they eat yet?

744
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,233
- I don't know, they're
usually the first ones up.

745
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,133
- I will check.

746
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:18,033
But in 15 minutes we must
leave to drive to Pushkin.

747
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,600
- Milt.
- Huh?

748
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,733
- I think you left the
camera in the room again.

749
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:28,200
- Nope, you're wrong, look,
I got the camera right here.

750
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,133
Hey Susie, let me ask
you, on the bus today--

751
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,600
- Milt, I need to get a sweater.

752
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,066
- Oh, sweater, yes, well
it's always cold in Russia,

753
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,466
better get your sweater.

754
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:39,200
- We'll see you guys on the bus.

755
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,800
- Say, what the hey,
you're on vacation.

756
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,400
(suspenseful music)

757
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:48,933
- I missed you this morning.

758
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,300
- I had to leave.

759
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,400
I thought you might like
to keep things quiet.

760
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:58,933
- Mm, you're sweet.

761
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:04,833
- No, you're wonderful.

762
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:22,466
(suspenseful music)

763
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,866
- Excuse me, Ms. Dennison.

764
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:46,466
I must tell you, Helen and
Joseph Meadows, this morning,

765
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:48,933
return to America.

766
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:50,300
- What?

767
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,000
- They left a note.

768
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,733
They say goodbye to
everyone and they apologize

769
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,466
for leaving so soon.

770
00:55:59,466 --> 00:56:00,733
- I can't believe that!

771
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,200
How could they just go?

772
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,533
Did Joe get sick?

773
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:08,500
- Uh, they left
no other details.

774
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,600
Excuse me, I will go
and tell the others.

775
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
(suspenseful music)

776
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:41,266
- Grant!

777
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,700
Darn.

778
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,233
That red car, follow
the car please.

779
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:10,033
(speaking in foreign language)

780
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:11,200
There he goes.

781
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:22,533
Where is he?

782
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,833
Oh there he is, there he is.

783
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,400
Oh, that's it, good, follow him.

784
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,300
You understand, you understand?

785
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,933
Follow that car?
- I understand.

786
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:45,600
- There he is.

787
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,933
There he is, yeah.

788
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:07,033
Oh watch it, watch it, watch it!

789
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,800
(tires squealing)

790
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:17,733
Careful, careful.

791
00:58:19,766 --> 00:58:20,666
- All good.

792
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:41,033
- Not too close.

793
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:44,333
Slow down up here.

794
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,200
(speaking in foreign language)

795
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,933
(suspenseful music)

796
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,400
Okay, good, stay
here now, wait here.

797
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,066
I'll be right back.
- All good, yes.

798
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,533
(speaking in foreign language)

799
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,900
- No, wait, wait!

800
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:02,266
- Wait.

801
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,700
Wait, why are you so impatient?

802
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,566
The situation we have
here is so difficult.

803
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:07,766
I've been doing
exactly what we planned

804
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:09,600
but I don't have it, not yet.

805
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,866
- What do you mean,
you don't have it yet?

806
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:12,066
Will you stop screwing around?

807
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,633
We had a deal, Blitzkov!

808
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:16,600
- You Americans are always
so quick with blaming others.

809
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,033
- I did my part.

810
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:26,000
Bottom line.

811
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,600
- You'll have it tomorrow night.

812
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,266
- I'd better.
- But I am worried.

813
01:00:29,266 --> 01:00:31,500
This American woman.
(suspenseful music)

814
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,433
- The situation's under control.

815
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:37,033
- That's exactly
what Gorbachev said

816
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,366
a week before the coup.

817
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:40,166
I don't trust her at all.

818
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,366
Get rid of her.

819
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:42,433
- She's a US citizen.

820
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:43,566
If anything happens to her,

821
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:45,800
the embassy will be
down around our ears.

822
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,266
- Perhaps I should handle it.

823
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:52,300
- Yeah, well perhaps
when I no longer need her

824
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,633
I'll take care of her myself.

825
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:54,566
- As you wish.

826
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:59,833
(branch snaps)

827
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:02,500
(dramatic music)

828
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:23,500
- Susan!

829
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,900
Susan, stop running!

830
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,700
Let me explain, come on!

831
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,300
Susan, Susan, stop!

832
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:46,333
Susan.

833
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,366
- Let go of me!

834
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:51,400
- Don't run away.

835
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,533
Shh.

836
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:53,266
Shh.

837
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,300
- I heard everything.

838
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,166
You're a criminal,
just like him.

839
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:00,800
- Yeah that's exactly
what he thinks.

840
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,966
It's taken me eight months
to win Blitzkov's confidence.

841
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:05,266
I am so close I can taste it.

842
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:06,966
Once he gives me one
more piece of evidence

843
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,800
I'll have the whole
mafia ring broken.

844
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,000
Then I can go home.

845
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,000
We can go home.

846
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,366
- Why should I believe you?

847
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,100
- Because I'm telling
you the truth.

848
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:22,666
Because I love you.

849
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:25,600
(suspenseful music)

850
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:32,400
I want us to have a
future together, Susan.

851
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,766
- Oh, oh Grant.

852
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:37,166
You do?

853
01:02:41,533 --> 01:02:43,500
(sighs)

854
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,266
You do.

855
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:47,000
- Come on.

856
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:51,600
(suspenseful music)

857
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,266
- Very nicely done, my friend.

858
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,333
And now, move away from him.

859
01:03:03,466 --> 01:03:04,266
Go.

860
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:12,900
- Don't do it, Blitzkov.

861
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,800
You'll blow the whole deal.

862
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,733
- Stalin knew it best.

863
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:18,300
(cocks gun)

864
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,266
You Americans are soft.

865
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,300
- You're acting like a dumb
Russian here, Blitzkov.

866
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,766
She's got $500,000 hard
currency in the hotel safe.

867
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,366
You kill her, we won't be
able to move the merchandise.

868
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:38,800
Why do you think
I keep her around?

869
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,300
- You'll never get
your hands on my money!

870
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,266
- Shut up!

871
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:42,133
(hits)
(cries out)

872
01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:42,900
- Watch it.

873
01:03:47,633 --> 01:03:48,400
Get back.

874
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,700
- What do we need him for?

875
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,966
I'm the one with the money.

876
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,200
If you can supply the
icon, let's make a deal.

877
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,400
- What's she talking about?

878
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,333
- Don't listen to
her, you need me.

879
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,933
- Shoot him, go
ahead, shoot him!

880
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:05,166
Shoot him!
- Shut up.

881
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,500
- Go on, shoot him!
- Let me think.

882
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,300
- Take your time.

883
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,533
What you need to do now is
think, think it through.

884
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,566
That's what's you
need to do now.

885
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:20,066
- Stand back.
- Think.

886
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:21,333
Think it through.

887
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:26,466
(dramatic music)

888
01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:30,766
(gun firing)

889
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:38,866
(empty gun clicking)

890
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:41,400
Blitzkov.

891
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,900
(neck snaps)

892
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:48,200
(suspenseful music)

893
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:53,166
- Oh.

894
01:04:54,466 --> 01:04:55,866
- You were terrific!

895
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:56,966
- Oh, thanks.

896
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:58,266
- Knocking his
glasses off like that.

897
01:04:58,266 --> 01:04:59,600
- I was aiming for his gun.

898
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:07,933
What are you looking for?

899
01:05:09,266 --> 01:05:10,333
- Just information.

900
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:12,966
Ah.

901
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:16,066
Help me.

902
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:16,800
- What?

903
01:05:17,733 --> 01:05:19,200
- Susan, listen to me.

904
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,666
Blitzkov was a cold-blooded
killer, he won't be mourned.

905
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,900
Here, take his other arm.

906
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:24,266
- Okay.

907
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,900
(suspenseful music)

908
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,700
(splashes)
(groans)

909
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,500
Oh my god.

910
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,266
- Easy.

911
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,266
Now I've got one
more thing to do

912
01:06:05,266 --> 01:06:06,466
then the last piece
of this puzzle

913
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,233
will drop into place.

914
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,033
We were never here, understand?

915
01:06:13,933 --> 01:06:17,100
Do you understand?
- Yes, yes.

916
01:06:19,033 --> 01:06:19,933
- Let's go.

917
01:06:21,466 --> 01:06:24,366
(mysterious music)

918
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:40,366
- So, is it as good with her?

919
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:44,933
- That's business, I
don't confuse the two.

920
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:45,733
(giggles)

921
01:06:45,733 --> 01:06:46,533
Ah.

922
01:06:46,533 --> 01:06:48,900
(whistling)

923
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:58,666
- So many churches
in Russia look alike.

924
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,333
This could be anywhere.

925
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,300
- Let me see the paper.

926
01:07:05,633 --> 01:07:07,066
Ah.

927
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,633
I'll find it.

928
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:10,833
- You know, when
Blitzkov's people

929
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:14,166
discover his body, they
will come after both of us.

930
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:16,366
- Mm, well by then we'll
both be on a plane.

931
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,366
- And the woman?

932
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,466
- What about her?

933
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,266
- You picked the wrong one
this time, she's too smart.

934
01:07:26,266 --> 01:07:27,833
- I picked her?

935
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,100
You're the one who put the
tsar's pin in her camera case.

936
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,900
- That was emergency.

937
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,666
You could have
picked someone else.

938
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:37,666
- Jealousy.

939
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,033
Something new for you.

940
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,700
- Don't be ridiculous.

941
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,100
- We still need her.

942
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,866
- And then?

943
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:47,300
- I'll snap her neck.

944
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:51,966
- [Viktoria] Hmm, the glory
of the Russian people.

945
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:55,033
- But sure, take it
out of Russia, baby.

946
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:02,433
(speaking in foreign language)

947
01:08:02,433 --> 01:08:04,866
- [Susan] Is that the paper
you pulled of Blitzkov's body?

948
01:08:04,866 --> 01:08:06,166
What's it say?

949
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,900
- Well, just the name of
this church, this market, and

950
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,066
today's date.
- Hmm.

951
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,766
- We're looking for
one particular guy.

952
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:16,833
- Okay, which guy?

953
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:18,900
- Good question.

954
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,633
- Oh, I see, hmm.

955
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:27,100
It's just hard for me to believe

956
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,633
that dead tsars could
cause so much bloodshed.

957
01:08:30,633 --> 01:08:33,266
- You don't know much about
tsarist Russia, do you?

958
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:35,633
- I teach algebra, remember?

959
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:38,033
- Well in 1918, the new
socialist government

960
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:43,266
executed Tsar Nicholas
along with his entire family

961
01:08:43,266 --> 01:08:44,666
and servants.

962
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,433
The bodies were
found in a mine pit

963
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:48,333
near where they were shot.

964
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,066
Well, what was left
of them anyway.

965
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:52,133
They'd been chopped
into little pieces

966
01:08:52,133 --> 01:08:53,633
and burned with acid.

967
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:55,333
- Mm, thank you for
sharing that with me.

968
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,900
- Uh huh.

969
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,066
History's a brutal subject.

970
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:00,966
Russian history is
particularly brutal.

971
01:09:02,033 --> 01:09:04,066
The tsar's icon was
originally presented

972
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:05,933
to the Tsarina
Alexandra by none other

973
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,233
than Rasputin
himself, the mad monk.

974
01:09:08,233 --> 01:09:09,466
- Oh.

975
01:09:09,466 --> 01:09:11,066
- She was so in love
with her husband

976
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:12,733
that she gave it to him
even though her own faith

977
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:13,700
was far stronger.

978
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:15,666
That's it.

979
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:19,733
- Hey, do you want
to buy something?

980
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:22,033
(speaking in foreign language)

981
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:22,766
Sorry.

982
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,900
- Get out there and sing.
- What?

983
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:27,833
- Anything, anything.

984
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,033
I gotta get this guy alone.

985
01:09:29,033 --> 01:09:30,566
Sing something American,
just draw a crowd.

986
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,533
Go, go, go, go!
- I can't sing!

987
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:32,300
- Go, go!

Oh you look tired, uncle.

1011
01:10:40,566 --> 01:10:43,033

Let's move.
(laughing)

1016
01:10:50,466 --> 01:10:51,933
- I'm just warmed up.

1017
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:54,166
- The mafia has eyes
everywhere, let's go, come on.

1018
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,766
- You're hurting me.
(suspenseful music)

1019
01:10:55,766 --> 01:10:57,100
Grant.

1020
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,533
Oh look, there's Milt!

1021
01:10:58,533 --> 01:10:59,666
- Hey, hey Susie.

1022
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:00,900
Wait a minute!

1023
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,066
- This is it.

1024
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,700
Let's go.

1025
01:11:32,866 --> 01:11:35,766
(mysterious music)

1026
01:11:49,266 --> 01:11:50,700
- It's beautiful.

1027
01:11:58,266 --> 01:11:59,666
- Blitzkov said it
was behind the door

1028
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,333
hanging on a wall, so...

1029
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,566
- Is that where
it's supposed to be?

1030
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:39,266
Whoa.

1031
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:42,700
Oh no, it's gone.

1032
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,100
- Blitzkov.

1033
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,066
He double-crossed me.

1034
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,100
(scoffs)

1035
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,066
- And there's
nothing you can do?

1036
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,533
- No.
(suspenseful music)

1037
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:59,233
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.

1038
01:13:02,433 --> 01:13:03,900
- Well.

1039
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,166
If it hadn't been for you,

1040
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:09,266
I couldn't have come this far.

1041
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:10,700
- Don't say that.

1042
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:22,633
Maybe if I hadn't been
around you'd have it by now.

1043
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:24,900
- No.

1044
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:30,133
I owe you more than
you'll ever know.

1045
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:31,366
- And now it's over.

1046
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,233
I am so sorry.

1047
01:13:38,433 --> 01:13:39,233
- Yeah.

1048
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,966
I'm sorry too, Susan.

1049
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,100
Let's go.

1050
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,666
I told you I'd snap her neck
when I was through with her.

1051
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,900
(suspenseful music)

1052
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:42,766
(knocking)

1053
01:14:42,766 --> 01:14:43,533
- Grant?

1054
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:47,133
- [Molly] It's Molly,
we need to talk to you.

1055
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:48,533
- Oh Molly, I'm not dressed.

1056
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:50,366
Can I meet you downstairs?

1057
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:51,533
- [Molly] It'll
just take a moment.

1058
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:53,700
It's kind of important.

1059
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,533
- Okay, hang on.

1060
01:14:57,866 --> 01:14:58,666
What is it?

1061
01:14:58,666 --> 01:14:59,866
- Can we come in, Susan?

1062
01:14:59,866 --> 01:15:01,500
- Well I'm just getting
ready for dinner.

1063
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,933
- So it shouldn't take long.

1064
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:08,033
- What's the matter?

1065
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:10,733
- [Molly] You better
sit down, Susan.

1066
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:15,533
- Susan, I'm afraid
you've gotten yourself

1067
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:18,433
into something that's
pretty serious.

1068
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:19,533
- What's going on here?

1069
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,133
- Well first of
all, I'm not Milt.

1070
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:27,066
My name is John Mulwray, and
this is Vanessa Anderson.

1071
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:29,133
And we both work for Interpol.

1072
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:32,133
It's part of a joint
Russian-American
surveillance unit

1073
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:35,066
and we've been after your pal
Grant for the past two years.

1074
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,066
- His real name is
William Cassidy.

1075
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,766
- We found Blitzkov's
body floating in

1076
01:15:39,766 --> 01:15:41,300
the river at the palace.

1077
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,566
We got there before the police,

1078
01:15:42,566 --> 01:15:44,766
but not before Cassidy
got what he wanted.

1079
01:15:44,766 --> 01:15:46,433
- He killed that old
man at the flea market

1080
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:47,833
while you were singing.

1081
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:48,766
- Oh my god.

1082
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,366
I don't believe this.

1083
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,333
- [John] We also have to
assume he's responsible

1084
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,233
for the murder of
Helen and Joe Meadows.

1085
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,100
- What are you talking about?

1086
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,366
They went back to the States.

1087
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,933
- No one using that passport
ever cleared customs.

1088
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,033
Susan, it's true.

1089
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:18,900
- I suppose he told
you he was after this?

1090
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,500
- The tsar's icon, you
took it from the church.

1091
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,066
(scoffs)

1092
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:24,133
- As far as this goes,
the Russians make these up

1093
01:16:24,133 --> 01:16:25,933
by the thousands
for the tourists.

1094
01:16:25,933 --> 01:16:27,733
One of the monarchists was
supposed to mark the medallion's

1095
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:29,133
location with a missing icon.

1096
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:32,433
- Wait a minute, what medallion?

1097
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:34,033
- It's got the likeness
of the tsar in gold,

1098
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:35,333
it's about this big.

1099
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,766
It disappeared just
before the revolution

1100
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:38,666
and it's been hidden
away all these years

1101
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,933
by the Monarchist Society.

1102
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,866
- You see Susan, this
medallion is worth

1103
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:46,066
between $3 million
and $5 million.

1104
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:47,966
And even in a slow
market, Cassidy

1105
01:16:47,966 --> 01:16:50,300
could get 2.5 million
without even trying.

1106
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,933
(scoffs)

1107
01:16:51,933 --> 01:16:53,700
- No wait a minute, this whole
thing doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:55,666
I never saw any medallion,
I don't buy this.

1109
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:07,733
- Susan, you're not the first

1110
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:09,166
pretty American woman he's used.

1111
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,466
He's been working
petty scams for years.

1112
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,933
- This is just a bigger scheme.

1113
01:17:14,933 --> 01:17:16,900
- Then why don't you arrest him?

1114
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,233
- Because we don't
have any proof.

1115
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:20,966
- Yes you do.

1116
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:24,866
I saw him kill that man
Blitzkov at the palace.

1117
01:17:24,866 --> 01:17:26,966
- I mean the most the
Russians could do is

1118
01:17:26,966 --> 01:17:28,333
just deport him.

1119
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,066
Meanwhile, Cassidy's
still got the medallion

1120
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:31,666
and it's our job
to link him to it.

1121
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:33,533
- Tonight's your
last night in Russia.

1122
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,933
He's gonna try to slip the
medallion into your bag

1123
01:17:35,933 --> 01:17:37,466
to get through customs.

1124
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:39,966
Once you get to Kennedy,
he's going to get you alone,

1125
01:17:39,966 --> 01:17:41,733
take the medallion,
and at that point--

1126
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:43,933
- At that point, you're
a dangerous witness.

1127
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:47,966
- Excuse me, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

1128
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:55,166
(faucet running)

1129
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:00,266
- You okay?

1130
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,333
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,166
- Why don't you sit down?

1132
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:09,133
- Okay, what do
you want me to do?

1133
01:18:09,133 --> 01:18:10,966
- Well first, don't panic.

1134
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:13,066
Wherever you go, we'll be there.

1135
01:18:13,066 --> 01:18:14,533
He doesn't wanna hurt you,

1136
01:18:14,533 --> 01:18:16,433
'cause he needs you,
at least for now.

1137
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:17,166
- Okay.

1138
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:20,700
Well we're supposed to be
having dinner together tonight.

1139
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,633
- Well that's good.

1140
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,500
- Look we know he's been
sleeping in your room so

1141
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,033
when you go to bed tonight,
don't lock the door

1142
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:30,033
and we'll take care
of everything else.

1143
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:31,333
(scoffs)

1144
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,866
- I can't, I can't
sleep with him now

1145
01:18:32,866 --> 01:18:34,433
after knowing all this.

1146
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:36,166
- You don't really
have a choice, Susan.

1147
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,866
If Cassidy knows
you're onto him,

1148
01:18:37,866 --> 01:18:39,433
you'll never live til morning.

1149
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:42,300
- And if they catch you at
customs with that medallion...

1150
01:18:43,466 --> 01:18:45,133
Even we can't help.

1151
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:47,033
You'll spend the rest of
your life in a Russian jail.

1152
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,666
(Russian music)

1153
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:59,366
(singing in foreign language)

1154
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:22,133
(speaking in foreign language)

1155
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,733
- What's the matter?

1156
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:26,000
You seem so distracted.

1157
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,600
You usually like
Russian ice cream.

1158
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,933
- Oh, I'm just sad, I guess.

1159
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,566
I just can't believe
I'm going home tomorrow.

1160
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:35,533
- I've had very good news.

1161
01:19:35,533 --> 01:19:37,966
I've been reassigned stateside.

1162
01:19:37,966 --> 01:19:39,933
We're gonna be on the
same plane together.

1163
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,600
And when we land, I'm
gonna take you out

1164
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,433
for the best dinner in
all of New York, hmm?

1165
01:19:44,433 --> 01:19:45,233
(laughs)

1166
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:47,333
- That sounds great.

1167
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:49,566
And I guess you'll be
arresting Joe and Helen.

1168
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:52,000
- They've been taken care of.

1169
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,300
- The way you say it it almost
sounds like they were dead.

1170
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:01,166
- They have a lot to answer for.

1171
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,200
- Um...

1172
01:20:05,566 --> 01:20:07,100
And what about the tsar's icon?

1173
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,766
- I'm afraid the
trail has gone cold.

1174
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:15,766
But it's not my problem anymore.

1175
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:16,533
Or yours.

1176
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,200
Now, we have our
whole future together.

1177
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,433
Just the two of us.

1178
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:30,933
Eh?

1179
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:35,233
Unless you're tired
of me already.

1180
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:36,233
(laughs)

1181
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:37,033
- Oh.
- Huh?

1182
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:38,400
- No, of course not.

1183
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,366
Of course not.
- No.

1184
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:43,733
Come on.

1185
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:45,200
I got a special
place to show you.

1186
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,733
I think you'll like it.

1187
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:48,333
- Now?
- Mm hmm.

1188
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,300
- But I promised Molly we'd
have a drink with them,

1189
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,700
a last drink.

1190
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,400
- As soon as we get back,
this won't take long.

1191
01:20:55,566 --> 01:20:56,966
- Oh, Grant.

1192
01:20:56,966 --> 01:20:58,166
You're hurting me.

1193
01:20:58,166 --> 01:20:58,966
- Am I?

1194
01:20:58,966 --> 01:20:59,733
I'm sorry sweetie.

1195
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:07,800
(suspenseful music)

1196
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,133
- It's so late,
where are we going?

1197
01:21:09,133 --> 01:21:11,533
- It's a surprise.

1198
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,300
Come on.

1199
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,566
You know, my mother once told me

1200
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:17,900
you never truly
appreciate anything

1201
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,200
until you're about to lose it.

1202
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,766
Russia is truly the
land of opportunity.

1203
01:21:22,766 --> 01:21:24,133
Like the Old West.

1204
01:21:24,966 --> 01:21:27,000
These people are smart.

1205
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,366
And they're learning fast.

1206
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,600
But they're much too trusting.

1207
01:21:34,133 --> 01:21:35,000
They have hope.

1208
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,300
We have the edge.

1209
01:21:49,566 --> 01:21:50,333
Oh.

1210
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,200
Here.

1211
01:21:55,466 --> 01:21:56,633
This is for you.

1212
01:21:58,133 --> 01:21:59,000
- What is it?

1213
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:00,733
- Open it.

1214
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,433
(laughs)

1215
01:22:10,433 --> 01:22:12,933
- It's beautiful, what is it?

1216
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,933
- It's my retirement.

1217
01:22:15,933 --> 01:22:19,233
It's the Nicholas medallion,
it's worth a fortune.

1218
01:22:20,466 --> 01:22:23,566
But I guess you know
all about it now.

1219
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:26,500
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1220
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,766
- Susie, Susie.

1221
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,900
Susan, we had a chance.

1222
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:34,500
Viktoria was a nobody.

1223
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,933
I needed her, I used her.

1224
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,533
But you're different.

1225
01:22:41,133 --> 01:22:42,533
I wanted to love you.

1226
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,933
- Grant, stop it.

1227
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:48,300
You don't know
what you're saying.

1228
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,733
- You think your
friends from Interpol

1229
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:52,000
are gonna help you now?

1230
01:22:57,733 --> 01:23:00,833
(dramatic music)

1231
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:01,700
(gasps)

1232
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,166
- Oh my god!

1233
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:03,933
Oh my god.

1234
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:09,566
- You know I never
suspected them?

1235
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:12,000
Sure, I thought the local
dick would be snooping around

1236
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,500
sooner or later,
but he's no problem.

1237
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,500
They're supposed to be pros.

1238
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,800
Huh?

1239
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,133
- Let me out!
- Susie.

1240
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:28,033
Susie, I was ready
to give it all up.

1241
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:29,500
This round would bring in
a couple of million, easy,

1242
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,633
and we could have lived
high and wide on that

1243
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,766
for a long time.

1244
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:35,900
But you just didn't want
to play along, did you?

1245
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,633
Hmm?

1246
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,333
You still can, you know.

1247
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,300
It's not too late.

1248
01:23:43,866 --> 01:23:46,433
We can live like kings.

1249
01:23:46,433 --> 01:23:47,200
Or tsars.

1250
01:23:51,466 --> 01:23:53,133
(brakes squealing)

1251
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:56,100
(suspenseful music)

1252
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,533
- Please let me go.

1253
01:24:04,533 --> 01:24:07,200
Please Grant, I won't tell
anyone anything, I promise.

1254
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,433
- We had our fun.

1255
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,400
Didn't we?

1256
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,100
Didn't we?

1257
01:24:17,133 --> 01:24:17,933
- Yes.

1258
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:21,833
- Alright, get out.

1259
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:24,533
- Please.

1260
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,700
Please.

1261
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,400
- Get out.

1262
01:24:33,366 --> 01:24:36,366
(breathing heavily)

1263
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:40,700
- Grant!

1264
01:24:47,466 --> 01:24:49,766
(grunting)

1265
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,766
(dramatic music)

1266
01:25:15,566 --> 01:25:18,033
- Please, please, give
me a chance to explain!

1267
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:20,533
(gun firing)

1268
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,600
Is this our first
lover's quarrel?

1269
01:25:41,766 --> 01:25:43,633
Oh come on, let's
kiss and make up, huh?

1270
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:46,933
Ha!

1271
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,233
I love you, Susan.

1272
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,700
Come on sweetie, can't we talk?

1273
01:26:22,733 --> 01:26:23,766
(knocks)

1274
01:26:23,766 --> 01:26:24,833
(whistles)

1275
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,366
Can Susie come out and play?

1276
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,433
(dramatic music)

1277
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,600
(gun fires)

1278
01:26:34,366 --> 01:26:36,766
I know you're here, Susan.

1279
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:38,566
(suspenseful music)

1280
01:26:38,566 --> 01:26:39,700
There's only one way out.

1281
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:45,233
But we have a future, baby,

1282
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,733
once I dump the
medallion, we'll be rich.

1283
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,533
We can go anywhere we want.

1284
01:26:50,533 --> 01:26:55,300
Wanna go to, uh,
Tahiti, we'll go.

1285
01:26:58,266 --> 01:26:59,033
Paris.

1286
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:06,300
You got it, sweetie.

1287
01:27:09,733 --> 01:27:11,833
I can't wait for you
to meet my mother.

1288
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,333
Her memory's not
so good anymore.

1289
01:27:20,933 --> 01:27:23,533
But I know she'll like you.

1290
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,100
Oh, I forgot.

1291
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,000
She's dead.

1292
01:27:33,966 --> 01:27:36,100
(scoffs)

1293
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,000
Time's up.

1294
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:42,966
Game's over.

1295
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,566
You lose.

1296
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:56,400
(dramatic music)

1297
01:28:00,966 --> 01:28:03,100
(groaning)

1298
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:03,833
- My god.

1299
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,600
- That was genius.

1300
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,300
(breathing heavily)

1301
01:28:36,866 --> 01:28:39,166
(coughing)

1302
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,433
(dramatic music)

1303
01:29:13,433 --> 01:29:16,033
You play rough, teacher.

1304
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:20,133
(kicks)
(shouts)

1305
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,166
(breathing heavily)

1306
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:28,133
(suspenseful music)

1307
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,166
It's beautiful.

1308
01:29:54,066 --> 01:29:54,833
Isn't it?

1309
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,000
Isn't it?

1310
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,300

1311
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:06,200
