Don't worry about that.
Either you get me my money

I got you on the alert.
It's already set up.

508
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,055
-That's good.
-Mmm-hmm.

509
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,309
Well, I've almost
finished your painting.

510
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,145
Sorry it's taking me so long.

511
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:19,530
It's fine.

512
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,901
-Tanner.
-Hmm?

513
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,371
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

514
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,991
Well, let me buy you lunch.
We can chat.

515
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:33,210
-Yeah.
-Okay.

516
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,880
[laughing]

517
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,956
-oh, this looks good.
-Yeah, it's the best
in the city.

518
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,307
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

519
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:49,143
Is that how you eat tacos?

520
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,511
I just thought
there would be a plate.

521
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,462
I thought we'd
be sitting down...

522
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,731
-we're outside, iris.
-Yeah, I know.

523
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,849
Oh, my goodness.

524
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,235
-[chuckles]
-can I ask you a question?

525
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,988
A personal question.

526
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,074
Hmm, depends how personal.

527
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,860
How do you get by
here, tanner?

528
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,997
How do most of the people
here get by here

529
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:12,583
now that the plants
have closed,
the factories have closed?

530
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,922
Just like you, I guess.
A lot of hard work
and a lot of faith, you know.

531
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,876
It's kind of hard
to have faith when
you're staying in a shelter.

532
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,512
I saw you in line
the other night.

533
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,267
-You don't have any place
else you can stay?
-Like where, iris?

534
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,053
I don't know.
Family or friends or...

535
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,055
no, I don't have none.

536
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,009
And cheap housing
is hard to come by.

537
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,230
-White people coming in here
and driving up the prices.
-It's not just white people.

538
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,850
And look, there are advantages
to companies coming into
communities like this

539
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,351
and investing and building...

540
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,236
investing is one thing.

541
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,956
Erasing,
that's a whole nother thing.

542
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,576
You know, developers
when they come here,

543
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,412
all they see
is buildings and houses.

544
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,881
But this...

545
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:07,054
This is life. This is me.
This is all I know.

546
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,390
Can't you see that?
It's beautiful.

547
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:13,060
And I agree with all of that,
but that's not all you need.

548
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:14,711
What about the people
who are out of work

549
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,263
living on the street,
in shelters?

550
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,015
-Those are
circumstances, iris.
-I know.

551
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,766
People are more
than their circumstances.

552
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,068
-Of course, I know that.
-You know...

553
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,437
-Tanner...
-are you good?

554
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,272
I did not mean to offend you.
I'm just...

555
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,107
nah, nah.
'cause you don't understand.

556
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,391
You just like everybody else.

557
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,744
I thought you were different.
I really did.

558
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,115
Nah, you're good.
I got to go.

559
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,867
I'll see you around,
all right?

560
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,042
[sighs]

561
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:57,387
hi, I was wondering
if I could talk to someone

562
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,273
about getting an extension
on my mortgage payments.

563
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,777
Yeah, you know,
if she could call me back,
that would be great.

564
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:08,532
555-0100. Yeah, that's it.
Okay, thank you.

565
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,534
I'm back.

566
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,572
-You are back. Yeah, you...
-I'm back.

567
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,491
-Of course.
-[chuckles]

568
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,577
-and remember I said I might
have a surprise for you?
-Yes, I do.

569
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,163
<i> Viola.</i>

570
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,285
I recall from our one date
that was technically
not a date,

571
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,454
-you were a hip-hop head.
-Yeah?

572
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,473
-So.
-And r&b.

573
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,594
Oh, wow.

574
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,680
-[Clay stutters] uh... okay.
-Oh, wow, vanilla ice.

575
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,015
-Oh, my god. I've been waiting
for this album.
-All right, wait. No.

576
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,269
-You are amazing.
-That one is my brother's.

577
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,571
I was always more bebop
than hip-hop.

578
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,323
Okay.

579
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,941
This one is from
my collection.

580
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,161
-Jazz.
-Yeah.

581
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:55,862
-Nice.
-Why don't you take it
for a spin?

582
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,532
-Go ahead.
-Yeah?

583
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,117
-[iris gasps] oh!
-Ooh! You okay?

584
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,536
-No, no. It's fine. It's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay, no.

585
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,172
-No, it's really not
that serious.
-Iris, please sit.

586
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:06,456
-Okay.
-Careful.

587
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,626
Sit back. Get your feet up.

588
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,962
[romantic music playing]

589
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,050
-[gasps] oh!
-What about this?

590
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,303
-Hmm? Um...
-Does that hurt?

591
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,604
No... no.

592
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:23,357
What about right there?

593
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:27,778
That feels, that feels...

594
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,983
-It's good.
-[chuckles]

595
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,869
-[exhales]
-so it looks like it's just
a twisted ankle, then.

596
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,355
[whispers] okay.

597
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,823
Yeah, are you okay?

598
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:41,241
Hey!

599
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:43,994
-Bev!
-[Beverly] uh...

600
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,163
-Should we come back later?
-No, it's fine. No.

601
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,698
-Are we
interrupting something?
-No, it's fine.

602
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,050
Welcome to opal's.

603
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:53,036
Alton miller,
this is iris Duchamp.
She owns opal's.

604
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,671
Ah, nice to meet you.

605
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,340
-Lovely place.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

606
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,396
Clay... Clay, this is...
This is my good friend,
uh, Beverly Corson.

607
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:07,017
Oh, Clay. Mmm, okay.
The morehouse man.
I see you.

608
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,551
-So you were talking about me?
-No, no! Oh, no!

609
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,187
-Why are you here?
-I'm in a group chat already?

610
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,023
-Yes. Well, this was fun.
-I need to talk to you.

611
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,942
I'm going to go.
Just make sure to rest
the ankle, okay?

612
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,944
Yes, thank you so much.
Thank you.

613
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,915
-Bye, Clay.
-Beverly.

614
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,252
-Okay. Mmm-hmm.
-What do you want?

615
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:26,920
Walk with me.

616
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:29,790
-[laughs] your ankle looked
fine to me.
-Don't... Oh, shut up!

617
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,413
Uh, okay, so, what...
what is this about?

618
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,882
-So, I work for
crossroads metro development.
-Right.

619
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,219
-Why am I here?
-The response has been
so overwhelming.

620
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,471
We're looking to buy
some of the buildings
on this block.

621
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,642
What will happen
to the businesses
that are already here?

622
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:53,096
Uh, we'll refurbish the stores
and business owners
can rent from us.

623
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,482
I'm pretty sure they won't
be able to afford your rent.

624
00:33:56,985 --> 00:33:59,102
Oh, so, but you're counting
on that, right?

625
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,987
-[Alton] iris, listen.
-Is he... Why am I here?

626
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,657
Most of the businesses
are months behind
on their rent.

627
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,908
Their debt would be forgiven.

628
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,460
And, if they choose
to move on,

629
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:07,961
other businesses can
come in and...

630
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,747
and breathe life
back into this community.

631
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,998
I know you own your building.

632
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,167
Yes, I do.

633
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,636
But I also know
that your business
has been struggling.

634
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:21,425
So, crossroads metro
development would like
to buy your store.

635
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:24,344
No stress.

636
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,802

-Mom!
-I know, I know.

[shouting]
open the damn door!

647
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,926
opal, you hear me!

648
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,179
-Where are you? I'm going to
find you, bitch.
-He's gonna hurt you.

649
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,597
[man yelling] you hear me?

650
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:18,515
I will find you!

00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:24,521

tanner.

656
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,103
Tanner!

657
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:15,071
Tanner!

658
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:15,989
What?

659
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:16,873
Tanner.

660
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:23,112
-Iris.
-Tanner.

661
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,781
I didn't mean what I said.
Okay?

662
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,300
You were right.
These are circumstances.

663
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:29,753
Okay? Come work
in the store with me.

664
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,638
You drove all the way
in the rain
just to tell me that?

665
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:32,672
Yes, I did.

666
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,290
-I'm worried about you,
tanner.
-I'm good.

667
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:35,225
No! Tanner, wait!

668
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,845
You're not okay.
Let me help you.

669
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,264
You've helped plenty.

670
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,634
Is it really that hard for you
to accept a hand from someone?

671
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:46,653
I'm literally trying
to help you.

672
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,775
You know what?
I'm not gonna beg you.

673
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,742
-Do what you wanna do.
-Okay.

674
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:02,202
[thunder rumbling]

675
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,042
iris, wait!

676
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:13,964
What?

677
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,767
I'm all... my stuff's all wet.

678
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,552
I know, come on.

679
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,695
[sighing in exhaustion]
thank you.

680
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:47,414
You can use the office,
slash guest room,
slash whatever room.

681
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:48,298
All right.

682
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:57,891
Sorry, I wasn't
expecting company. Sorry.

683
00:37:59,061 --> 00:37:59,893
Come in.

684
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:01,811
[laughs] come in.

685
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,820
So, uh...

686
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:13,039
Sorry.

687
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:14,274
Most of your neighbors white?

688
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:15,742
No, not really.

689
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:17,994
Some, some of them...

690
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:21,915
Yeah. Yeah, most of them.

691
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:23,667
[tanner] mmm-hmm.

692
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:27,921
I'm gonna get you some bedding
and some dry clothes.

693
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:28,838
Just give me one second.

694
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,599
[iris] okay.

695
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:42,052
-You graduated from spelman?
-Mmm-hmm.

696
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,973
It says here that you're
the buyer of the month.

697
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:48,892
What did you buy?

698
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:51,611
Mostly specialty items.

699
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:53,563
Art, decor.

700
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,865
I worked for Chartoff, so.

701
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,069
Well, why'd you leave?

702
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,938
Well, my mom, she struggled
with the store.

703
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:03,623
When she died, I felt bad.

704
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:06,609
Like, I could've done more
to help her, you know.

705
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:08,878
But I was just caught up
with my own drama.

706
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:13,917
I guess, me coming back here
is my way of
making it up to her.

707
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,785
Plus, I needed a change
of scenery

708
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:18,471
and Moses park felt like
a good place to heal.

709
00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:19,973
[tanner laughs]

710
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:23,626
well, this isn't exactly
Moses park.

711
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,762
This is Lincoln.

712
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,347
Moses park's uppity cousin.

713
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,314
[iris laughs] okay.

714
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,733
Uh...

715
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,820
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mmm-hmm.

716
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:36,356
I mean...

717
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,830
How do you deal
with the guilt?

718
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,583
Over not being there
for your mom.

719
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,202
Is that why you help people?

720
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,872
I help people because
that's how my mama raised me.

721
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:55,792
[sighs softly]

722
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,128
speaking of my mom...

723
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:12,859
You can't finish a painting
without paint.

724
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,446
You should've just told me
you didn't have the supplies.

725
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:18,198
[tanner exhales]

726
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,283
it's okay.

727
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,540
Get some sleep. It's okay.

728
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,662
-Hey, iris.
-Mmm-hmm?

729
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,631
Thanks.

730
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:36,800
You know.

731
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,001
Goodnight.

732
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,720
[soft piano music playing]

733
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:57,904
what you so mad about?

734
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,906
'cause you ran away, Elijah.

735
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,274
I'm not gonna
let them people adopt me.

736
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:02,775
I wanna stay with you.

737
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:06,079
Oh, right, so we both can be
living off of ramen noodles
and juice boxes?

738
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:07,947
Nah, not no more.

739
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:10,917
Where'd you get
that money from?

740
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,919
I've been runnin' errands
with baker.

741
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,403
He's been teaching me
all kinds of stuff.

742
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:16,556
I told you I don't want
you foolin' with baker.

743
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,374
Man, baker's not gonna
let anything happen to me.

744
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,911
You need to be focused
on graduating from high school
and going to college.

745
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,879
Look who's talkin'.

746
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:27,433
I'm callin'
the Hendersons, okay?

747
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:32,272
-Why you trippin'?
-[screams] because I can't
take care of you, Elijah!

748
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:33,973
I don't want you livin'
like this.

749
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,033
If you make me
go back, tanner,

750
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,736
I'm never talkin'
to you again.

751
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,490
[screams] I'm serious, man!

752
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,132
[dialing]

753
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,801
-[line ringing]
-[Mrs. Henderson]
<i> Henderson's residence.</i>

754
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:05,004
<i> Tanner, is that you?</i>

755
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,090
<i> If Elijah is there,</i>
<i> we can come pick him up.</i>

756
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,007
Yeah, he's here.

757
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,761
<i> Tanner, we promise</i>
<i> to take good care of him.</i>

758
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,613
[dramatic music playing]

759
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,002
[humming "amazing grace"]

760
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,063
hey.

761
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:31,664
-Good morning.
-I'ma head out.

762
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,217
Oh, I can...
I can just drop you off
wherever you need to go.

763
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:38,404
Or you can just come join us
for brunch. Come, yes.

764
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:42,275
-Come to brunch.
-No brunch.

765
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,743
-I can cook.
-Oh, no.

766
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:45,161
I can cook.

767
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,913
You can cook, but you're not
going to find anything
in my kitchen.

768
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:49,782
-Watch me, okay, trust me.
-No, I'm tellin' you.

769
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,001
Oh, pancake mix.
Oh, that's good.

770
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:53,536
Eggs, yes.

771
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,288
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.

772
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,457
You obviously know
what you're doing.

773
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:58,758
-You've got plenty.
-[doorbell rings]

774
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,242
smell it, though.

775
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:01,628
-One second.
-Okay.

776
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,182
-[gasps]
-surprise!

777
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,551
Happy mimosa Sunday!

778
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,435
[both laugh]

779
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,255
pearl and I, we had
a last-minute change of plans.

780
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,775
Something about family drama.

781
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,861
So, it's just you, me,
a pitcher of mimosas...

782
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:22,615
and the thief
who robbed your store?

783
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:23,783
Iris, what the hell?

784
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,236
-Tanner, meet Beverly.
-Yes.

785
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,122
The one who got the d.A.
To release you.

786
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:30,556
Well, you wouldn't have had
to release me

787
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:32,792
if you wouldn't have had me
arrested in the first place.

788
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:35,161
Well, you wouldn't have been
arrested if you hadn't have
been a thief.

789
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,113
Is it your store? You need
to mind your business.

790
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:38,247
Get your girl.

791
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,300
That's what you need to do.
Get your girl.

792
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:42,335
You know what? I'm not even
gonna stoop to your level.

793
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,953
You know where your level is?

794
00:43:43,972 --> 00:43:46,472
[exclaiming]
right down there, okay?

795
00:43:46,508 --> 00:43:49,309
-You know, I can't...
-okay, Beverly,
just one second...

796
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:50,560
-she is...
-one second...

797
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,428
-what is she doing here?
-Beverly, be quiet.
Just stop...

798
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,981
did she really
just try to come for me?

799
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:57,433
She's a little upset.
You got her arrested.

800
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,935
-She's upset?
-Yes.

801
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,971
-She? She is upset?
-Yes...

802
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,823
I. I'm upset. Okay?

803
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:06,192
-You know it's bad enough
that you guilt me...
-I didn't guilt you.

804
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,660
...Into getting her
out of jail.

805
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:09,478
Now, you two are having
slumber parties.

806
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:13,282
I found her in an alleyway
trying to find cover
from the rain.

807
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,001
What was I supposed to do?
What would you have done?

808
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:17,170
Send her to a hotel.

809
00:44:17,205 --> 00:44:20,289
Anything would've been
better than inviting
a stranger into your home,

810
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,323
iris.

811
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:23,009
Bev, it's all good. I got it.

812
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:25,795
-Okay? [exhales]
-okay.

813
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:28,798
Are we having mimosas or not?

814
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,967
I'm keepin' my eye on her.

815
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:44,280
Cheers.

816
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,651
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

817
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,786
Happy Sunday.

818
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:53,489
Too much orange juice.

819
00:45:12,427 --> 00:45:14,727
Thanks for everything, iris.

820
00:45:14,763 --> 00:45:19,715
I know I can be a little...
I appreciate everything.

821
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:21,717
Anytime you need
a place to stay.

822
00:45:21,736 --> 00:45:23,152
I got you. Okay?

823
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,388
-You hangin' out or...
-[cell phone ringing]

824
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:28,891
-uh, no, I think I'm gonna
go to my spot.
-Oh.

825
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,743
I'll let you get that.

826
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:32,245
I'm gonna get some coffee.

827
00:45:34,582 --> 00:45:36,616
-What?
-[baker on phone]<i> tanner.</i>

828
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:38,618
<i> I'm tired of waiting for you</i>
<i> to get your act together.</i>

829
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,238
-<i> Don't test me.</i>
<i> -Look,</i> I can't do this
right now, baker.

830
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,590
-I can't.
<i> -You serious?</i>

831
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,742
<i> You owe me money.</i>
<i> I'm comin' to collect.</i>

832
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:51,413
-I ain't got it right now.
Seriously. I need more time.
<i> -Oh, you think I'm playing?</i>

833
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:54,884
<i> I checked Eli already.</i>
<i> And, now, I'm going to check</i>
<i> your girl's store.</i>

834
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:55,935
[baker hangs up]

835
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,637
baker.

836
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:02,475
Iris, um, you know,
I think I might, uh,
help you out today.

837
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,476
If that's okay?

838
00:46:04,813 --> 00:46:06,145
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

839
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,596
-Okay.
-Okay.

840
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,931
-All right, let's go.
-All right.

841
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,816
Come on.

842
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,040
You brought so much life
in here with
these plants, tanner.

843
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:20,460
You really did a great job.

and I remember everything.
Your grandmother.

I don't expect you

me and Elijah asked her
about grace.

1412

And she said,
"grace is god's love,
mercy, and forgiveness."

-[exhaling sharply]
-he gives it freely.

1414

And he wants us
to do the same.

1415
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:34,058
She did that for you
and your mom.

1416

-And for so many other people.
-She saved my life.

Give him some grace, tanner.

-Yeah.
-[Elijah] tanner, wait. Wait.

I was wrong.

1428
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:14,632
Look, I heard
what you said earlier.

1429
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:16,884
About wanting
what was best for me.

1430

I heard what you said
about grandma's love
for the community.

And I remember
what grandma said about
grace and forgiveness.

Tan, I'm sorry.

1433

And I'm tired of hurting.

I'm tired of hiding.

Part of me knew that
you would find me when
I was back here.

to be found.

-[sniffles] and
I missed you so much.
-I missed you, too.

Remember how you used
to always hold my hand
when we were kids?

you used to hate it.

uplift the community like
grandma Maeble did.

I bought haven house.

a great place to start.
