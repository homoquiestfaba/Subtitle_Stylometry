1
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,800
What are you doing?

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,400
Wait a minute.

3
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Tell me your name.

4
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,500
Are you recording?

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,800
When I see beauty, I have to record it.

6
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm embarassed. Turn it off.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,400
What do you want me to say?

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Tell me your name.

9
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,100
Hi Aban.

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
I bid you hello. My name is Aban.

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm tired.

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
I can't stay awake anymore.

13
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Why?

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm having dreams.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,950
What dreams?

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,100
They took you from me.

17
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I can't tell what is a dream, and what isn't anymore.

18
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,200
When I'm asleep, it's as if I'm awake...

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,000
... and when I'm awake, it's as I'm asleep.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Sing a song for me.

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,850
I don't know how.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,450
Everyone can sing.

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,000
Altough I am of beautiful nature,

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,200
With the cypress's stature, the tulips glow,

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I cannot fathom, here in this earthly joy,

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,300
Why my creator painted me so.

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Here.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Isn't it nice.

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Do you remember how we met?

30
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm trying to remember.

31
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,300
You already know.

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
I want you to tell me.

33
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
It was Chahar Shanbe Soori.

34
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,400
I was lighting up the fire with everyone.

35
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,550
And all of a sudden, you showed up out of nowhere.

36
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
If you could, just for a day...

37
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,650
Have a...

38
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,300
Have a super power?

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
What would it be?

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,500
I would want to be...

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I would want to fly.

42
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
But we don't have wings.

43
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Do you still think I'm beautiful?

44
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Yes.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Just like Dracula... Dracula with cucumbers.

46
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't play with your food.

47
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
What about now? Am I beautiful?

48
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm so hungry.

49
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,500
You're always so hungry.

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Hey

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,300
Mister! We're ready to order.

52
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,200
Two sweet teas.

53
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,800
Doo Randi, bread, cheese...

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
What else? Oh, halva for the young gentleman.

55
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,100
I hope it's no trouble.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Aban.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
What is it, Khorshid, my dear?

58
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
He's bringing your order for you right now.

59
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
What's it like on the other side?

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Nothing.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No one will bother us, Aban.

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
You never get full, do you?

63
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,150
Aban.

64
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,450
Yes?

65
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,300
Are you hungry?

66
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Yes.

67
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,100
You got tired from eating that much, didn't you?

68
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Yeah... I'm sleepy.

69
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,200
Should we go take a nap?

70
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Yes.

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
You eat and then you sleep.

72
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,900
That's my life.

73
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
It's our lives!

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
- Don't move! Don't move!

75
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
Did you open it?

76
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Yes.

77
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
Aban.

78
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Look at it from up close.

79
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Do you see the dot in the middle?

80
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
What is it?

81
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
That's us.

82
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't be afraid.

83
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Aban?

84
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Khorshid.

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, my love?

86
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
That super power you talked about...

87
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,300
Now I know what it is.

88
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
What is it?

89
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
What you said... To fly.

90
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,150
Take off my blindfold!

91
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Aban.

92
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,050
Please take it off.

93
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Sir, please take off my blindfold!

94
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,900
Take off my blindfold!

95
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,100
I want to see you Khorshid!

96
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Aban.

97
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
Yes?

98
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
Grab my wing.
