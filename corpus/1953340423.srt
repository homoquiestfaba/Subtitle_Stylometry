1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:17,383
The fight to control

2
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,584
illegal immigration isn't just

3
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,893
on our borders... Lawmakers in Arizona

4
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:22,054
passed a sweeping overhaul...

5
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,344
In a few months, president
Obama will push

6
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:26,425
legislation to legalize the

7
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:32,965
nation's 12 million illegal immigrants.

8
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:42,207
...I feel bad when the bus is leaving--

9
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,511
And I know that he's there.

10
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,691
<i>Illegal immigration...</i>

11
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,933
<i>America's 21st century dilemma.</i>

12
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,362
<i>It's estimated that more than</i>

13
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,563
<i>a million illegal immigrants</i>

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,864
<i>enter the U.S. every year.</i>

15
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,332
<i>They face countless dangers.</i>

16
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,414
<i>Some succumb to dehydration</i>

17
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,001
<i>and exposure.</i>

18
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,702
<i>Some fall victim to human</i>

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,904
<i>traffickers and warring</i>

20
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,573
<i>drug cartels.</i>

21
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>And others...</i>

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,349
<i>Simply disappear.</i>

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,510
<i>Why do they risk their lives?</i>

24
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,631
<i>Because the American dream's</i>

25
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:20,352
<i>still so powerful.</i>

26
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:20,953
<i>Hey, Spielberg.</i>

27
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:21,914
<i>We get it. Come on, man.</i>

28
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,248
<i>Got a headache.</i>

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,330
<i>Dude, dude, guys, check out</i>

30
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,531
<i>the bullet holes in that sign.</i>

31
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,533
<i>I feel like a bear took a</i>

32
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,553
<i>shit in my head.</i>

33
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,549
<i>Hey, Brad, can you pull over,</i>

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,290
<i>brother?</i>

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,993
<i>Brad.</i>

36
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,962
<i>Brad.</i>

37
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,232
<i>Brad, pull... Brad.</i>

38
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,433
<i>Brad.</i>

39
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,007
<i>Brad.</i>

40
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,168
<i>Hey, we do need to shoot some</i>

41
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:43,769
<i>b-roll on that.</i>

42
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,891
<i>Pull the shit over, Bradley.</i>

43
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:45,292
<i>Thank you.</i>

44
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,004
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

45
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:46,766
<i>We're already late.</i>

46
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,606
<i>How do you be late?</i>

47
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,807
<i>We're in Mexico.</i>

48
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,808
<i>Jim.</i>

49
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,930
<i>What? I'm sor--, I had a big</i>

50
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,851
<i>night last night, O.K.?</i>

51
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:52,778
<i>I slept in.</i>

52
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,767
<i>Because... Sake bombs.</i>

53
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:57,928
Where were you, by the way?
Uh, you didn't invite me,

54
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:58,329
douchebag.

55
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,570
Right.

56
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,292
Next time.
Next time, definitely... maybe.

57
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,624
What's up, kid?

58
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:48,167
Guys... I think that
kid took my wallet.

59
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,439
What are you drinking there?

60
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,274
Electrolytes, bro.

61
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,236
You look like shit. Mmm.

62
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:59,144
I love being around creative people

63
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,446
like you guys; You're so, like,

64
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,650
in the moment.

65
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,186
So... Brad.

66
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,054
Where are you from again?

67
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,291
Uh, well, I was actually born in Dallas.

68
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,333
And, and, and how long did

69
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,226
you live in London?

70
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,861
I was in London for about a year.

71
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,129
A whole year?

72
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,298
Travis, don't you...
Have anything to do?

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,060
Keep yourself busy?

74
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:21,142
No, this is all I got to do

75
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:21,943
right now, actually.

76
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,368
It works out nice.

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,330
Babe, babe, I can handle

78
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,204
myself, all right?

79
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,176
Yeah, west Texas boys could be

80
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,377
quite rambunctious.

81
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,539
How do you say "suck my cock"

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,380
in an English accent?

83
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,982
Suck on my cock.

84
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,716
Suck on my cock.

85
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,598
Suck, suck on my cock.

86
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,384
Suck on my cock.

87
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,987
Cock, cock, cock... Suck on my cock.

88
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:42,989
I'm the queen of england.

89
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:49,248
I suck cock... With Brad.

90
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:50,409
You know what's really funny?

91
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,450
She actually hates London.

92
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:52,251
Didn't you say that?

93
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,373
You, you hated...? No, I
just hated London with you.

94
00:03:54,374 --> 00:04:01,707
Ooh... get a little e.C.U.
On that one.

95
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:09,314
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker.

96
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,649
No comment.

97
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,730
What's your response to the

98
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,971
allegations you ran a sweatshop

99
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:14,706
of illegal immigrants?

100
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:15,667
I run a family business.

101
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,388
A family business.

102
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,589
That's very noble of you, sir.

103
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,830
Does a family business threaten

104
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:19,716
and intimidate their employees?

105
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,653
Does it deny their workers

106
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:21,334
safety equipment?

107
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:22,535
Does it fire them when they're

108
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:23,296
injured on the job?

109
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:23,762
Whoops.

110
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,364
Get that camera out of my face!

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,360
Mr. Whitaker, what about

112
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,521
Miguel Gonzales, the man that

113
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,401
you crippled?

114
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,536
Was he family?

115
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,618
Would you apologize to him?

116
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,273
Car troubles?

117
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,955
I have a Mexican friend,
he can fix that.

118
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,515
He's a citizen though, is that

119
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,816
gonna be an issue?

120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,587
Did you get that?

121
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,990
Tell me you got that.

122
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:56,428
...all right, let's get going.

123
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,996
Got everything.

124
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,866
O.K., I'll ping you.

125
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,201
All right.

126
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,337
That sound good?

127
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,438
Sorry.

128
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,539
Be safe.

129
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,207
See you back in Austin, babe.

130
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,108
Really?

131
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,876
Uh-huh.

132
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:11,510
Bye, babe.

133
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,152
Hey, later Brad.

134
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:12,878
Let's hang out.

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,348
Yeah? No.

136
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:26,491
<i>Si.</i>

137
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,410
<i>Guys, guys, this is my cousin</i>

138
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,880
<i>Alberto.</i>

139
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,784
<i>...my friends...</i>

140
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:29,821
<i>This guy is the director.</i>

141
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,789
<i>Yo, man.</i>

142
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,257
<i>Hi, Liz.</i>

143
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,693
<i>Yeah, Liz.
Will.</i>

144
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:42,868
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

145
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,302
<i>No touch, no touch.</i>

146
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,303
<i>No touch-ey.</i>

147
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,982
<i>Whoa, whoa...</i>

148
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,286
<i>So, how much is, uh, how much</i>

149
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,822
<i>is this trip costing you?</i>

150
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,956
<i>Much... eh... eh, si...</i>

151
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,027
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

152
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:17,302
<i>...my daughter.</i>

153
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,771
<i>Si.</i>

154
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:35,387
<i>...have a family.</i>

155
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:56,041
<i>Gracias! Gracias!</i>

<i>What?</i>

160
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,787
<i>2500 is the best he can do.</i>

161
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,522
<i>No, you told me 200</i>

162
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,923
<i>each-- that's one thousand</i>

163
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,058
<i>dollars, comprendo?</i>

164
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,559
<i>Would you tell him that?</i>

165
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,795
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

166
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,584
<i>Would you stop filming,</i>

167
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,264
<i>please?</i>

168
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:19,998
<i>I stopped.</i>

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,266
<i>Thank you.</i>

170
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:31,476
<i>Now it's a thousand dollars</i>

171
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,813

172
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,781
<i>Fine, fine.</i>

173
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,884

00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,886
<i>- Bueno... bueno...

175
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:49,528
What?

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,210
He says we won't regret it.
I already do.

177
00:08:51,211 --> 00:09:04,910
What?

178
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:09,447
He says you're very beautiful.

179
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,286
<i>Right.</i>

180
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:18,590

<i>You all set?</i>

184
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,699
<i>Behind me, two dozen men, women</i>

185
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
<i>and children have sacrificed</i>

186
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,901
<i>everything for this moment.</i>

187
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,502
<i>They're about to cross over 300
miles of treacherous terrain for</i>

188
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,783

<i>There's a stillness to the</i>

370
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:11,716
<i>night.</i>

371
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,825
<i>Seems like it's gonna be a</i>

372
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:14,852
<i>pretty tight fit.</i>

373
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,820
<i>Shit, grab your shit.</i>

374
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,288
<i>Grab your shit, come on,</i>

375
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,823
<i>go, go, go.</i>

376
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:33,271
<i>Are you getting this, filming?</i>

377
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:46,184
<i>Wait-- no, no, no,</i>

378
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,718
<i>my camera!</i>

379
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,055
<i>Fuck!</i>

380
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,592
<i>O. K., it's working.</i>

381
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,815
<i>Selina, selina, come here.</i>

382
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,977
<i>Wanna do shadow puppets? It
looks like a mouse to me.</i>

383
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:21,219
<i>That's a very good one.</i>

384
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:40,972
<i>It's very cramped in here.</i>

385
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,641
<i>We're about a hundred Miles away</i>

386
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,475
<i>from the safe house.</i>

387
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,797
<i>The air is tense. Let's go
talk to some of our travelers.</i>

388
00:20:46,798 --> 00:21:06,731
<i>Como? </i>

389
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:24,882
<i>Yes, officer?</i>

390
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,050
<i>I'm gonna need you</i>

391
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,418
<i>to step out of your vehicle.</i>

392
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,057
<i>What did I do wrong, sir?</i>

393
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:33,924
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

394
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:54,138
<i>Yeah?</i>

395
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,106
<i>Can you hear me,</i>

396
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,841
<i>it's an emergency.</i>

397
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:59,443
<i>Hello?</i>

398
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:07,251
<i>He-- damn it, nothing.</i>

399
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:30,241
<i>Put the camera away.</i>

400
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,809
<i>We've gotta put it away now.</i>

401
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,877
<i>Put them away now.</i>

402
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,388
<i>Do what I'm saying.</i>

403
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,909
<i>Put 'em away, just do what I'm
saying, put it down. All right.</i>

404
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,310
<i>All right.</i>

405
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,311
<i>Everybody should get your</i>

406
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:40,785
<i>passports ready, I'll try...</i>

407
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,629
<i>We're Americans!</i>

408
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,632
<i>Please! Don't shoot!! Please.</i>

409
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:45,616
<i>What is your full name?</i>

410
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:58,329
<i>Travis Williams.</i>

411
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,865
<i>Why am I blindfolded?</i>

412
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,666
<i>Full name. Now.</i>

<i>All right, we'll do this</i>

419
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,551
<i>the hard way.</i>

420
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,116
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

421
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:26,056
<i>I'm sound.</i>

422
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:30,394
<i>Speak up.</i>

423
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,829
<i>Sound.</i>

00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:34,164
<i>I'm a director.</i>

426
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,533
<i>Director of what?</i>

427
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,161
<i>I already told you,</i>

428
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,402
<i>we were shooting a documentary.</i>

429
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,871
<i>About what?</i>

430
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:41,705
<i>Illegal immigration.</i>

431
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,407
<i>Are you a U.S. citizen?</i>

432
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,475
<i>Come on, man, you have</i>

433
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:45,577
<i>my passport-- what is this?</i>

434
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,578
<i>Look in my wallet please.</i>

435
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,619
<i>Check-- give me my wallet.</i>

436
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:48,461
<i>Look, there should be</i>

437
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:49,213
<i>a wad of cash--</i>

438
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,482
<i>You want your wallet?</i>

439
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,051
<i>There's your wallet.</i>

440
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,419
<i>We're grad students.</i>

441
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,354
<i>Making a thesis film.</i>

442
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:01,392
<i>Nobody's gonna see it.</i>

443
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:07,064
<i>That is peyote.</i>

444
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,098
<i>It was in your backpack.</i>

445
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,600
<i>No, uh, that's,</i>

446
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:13,637
<i>that's not possible.</i>

447
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,838
<i>Because... I don't even</i>

448
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,307
<i>own a backpack... sorry.</i>

449
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:16,674
<i>Ah! Ow!</i>

450
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:29,420
<i>You feel that?</i>

451
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,542
<i>...listen to me very carefully. Whatever
you think this is... it's far worse.</i>

452
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,604
<i>What do I have to do? What, what do I have
to do to get them out of this, tell me.</i>

453
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:53,944
<i>Uh.
Hold on, just gimme a second.</i>

454
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:11,929
<i>My crew and I have been detained</i>

455
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,298
<i>by a group... Of patriots.</i>

456
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,135
<i>They promised, they said that</i>

457
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,271
<i>they would let us go if we</i>

458
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,740
<i>document their activities...</i>

459
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,662
<i>And their philosophy. If, uh, if we
spread word of their movement, so...</i>

460
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:36,487
<i>Is that good, is that it or no?</i>

461
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:41,358
<i>Is that O.K.?</i>

462
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,861
<i>Over here.</i>

463
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:48,298
<i>Come closer.</i>

464
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:54,538
<i>Illegal immigration is a plague</i>

465
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,006
<i>that threatens to overtake the</i>

466
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,309
<i>United States of America.</i>

467
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,946
<i>We are sick and tired of these</i>

00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,349
<i>vermin pouring in over</i>

469
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,485
<i>our borders...</i>

470
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,088
<i>Crawling up on our shores...</i>

471
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,324
<i>Bleeding this country dry.</i>

472
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:17,027
<i>We are slowly losing our</i>

473
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,129
<i>country, but we are determined</i>

474
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,865
<i>to take it back.</i>

475
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,062
<i>Well, as you will see,</i>

476
00:28:23,063 --> 00:28:25,703
<i>we're not without mercy. All
children are free to go. Psst, mira.</i>

477
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,322
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

478
00:28:45,324 --> 00:29:14,952
<i>No.</i>

479
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,720
<i>No.</i>

480
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,822
<i>No.</i>

00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:22,059
<i>No, mija.</i>

482
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,228
<i>No, mija, no.</i>

483
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,929
<i>Mama.</i>

484
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,864
<i>Mama.
Mama.</i>

485
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:56,693
<i>Te quieres, tu mami...</i>

486
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:03,000
<i>Children are smart.</i>

487
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,002
<i>They'll find their way home.</i>

488
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:06,837
<i>Dios mio.</i>

489
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,479
<i>Let's show them
what we're really about.</i>

490
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,840
<i>Mi Nina, mi Nina.</i>

491
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,984
<i>Listen up.</i>

492
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:21,706
<i>I need one camera.</i>

493
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:22,667
<i>Him, to film over there.</i>

494
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:23,720
<i>Excuse me.</i>

495
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,202
<i>Yeah, you put</i>

496
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,123
<i>that on-- hey, not yet.</i>

497
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,892
<i>Come back here.</i>

498
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,060
<i>One camera.</i>

499
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,228
<i>You, stay here with me.</i>

500
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,190
<i>What the hell do you do?</i>

501
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:33,764
<i>I'm a producer.</i>

502
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,332
<i>You're a what?</i>

503
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,135
<i>She holds the batteries.</i>

504
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,204
<i>Listen up.</i>

505
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,639
<i>I have only one rule with you.</i>

506
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,241
<i>I talk, you film.</i>

507
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,376
<i>If you interfere, if you say one</i>

508
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,312
<i>single word without being spoken</i>

509
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,513
<i>to, you're not gonna like</i>

510
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,248
<i>what's gonna happen.</i>

511
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,651
<i>Is that clear?</i>

512
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,087
<i>Is that clear?</i>

513
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,890
<i>Good.</i>

514
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,012
<i>Let's roll. You there, not too close.
That's enough.</i>

515
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:22,179
<i>This charming fellow forces</i>

516
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,480
<i>women to cross our border</i>

517
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,415
<i>as drug mules.</i>

518

<i>They have to swallow condoms</i>

519
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:27,751
<i>filled with cocaine.</i>

520
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,153
<i>It's about</i>

521
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,354
<i>the only time you ever hear of</i>

522
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:32,035
<i>Mexicans using condoms. If they
refuse, a family member gets shot.</i>

523
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:43,433
<i>He said "fuck your mother." He
said "fuck my mother"? Youmother.</i>

524
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:56,179

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,419
<i>Open up! Open up!</i>

<i>Take it!</i>

529
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:10,627
<i>Take it all!</i>

530
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:11,995
<i>90% of drugs in America come</i>

531
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,530
<i>from vermin like this.</i>

532
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,052
<i>You know what</i>

533
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,133
<i>you're doing to my country?</i>

<i>The families that you're tearing apart?</i>

540
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,794
<i>Enough, enough of this, enough!</i>

541
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,948
<i>Aw, shit.</i>

<i>What? The condom broke.</i>

543
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:47,758
<i>Fuck.</i>

544
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,027

<i>What the fuck.</i>

547
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:53,897
<i>What is this place?</i>

548
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,831
<i>Oh.</i>

549
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,599

00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,772
<i>How many representatives

Please stop.

771
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,527
When I applied for my

773
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:56,132
And I was proud.

774
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,533
I studied very hard.

775
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:58,901
But you're defending a man who

776
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,637
entered a country he
doesn't even respect!

777
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,806
He doesn't understand
what you're saying.

778
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:08,778
When it comes to fucking food

779
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,880

00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:39,475

00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:47,350

00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:58,127
Thirteen, thirteen.

795
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,462
Correct.

796
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,830
Thirteen!

797
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,333
Undo! Undo her wrist.

798
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:15,878
Good job.

799
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,046
Keep up the good work.

800
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:17,888

806
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,800
Please.

807
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:41,771
Please.

00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,390
man, listen, the door's open,

916
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:20,911
they're gone.

917
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:21,911
We've gotta take a shot.

918
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,179
Sorry, listen.

919
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,901
I just need you to think
about this, O.K.?

920
00:51:24,902 --> 00:51:26,949
There's a right way,
there's a wrong way.

921
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:27,950
We use precision.

922
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,158
We have some strategy, we have

923
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:30,319
our tapes, we have our points

924
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,520
of entry, exit.

925
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:32,388
We're not just gonna

926
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,389
go blindly into the dark.

927
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,924
Wait a minute.

928
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,258
Jesus.

929
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,159
He's right.

930
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,360
O.K., we think about it for a

931
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,262
second, O.K.?

932
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,264
Listen to me.

933
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:42,946
We can help them.

934
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:45,501
We can.

935
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:49,371
Please.

936
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,073
We can't stay here.

937
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:55,211
O.K.

938
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:56,045
O.K., good.

939
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,046
All right.

940
00:51:57,048 --> 00:51:59,482
Give me a flashlight.

941
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,364
No, no, no flashlight.

942
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:01,117
O.K., be quiet.

943
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:01,617
O.K.

944
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,486
Why are you bringing the tapes?

945
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,355
It's for the police. Someone's
gotta shut these fuckers down.

946
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:13,629
Alberto.

947
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:41,123
O.K.
Here, here-- take, take this.

948
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:50,432
What if they see the lights?

949
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,902
They can't, it's night vision.

950
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:53,704
Travis, I can't see.

951
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:55,471
Just follow us.
We got night vision.

952
00:52:55,473 --> 00:53:04,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

953
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:11,086
They make them sleep like this.
Hey.

954
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,988
Shh!

955
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:32,975
Wait, wait, wait.

956
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:33,697
Wait, where is it?

957
00:53:33,698 --> 00:53:36,145
Oh, oh shit.

958
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:36,979
What is it?

959
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,081
Hold the fence.

960
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:39,923
Travis, what the fuck

961
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:40,884
are you doing? Get down!

962
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:47,823
Travis, what are you doing?

963
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:50,559
All right, this is taking too

964
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,527
long, we gotta go.

965
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,333
Take this. O.K., O.K.

966
00:53:57,335 --> 00:54:05,507
Easy, easy.

967
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,678
Oh shit.

968
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:17,353
Fuck, fuck.

969
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:17,955
Can't see shit.

970
00:54:17,957 --> 00:54:19,757
- Fuck, where's Alberto? We gotta go!
- Hey!

971
00:54:49,754 --> 00:55:11,807
Shh.

972
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:26,188
Alberto.

973
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:51,547
Come on, Alberto, back up.
What's going on?

974
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:59,054
We gotta go, now.

975
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,424
O.K. Which way?
- Which way?

976
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:43,999
I still can't
see, I can't see.

977
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:50,606
It's all barbed wire.

978
00:56:50,608 --> 00:57:04,386
- What is that?
- Oh God.

979
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:18,700
Shh.

980
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:28,911
Oh shit, run, run!

981
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:56,138
Help me! Help me!

982
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,541
Ahh!

983
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:01,410
I'm coming back.

984
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:02,811
I'm coming back.

985
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,612
Liz!

986
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:05,581
[Shouts in pain,

987
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,784
Ah, get him off!

988
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,653
Get him off! Help!

989
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:38,480
Pancakes.

990
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:39,948
Thank you, marta.

991
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,818
Good bacon. No, not him.
He's not eating.

992
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:53,629
I'm not hungry.

993
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,697
I must say.

994
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,399
I'm a little bit disappointed in you.

995
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,501
You said you'd let the kids go.

996
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:00,536
And we did.

997
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:02,137
No, you didn't.

998
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,219
Because we saw his daughter

999
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,380
there and there were dogs and

1000
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:07,343
razor wire and-- they were given clear

1001
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,544
instructions, but his daughter

1002
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:11,280
didn't listen.

1003
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,682
She took off in another direction.

1004
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:18,020
But there's a lesson to be learned here.

1005
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,588
Don't fuck with me.

1006
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,990
The only way you're going

1007
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:25,160
home is to do exactly what I tell you.

1008
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,062
There's a few more things I'd

1009
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,399
like to get on camera.

1010
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:31,601
And if you challenge me again,

1011
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,570
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1012
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,439
Could you please pass me the syrup?

1013
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,574
Thank you, Travis.

1014
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,842
You'll have to excuse the mess.

1015
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:43,445
Marta and the maids aren't

1016
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,514
allowed in here, and...

1017
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:49,551
I don't get too many visitors.

1018
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:52,054
Sorry about that.

1019
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,722
I've been wondering something.

1020
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,684
When you came in through the

1021
00:59:55,685 --> 00:59:56,925
drug tunnel, what did you think

1022
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,794
of my work?

1023
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:01,597
I mean the, the, you know,

1024
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,731
the body in the tunnel.

1025
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,200
Did it frighten anyone away?

1026
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,003
Yeah.

1027
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,871
One, I think.

1028
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,139
One.

1029
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:12,975
That's, that's a problem.

1030
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,177
You see, I'm not here to build

1031
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,477
a better mousetrap.

1032
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,546
I'm here to build a better scarecrow.

1033
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:21,650
The hell does that mean?

1034
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:22,612
I'm glad you asked that.

1035
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:24,319
Think about that body you saw.

1036
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,088
All these videos that you're

1037
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:28,023
shooting right now, when we send

1038
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:29,891
them to the Mexican media,

1039
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,693
it'll put the stopper on.

1040
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:33,528
It'll say, "stay where
the fuck you are."

1041
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,830
The right image can make all

1042
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:37,332
the difference in the world.

1043
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,334
I mean, that's why you're here.

1044
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:42,204
That's the point of this video.

1045
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:43,286
And to do that, the message

1046
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:45,307
needs to be stronger.

1047
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:45,941
Jesus!

1048
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:48,477
"Jesus."

1049
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,711
Oh, that's interesting.

1050
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,279
"Jesus."

1051
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,481
You know when the guy comes to

1052
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,602
school and he wants somebody

1053
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,217
from the audience, it's just like that.

1054
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,499
I just want you to come upstage.

1055
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,287
It's hard because she's lying

1056
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:02,924
flat and she's all stiff.

1057
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:04,426
I, I need somebody upright.

1058
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:05,794
Well, you're a botticelli now.

1059
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,330
But if I let you rot in the sun

1060
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,867
a few days, you'll be rubenesque.

1061
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,769
I'm gonna take a bone saw to her

1062
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,570
skull, right below the hairline.

1063
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,172
Right here.

1064
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,074
Skull cap comes off.

1065
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,709
Remove her brain, her eyes,

1066
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:21,943
all the soft tissues.

1067
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:23,512
Then, I'm gonna run electrical

1068
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,747
wiring through her sinus

1069
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:27,182
cavities to a hundred-watt bulb

1070
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,051
at the back of her brain pan.

1071
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:33,288
It'll look like a glowing, white halo.

1072
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:37,059
Like an angel.

1073
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:39,494
Imagine.

1074
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,363
Our sweet, innocent girl here,

1075
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,331
naked at the end of a tunnel.

1076
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,201
Cradling her baby like the

1077
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,537
Paints
quite a picture, doesn't he?

1078
01:01:48,539 --> 01:02:02,084
What's the surprise?

1079
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:03,752
Gonna lecture again while you

1080
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:04,953
kill someone?

1081
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,955
On the contrary.

1082
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,957
El toro screens the blood of

1083
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,893
everyone who comes here.

1084
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,996
And if they're clean, we'll make

1085
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,132
a donation on their behalf.

1086
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,235
And this man has been matched...

1087
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,436
For a kidney.

1088
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,841
The equation is very

1089
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,042
simple-- by saving an American

1090
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:29,478
life, we will spare his.

1091
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,214
Hey.

1092
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:37,953
We're not doing it for the money.

1093
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39,454
We're doing it for our country.

1094
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:41,623
Hey, Remy, want to play spic-tac-toe?

1095
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,145
- Can I go first?
- You can be "x" s.

1096
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:43,906
Help me or get out.

1097
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:51,700
Is he really a surgeon?

1098
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:53,602
'Course he's a surgeon.

1099
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:54,603
Ugh.

1100
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:55,604
Gallo, you're a bleeder.

1101
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,093
You know, he's the first

1102
01:02:58,094 --> 01:02:59,374
one to graduate from high school

1103
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,510
in his family.

1104
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,211
And then he just kept going

1105
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,813
right through med school.

1106
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,715
And then in his third year of

1107
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:08,544
residency, on his way back from

1108
01:03:08,545 --> 01:03:09,785
the hospital, a gang of illegal

1109
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,286
immigrants approached him.

1110
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,854
All right, let's

1111
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,289
clamp off the blood vessels.

1112
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,224
O.K., get the cooler, let's go.

1113
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:17,859
He gave them everything

1114
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:19,194
he had in his pockets.

1115
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:20,395
No, no, that wasn't enough.

1116
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:24,633
Shh, he's a real good doctor.

1117
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:26,401
Know what they did?

1118
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,602
They fucking cut his throat.

1119
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:28,937
Gotta sew him up.

1120
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:29,819
Doesn't make it right.

1121
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,807
What was that?

1122
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,575
It doesn't make it right.

1123
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,745
Would you say the same thing?

1124
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,346
Hey! Shut the fuck up.

1125
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,981
Fuck you.

1126
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,217
Just film this.

1127
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,792
If someone came up to you

1128
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:44,953
with a fucking box cutter and

1129
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:45,987
just did this to you.

1130
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,723
Hey, z.

1131
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,559
I'd like to remove his corneas.

1132
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:51,693
What do you think?

1133
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:54,062
As long as he lives!

1134
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,832
Take whatever fits in the cooler.

1135
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,734
Jim-- shit!

1136
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,036
Jim, Jim.

1137
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:02,237
Hey, come back!

1138
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,705
- It's all right...
- I got her.

1139
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:04,806
You O.K.?

1140
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:05,473
Yeah, I'm fine.

1141
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,542
I'm fine, no, don't worry about it.

1142
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:08,810
Worry about Jim.

1143
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,650
Worry about Jim.

1144
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:16,685
Worry about Jim.

1145
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,019
Fuck, I don't know.

1146
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:19,254
I don't know where he is.

1147
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:20,255
I don't know.

1148
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:21,217
They're playing with us.

1149
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:24,993
They're never gonna let us go. Hey, don't.
They have no reason to.

1150
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:36,371
We just need to find some leverage.

1151
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,040
Somehow we just, we gotta find

1152
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,241
something, there's gotta be...

1153
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:49,050
All right, get up, come on. Bring the
cameras, let's go. Not until we see Jim.

1154
01:04:49,052 --> 01:05:00,028
I want you to record that

1155
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:03,164
we're taking really good care of him.
Continue filming.

1156
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:12,240
Hey.

1157
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,408
Hey.

1158
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,476
How you feeling?

1159
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:15,243
Feel really good.

1160
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,411
Yeah?

1161
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,412
Good.

1162
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,534
I want you to hang in there,

1163
01:05:18,535 --> 01:05:19,695
O.K., because we're gonna get

1164
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:20,849
you home really soon.

1165
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:22,484
Feel good.

1166
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:25,086
Good, good.

1167
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,956
Listen, man.

1168
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,038
About last night, that was
just, I didn't, I was...

1169
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,693
Don't worry about it, t.

1170
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:45,674
All right.

1171
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:46,908
Visitation's over!

1172
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:47,475
Wait a minute.

1173
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,778
Can we have five more minutes?

1174
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,412
No.

1175
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:51,980
Got a documentary to shoot.

1176
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:52,814
Come on.

1177
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:54,316
You know what?

1178
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,352
All right, you want a documentary?

1179
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,956
We'll have a documentary.

1180
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,625
Over here.

1181
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,494
Why are you doing this?

1182
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:07,963
Why am I doing this?

1183
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,005
Isn't that obvious by now?

1184
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,534
Oh no I, I, I completely get it.

1185
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:14,402
Illegal aliens cause crime.

1186
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,004
They carry diseases.

1187
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,472
So does everyone else.

1188
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,140
This is all just racism posing

1189
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,108
as patriotism.

1190
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,445
I bet you rehearsed that all morning.

1191
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,721
<i>You want to know what</i>

1192
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:27,282
<i>I think?
I'm thinking you're targeting</i>

1193
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,443
<i>Oh, she can think now!
People like him and the people</i>

1194
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,604
I'm thinking you're targeting

1195
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:32,520
people like him and the people

1196
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:33,788
outside because they're

1197
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,590
undocumented, and you get to do

1198
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,792
your sick things on them and

1199
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:40,729
think you can get away with it.

1200
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:42,330
Your propaganda, your patriotic

1201
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:49,671
front is bullshit.

1202
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:50,672
You're not a patriot.

1203
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,340
You're fucking insane.

1204
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,074
Don't take it!

1205
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:01,416
No, no.

1206
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,086
You feel that?

1207
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,208
Now that's what the brain of

1208
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:07,022
an idiot feels like.

1209
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:07,984
You want to be an idiot?

1210
01:07:07,985 --> 01:07:17,165
Leave her the fuck alone!

1211
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,666
This is how it ends.

1212
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:19,434
Continue filming.

1213
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,236
It's not coming off.

1214
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:24,539
Yeah, don't worry, it'll come off.

1215
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:42,824
Wait, wait, wait.

1216
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,860
Wait, what's that?

1217
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,029
Shh, shh, shh. Shit, is that a truck?
Oh, shit.

1218
01:07:48,031 --> 01:08:00,175
Where is it?

1219
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:05,980
Hold it, hold it.

1220
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:06,881
There it is.

1221
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:08,349
There it is.

1222
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:10,919
Oh, God, come on.

1223
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,688
Come on, come on, come on.

1224
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,256
Come on-- fuck.

1225
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,092
Fuck.

1226
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,760
Fuck.

1227
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,729
Fuck.

1228
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:25,600
Shit.

1229
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,536
Oh, oh, God, fuck.

1230
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,972
Lizzie.

1231
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:32,607
Lizzie, Liz, get up.

1232
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,610
See? I told you, a truck.

1233
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:36,945
Oh, my God.

1234
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:39,747
Hey!

1235
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:46,254
A truck, come on.

1236
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:46,976
Liz, Liz, a truck.

1237
01:08:46,978 --> 01:08:47,778
Just please help us!

1238
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:50,158
Please, call, call the police.

1239
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,227
We've been kidnapped.

1240
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:54,362
They're trying to kill us.

1241
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:56,131
Be quiet, keep quiet.

1242
01:08:56,133 --> 01:09:01,870
Oh, shit, he's right behind you-- run!

1243
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,572
Where the fuck have you been, man?

1244
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,942
Had to change a tire.

1245
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:09,310
Fuck.

1246
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:16,918
Jesus. Fuck.

1247
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:28,096
I thought I made myself

1248
01:09:28,098 --> 01:09:32,233
perfectly clear, huh?

1249
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:35,236
No, no.

1250
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:37,205
You chose not to listen.

1251
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:39,474
Me and my men have shown you

1252
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:41,376
a lot of hospitality.

1253
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:42,777
And a lot of respect.

1254
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,912
What do we get in return?

1255
01:09:43,914 --> 01:09:44,913
We're sorry.

1256
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:46,247
Yes-- no!

1257
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,516
It was, it wasn't like that.

1258
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,018
We're sorry.

1259
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,154
Huh?

1260
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,796
Fucking respect.

1261
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:03,665
Bring 'em in.

1262
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:07,102
I have to say, your tapes

1263
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,803
<i>were very informative.</i>

1264
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,575
<i>Tia!</i>

1265
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,509
<i>Oh, fuck, please, man.</i>

1266
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,811
<i>Maybe from now on,</i>

1267
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,714
<i>we'll have your attention.</i>

1268
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,617
<i>Tia!</i>

1269
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:25,620
<i>Tia! Tia!</i>

1270
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,742
<i>Fucking shit! Hey, hey. You
fucking drop your knife.</i>

1271
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:29,123
<i>You fucking drop your knife.</i>

1272
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:31,245
<i>Drop that fucking knife.
Drop that fucker right now.</i>

1273
01:10:31,246 --> 01:10:31,806
<i>Don't do this.</i>

1274
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:36,297
<i>Fuck you!</i>

1275
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:38,766
<i>Davie, you're making</i>

1276
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:39,367
<i>a big mistake.</i>

1277
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,529
<i>Give me the fucking keys now,</i>

1278
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,203
<i>retard.</i>

1279
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:44,672
<i>Give me your fucking keys.</i>

1280
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,541

Come on, run.

1439
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:35,549
Which one of them shot you?

1440
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:38,585
He did.

1441
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:41,655
Rip your fucking jaw off!

1442
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:43,791
If you catch them, don't fuck up
