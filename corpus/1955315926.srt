1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,700
CARTMAN: Why did we
choose this life?

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,730
[thunder rumbles]

3
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,473
Why did we become superheroes?

4
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:20,827
We dedicate our lives to
fighting crime for one reason.

5
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,833
To make a billion dollars
on a superhero franchise.

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,403
Superheroes and video
games-- there's a lot of stuff

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,770
to take the piss out of you.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:29,497
There just is.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,467
[epic theme music playing]

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,400
[phone ringing]

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,370
Hello, South Park.

12
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,867
TREY PARKER: We learned so
much from "Stick of Truth"

13
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,897
that we decided,
let's do another one

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,200
and take everything we've
learned and make it better.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,070
MATT STONE: We did learn a
lot and I think this game is

16
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,597
going to be much, much better.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,300
And now it's going to be worse
because I just said that.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,630
Yeah.
Because you said that.

19
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,233
TREY PARKER: There's
"The Stick of Truth,"

20
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,333
and this literally happens
the next day in town.

21
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,403
Your superpowers
are not match for me.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,470
Everybody switch games.

23
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,867
We're playing superheroes now.

24
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,667
TREY PARKER: And you're
still that same character.

25
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,067
You're still that kid that did
all that stuff with the stick.

26
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,567
This dork, like,
wearing a little crown?

27
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,697
And now something new
is happening in town.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,830
And so, even though you've
really risen to prominence

29
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,233
in "The Stick of Truth"
game, they're all like, well,

30
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,233
you can't play this with us.

31
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,503
You're nobody again.

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,830
Does this look like
a superhero to you?

33
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,573
Just seems like a
perfect RPG thing of like,

34
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,127
you're this big, powerful
person and now you're nothing

35
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,533
and you've got to
work your way back.

36
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,273
FRANK C. AGNONE II: Matt
and Trey are both gamers.

37
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:40,067
They've really invested
a lot of time and effort

38
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,167
into this project,
and working closely

39
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:44,827
with Jason and his team,
to make sure that they

40
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,503
nail this process perfectly.

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Even as we're first starting
to figure out the first ideas

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
of what it could be, we brought
everyone from Ubisoft down

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,100
and had them in those meetings.

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,970
We have this big fight
where the kids split up.

45
00:01:57,967 --> 00:01:59,527
And that's basically back story.

46
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,303
How come I have to
have the Netflix series?

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,200
I want a move, too.

48
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,330
Do I get my own movie?

49
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,773
Not everyone gets
their own movie.

50
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,967
Maybe we'll just go and
do our own franchise.

51
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:07,867
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

52
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,067
Oh, you want civil war?

53
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,467
Is that what you want?
-Yeah, dude.

54
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,727
It's civil war. [beep] you.

55
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:12,373
Oh, [beep] you.

56
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,527
Get out my house.

57
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,933
Oh, it'd be so
cool for them to be

58
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,303
in a fight on opposite sides.

59
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:19,797
[slap]

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
[cries]

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,900
Mom, Kenny hit me
right in the face.

62
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,670
Our goal, what we said
from the beginning,

63
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,167
was we still want that feeling
that everyone had of putting

64
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,567
their underwear on the
outside of their pants

65
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,067
and running around with
a cape and being like,

66
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,227
I'm going to save the town.

67
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,233
KYLE: But then
we're just rehashing

68
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,703
the same old material.

69
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,970
There's nothing wrong with
doing the exact same movie

70
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:35,897
to start a franchise.

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,830
How's it going, brother?

72
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,133
My name's [squeals].

73
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,133
I started going back
and watching PewDiePie

74
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,203
play "Stick of Truth."

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,470
This game's really detailed.

76
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,367
You got to appreciate
it for that, man.

77
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,427
And it was just the best
material I could have.

78
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,673
Because it was
like I was watching

79
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,497
an audience member
play it and what

80
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,430
they were thinking about it.

81
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,373
They're all kind of similar--
the attacks or whatever.

82
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,797
I hear him going,
well, this part's lame.

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,430
And I'm like, OK.

84
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,833
That part's lame.

85
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,733
It was just great to
have that as a resource.

86
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,073
Dude, what the [beep]?

87
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,167
Who let this ordinary
citizen into the coon lair?

88
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,497
KIMBERLY WEIGEND:
There are RPG elements.

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,630
You can level up your character.

90
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,933
There are certain
powers that you

91
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,273
can equip to your character.

92
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,097
CARTMAN: Speedster.

93
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,130
Ah, yes.

94
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,073
Like the Flash or Quicksilver.

95
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,427
I like it.

96
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,473
KIMBERLY WEIGEND: You have
a team of buddies that

97
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,067
join you in all of your combat.

98
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,167
And they'll have their unique
personalities and powers,

99
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,467
as well.

100
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,227
WARREN PRICE: It is an
outrageous tactical RPG--

101
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,233
Bring in the thunder.

102
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,433
[electrical shock sounds]

103
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,173
WARREN PRICE: --in
a superhero suit.

104
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,497
This time, it's serious.

105
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,070
KIMBERLY WEIGEND:
Game development

106
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,067
is different from the way that
Matt and Trey run the show.

107
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,467
We are very familiar with
their process over there.

108
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:40,067
They do a six-day turn
around, from nothing to making

109
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,527
an actual episode for the show.

110
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,403
And we do have to elongate
that a little bit for our game

111
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,630
development process.

112
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,903
JASON SCHROEDER: One
of the challenges

113
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,070
that we knew we'd face
is that Trey wants

114
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,367
to try stuff and change stuff.

115
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:53,467
And we need to be as fast
as the show, or at least,

116
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,097
try to get somewhere close.

117
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,500
The process begins-- it comes
out of the writers' room,

118
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,770
where we start with a script.

119
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,327
GREG POSTMA: Trey
will give us a draft.

120
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,773
And the majority of
the artwork and design

121
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,167
work that's going into this game
is designed by our department.

122
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,497
Part of the fun
of the first game

123
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,900
was that you get to pick
what type of character

124
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,070
you are, what costumes
you get to wear.

125
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,067
Part of this game is going to
have that, too, where you get

126
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,867
to dress your character up
based on your superpower

127
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,727
or based on what type of
superhero that you are.

128
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,133
These are some concepts that we
created to get an idea of what

129
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,433
these kids would look like.

130
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,633
There's a very specific
style to South Park.

131
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,333
Not everyone can just
simply animate and make

132
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,873
it look like South Park.

133
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,827
There are a lot of little
nuances that I've had to learn.

134
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,273
It is much more complex than
some of the more high-graphic

135
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,667
games that I've
worked on, simply

136
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:41,067
because it's so hand-drawn
and it's a unique style.

137
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,127
There's a lot of attention
to detail on this show.

138
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,573
If you look at a tree, none of
the trees are exactly the same.

139
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,227
They have different
lines because everything

140
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,773
is hand drawn.

141
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,627
I think the hardest feature
that we've had to developed

142
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,073
so far has been combat.

143
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,197
The combat stuff is
definitely the most intense

144
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,530
technical gameplay part of it.

145
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,203
We knew we wanted to
keep it turn-based.

146
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,570
CARTMAN: We were hurt, yes.

147
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,167
But the intruder had
made a critical mistake--

148
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,627
he pissed you off.

149
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,433
Because that works really
well for timing and comedy

150
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,833
and allows us the
conceit of the boys

151
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,833
playing a game within a game.

152
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,073
[boom]

153
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,397
CARTMAN: (CHUCKLING) Nice.

154
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,700
But we definitely wanted
it to be a Version 2.0.

155
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,200
I think we can all
agree that this kid

156
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,270
shows a lot of potential.

157
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,497
We're expanding
upon the combat,

158
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,830
moving from more
traditional JRPG

159
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,873
turnstile to something that's
a little more tactically based.

160
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,627
And that, pretty much,
allows our players

161
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,633
to have a lot more
flexibility, in terms

162
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:30,973
of how they attack combat.

163
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:31,797
Car.

164
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,730
Car.

165
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,533
Stay out of the
street, damn kids.

166
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,973
[beep] you, dude.

167
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,227
It's civil war, dick.

168
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,903
Being able to pick which
heroes they want at their sides,

169
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,630
combining powers and
abilities, and positioning

170
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,503
their characters adeptly.

171
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,930
You're actually having
to think a little bit more

172
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:50,373
about your next move and maybe
even two or three moves ahead.

173
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,767
TREY PARKER: You want
it to be complex enough

174
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,927
to be fun and challenging
and have strategies,

175
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,673
but you also want it
to be simple enough

176
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,827
that it looks like South Park
and it is just still fun.

177
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,603
MATT STONE: We established,
in "Stick of Truth,"

178
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
that you have a
magical butt hole.

179
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,267
And so this goes to the
next level, where you get--

180
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,497
TREY PARKER: We were
like, how can we

181
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
make your farts more
powerful than what

182
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,070
it was in "Stick of Truth"?

183
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,197
And we're like, we could
start to bend time.

184
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,530
Yeah.

185
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,533
If you make us think,
it really rips a hole

186
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,473
in the space time continuum.

187
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,767
You really rip one.

188
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:14,927
MATT STONE: Yeah, you
can really rip one,

189
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,173
which again, was
one of those things,

190
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,727
like oh, that's a great idea.

191
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,503
But then, when you start to put
it into a video game system,

192
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,870
it's really hard to figure out.

193
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,167
So I think we
figured out a good--

194
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,497
Yeah.

195
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,270
I think we figured out
a good time fart system.

196
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,067
[fart sounds]

197
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:30,867
[boom]

198
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,533
TREY PARKER: A game is such
a different animal than a TV

199
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,933
show or a movie or anything.

200
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,703
I don't want just a movie
where I press x a lot.

201
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,170
MATT STONE: What I'm psyched
about with "Fracture" is that I

202
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,627
just like the fact that there's
something that we're doing

203
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,203
that we couldn't do in a show.

204
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,730
And there's a way to experience
the town and jokes in a way

205
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,233
that you couldn't
do in the show.

206
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,673
There are going to be those
moments where you're going

207
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,067
to look and go, oh, my god.

208
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,167
That was really cool.

209
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,497
We're really excited.

210
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,070
We're excited to tell
this particular story.

211
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:55,967
Hood rats.

212
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:56,797
Go.

213
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,170
[epic orchestral music playing]

214
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,627
CARTMAN: South Park.

215
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,803
The Fractured but Whole.

216
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
[laughs]

217
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,470
TREY PARKER: It was originally
called the Butt Hole of Time.

218
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,767
MATT STONE: Yeah.

219
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,197
TREY PARKER: They ran
it past the whatever

220
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
and they said you can't
put butt hole in the title.

221
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,070
The retailers won't
put butt hole--

222
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,297
The retailers
won't put it there.

223
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,870
--on a shelf.

224
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,167
So I just sat there at my desk
for hours going, butt hole--

225
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,427
How do I get past this?

226
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,103
Butt hole, butt hole,
butt-- butt hole.

227
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Butt hole.

228
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,830
Butt hole.

229
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,067

232
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,573
Why did we choose this life?

233
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,127
[thunder rumbling]

234
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,433
Why did we become superheroes?

235
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:44,073
We dedicate our lives to
fighting crime for one reason--

236
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:47,467
to make $1 billion on
a superhero franchise.

237
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,297
Now let's go through
the plan one more time.

238
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,070
First, we start
with the coon movie.

239
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,427
Then we do the Supercraig movie.

240
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,303
Then Supercraig and Coon
will join forces in the Human

241
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,930
Kite movie, just
as we start ramping

242
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,173
up Kenny's Netflix series.

243
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,597
How come I have to
have the Netflix series?

244
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,630
I want a movie, too.

245
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,173
You have a movie, Mysterion.

246
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,167
You're in the third Coon
and Friends United movie,

247
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,527
after your Netflix series.

248
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,503
Yeah, but he's saying he
doesn't ever get his own movie.

249
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,600
Do I get my own movie?

250
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,330
Not everyone gets
their own movie.

251
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,533
This franchise plan sucks.

252
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,203
If we want to make
billions of dollars,

253
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,300
then I think we should start
with the Tupperware movie.

254
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,370
Right, start with
a black superhero.

255
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,397
Marvel is making a
black superhero movie.

256
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,430
Yeah, now.

257
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,633
They waited years
to get to that.

258
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,273
We follow their plan.

259
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,497
We do all the real people first,
then we sneak the black guy

260
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,970
in in phase three.

261
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,597
How about we just do
movies starring all of us,

262
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,130
like all the time?

263
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,603
But then we're just rehashing
the same old material.

264
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,230
There's nothing wrong with
doing the exact same movie

265
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,233
to start a franchise.

266
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,133
OK, JJ Abrams.

267
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,233
OK.

268
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,373
Oh, OK, so you're
on Cartman's side?

269
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,427
He just likes this
plan because he

270
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,573
gets two movies in phase one.

271
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,597
Guys!

272
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,730
We have to just
go with this plan.

273
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,133
We don't even have
one movie yet!

274
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,173
How did it get to this?

275
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:47,067
How did we grow so far apart?

276
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,267
You go with the plan.

277
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,067
Maybe we'll just go and
do our own franchise.

278
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:50,697
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

279
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,070
Oh!

280
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,197
You want civil war,
is that what you want?

281
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,370
Yeah, dude, it's civil war.

282
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,427
Fuck you.

283
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,733
Oh, fuck you, get
out of my house.

284
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,233
We'll make way more
money on our franchise.

285
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,573
Go ahead.

286
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,697
I bet you don't even get
halfway through phase one

287
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,530
on your franchise, DC Comics.

288
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,130
[door shutting]

289
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,273
I thought civil
war wasn't supposed

290
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,627
to happen until phase three.

291
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,733
Shut up, Supercraig.

292
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:16,733
[dramatic music]

293
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,727
I didn't want to
have to do this,

294
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:29,173
but you leave me no choice.

295
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,367
Did I just hear someone
use a micro-aggression?

296
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,697
[screaming]
