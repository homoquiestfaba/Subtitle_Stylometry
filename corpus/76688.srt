There's nothing here.

1184
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:53,440
l'm going to turn this into something.
l'll build homes for families.

1185
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,400
The smart thing for you to do
is cash in right now.

1186
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,960
-You might want to join me, Melvin.
-Why?

1187
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,560
lt's safer up here.

1188
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:16,240
Jesus Christ, Burt!
l thought you killed all those things.

1189
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,120
BURT: l never said that.
MEL: God, man, kill it! Blow it up!

1190
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,080
What are you waiting for?

1191
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,680
BURT: The thing is, as long as one
of these reptilians is still alive...

1192
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,760
...this whole area is deemed protected.

1193
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,160
You know, pursuant to section 1472-B
of the Endangered Species Act?

1194
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:39,080
ln other words, no houses,
no condos and no ranchettes.

1195
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:43,320
You're crazy. Okay?
These things, man, they're going to--

1196
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,560
They're going to eat you, Burt.
They're going to get all of you.

1197
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,400
We got new geophones,
graboid barriers, blanket protection.

1198
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,160
The whole town agrees. Between you
and El Blanco, they'll take him every time.

1199
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,920
Adiós, Melvin!

1200
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,880
Burt! Hey!

1201
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,520
Burt!

1202
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,480
Burt!

1203
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,040
MEL: [Shouts] Burt! You asshole!

1204
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,400
You damn son of a bitch!

1205
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,360
God! I hate you!

1206
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,320
I hate your guts!

1207
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,600
You sorry, sick...

1208
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,920
...paranoid, right-wing...

1209
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,160
...redneck psycho!

1210
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,280
Shit-kicker!

1211
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,320
Goddamn you, Burt!

1212
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,080
And I hate that hat!
