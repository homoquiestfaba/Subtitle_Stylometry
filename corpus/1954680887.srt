1
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,124
Teela, my child.

2
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:37,699
You must take this stone to
the Paladin at Sung Hill.

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,246
I am too old to make the journey.

4
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,742
Run! Run!

5
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,514
Teela! Teela!

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,770
Where... is the stone?

7
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,742
You will never find it!

8
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,629
Run, Teela! The Goddess will not let me die.

9
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,122
Find help.

10
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,010
We shouldn't doing this.

11
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,010
Nonsense.

12
00:03:56,202 --> 00:04:00,260
Gentle... or we'll go... pooh!

13
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,102
- This-this one here?
- Mm-hm.

14
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:15,693
- OK.
 - Softly!

15
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,386
- I can't!
- Pour.

16
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,229
- Nothing's happening. We should stop.
- Ah-ah... and I would pour the rest in.

17
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,752
Oh!

18
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,402
Now, begin!

19
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:40,890
Ah, that's it.

20
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,430
I don't know what went wrong.

21
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,339
I think I need more Basilisk blood.

22
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,667
No!

23
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,862
What's that smell?!

24
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,852
Take care of this.

25
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,941
You brought some down there, boy?

26
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,130
I'll strip your hide from you!

27
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:41,019
Out of my way, gimp!

28
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,205
You clumsy bitch!

29
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,090
You're not worth the gruel it costs to feed you!

30
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,661
Leave that! Let the gimp finish it.

31
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,160
Here!

32
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,250
Take this into town.

33
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,140
Get coin, from the wizard

34
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,370
And I want you back before first watch!

35
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,410
I don't want any trouble with the guards.

36
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:16,599
- I'll go.
- No, your leg...

37
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,780
You won't get back before dark. They'll catch
you and... they'll brand you as a runaway.

38
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,553
I mastered the vision spell you gave me.

39
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:28,015
Although, I-I think it could've...
used some more Basilisk blood.

40
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,620
And what the Basilisk blood project?

41
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,889
An eagle.

42
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,700
That's fascinating. I'm certain Basilisk
blood would result in a fireball.

43
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,629
Think I'm ready for more spells.

44
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,540
Really? What kind of spells?

45
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,320
Healing.

46
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:58,059
I'm not a holy man.

47
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,809
You need a healer.

48
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,210
Magic... is not an art of
faith, but of understanding.

49
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,010
However... I do have something for you.

50
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,110
Bring me that pile of parchment.

51
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,239
There, a displacement spell.

52
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
It's very useful, but don't
use it on living objects.

53
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,249
Why not?

54
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,470
Because it will most likely cease to be living.

55
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,280
What are you doing?

56
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,039
I'm leaving. These things
not safe to be left here.

57
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,879
Nothing, is safe here anymore.

58
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,239
You're leaving?

59
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,649
There's too many eyes, too much... lust for power.
I've stayed too long.

60
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,659
Take me with you.

61
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,969
You've a strong mind Marek...
and a gift for learning.

62
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,489
You could teach me.

63
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,629
You could buy me and you could teach me.

64
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,669
There's an inn...

65
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,720
It's just outside of town.

66
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,341
You ask for Hammerhead.

67
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,600
You'll find the experience that you lack, there

68
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,435
and someone... will be in need of a conjurer.

69
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I can't.

70
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,305
I'd be alone... a runaway.

71
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:25,799
Hunted down and hanged.

72
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,879
You're a fighter, Marek.

73
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,179
It would be a shame to see that flame go out.

74
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,983
- But, I ca...
- No. It's getting dark and you must go.

75
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,840
It's almost night.

76
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,569
Here, it's for the hogs' room.

77
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,339
Please don't go.

78
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,469
You're my only friend.

79
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,444
The only one who could help me.

80
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,169
Good friends aren't so hard to find.

81
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,000
Our paths will cross again.

82
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,900
Now... haste.

83
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,669
It's after first watch and the guards
will looking for slaves breaking curfew.

84
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:28,544
- What is it?
- Adventurers, they have dragon heads.

85
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,718
The first watch!

86
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,640
Watch where you're going, gimp!

87
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,089
Ohh... ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

88
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,110
What do we think of this, huh?

89
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:10,639
Oh, slave girl , huh? But you're not so young.

90
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,915
I could sell you as a 15 year old. Mmm...

91
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,410
- 16 years old, no right leg?
- No! No!

92
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,439
But it's your twisted foot... it's not my type.

93
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,460
But some man, mmm, some man
may pay extra for a girl like you.

94
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,780
No!

95
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,190
Take her to the den. Take her!

96
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,559
No! No.

97
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,120
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- Ohh!

98
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,249
And find out who owns the rights, in case...
somebody wants to claim her.

99
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,315
Hold!

100
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,822
My slave, she ran away... but I caught her.

101
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,215
No! He's lying!

102
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:01,182
Your slave's out past first watch.
She'll have to come with me.

103
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:05,846
Like, I said... my slave girl ran away...

104
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,860
and I found her.

105
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,155
There's no harm done here.

106
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,300
That's for your troubles.

107
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,200
What's her name?

108
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,226
Kill him!

109
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,070
Ah, you... bitch!

110
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,003
I will find you!

111
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,430
You, uh... you just don't know who I am, do you?

112
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,890
I have a general idea.

113
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,920
If you cross me, you will pay!

114
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:38,108
You thrust this in with some force, my lady.

115
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,144
The effect... was nearly disastrous.

116
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,054
Papers!

117
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,070
- What are you carrying?
- Nae but straw.

118
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,370
Move along. Move along.

119
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,716
Get off me!

120
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:11,161
A thousand pardons, my lady.

121
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,628
I can't help myself.

122
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:16,840
Beautiful girl... intimate moment in the straw...

123
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,190
But, alas, work calls.

124
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,024
The magistrate isn't going to
cuckhold himself, now, is he?

125
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,678
Pleasant travels.

126
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,380
- The coins...
- <i>Hey, stop! You there, stop!</i>

127
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,375
<i>Hey!</i>

128
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,880
Oh, no! No! No!

129
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,175
Who's the man here?

130
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,750
Does this belong to you?

131
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,750
Yes.

132
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,640
I trust this can be forgotten!

133
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,273
You led the Vitalian Guard to this house?!

134
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:59,289
Where's my coin?

135
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,739
I'm sorry, I was robbed, and...

136
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,229
Are you trying to make a fool of me, girl?

137
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,580
You managed that, yourself.

138
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,089
You're finished here!

139
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,110
Yes, I wanted you clean, so I
could keep your price up!

140
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,549
Now, I'll just take what's mine! Sell
whatever's left of you... to the whorehouse!

141
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,069
What was that?

142
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,839
- I... I don't mean...
- You used no powders and you said no words.

143
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,431
It-it was like no magic I've ever seen before.

144
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,731
<i>- Where is she?
- Witch! Conjurer!</i>

145
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:30,263
I have to go. I'm going to Hammerhead's inn.

146
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:34,076
Come with me. I can't do it alone, Egan.

147
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,476
Wait.

148
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,952
I made it. It'll help you run.

149
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,670
I don't have your courage.
I-I would never make it.

150
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,890
Come on, go. Quick.

151
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,993
Goodbye, Egan.

152
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,194
Go.

153
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,828
Make sure she stays out.

154
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,780
I won't be sayin' it again!

155
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,290
No fightin' blades in the establishment!

156
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:52,769
Feed that mess to the pigs.

157
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,856
A round of drinks for the Blood Clan!
On the house!

158
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:35,349
Hammerhead!

159
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,424
Move it along, nowl!

160
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:39,925
Hammerhead!

161
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
I'm going to assume that you're new here

162
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,020
and that this is a gift... so that Orc over there

163
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,380
doesn't have to polish the blood
off the blade of my ax, again.

164
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,569
- I'm looking for work.
- Then talk to Narnie, over there.

165
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,960
No... adventuring work!

166
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,079
I want a chance at a bounty. I do magic.

167
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,259
Ohhh!

168
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,410
Why didn't you say so? A magician!

169
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,840
Well! I had no idea!

170
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,452
And all this time I've been payin'
court to a real fyekin' magician!

171
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:17,534
- Now get out before my temper's...
- Ahh!

172
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:24,830
In the name of the goddess, Anisette,
I demand audience with Orin Tuck!

173
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,359
- Fyekin' women tonight!
- You are Orin Tuck?

174
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,600
Hammerhead's what they be callin' me now.

175
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,159
I am Teela, of the order of
Anisette, sent to plead your help.

176
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,530
Orcs raided my temple, two nights past

177
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,220
and my people were slain, or taken by foul beasts.

178
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,749
I seek heroes to win their freedom.

179
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,729
Have you any gold?

180
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,599
I... have some. 200 silver.

181
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,839
That's not gold.

182
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,689
Please, you and your kind were friends
to the order, in times of old.

183
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,444
Times of old are olden times, now.

184
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,700
And those heroes lie shriveled, in the dirt.

185
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,049
I've no use for causes!

186
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,164
And neither does any man here, today.

187
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:18,273
They have my sister!

188
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:23,139
Does any lad here want to
help save this lass's sister,

189
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,599
who was kidnapped by a band or marauding Orcs?

190
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,757
The pay is 200 silver pieces.

191
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,819
There's the door.

192
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,660
I suggest you use it.

193
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,099
If I just fyekin' saw who I think I fyekin' saw...

194
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,329
she better be here to sell herself as a whore!

195
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,170
I will take that bounty!

196
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,490
I'm forming a team.

197
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,439
Any of you are welcome to join my team.

198
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,820
I... bring the skill... of magic.

199
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,423
<i>Careful, she has magic!</i>

200
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,339
Wait!

201
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,749
You need help.

202
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,169
In there... I-I heard you. You nee...
you need help.

203
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:40,439
I require seasoned adventurers... heroes, even.
Not young girls.

204
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,040
I have a team!

205
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,600
You have a limp.

206
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,609
No one else will help you.

207
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,199
Hammerhead said it.

208
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,839
The mission is too dangerous and...
you have too little to pay.

209
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,293
And you... you do not fear it?

210
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,579
No.

211
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,620
- Should I?
- Yes.

212
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,499
200 silver pieces... full sum upon completion.

213
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,489
It will be dangerous.

214
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,689
But with a care, a man just might survive it.

215
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,343
You won't regret it.

216
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,829
- I very much doubt that.
- Give me until fourth watch.

217
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,410
We meet at the stone circle, at dawn.

218
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,626
I know you.

219
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:17,183
You're that slave girl that
got me thrown into this cage.

220
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,584
Marek.

221
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,449
That pimp has some influential
friends in my regiment.

222
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,099
I'm here to free you.

223
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,090
All I need is for you to swear an oath to me.

224
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,950
Why not?

225
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,463
I need a swordsman, for a bounty.

226
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:39,790
Join me and we'll win it together.

227
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,080
You're joking!

228
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,428
You're not joking.

229
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,679
Long ago, I swore an oath, to the Vitalian Empire.

230
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,689
That oath, took me across the
world, and into this cage.

231
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,699
I'm done with oaths.

232
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,999
I saw you in the alley. You... you're a brave man.

233
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,049
- I wouldn't go that far.
- No more masters, no magistrates!

234
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,159
We-we'll create our own destinies.

235
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,679
And what would those destinies
hold for us, little varmint?

236
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,200
A life with dignity.

237
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,620
Well, friend... for a life of dignity...

238
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,310
Oh, God.

239
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,359
Oh, here come the guards! Maybe
one of them has the key!

240
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,059
Reckless balls...!

241
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,760
Name's Thane.

242
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,599
We need a thief.

243
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,955
It's Thor's day.

244
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:54,216
I believe there's one coupling
with my commander's wife.

245
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:56,974
Well, there's our thief.

246
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,199
Pssst!

247
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,029
Boy!

248
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,651
Boy!

249
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,452
Boy!

250
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:14,329
Go around the corner and tell the guards

251
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,750
you saw a man climb into that window.

252
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,211
What's on your leg?

253
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:24,212
Go!

254
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,233
What is that on your leg?

255
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:31,420
Oh! My husband's back!

256
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,111
<i>Take these! Go! Go! Go! No-no-no! Don't hurt me!</i>

257
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:56,979
What is that thing on your foot?

258
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,189
Where's my money?

259
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,619
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- In the hay wagon.

260
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,154
I meet a lot of women in the hay.

261
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:06,686
No offense, but, I... can't say
as I remember you, sweetheart!

262
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,443
Wait, it's coming to me.

263
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:12,542
What manner of insult is it you bring to me?!

264
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,489
To this house! To my bed! Get away, you whore!

265
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,749
Can we maybe discuss this somewhere else?

266
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,260
Take your time, pal.

267
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,690
Alright... alright.

268
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:27,189
Given my very... limited... knowledge on thieves,

269
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,179
I would assume you money is gone. Gambled away,

270
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,618
or spent on very, very expensive women.

271
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:35,369
You bastard!

272
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,059
Most probably.

273
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,909
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm
a harder catch than that.

274
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,919
We're here to make you an offer.

275
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:54,043
Guads! Guards! I can just...

276
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,759
I need you for one mission.

277
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,980
No chance, milady.

278
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,139
Then we'll let the magistrate have
you, and she keeps her clothes.

279
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,999
- What's the pay?
- 50 silver.

280
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
100!

281
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,819
- 100!
- Is now really the time to haggle?

282
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,799
- 75.
- What?

283
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,790
- Have him destroyed!
- I'm in!

284
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:45,720
We're here.

285
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,639
Weh-heh-heh-hell, well... allow me!

286
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,930
Dagen.

287
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,489
- And you are?
- Teela, from the order of Anisette.

288
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,008
A holy woman?!

289
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,769
A little girl, a Vitalian... and a miscreant.

290
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,510
Pray the goddess may bless our worthy cause.

291
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,710
Charming.

292
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,329
There is an Orc encampment 10 leagues east.

293
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,859
My sister is held there.

294
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,829
We will rescue her under cover of night.

295
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,855
You and I, under the covers, at night? I like it.

296
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,810
Except without the dress. All done up in...

297
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,510
why don't you stick out like a
lily in a pile of pig shite?

298
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,689
- Done. Up!
- Should we head out?

299
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,679
My white robes symbolize purity

300
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,089
and show my dedication to the goddess, Anisette.

301
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,885
And I will not be spoken to
like one of your common whores.

302
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,129
Speak to ladies like whores, and whores, like

303
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,498
ladies. Surprising what you get from both.

304
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,159
I've ten leagues, yet, before I test this blade.

305
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,740
Don't push me off.

306
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,780
The goddess leads us.

307
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,960
<i>"The goddess leads us."</i>

308
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,925
Ten leagues.

309
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,409
Maybe we should take a look around, down there.

310
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,304
See if they... missed anything valuable.

311
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,390
They are my friends and teachers.

312
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,609
Should we go down there... to pick up the trail?

313
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,180
Let's keep moving.

314
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:02,704
What is that smell?

315
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:06,660
We're to stay downwind.

316
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,644
Keep low... and quiet.

317
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,292
That's a lot of orcs.

318
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,129
Right. Time to go home.

319
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,492
If we fight, we die.

320
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:21,664
I have a plan.

321
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:25,040
I'll create a distraction.

322
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,049
The meadow. Draw them out that way.
Get them to chase us.

323
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,079
- Then Dagen will run in and...
- Oh, hey, no! Like hell I will!

324
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,809
You out of your nut?

325
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,510
Those aren't imaginary Orcs that your

326
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,490
grandmother told you about, to
lull you to sleep, sweetheart.

327
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:43,072
Those are real, bloodthirsty, musclebound animals.

328
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:47,649
And we only have one musclebound animal.

329
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,641
I can conjure a distraction.

330
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,616
There's a lot of Orcs down there.

331
00:38:54,217 --> 00:39:00,499
Fine! Well, then, thief, you're going to slip
into the water, quietly... hop into those cages

332
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,600
and find out which one has Teela's sister in it.

333
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,460
- Mmm.
- Then come ashore when you're in the clear.

334
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,619
- Well, what about freeing the other captives?
- Yeah, why not?

335
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,794
And while I'm at it, I'll swipe some teeth

336
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:12,024
from the biggest gooch's mouth.

337
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:15,592
- Forget it!
- If anything happens, we'll attack...

338
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:17,494
causing a distraction.

339
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:19,649
It's a good plan.

340
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,479
Naturally!

341
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,579
And what about that guard,
down there by the cages?

342
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,579
Maybe I'll make friends with him.

343
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,499
All the while, Thane can spend the night, up
here, on the rocks, pleasuring you lovely ladies,

344
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,359
while Teela's sex deprived
goddess watches on, with envy.

345
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,494
Shove your dagger straight up through his bowels.

346
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:40,690
He won't scream and death is instant.

347
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,341
The sisters of my order
study principles of combat.

348
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:48,549
- Dagen, if your thieving skills aren't up to it.
- My thieving skills?

349
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,169
No-no-no-no-no. It's fine. I'll do it.

350
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,000
Fyke! Always the thief gets
the sodden end of the stick!

351
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
Teela, cut that out!

352
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,330
Alright? It's bad luck.

353
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,016
Alright, excuse me.

354
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,639
What's she look like, this sister of yours?

355
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,979
- Brown hair.
- Is she beautiful?

356
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:18,000
Chances are improving.

357
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,620
What's going on down there?

358
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,875
Teela, is that your sister?

359
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:39,790
No, a priest.

360
00:40:43,135 --> 00:40:45,698
That's him. He led the raid on my temple.

361
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,140
- Where is the stone?
- I don't know.

362
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:00,904
What is he doing to him?

363
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:10,566
Necromancy. It's an old, dark magic,

364
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,855
which draws on the life of survivors.

365
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:15,599
I'd only ever heard tales of it, until now.

366
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,729
I can't see Dagen.

367
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,841
Any sign of him?

368
00:41:30,842 --> 00:41:33,342
Come on, thief, earn your pay.

369
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,329
Which one of you is Teela's sister, Caeryn?

370
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,964
They kill those of us who speak.

371
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:59,160
I mean to free you.

372
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,689
- The Ogre came and he took...
- Silence!

373
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,199
Or my blade shall taste of your blood, again!

374
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:18,018
So, what have we got, here?

375
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:24,640
Put it in... easy, easy...

376
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,800
A bit deeper... and... there she is.

377
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:35,200
Right. Let's have a look at you.

378
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,316
You're Caeryn?

379
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,463
Caeryn isn't here.

380
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:45,569
- What do you mean?
- I misunderstood.

381
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,331
Goddess wants all of her worshipers released.

382
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,707
They'll see we've escaped and come after us.

383
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:05,029
Ohh...oh, no.

384
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:07,811
Fyke! Don't do it.

385
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:16,375
Alright. Alright. They've got him.

386
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:20,641
No-no! Come on down whenever you're ready!

387
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,036
It's going in!

388
00:43:27,797 --> 00:43:29,829
Do we have a plan?

389
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,219
We fight.

390
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,489
I thought you said we'd die.

391
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,910
We'll see now, won't we?

392
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,851
It is a lot of Orcs.

393
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,777
Are you alright?

394
00:44:29,778 --> 00:44:31,276
Of course I'm not alright!

395
00:44:48,463 --> 00:44:49,877
Help Teela!

396
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:10,330
You had to fyeking stab me.

397
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,830
Teela, your combat training is shite!

398
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,480
Leave us your women and you can live.

399
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,440
How very Orkish of you.

400
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,450
Leave me! I'm not afraid to die.

401
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:43,074
Just do it, already.

402
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,998
You had to fyeking stab me.

403
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,702
Must have lost them.

404
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,878
Not. Marek!

405
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,342
Could really use some magic, right now!

406
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:12,813
- Just leave me! I'm slowing you down!
- No!

407
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,798
Our oath goes both ways!

408
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:22,414
Move him faster, or drop him!

409
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,819
Wait, wait! I know this place!

410
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,879
Up there, we raided a camp here, once.

411
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,407
There's a cave. It's hard to get to.

412
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,055
I'm out of arrows!

413
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,375
Hard to get to?

414
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,600
I'm not gonna let you die!

415
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,275
The bolt! Pull the bolt!

416
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:19,475
- I'm alright!
- OK.

417
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,272
Keep him quiet!

418
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:25,618
Shhh! Quiet!

419
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,630
I'm bleeding too fast!

420
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,130
Move aside.

421
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,556
Embrace the pain and welcome
death, should she beckon you.

422
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:51,404
No! No!

423
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,903
I couldn't get it all.

424
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,023
It'll take time to fully heal you.

425
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:32,682
But you will live.

426
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:35,744
You are so beautiful.

427
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,149
Sleep now. I will watch over you.

428
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,428
Thank you.

429
00:48:45,785 --> 00:48:47,000
Thank you.

430
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,566
I'm going to see what else is in here.

431
00:50:33,976 --> 00:50:35,545
It's Faltic.

432
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,745
It needs to be placed on a shrine. It's a...
gift to the gods, to grant a wish for love.

433
00:50:48,668 --> 00:50:50,356
How do you know that?

434
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:53,658
Personal experience, I'm afraid.

435
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,601
It's far too pretty a thing for this place.

436
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:05,427
I don't even know where we are.
What is this, a house?

437
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:06,832
Ah, no.

438
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:10,320
No, it's a-it's a runner's cache.

439
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,674
Daring smugglers used to keep them
up and down the trade routes.

440
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:16,010
It's long forgotten.

441
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:23,526
But, um... might wish we asked to go
through them... being a slave in them.

442
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:30,450
No, I ju... um, I just, uh... saw
the-the mark on your... neck.

443
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,500
Explains a lot.

444
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,710
I'm going to make a fire.

445
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,920
Well, Teela. I presume the mission's over?

446
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:18,779
Unless, of course, you have some idea as
to where your sister might actually be.

447
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,384
My sister might have been taken by the Ogre.

448
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:28,390
- The Ogre?
- Oh, yes, THE Ogre. And not just any Ogre...

449
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,190
but the one that attacked
your temple, with the Orcs.

450
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,158
A little-or should I say, a HUGE
detail that Teela left out.

451
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,525
It's probably why she didn't want
us to go down there. We'd have

452
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:41,479
- noticed all the evidence...
- No!

453
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,559
- I mean, I didn't know the goddess led us to...
- Oh, the goddess be damned!

454
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,149
I did my part, whether your
sister was there or not!

455
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,100
Now I want my silver and then, I'll be going.

456
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:54,150
I do not have your silver.

457
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,170
- Ah!
- Not yet.

458
00:52:57,385 --> 00:53:00,879
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

459
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,295
The goddess has promised to
provide you with payment.

460
00:53:04,296 --> 00:53:06,200
OK. I'm done with you lot.

461
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,630
I know, in my heart, that my sister is alive.

462
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,641
I still have to find her!

463
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:19,509
Yeah, well... good luck with that, priestess.

464
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,650
Dagen, wait!

465
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,692
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

466
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:04,650
- This mission is suicide.
- It's suicide alone.

467
00:54:05,385 --> 00:54:07,419
Take my chances.

468
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:11,106
You can come with me... if you like.

469
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:14,155
I want to see this through.

470
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,614
- Take care of Thane.
- Wait!

471
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:51,605
Teela?

472
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,700
No.

473
00:54:56,765 --> 00:54:58,265
I'm sorry.

474
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,600
Nothing has changed.

475
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,540
My promise is good.

476
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,639
One bounty.

477
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,140
We leave at dawn.

478
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,750
Teela?

479
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,810
You should rest.

480
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,102
I've no need.

481
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:38,320
Nor I. Sleep doesn't come so easily, now.

482
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,229
Before this, I would sleep like a babe.

483
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,570
This is very clever.

484
00:56:53,371 --> 00:56:57,189
Teela... you're a healer.

485
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,600
Are you able to heal... anyone?

486
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:09,449
Those with... pure intent, who have
faith to heal and be healed... yes.

487
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,337
Am I pure enough?

488
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:15,160
C-can your goddess... can she heal me...
my... my leg?

489
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:17,768
Please?

490
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,240
I'm sorry, Marek.

491
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,930
It is not the will of the goddess.

492
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,174
What?

493
00:57:50,374 --> 00:57:52,139
Why? Why?

494
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,904
Your leg... it's a deliberate mark, from the gods.

495
00:57:56,905 --> 00:57:59,590
A reminder of the darkness inside you.

496
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,859
I'm good! I know I am. There's no...
there's no darkness inside of me!

497
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,960
We all harbor darkness... and all light.

498
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,179
Then why am I different?

499
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,960
And why can't I be healed?

500
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,079
How recent do you think this Ogre trail is?

501
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,999
Less than a day, I'd wager.

502
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,857
- Are Vitalian soldiers trained in tracking?
- Aye. But men... not Ogres.

503
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,549
Why become a soldier?

504
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:19,719
A chance to see the world...
and swing a sword at it.

505
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,689
And you?

506
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,169
- Why did I chose the order of Anisette?
- Aye.

507
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,539
It was my sister, who was first called.

508
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,227
Greatly upsetting our father.

509
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:32,179
I promised I would never follow in her footsteps.

510
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,580
Nor did I desire to.

511
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:36,999
Then, I found out he planned
to trade me to a nobleman

512
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,479
for a tract of land. I refused
and ran to Caeryn and the order.

513
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,809
The goddess has been my life, since.

514
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,209
Not many girls would pass up a
chance to marry a nobleman.

515
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:51,001
I refused to be traded like property.

516
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:53,414
Well, we all sell ourselves
for something, in the end.

517
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:55,592
That's rather bleak.

518
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,390
Life is bleak.

519
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,559
The imprint is deeper here.

520
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,739
And lengthened... the Ogre was running.

521
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,610
- Running? For what?
- From what?

522
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:18,350
I have little experience with these creatures.

523
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,522
Following blindly... is reckless.

524
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,890
What do you suggest?

525
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,169
I say we get up high... spy out the land.

526
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:36,370
Learn what... might be waiting for us.

527
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,585
We don't have time.

528
01:00:40,586 --> 01:00:42,829
If your sister's still alive...

529
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,209
there's no telling how much longer she has.

530
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,210
We have the trail, let's keep going.

531
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,060
Orcs.

532
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,829
He chose his own path.

533
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,095
He may have been taken captive.
He's likely still alive.

534
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:28,970
Maybe.

535
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:30,859
The goddess has her purposes.

536
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,949
Dagen's fate is no longer our concern.

537
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,499
I've heard enough of your damned goddess!

538
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,159
What good is she to me, to you, to anyone?

539
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,609
Maybe Dagen had it right.

540
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:44,694
Your temple is burned. Your
sister is probably dead.

541
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:48,479
And chances are, we're probably
going to die here, too.

542
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,345
Maybe I'm not good enough... for you
and your goddess, to care about,

543
01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:58,391
but I know this. I'm not like your goddess.

544
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:01,240
I wouldn't leave a friend to
die, alone, in the wilderness.

545
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:05,788
The same way Dagen left us?

546
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,844
- What was that?
- We need to move. Now!

547
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,691
We need to find a clearing!

548
01:02:19,692 --> 01:02:22,660
We'll have a better chance of
fighting, if we can see it.

549
01:02:42,308 --> 01:02:44,510
Go on! Don't look in his eyes!

550
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,230
- Blind me! I have looked directly into his eyes!
- Do we keep running or make a stand?!

551
01:02:48,327 --> 01:02:50,021
Keep running!

552
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:54,916
- I thought we needed to find a clearing?!
- I'm trying!

553
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,500
Stop playing around! Marek, run!

554
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,421
- What was that?
- I don't wanna know.

555
01:03:41,622 --> 01:03:43,106
There's a clearing ahead!

556
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,350
We should have scouted.

557
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,896
Into the trees!

558
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,173
Leave me, I can make it!

559
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:32,663
Put me down! Put me dow...

560
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:35,056
- Shut up and hold on!
- Leave me!

561
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:40,038
Faster! Run faster!

562
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:01,049
Over here, you brute!

563
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,040
Pretty!

564
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,001
Marek! Forget about us! You must find the stone!

565
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:14,994
The goddess leads you!

566
01:05:39,498 --> 01:05:41,220
Why won't you heal me?

567
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,566
Anisette, hear my prayer.

568
01:06:15,902 --> 01:06:19,045
<i>I have failed you, goddess.</i>

569
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:26,285
<i>My friends are going to die. I was alone.
I was alone. I'm alone.</i>

570
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:31,739
<i>Heal me. Heal me, so I can save my friends!</i>

571
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,563
<i>Anisette, if you hear me, answer.</i>

572
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:37,655
<i> If you hear me... answer.</i>

573
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:42,017
<i>Answer me.</i>

574
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:44,401
<i>Answer me.</i>

575
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,295
<i>Answer me!</i>

576
01:06:51,122 --> 01:06:52,472
<i>Answer me.</i>

577
01:06:59,968 --> 01:07:02,555
<i>You're wrong!</i>

578
01:07:02,556 --> 01:07:04,548
<i>You're wrong about me.</i>

579
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:14,902
To hell with the gods!

580
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:01,039
What about a last meal, or something?

581
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,639
Some meat?

582
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,325
Ale would be nice.

583
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,224
Thanks very much.

584
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:29,515
Marek. Thanks for it.

585
01:10:30,516 --> 01:10:32,599
Quiet... I'm concentrating.

586
01:10:39,978 --> 01:10:41,864
Thank you... very much.

587
01:10:51,432 --> 01:10:54,599
Don't mind me, I'm just a bit foxy.

588
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:10,853
You have impeccable timing, Marek.

589
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:13,869
The ugly one had a look in his eye I didn't like.

590
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,181
Yep, yep, OK.

591
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:23,575
This is yours.

592
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:25,013
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

593
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:29,298
Oh, my God! And I thought you'd deserted me!

594
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,030
Where are the others?

595
01:11:36,094 --> 01:11:38,080
You left them?

596
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,959
- Smart.
- No.

597
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,930
We're going to rescue them.

598
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,630
The Ogre?

599
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,434
Fyke, Marek!

600
01:11:49,034 --> 01:11:50,379
Why?

601
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:52,935
Because they're our friends.

602
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,569
And I don't have many friends.

603
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:01,065
And neither do you.

604
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,699
I spotted the Ogre trail, not far from here.

605
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,750
It's just over that ridge.

606
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:09,630
Alright.

607
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,463
Wait! Wait! Wait!

608
01:12:45,913 --> 01:12:49,085
- Yes, alright.
- Is this the Ogre's cave?

609
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:53,078
I'd bet my magic wand we're at his doorstep.

610
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,879
You know, you're asking the impossible, right?

611
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,957
Surely not impossible for you.

612
01:13:06,557 --> 01:13:09,390
I just want to make sure
you'll appreciate my success.

613
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:17,610
- What was that for?
- I'm probably falling in love.

614
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,589
<i>Who's out there?</i>

615
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,740
<i>Is there someone there?</i>

616
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,519
<i>Please!</i>

617
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,677
<i>Are you here to help me?!</i>

618
01:13:45,078 --> 01:13:46,664
<i>Who's there?</i>

619
01:13:48,422 --> 01:13:50,393
<i>I'm trapped! I can't get out.</i>

620
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,680
<i>Is there anyone there? I-I hear you.</i>

621
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,080
<i>Is that someone out there?</i>

622
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,179
<i>Who's there? Who's there? I'm in here!
I'm in here!</i>

623
01:14:08,855 --> 01:14:10,600
Psst! Anybody home?

624
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,559
Who are you? Just... get me out of here.

625
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,603
Shhh, sh-sh-sh. Calm down, boy.

626
01:14:20,604 --> 01:14:22,484
Is there anyone else in there with you?

627
01:14:22,485 --> 01:14:24,719
A tiresome priestess, maybe?

628
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,595
No. I'm-I'm all alone.

629
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:29,510
Alright, just... sit tight.

630
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,879
Please! You have to save me!

631
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,110
Please! Please! Get me out of here!

632
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,311
Don't... don't leave me!

633
01:14:39,812 --> 01:14:41,787
<i>Where did you go?</i>

634
01:14:42,288 --> 01:14:44,271
<i>Come back! Come back!</i>

635
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:46,551
<i>Please! Please, help!</i>

636
01:14:46,752 --> 01:14:48,150
Hello, beautiful.

637
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,139
I'm Dagen. Your insane sister
sent me here to rescue you.

638
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:55,895
- I'm not important. Take this.
 - <i>Please, get me out of here!</i>

639
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:03,699
Take the stone. Bring it to the Paladins
at Sung Hill. They can protect it.

640
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:05,470
Listen, sweetheart...

641
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:09,199
We have gone through a lot of
trouble to get you out of here.

642
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,939
<i>Come back, please! Please, get me out of here!</i>

643
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,540
Shut it!

644
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:18,209
You fool! Escape with the stone!
Nothing else matters!

645
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,470
You remind me a lot of your sister.

646
01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:31,333
<i>Go! It's coming! Let's go and get out here!
It's coming!</i>

647
01:15:36,753 --> 01:15:44,153
<i>Let me go! Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!</i>

648
01:15:52,111 --> 01:15:53,609
Dagen move!

649
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:07,736
Did you two want to quit lying
around and give me a hand?

650
01:16:08,236 --> 01:16:12,229
Dagen. By the gods, never thought
I'd be happy to see you again.

651
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,845
Yeah, well, I was missing Teela's sunny demeanor.

652
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:19,220
- Where's Marek?
- She's here.

653
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,975
We're going to get you out of here.

654
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:29,080
Ready, push!

655
01:16:32,161 --> 01:16:34,109
OK, OK. I'm, uh...

656
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:37,553
- Uhh...
- Maybe we could the... Ogre to...

657
01:16:37,554 --> 01:16:40,821
He doesn't take them out to play with
them, he takes them out to eat them.

658
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,735
I have an idea.

659
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,699
Teela, remember that spell, in hideout?

660
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,600
The one you were practicing on the kettle?

661
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:52,430
Yes.

662
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:54,600
Anisette, be merciful.

663
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,550
Hang on to each other...

664
01:16:57,551 --> 01:16:58,899
tightly.

665
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,195
Ready?

666
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,620
Hold on, Teela, I've got you.

667
01:18:17,712 --> 01:18:19,008
Marek.

668
01:18:27,076 --> 01:18:31,072
- What was that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

669
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,119
- It was the only way. I didn't mean...
- Yeah, well, it worked...

670
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,419
but, never do it again.

671
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,880
Did you find Caeryn?

672
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:40,599
Caeryn?

673
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:45,255
- Yeah, together, we might be able to move it.
- Yeah, Yeah.

674
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,745
Push!

675
01:18:54,475 --> 01:18:57,415
- Sister!
- She's out. She's out.

676
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,700
I'm gonna need something sharp!

677
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,538
This way!

678
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:40,205
Come on! That way! Come on. Come on. Come on.

679
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:52,660
I feel fresh air moving!

680
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,851
This must be another way out.

681
01:19:54,852 --> 01:19:56,600
I see a light. This way!

682
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,426
Get out, get out!

683
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,209
Think you can make it?

684
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,999
Probably, but how are we gonna
get the rest of you out?

685
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,574
Help him.

686
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,034
What is that?

687
01:20:43,892 --> 01:20:46,582
I've got a bad feeling about this.

688
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:05,613
You wanna eat us? You'll have to crawl
in after us. We're not coming out.

689
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:07,799
I'm not so sure about that!

690
01:21:08,999 --> 01:21:10,995
Here come the spiders!

691
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:03,590
I'm out of arrows!

692
01:22:25,644 --> 01:22:28,444
Quickly... before it recovers!

693
01:22:34,727 --> 01:22:36,224
Oh, come on!

694
01:22:41,313 --> 01:22:44,409
There's the entrance! We can make it if we run!

695
01:24:51,354 --> 01:24:53,150
Well done, wizard.

696
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,134
Is everyone alright?

697
01:25:04,626 --> 01:25:06,620
You did it.

698
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,318
We did it.

699
01:25:15,405 --> 01:25:16,970
Are you kidding?

700
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:19,196
There's no treasure!

701
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:26,040
I have always heard... that Ogres...
amass hordes and hordes of treasure.

702
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,650
That belongs to the temple.

703
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,362
We must hurry. This country is unsafe, at night.

704
01:25:31,363 --> 01:25:32,930
At night?

705
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:39,918
Hardly imagine anything worse...
than this country, during the day.

706
01:26:05,104 --> 01:26:07,800
How much for an Ogre's ear?

707
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:10,650
An Ogre's ear, you say?

708
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:18,146
I'd say that's worth... a free drink...
and a smidgen of respect.

709
01:26:18,646 --> 01:26:19,946
Done!

710
01:26:33,059 --> 01:26:35,920
I won't stop until I've reached the monastery.

711
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,454
The Paladin will send the team their silver.

712
01:26:38,455 --> 01:26:40,229
I'm afraid for you.

713
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,939
Why must you travel alone?

714
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,869
My path is sure.

715
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,819
I have no fear.

716
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,069
And the goddess says you are to
stay here for the time being.

717
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,099
I must take the stone to the Paladin.

718
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,590
Farewell, my sister.

719
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,755
Now, go. Be with your friends.

720
01:27:13,273 --> 01:27:19,155
<i>I said, you take that staff and you give it
to the captain... he knows right where to...</i>

721
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,629
Maybe I'll... become a farmer?

722
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:31,262
- Find a soft woman to settle down with.
- Oh.

723
01:27:33,062 --> 01:27:34,630
To adventure!

724
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:39,010
- To a life of dignity.
- To riches and gold!
