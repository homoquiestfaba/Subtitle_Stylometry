AND IT WAS FILLED WITH
DREAMS. WHY, HE EVEN FOUND A

00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,428
DREAMING TREE IN MARCELINE.
IT WAS HIS OWN SPECIAL

PLACE, WHERE HE COULD SIT
AND IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF

136
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,300
MAGICAL THINGS. HE WOULD
RETURN TO THIS SPOT

137
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,202
THROUGHOUT HIS ADULT LIFE
FOR REFLECTION, PRAYER, AND

138
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,379
OF COURSE, TO BE INSPIRED.
HE WAS PROUD OF THAT TREE

139
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,218
AND THE DREAMS THAT CAME
FROM IT. AND IF THE DREAMING

140
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,487
TREE WASN'T WORKING OUT FOR
WALT'S AWAKE-DREAMING, IT

141
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,622
SURE CAME IN HANDY AS A SPOT
FOR SOME REAL DREAMING. LIKE

00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,257

00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,516
LOOK, THERE HE IS
NOW WITH DOC.

175
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,214
WELL, RUN ALONG.

176
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,731
THANK
YOU AUNT MARGARET!

177
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,450
DID IJUsT
GET SNUBBED FOR A HORSE?

178
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,604
DOC: SORRY, DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN STILL DRAW HIM WHILE HE'S

179
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:45,139
ACTING THIS WAY? PERHAPS
HE'S JUST BEING SHY OR

180
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,002
SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

181
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,335
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT I
THINK.

182
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,570
DOC: SAY, WALTER,
HOW'S YOUR FATHER FEELING

183
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,422
THESE DAYS? I'VE HEARD THAT
HE'S BEEN ILL.

184
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,215
WELL, HE'S DOING PRETTY AWFUL,
DOC.

185
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,181
DOC: OH, SORRY TO HEAR

186
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,429
THAT WALTER. SHOULD I PAY
HIM A VISIT YOU THINK?

187
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,191
WALT: NO, NO, SIR! IF HE EVEN
FINDS OUT THAT I WAS TALKING

188
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,606
ABOUT HIM, PLEASE DON'T DOC.
MOM SAYS IT'S JUST STRESS

189
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,574
THAT'S DONE IT TO HIM. HE'S
MADE HIMSELF SICK BY WORRY

190
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,194
SO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING. I
THINK IT'S JUST THE WEATHER

191
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,046
OR ATLEAST THAT'S WHAT AUNT
MARGARET SAYS.

192
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,887
DOC: WELL, EITHER WAY, IT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE. HE'S GOT A

193
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,618
BIG FARM TO TEND. WELL, JUST
MAKING ENDS MEET, SEEMS LIKE

194
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,489
HE MAY HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.

195
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,857
WALT: OH, NO SIR! WE ALL

196
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,613
LOVE THE FARM. HECK! WHAT
WOULD MARCELINE BE WITHOUT

197
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,688
WALT DISNEY! RIGHT DOC?

198
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,835
DOC:
WELL, IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T

199
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,838
BE AS COLORFUL. BUT, WELL,
AS MUCH AS RUPERT AND I

200
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,842
WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU GO,
WELL, SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU

201
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,834
HAVE TO GIVE UP THINGS YOU
LOVE. IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO

202
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,766
MOVE ON.

203
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:50,741
WALT: I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE DOC. THIS HERE'S MY

204
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,601
HOME!

205
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,635
DOC: WELL, HOME IS
WHERE THE HEART IS AS THEY

206
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,742
SAY, WALTER.

207
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,756
WELL, MY
HEART IS IN MARCELINE!

208
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,520
I KNOW THAT, WALTER. I
KNOW. BUT WELL, PERHAPS

209
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,015
YOU SHOULD
BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT

210
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,289
EXCUSE ME, SIR. I HATE TO BE

211
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,650
SHORT WITH YOU BUT I'VE GOT
OTHER PICTURES TO GET TO.

212
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,860
HERE WE GO! ALL DONE!

213
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,506
I
LOVE IT! IT'S MAGNIFICENT!

214
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,964
WHAT A TALENTED YOUNG MAN
YOU ARE, WALTER!

215
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,768
GEE,
THANKS DOC!

216
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,267
IT WASN'T EASY
WITH RUPERT DANCING THE

217
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,707
WHOLE TIME. IT WAS FUN,
THOUGH, TRYING TO GET HIM ON

218
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,552
PAPER. WITH THE WAY HE
MOVED,

219
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,961
WELL, BEING STILL
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EASY.

220
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,293
WELL, IT'S EXCEPTIONAL!

221
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,683
I'D LIKE TO FRAME IT AND PUT
IT IN MY HOUSE.

222
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,789
REALLY?

223
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,234
YES, REALLY!
OH, NOW, HERE'S A NICKEL.

224
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,998
NOW I THINK THAT'S A FAIR
EXCHANGE IF YOU'LL AGREE, OF

225
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,369
COURSE.

226
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,693
WOW! DOC, 1
WOULDA JUST GIVEN IT TO YOU.

227
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,747
NEVER GIVE YOUR ART
AWAY, WALT! NO, NO, TALENT

228
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,670
LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE PAID
FOR. WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN A

229
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,105
PATIENT FOR FREE NOW HAVE I?

230
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,121
NO, I GUESS NOT.

231
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,942
EXACTLY. SO IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A REAL ARTIST, YOU'RE

232
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,525
GOING TO HAVE TO CHARGE FOR
YOUR WORK.

233
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,782
TO
EVERYBODY? EVEN MY MOM?

234
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,721
WELL, NOT EVERYONE, BUT THE

235
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,912
GENERAL PUBLIC, YEAH.

236
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,189
OK. THEN MAYBE JUST MY DAD.

237
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,601
(LAUGHTER)

238
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,330
OH, AND
WALTER! IF YOU'RE GOING TO

239
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,726
BE A REAL ARTIST, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE

240
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,730
MARCELINE EVENTUALLY. I
MEAN, REAL ARTISTS NEED

241
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,005
ADVENTURE IN THEIR LIVES.
IT'S INSPIRATION FOR THEIR

242
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,376
WORK, YOU SEE.

243
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,035
I GUESS
SO.

244
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,611
YOU NEED TO SEE NEW

245
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,005
THINGS, MEET NEW PEOPLE, NEW
HORSES EVEN.

246
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,777
FILL YOUR MIND
FULL OF FRESH CREATIVITY.

247
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,622
WHY, YOU NEED TO DO THAT,
THOUGH, AWAY FROM MARCELINE.

248
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,796
ARTISTS OF TODAY ARE IN NEW

249
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,661
YORK CITY OR MAYBE EVEN
FRANCE!

250
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,597
WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M JUST HAPPY
DRAWING RUPERT.

251
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,627
AN ARTIST GOESWHERE THE WIND
BLOWS, WALTER.

252
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,393
I'LL THINK
ABOUT THAT DOC.

253
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,771
I BETTER GET
HOME FOR DINNER SO I CAN

254
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,970
DRAW AUNTIE MARGARET'S
PICTURE FIRST AND I'M AWFUL

255
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,580
GRATEFUL FOR THE NICKEL,
DOC.

256
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,192
I'LL REMEMBER THIS
FOREVER!

257
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,614
THANK YOU!

258
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,809
OH, YOU'RE VERY
WELCOME, WALTER!

259
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,535
AND WHENEVER I LOOK AT THIS
PICTURE, I'LL THINK OF YOU.

260
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,609
WELL, GOODBYE NOW, SON.

261
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,022
AUNT MARGARET: WELL, THE
YOUNG ARTIST RETURNS.

262
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,393
LOOK,
AUNTIE MARGARET, I MADE A

263
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,038
WHOLE NICKEL. I SOLD MY
FIRST ARTWORK.

264
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,647
OF A HORSE?

265
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,849
YEAH, AND IT
KEPT DANCING

266
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,237
AROUND LIKE HE WAS DOING THE
FOX TROT TOO!

267
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,619
WALTER, YOU AMAZE ME MORE
EVERY DAY! YOU SOLD YOUR

268
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,339
FIRST SKETCH? YOU ARE A REAL
ARTIST NOW!

269
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,147
WELL, NOT

270
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,481
REAL, REAL. I'M STILL JUST A
KID. I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

271
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,348
I'M OLDER.

272
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,880
WELL, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT

273
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,683
TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? AN
ARTIST?

274
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,523
WELL, YEAH?

275
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,440
BUT I WANT TO BE SOMETHING
MORE.

276
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,807
LIKE
WHAT?

277
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,626
THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES?

278
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,603
WELL, NOT LIKE PRESIDENT IN
POLITICS. I WANT TO HAVE THE

279
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,603
POWER TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S
LIVES SOMEHOW.

280
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,073
WELL, ART CHANGES
PEOPLE'S LIVES, WALTER.

281
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,266
HOW?

282
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,035
ART HAS POWER! IT HAS THE

283
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,078
POWER TO MAKE US HAPPY OR
SAD.

284
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,478
IT HAS THE POWER TO HELP US
SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

285
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,420
OR, WE SEE
SOMETHING AND WE FEEL IT TOO

286
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,884
AND IT HELPS US KNOW WE'RE

287
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,855
NOT ALONE. ART CAN CHALLENGE
PEOPLE. IT CAN CHANGE

288
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,803
PEOPLE.

289
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,851
WOW! THAT'S
WHAT I WANT TO DO!

290
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,703
WELL, YOU ARE OFF
TO A MAGNIFICENT START.

291
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,529
AND IF I CAN GET PAID
TODO IT,

292
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,792
WELL,

293
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,107
DOC SAID I SHOULDN'T GIVE AWAY
MY ART FOR FREE.

294
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,679
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO
YOUR HEART ON THAT ONE, BUT

295
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,070
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOUR
STOMACH TOO, BECAUSE A MAN

296
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,587
HAS TO EAT AND IT TAKES
MONEY TO BUY FOOD.

297
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,483
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE HAD
BETTER HEAD IN FOR DINNER

298
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,878
BEFORE YOUR DAD SENDS OUT A
SEARCH PARTY.

299
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,816
YEAH. AND
AUNTIE MARGARET?

300
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,327
YES?

301
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,563
THESE
ARE FOR YOU.

302
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,855
WALT, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL!

303
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,495
THEY LOOK SO REAL I CAN
ALMOST SMELL THEM,

304
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,691
THANK
You!

305
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,290
NO, THANK YOU
AUNTIE MARGARET.

306
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,709
FOR WHAT?

307
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,026
YOU'RE THE ONLY ADULT THAT

308
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,705
TALKS TO ME LIKE I'M A REAL
PERSON.

309
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,577
WELL,
YOU ARE A REAL PERSON.

310
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,153
I THINK? I MEAN, AREN'T YOU?

311
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,746
OF COURSE I AM.

312
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,335
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AUNTIE
MARGARET.

313
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,322
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

314
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,813
WE ARE
KINDRED SPIRITS.

315
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,556
YES.
KINDRED SPIRITS!

316
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,896
NARRATOR:
AND IF THERE WAS ANOTHER

317
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,093
ADULT WALT
ENJOYED BEING AROUND AS MUCH

318
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,966
AS HIS AUNTIE MARGARET, IT
WAS HIS UNCLE MIKE, THE

319
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,801
STEAM TRAIN ENGINEER.

320
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,765
EVER
SINCE HE TOOK THAT FIRST

321
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,038
TRAIN RIDE WHEN HE ARRIVED
AT THE STATION IN MARCELINE,

322
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,549
HE WAS HOOKED. HE EVEN SAID
HIMSELF THAT ONE OF THE

323
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,166
PRIDES OF HIS LIFE WAS HIS
UNCLE MIKE MARTIN, WHO WAS

324
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,984
AN ENGINEER ON A TRAIN
RUNNING FROM MARCELINE TO

325
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,682
FORT MADISON, IOWA.

326
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,081
AFTER
ALL,

327
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,594
IF YOU CAN'T BE AN
ENGINEER YOURSELF,

328
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,164
THE NEXT BEST THING IS TO
HAVE A RELATIVE WHO'S ONE.

329
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,929
AND YOUNG WALT WAS
EXPECTING HIM ANY MINUTE.

330
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,770
SAY, THERE, GUY! WHAT'CHA DOIN'
ON THE TRACKS?

331
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,911
DON'T YOU KNOW
THERE'S A TRAIN COMING?

332
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,206
WHY, SURE I DO,
MISTER!

333
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,747
THAT TRAIN COMING IS
ENGINEERED

334
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,202
BY MY VERY OWN UNCLE,

335
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,875
MR. MIKE MARTIN!

336
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:26,837
IS THAT SO?

337
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,971
SURE IS.
WAIT AND SEE.

338
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,135
WELL, COULD YOU WAIT AND SEE
FROM UP HERE?

339
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,485
YOU'RE MAKING ME A

340
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,025
BUNDLE OF NERVES SITTING ON
THE TRACK LIKE THAT.

341
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,286
IDON'T

342
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:34,985
WANT TO END UP IN THE
MARCELINE HERALD AS THE

343
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,984
MAN WHO IGNORES
TRACK-NAPPING KID

344
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,191
JUST BEFORE HE WAS
SQUISHED.

345
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,154
AH, SHUCKS,
MISTER. I'M JUST LISTENING

346
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,861
FOR THE TRAIN IS ALL.

347
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,002
LISTENING FOR THE TRAIN?

348
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,670
AIN'T THAT WHY A TRAIN BLOWS
ITS WHISTLE?

349
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,402
GOSH, MR!
HAVEN'T YOU EVER LISTENED

350
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,592
FOR THE VIBRATIONS ON A
TRACK?

351
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,409
YOU CAN HEAR A TRAIN
COMING FOR MILES AWAY.

352
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,835
NO FOOLIN', HUH?

353
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,098
YOU
WANNA TRY?

354
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,734
WELL, GOLLY, YOU
AREN'T AFRAID ARE YOU?

355
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,222
WHO ME?

356
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:05,990
NO, I'M NOT AFRAID!

357
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,813
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO BRUSH
UP ON MY TRAIN VIBRATION

358
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,860
STUDIES.

359
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,621
LIKE THIS?

360
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,640
I DON'T
HEAR ANYTHING.

361
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,795
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE.

362
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,474
I HEAR SOMETHING.

363
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,554
THAT'S
MY UNCLE MIKE!

364
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,954
WOW! THAT REALLY IS A SWELL
TRICK.

365
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,237
I'M REAL PROUD
OF YOU MISTER.

366
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,693
AW,
SHUCKS!

367
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,754
THANKS KID.

368
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,415
NOW I'LL
ALWAYS KNOW IF THE TRAINS

369
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,730
ARE RUNNING ON TIME.

370
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,853
MISTER?

371
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:54,929
WHAT'S THAT
KID?

372
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,302
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
SKEDADDLE.

373
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,554
[TRAIN WHISTLE!]

374
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:20,455
[SOUND OF TRAIN PASSING[

375
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,685
NARRATOR: WALT'S LOVE FOR
TRAINS WAS ONLY RIVALED BY

376
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,850
HIS LOVE FOR COMMUNITY IN
MARCELINE.

377
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,433
THERE WAS NO

378
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,324
DOUBT THAT WALT FELT A SENSE
OF SUPPORT FROM HIS

379
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,340
RELATIVES.

380
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,038
HIS FATHER,
ELIAS,

381
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,339
MAY NOT HAVE EVER
FULLY UNDERSTOOD HIS SON,

382
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,003
BUT HE WOULD RELUCTANTLY
SUPPORT WALT.

383
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,367
AND YOU SEE,

384
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,716
MARCELINE WAS A PLACE WHERE
PEOPLE HELPED EACH OTHER.

385
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,382
ONE OF WALT'S FAVORITE

386
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,809
MEMORIES OF SUCH A TIME WAS
THRESHING SEASON.

387
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,980
A STEAM

388
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,926
ENGINE WOULD PULL A TRAIN OF
WAGONS THROUGHOUT THE FIELDS

389
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,362
AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD
GATHER AROUND TO BE OF

390
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,329
SERVICE.

391
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,725
THEY WERE GOOD,
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE

392
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,429
HELPING ONE
ANOTHER SURVIVE.

393
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,232
AS WALT
WOULD LATER PUT IT,

394
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,070
I BELIEVE FIRMLY IN THE
EFFICACY OF RELIGION,

395
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,294
IN ITS POWERFUL INFLUENCE
ON A PERSON'S WHOLE LIFE.

396
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,146
IT
HELPS IMMEASURABLY

397
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,136
TO MEET THE STORMS AND
STRESSES OF LIFE

398
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,865
AND KEEP YOU ATUNED TO
DIVINE INSPIRATION.

399
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,949
WITHOUT INSPIRATION, WE
WOULD PERISH.

400
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,024
ALL I ASK OF MYSELF,

401
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,753
"LIVE A GOOD, CHRISTIAN
LIFE".

402
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,954
AND SO HE DID.

403
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,990
HE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
HOW TO LIVE,

404
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,725
ABOUT HIS OWN
CHARACTER,

405
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,961
ALL FROM
MARCELINE AND THE PEOPLE

406
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,002
THAT LIVED THERE.

407
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,095
AND HE
WOULD KEEP THOSE QUALITIES

408
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,161
IN HIS HEART

409
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,354
TO FOREVER BE A
PART OF HIM.

410
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,945
WALT SURE WISHED THAT THINGS
NEVER HAD TO CHANGE.

411
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,114
HE WISHED IT MORE
THAN ANYTHING.

412
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,171
BUT HE KNEW
DOC SHERWOOD WAS RIGHT;

413
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,172
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THINGS UP.

414
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,003
AND AS MUCH AS HE
DIDN'T WANT TO,

415
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,373
HE COULD
TELL THAT CHANGE WAS COMING.

416
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,041
AND HE KNEW THEIR LIFE IN
MARCELINE COULDN'T LAST

417
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,584
FOREVER, EXCEPT FOR IN HIS
HEART, OF COURSE. NOBODY

418
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,743
COULD EVER TAKE THAT FROM
HIM. BUT IT WOULDN'T BE LONG

419
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,663
BEFORE FLORA MADE THE
DECISION TO SELL THE FARM

420
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,465
AND MOVE INTO TOWN. NOW,
SURE, THE TOWN WASN'T FAR,

421
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,050
BUT TO WALT

422
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,031
IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN A
WHOLE WORLD AWAY.

423
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,042
ONCE HE GOT A TASTE OF
THAT COUNTRY LIFE,

424
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,741
BOY, HE
DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP.

425
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,119
BUT SOON, THERE WOULDN'T BE
A CHOICE.

426
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:22,814
WALT: ROY?

427
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,434
ROY:
YEAH?

428
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,819
WALT: WHY DO YOU THINK

429
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,039
DAD'S HAVING US POLISH THIS
STUFF NOW? THE FARMING

430
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,411
SEASON IS OVER AND IT'S JUST
GOING TO GET ALL DUSTY

431
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,450
AGAIN. SO WHY?

432
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,213
ROY: COME ON,
WALT! YOU KNOW WHY.

433
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,425
YEAH, I GUESS 1 JUST WANTED
TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE

434
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,297
WHO'D TELL IT TO ME
STRAIGHT.

435
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,869
JUST AS LONG
AS WE'RE TOGETHER

436
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,257
IT WILL BE
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

437
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,295
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT, ROY, AND
YOU KNOW IT.

438
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,522
GOSH! I'M
ONLY TRYING TO CHEER YOU UP.

439
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,440
AND I MEANT IT, MOST OF IT
ANYWAY.

440
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,103
WE MAY NOT BE HERE
ON THE FARM

441
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,714
BUT WE'LL STILL
HAVE EACH OTHER.

442
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,501
IT'S JUST
TIME TO MOVE ON, IS ALL.

443
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,136
BUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS
AHEAD OF US.

444
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,317
IT'S TIME TO GET OFF
THIS FARM.

445
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,909
YOU WANT TO
LEAVE MARCELINE?

446
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,182
DOESN'T ANYTHING MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER, WALT?

447
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,957
ELIAS: WALTER, WHAT'S THIS I
HEAR ABOUT YOU FEELIN' BAD?

448
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,212
WALY: 1 JUST DON'T

449
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,081
ELIAS: DON'T
WHAT?

450
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:05,914
ROY: HE WANTS TO STAY.

451
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,260
I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

452
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,413
BOYS, I'M SORRY, BUT IN THIS

453
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,855
HOUSEHOLD WE'VE GOT TO GO
WHEREVER WE CAN MAKE A

454
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,256
BETTER LIFE FOR OURSELVES,

455
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,203
NOT WHEREVER WE CAN
DRAW THE BEST BARN CAT.

456
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,688
NOW HOW'S THE
POLISHING COMING?

457
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,671
IT WILL BE
A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH

458
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,097
IF THIS ISN'T READY FOR THE
AUCTION TOMORROW.

459
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,706
AUCTION! TOMORROW?

460
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,243
YEAH, AUCTION! WHAT DID YOU
THINK?

461
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,247
WE'RE GOING TO PULL
THIS STUFF BEHIND THE WAGON?

462
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,703
TAKE IT TO THE NEW HOUSE? IT

463
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,185
WOULD LOOK REAL GOOD, NOW,
SITTING THERE ON THE STREET,

464
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,243
NOW WOULDN'T
Ir?

465
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,742
OH, DAD, HE DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

466
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,222
WELL, YOU'RENOT THE ONLY ONE
LOSING SOMETHING HERE.

467
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,780
I'VE WORKED
HARD FOR THIS.

468
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,985
ALL OF THIS.

469
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,943
WE KNOW YOU DID, DAD.

470
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,728
BOYS, MAKE YOURSELVES

471
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,187
USEFUL. GO INTO TOWN AND
HANG THESE SIGNS UP AND I'LL

472
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,986
WORK EVEN HARDER CLEANING UP
THE FARM EQUIPMENT. HERE,

473
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:46,970
YOU'RE FINISHED.

474
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,593
WE CAN
DO BOTH, DAD.

475
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,232
NO! JUST GET IT DONE. GO INTO
TOWN AND GET IT DONE!

476
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,796
WE'LL BE BACK.

477
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,132
BOYS!
LISTEN, MAKE SURE YOU'RE

478
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,084
HOME IN TIME FOR DINNER.

479
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,017
YOUR MOM'S MAKING SOMETHING

480
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,079
REALLY NICE AND IT WOULD
GREAT TO BE TOGETHER AS A

481
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,180
FAMILY.

482
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,152
WE'RE ALL
HURTING IN OUR OWN WAY.

483
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,794
DAD
DOESN'T ALWAYS SHOW IT

484
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,128
BUT HE'S HURTING AND HE CARES
THAT WE'RE HURTING TOO.

485
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,137
I DON'T KNOW.
ROY:

486
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,147
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU
GET OLDER.

487
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,567
IF THAT'S
GETTING OLDER,

488
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,305
I DON'T EVER
WANT TO GET OLDER.

489
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,613
YOU
CAN'T HELP GROWING UP.

490
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,738
WELL, WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
ABOUT THAT.

491
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,210
OH, YEAH?

492
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,405
HAVE SOME IDEAS!

493
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,619
EVER HEARD OF THE FOUNTAIN
OF YOUTH? I READ ABOUT IT

494
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,046
ONCE IN AN ADVENTURE BOOK.

495
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,452
OH, WALT!

496
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,012
IT'S
REAL I TELL YOU!

497
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,225
NARRATOR:
IT WAS A SAD DAY, INDEED.

498
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,431
EVERYTHING WALT HAD COME TO
KNOW WAS CHANGING AND WOULD

499
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,337
JUST KEEP ON CHANGING, AS
LIFE HAS A TENDENCY TO DO.

500
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,734
BUT HE HAD ROY. AND AT LEAST
ROY COULD NOT ONLY SUPPORT,

501
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,248
BUT ENJOY WALT'S
IMAGINATION.

502
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,641
THE FAMILY

503
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,109
MOVED INTO A SMALL HOUSE IN
TOWN WHERE ELIAS COULD GET

504
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,194
BETTER WHILE WALT, ROY, AND
RUTH WOULD FINISH SCHOOL.

505
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,618
WALT ACTUALLY ENJOYED THAT
HOUSE, IT WAS COZY AND THE

506
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,898
FAMILY WAS ALWAYS TOGETHER;
THAT, HE COULD GET USED TO.

507
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,197
SCHOOL WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY
THING THAT REMAINED THE

508
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,194
SAME.

509
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,004
EVEN MARCELINE WAS
A'CHANGIN', STREETS WERE

510
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,013
PAVED NOW, THERE WERE
AUTOMOBILES, A BIG OL' MOVIE

511
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,812
THEATER, AND JUST BEFORE THE
FAMILY LEFT, THERE WERE REAL

512
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,444
ELECTRIC STREET LIGHTS.
WALT'S SMALL TOWN HAD BECOME

513
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:47,447
A CITY WITHIN ITSELF. YA
SEE, NOTHING IS REALLY

514
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,640
IMMUNE TO CHANGE.

515
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,290
BUT IN
WALT'S HEART IT WAS.

516
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,298
HE WOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER
MARCELINE IN HIS OWN WAY.

517
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,070
YEARS LATER, IN A MEETING,
HE SPOKE OF IT FONDLY,

518
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,574
SAYIN', "THAT'S WHAT IT IS A
FEELING OF FREEDOM WITH THE

519
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,293
ANIMALS AND CHARACTERS THAT
LIVE OUT THERE.

520
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,304
THAT IS WHAT
YOU EXPERIENCE

521
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,869
WHEN YOU GO
OUT INTO THE COUNTRY.

522
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,846
YOU
ESCAPE THE EVERYDAY WORLD,

523
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,646
THE STRIFE AND STRUGGLE.

524
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,286
YOUGET OUT WHERE EVERYTHING
IS FREE AND BEAUTIFUL."

525
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,846
AND SO
IT REMAINED TO HIM.

526
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,279
AND HE
HELD ONTO THAT DREAM,

527
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,294
THAT
PLACE WHERE HE ONCE LIVED

528
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,257
THAT HE WOULD NEVER FORGET,

529
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,720
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DISNEY
FAMILY LEFT MARCELINE FOR

530
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,099

531
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,889

ENOUGH, THEY WERE OFF TO

00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,736

687
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,206
1 YES, WE'VE GOT
ENOUGH MOTIVATIONAL OOMPH OF

688
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,518
OUR OWN. JUST LIKE WALT
HERE!

689
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,423
MOTIVATIONAL
OOMPH. I LIKE SOUND OF THAT.

690
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,550
SEE? JUST BEING

691
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,062
AROUND YOU MAKES PEOPLE MORE
OOMPHFUL.

692
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,848
OK. EXCUSE
US GUYS. WE HAVE TO GO.

693
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,854
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE TO DO?

694
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,856
WHY RUIN A
MOMENTOUS TIME?

695
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,528
I'M SORRY, SIR. I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

696
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:40,662
WE'VE KNOWN

697
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,661
YOUNG MASTER DISNEY SINCE
THE BEGINNING.

698
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,037
I DON'T THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND

699
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,702
I AM YOUNG MASTER WALT'S
FATHER

700
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,041
AND I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH HIM BY MYSELF IF YOU

701
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,296
DON'T MIND.

702
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,439
HIS FATHER,
HUH?

703
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,335
GUESS THAT KIND OF
TRUMPS OUR STANDING

704
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,770
WITH
WALTER, NOW DOESN'T IT?

705
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,933
WELL, WE'LL ALWAYS BE
OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW LOOKING

706
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,523
AT YOUR ART, UNLESS NATURE
CALLS.

707
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,258
OR UNLESS WE'RE LOOKING AT
YOUR ART IN A MUSEUM.

708
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,519
BUT IT WOULD
BE HIS MUSEUM, OF COURSE,

709
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,062
THE DISNEY MUSEUM.

710
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,845
HE WOULDN'T SHARE IT WITH
ANYONE.

711
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,964
WALTER, YOU ARE
A TRUE VISIONARTISARY!

712
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,325
AURESERVOIR, YOUNG
MASTER DISNEY!

713
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,695
HERE, I MADE A DRAWING
FOR YOU.

714
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,310
THANKS YOUNG MASTER DISNEY!

715
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,702
WELL, DO YOU GUYS LIKE
Ir?

716
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,917
(I COULD HAVE DONE
BETTER)

717
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,822
THOSE GUYS ARE
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH?

718
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,960
LISTEN WALT, YOU DON'T NEED

719
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,542
TO BE SPENDING TIME WITH
FOLKS LIKE THAT.

720
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,712
YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON
YOUR WORK AND YOUR TALENT.

721
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,850
YOU THINK
I'M TALENTED?

722
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,129
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
THINKS YOU'RE TALENTED, WALT.

723
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,399
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING
PAID FOR YOUR SKILLS,

724
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,622
YOU SHOULD
INVEST YOUR EARNINGS.

725
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,175
AW, DAD

726
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,757
NOW WAIT A
SECOND.

727
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,742
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO
SAY SOMETHING GOOD HERE.

728
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,771
SORRY, DAD.

729
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,815
YOU COULD INVEST YOUR
EARNINGS IN ART LESSONS.

730
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,568
THEY TEACH AT THE KANSAS
CITY ART INSTITUTE!

731
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,308
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE
BECOMING AN ARTIST

732
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,504
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO
IT

733
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,541
BUT DON'T EVER THINK THAT
YOU'RE THE BEST.

734
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,293
YOU CAN
ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING.

735
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,384
YOU
CAN ALWAYS GET BETTER.

736
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:11,761
DO
YOU UNDERSTAND?

737
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:12,755
YES,
DAD!

738
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:14,621
THANK YOU! I'M GOING TO
GO RUN HOME AND TELL ROY.

739
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:15,591
MEET YOU THERE!

740
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:16,967
OKAY,
THEN.

741
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:18,920
AND, DAD?

742
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,533
YES?

743
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:21,754
I'M GLAD YOU
HAPPENED BY.

744
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:32,041
ME, TOO,
SON. ME, TOO.

745
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,836
[SOUND OF DOOR FLYING OPEN]

746
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,570
WALT: ROY!
WHERE ARE YOU?

747
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,042
ROY!

748
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,974
I'VE GOT IDEAS, ROY!

749
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,286
ROY!

750
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:45,813
I'VE GOT AN IDEA

751
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,024
ROY: NOT
AGAIN.

752
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,644
NO, NO LOOK AT
THIS.

753
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,000
ALRIGHT.

754
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:52,449
LOOKS
NICE.

755
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,099
IT'S ELECTRIC
PARK,

756
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,492
IT HAS GAMES, IT HAS
RIDES. IT HAS EVERYTHING!

757
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,839
SO, WHAT'S THE IDEA?

758
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,960
WE OPEN UP OUR OWN
ELECTRIC PARK. OK?

759
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,746
FORGET ABOUT GOING TO
CHICAGO WITH MOM AND DAD.

760
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:03,408
ACTUALLY, WALT, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO

761
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,208
TALK TO YA ABOUT SOMETHING.

762
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,673
NO, NO, LOOK, LOOK.

763
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,979
THIS PLACE IS PRETTY GREAT,
YOU KNOW.

764
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,416
IT HAS STAGE
SHOWS, LOG RIDES,

765
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,380
ALOT OF
LIGHTS,

766
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,570
BUT IT'S MISSING
SOMETHING.

767
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,443
IT'S MISSING
SOMETHING.

768
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,039
IT'S MISSING IMAGINATION. IT'S
MISSING US!

769
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,378
I DREW IT ALL OUT RIGHT
HERE.

770
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,212
WE CAN OPEN UP OUR OWN
PARK:

771
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:21,998
A DISNEY PARK!

772
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,452
NO ONE IS GOING TO COME TO A
DISNEY PARK.

773
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,968
YES, THEY
WILL! LOOK!

774
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:27,789
I DREW A LAYOUT
RIGHT HERE.

775
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,188
HEY, HEY,
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

776
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,742
LET ME
SPEAK. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

777
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:32,908
WELL, THIS SOUNDS
SERIOUS.

778
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,291
SURE IT IS.

779
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,638
I'M GONNA BE LEAVING IN A
FEW WEEKS.

780
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,305
WHAT? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

781
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,439
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?

782
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,255
I JOINED THE
NAVY.

783
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,223
WITH OUR COUNTRY AT
WAR, I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND

784
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,547
AND DO NOTHING WHEN I KNOW
I'M ABLE TO HELP.

785
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,256
WHAT
ABOUT ME?

786
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,222
THIS IS FOR
YOU.

787
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,267
THIS IS FOR YOU AND

788
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,483
EVERY OTHER AMERICAN IN THIS
COUNTRY.

789
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,131
I'M DOING THIS SO

790
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,797
THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO
LIVE A SAFE AND FREE LIFE.

791
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,786
DON'T YOU GET IT?

792
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,798
WALT: NO!
I DON'T GET IT.

793
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:06,994
I NEED YOU
HERE, ROY.

794
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,796
WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITHOUT YA?

795
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,814
COME
ON, WALT,

796
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:11,906
LOOK AT YOU!
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

797
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:12,875
YOU'RE
GETTING PAID TO DRAW,

798
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:13,883
YOU'RE
TAKING ART CLASSES.

799
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,272
YOU'RE A
SWELL KID ALL ON YOUR OWN.

800
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,776
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

801
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,883
YEAH, I DO, ROY! YEAH, I DO
NEED Y OU. YOU'RE MY FAMILY!

802
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,859
AND I WILL STILL BE
YOUR FAMILY NO MATTER WHERE

803
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,612
I AM. I'M YOUR BROTHER
WHETHER I'M SITTING NEXT TO

804
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,858
YOU OR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WORLD.

805
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:31,482
HEY, LET ME PUT
IT TO YOU THIS WAY.

806
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,161
I NEED
AN ADVENTURE.

807
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,919
A REAL
ADVENTURE;

808
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,268
THE KIND YOU READ
ABOUT IN HISTORY BOOKS,

809
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,004
THE KIND THAT TAKES YOU TO
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

810
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,544
WORLD, TO SEE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, DIFFERENT PLACES.

811
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,060
AND THIS IS AONCE IN A
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

812
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,500
TO HAVE THAT ADVENTURE

813
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,777
I NEED YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THAT.

814
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,107
YEAH, YEAH, I GET IT.
I GET THAT YOU'RE THE

815
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,349
BRAVEST PERSON I KNOW.
YOU'RE THE BEST BROTHER A

816
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,423
GUY COULD ASK FOR.

817
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:55,776
AND
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

818
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,784
AROUND HERE THAT UNDERSTAND
ME

819
00:34:58,897 --> 00:34:59,921
AND SUPPORTS ME.

820
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:00,259
I
UNDERSTAND

821
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:01,987
AND PRETTY SOON
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR

822
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,487
OWN ADVENTURES.

823
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:03,881
RIGHT NOW,
MAYBE FOR YOU,

824
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:04,992
THAT'S
CHICAGO.

825
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,990
AW, ROY. 1
DON'T KNOW.

826
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,895
HEY, WHAT IF I
GO WITH YOU?

827
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,961
YOU WILL
BE WITH ME.

828
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,876
I'LL BE THINKING
OF YOU THE WHOLE TIME.

829
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,474
ROY, I'LL FIND A WAY. OK?

830
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,711
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY JUST AS
MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE,

831
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,668
ALRIGHT, AND IF YOU LOOK UP
CLOSE IN MY EYE YOU'LL SEE

832
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,868
AN AMERICAN FLAG WAVING,

833
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,073
AND ON MY SPINE IS GROWING
RED, WHITE AND BLUE. ALRIGHT?

834
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,172
I'LL FIND A WAY, ROY! I'LL
FIND A WAY!

835
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,349
WHATEVER
YOU SAY.

836
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,150
SO, TELL ME ABOUT
THIS DISNEY PARK.

837
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,432
IT'S
JUST AN IDEA.

838
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,566
BUT NOW,

839
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,360
NOW, TOGETHER WE ARE GOING
ON A REAL ADVENTURE.

840
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,129
THE DISNEY
BOYS ARE GOING OUT TO WAR.

841
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,132
NARRATOR: THINGS DIDN'T MOVE

842
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,146
QUITE AS FAST AS WALT HAD
HOPED AND HE FOUND HIMSELF

843
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,582
LIVING IN CHICAGO WITH ELIAS
AND FLORA.

844
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,212
CHICAGO WAS
BITTER-SWEET FOR WALT.

845
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,906
HE GOT A JOB AS A CARTOONIST
FOR HIS SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

846
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,778
HE
EVEN HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

847
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,960
BUT NOTHING COULD MAKE HIM
FORGET THAT ROY WAS GONE.

848
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,918
HE
MISSED HIS BROTHER,

849
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,561
AND HE WAS GOING TO FIND
A WAY TO JOIN HIM.

850
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,316
SOMETIMES IN YOUR
HEART,

851
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,634
YOU JUST KNOW IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

852
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:18,967
HE'D
FOLLOW IN ROY'S FOOTSTEPS

853
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,976
AND BE AS BRAVE AS HE COULD.

854
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,202
HE'D MAKE HIS BROTHER PROUD.

855
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,848
SO, WALT FIGURED HE'D GO
AHEAD AND FIGHT FOR OUR

856
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,999
COUNTRY.

857
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,845
HE WAS GOING TO ENLIST TO
FIGHT IN WORLD WAR 1

858
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,488
JUST LIKE ROY DID.

859
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,472
NEXT!

860
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,223
MR. DISNEY!

861
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,532
THE UNITED STATES ARMY

862
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,799
THANKS YOU FOR YOUR GUMPTION
AND YOUR COURAGE IN

863
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,034
APPROACHING THE RECRUITMENT
OFFICE TODAY, BUT

864
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,791
OF COURSE, SIR, IT'S MY DUTY
AS AN AMERICAN.

865
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,025
MR. DISNEY!

866
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,127
YES, SIR?

867
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,274
AT EASE, MR.
DISNEY.

868
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:02,947
LISTEN, KID, YOU'RE

869
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,169
SIXTEEN YEARS OLD.

870
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:05,903
UNDER THE SELECTIVE SERVICE
LAW,

871
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,186
CAN'T TAKE YOU UNLESS YOU'RE
18. GOT IT?

872
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,556
EXCUSE ME,

873
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,822
SIR, BUT I THINK MY PRIDE AS
AN AMERICAN MAKES UP FOR

874
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:11,976
THOSE YEARS.

875
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,363
MY WILLINGNESS
TO GET OUT THERE AND FIGHT

876
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,149
WITH MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN.

877
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,552
I MEAN, I HAVE BRAVERY BUSTING

878
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,022
OUT OF MY SOUL! DOESN'T THAT
COUNT FOR ANYTHING?

879
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,189
WE APPRECIATE YOUR
BRAVERY, BUT

880
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,276
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN
BREAK THE RULES FOR YOU.

881
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,160
SIR, DO YOU HAVE A
BROTHER?

882
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,437
YES. THREE
OF THEM,

883
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,375
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING,

884
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,991
MR.
DISNEY?

885
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,208
WELL, IT HAS A WHOLE LOT TO DO
WITH ME, SIR.

886
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,430
I MEAN, MY BROTHER IS

887
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,143
OUT THERE,MY BROTHER IS OUT
IN THE FIGHT,

888
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,782
AND THERE'S

889
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,002
NOTHING I WANT MORE THAN TO
BE OUT THERE WITH HIM.

890
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,003
HIS
NAME IS ROY DISNEY.

891
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,422
AND HE'S
FULL OF COURAGE AND A LOVE

892
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,895
FOR AMERICA. AND,

893
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,058
I HAVE AS MUCH PRIDE FOR
HIM AS THIS COUNTRY.

894
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,236
I MEAN, T JUST WANT
TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW

895
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,738
HIM. SURELY YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT?

896
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,102
I DO UNDERSTAND.

897
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,259
AND IN TWO
YEARS I'M GOING TO BE REAL

898
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,597
PROUD TO CALL YOU A SOLDIER.

899
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:05,081
BUT UNTIL THEN, MY BACK'S
AGAINST THE WALL, KID.

900
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,068
RULES
ARE RULES.

901
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,279
I'M SURE YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT?

902
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,317
YES,
SIR.

903
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:17,086
NEXT!

904
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,532
MR. JOHNSTON,

905
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,464
YOU
GONNA SHAVE?

906
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,198
NARRATOR: NOW,

907
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,294
WALT DISNEY NEVER TOOK NO
FOR AN ANSWER. THERE WAS

908
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,658
THIS NEW AGENCY CALLED THE
RED CROSS THAT HELPED

909
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,936
PEOPLE.

910
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,056
AND THEY WERE FIXING
TO SEND SOME MEN ABROAD TO

911
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,068
HELP OUT WITH THE WAR.

912
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,865
AND
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, WELL,

913
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,134
YOU ONLY HAD TO BE 17 YEARS
OLD.

914
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,906
SURE, WALT WAS ONLY 16,

915
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,708
BUT HE FIGURED HE COULD
SQUEAK BY WITH A LITTLE BIT

916
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,327
OF HIS ARTISTIC TALENT.

917
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,475
BUT
WHEN FLORA AND ELIAS CAUGHT

918
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,030
WIND OF IT,

919
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,163
WELL, THEY WERE
NONE TOO HAPPY.

920
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,929
HOW
COULD YOU DO THIS, WALT?

921
00:38:59,037 --> 00:38:59,936
YOU
WERE JUST GOING TO SNEAK OFF

922
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,563
AND NOT TELL US ANYTHING?

923
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,236
YOU DON'T HAVE RESPECT

924
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,197
ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOTHER AND I
TO TELL US YOUR PLANS?

925
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,210
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D LET ME
GO.

926
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,427
IT'S FOR OUR COUNTRY.

927
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,174
IT'S LIKE WHAT ROY'S DOING.

928
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:12,898
AND YOU WANTED TO

929
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,530
MARCH OFF WITHOUT EVEN
SAYING GOODBYE, WALT?

930
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,881
MARCH OFF TO DEATH!

931
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:16,886
DID YOU
KNOW THAT, WALT?

932
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,308
YOU COULD
DIE OUT THERE?

933
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,312
I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU WERE JUST GOING

934
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,109
TO MARCH OFF AND DIE AND NOT
TELL YOU MOTHER AND I

935
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,706
ANYTHING; NOT EVEN A LETTER.

936
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,352
I'M SORRY.

937
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,195
ALLTM
THINKING ABOUT IS ROY

938
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,314
AND
BEING BRAVE LIKE HIM.

939
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,156
WELL, YOU'RE NOT ROY.

940
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,763
ROY CAN TAKE CARE OF
HIMSELF OUT THERE.

941
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,935
ROY HAS RESPECTED MY
PLANS FOR THIS FAMILY ALL

942
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:39,976
ALONG.

943
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,729
HE HAS PROVEN HIMSELF
TO ME, WALT.

944
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,282
YOU WILL NEVER
BE ROY.

945
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,606
YOU ARE A DIFFERENT
SON.

946
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,605
YOU'RE THE DREAMER!

947
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,788
AND, WALT, DREAMERS, THEY
DON'T FIGHT.

948
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,210
I WON'T HAVE
Im

949
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,388
I DON'T WANT TO
FIGHT. I WANT TO HELP. AND

950
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,363
IF YOU'D JUST SIGN THIS
PAPER, I CAN BE A MEMBER OF

951
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,197
THE RED CROSS. I CAN BE A
PART OF THE RELIEF EFFORT.

952
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,292
LOOK, TJUST, I WANT TO AID
OUR COUNTRY AND PROTECT OUR

953
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,388
LIBERTIES AS AMERICANS!
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

954
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,868
NO, I DON'T!

955
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,413
I
DO.

956
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,227
EXCUSE ME?

957
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,044
IF WE DON'T SIGN, HE'LL JUST
FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO GO

958
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,664
AND SNEAK OFF,

959
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,221
AT LEAST THIS
WAY, WE CAN SAY GOODBYE TO

960
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,278
HIM AND HAVE A PROPER SEND
OFF.

961
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,155
HIS MIND IS SET.

962
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,643
I WILL NOT SIGN!

963
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,464
ELIAS, PLEASE. BE RATIONAL.

964
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,627
FLORA, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

965
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:40,762
I WILL NOT SIGN MY SON'S
DEATH WARRANT!

966
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,095
SORRY, MOM. I
SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

967
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,432
YES, YES YOU SHOULD HAVE.

968
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,266
BUT EVEN IF YOU DID, YOUR
FATHER WOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED

969
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:54,351
IT.

970
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,346
STILL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
RESPECTFUL THING TO DO.

971
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,249
IT'S JUST, I MISS
ROY. AND I WANTED TO DO

972
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,330
SOMETHING TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

973
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,428
I MEAN, AMERICA IS IMPORTANT
TO THIS FAMILY,

974
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,835
AND IF THIS
IS THE WAR TO END ALL WARS,

975
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,100
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME
DREAMERS.

976
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,357
IT'S OKAY,
WALT. I UNDERSTAND.

977
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,015
NOW,
WHERE DO I SIGN?

978
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,336
WELCOME TO THE
AMERICAN RED CROSS TRAINING

979
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,922
FACILITY.

980
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,503
YOU GENTLEMAN ARE
WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL THE

981
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,977
AMBULANCE CORE.

982
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,562
PREPARING FOR WAR IS AN
UNDERSTATEMENT.

983
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,391
THERE ARE SO
MANY DISTURBING AND

984
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,990
GROTESQUE THINGS THAT YOU
WILL SEE ON THE FIELD,

985
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:47,026
THAT YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT
TO RUN AWAY LIKE GIRLS

986
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,800
BUT YOU
CAN'T.

987
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,339
YOU HAVE TAKEN A VOW
TO BE A PART OF THIS CORP.

988
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,781
YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND YOUR
GROUND IN THE FIELD

989
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,201
AND BE
MEN.

990
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,700
AS THEY SAY,

991
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,281
WAR IS
HELL.

992
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,280
SO WELCOME TO HELL.

993
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,906
YOUR TRUCKS,

994
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,506
YOUR VEHICLES

995
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,722
WILL BE HOSTS TO THOUSANDS
OF LIVES,

996
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,756
AND MANY OF WHICH
WILL BE LOST DEPENDING ON

997
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,333
YOUR DRIVING ABILITIES.

998
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,523
LET'S JUST HOPE AND PRAY

999
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,338
THAT YOUR HOST

1000
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,323
DOESN'T
BECOME

1001
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,361
A GHOST HOST.

1002
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:26,711
WELCOME

1003
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,131
TO THE AMERICAN RED
CROSS.

1004
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:33,343
PREPARE FOR BLOOD AND THE
FRENCH.

1005
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,073
NARRATOR: NOW WALT
HAD WON THE BATTLE,

1006
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,841
BUT HE
HADN'T WON THE WAR.

1007
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,420
THE UNITED STATES DID THAT
WITHOUT HIM,

1008
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,789
BUT WALT GOT
SHIPPED OFF TO FRANCE TO BE

1009
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,625
PART OF THE AMBULANCE CORP,
ANYWAY.

1010
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,925
THERE WERE STILL

1011
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,227
RELIEF EFFORTS THAT NEEDED
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF,

1012
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,858
AND IT WAS NOW HIS DUTY TO
GO AHEAD AND

1013
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,403
TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

1014
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,761
NOW WALT GOT TO SEE ALL SORTS
OF THINGS IN FRANCE.

1015
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,162
IT WAS A WHOLE NEW SORT OF
EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.

1016
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,964
HERE HE'D NEVER
LEFT THE MIDWEST

1017
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,609
AND NOW HE WAS TRAVELLING
AROUND AN AWFUL LOT.

1018
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,840
THIS SMALL TOWN BOY WAS
QUICKLY TURNING INTO A MAN.

1019
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,403
TIMES SEEM TO MOVE
SLOWER IN FRANCE.

1020
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,139
AND IT WAS
AT THIS POINT

1021
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:18,661
WHERE WALT WAS
INTRODUCED TO CIGARETTES.

1022
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,961
HOWEVER, JUST LIKE WHEN HE
WAS A BOY UNDER THE DREAMING

1023
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,385
TREE,

1024
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,389
HE FOUND COMFORT IN
ART.

1025
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,189
AND JUST LIKE BEFORE,

1026
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,432
IT WAS ON AN UNLIKELY
CANVAS.

1027
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:36,332
[MOTOR RUNNING]

1028
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,215
HEY, SEEN ANY
ACTION TODAY?

1029
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,087
NOPE,
NOT TODAY.

1030
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,809
NOT YESTERDAY, NOT EVEN THE
DAY BEFORE THAT.

1031
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,487
I GUESS OUR INSTRUCTOR
WAS RIGHT.

1032
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,858
IF BOREDOM IS
WHAT THEY MEAN BY HELL,

1033
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,649
WAR

1034
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,007
HEY, FELLA, THOSE ARE SOME
PRETTY UNIQUE FUNNIES YOU

THANKS,

BUT WHEN THEY'RE IN THE
PAPER THEY CALLED FUNNIES,

1038
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,036
WHEN THEY'RE THAT BIG IT'S
CALLED ART.

1039
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,243
WOW. ART.

1040
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,481
DO YOU
MIND IF I SHOW MY BUDDY?

1041
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,478
NEVER MINDED A BIT OF
PUBLICITY IN MY LIFE!

00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,293

THEY CALL THIS ART!

1046
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,658
RAY: THAT'S NOTHIN".

1047
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,668
I KNOW
A GUY BACK ON THE EAST COAST

1048
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,249
WHO CAN DRAW JUST AS GOOD AS
THAT.

1049
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,487
HE'S DATING MY SISTER.

1050
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,040
WELL, HE
AIN'T HERE, IS HE?

1051
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,256
WELL, NO, BUT

BUT, NOTHIN".

1053

WHAT'D YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS

1054
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:42,677
I DIDN'T.

1055
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,928
BUT,
IT'S DISNEY.

1056
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,311
WALT DISNEY.

00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:46,473
WELL, MY

00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,732
THIS IS MY
BUDDY, RAY.

1059
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,206
AND DO YOU THINK

1060
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,583
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DRAW A
COUPLE OF THEM THINGS FOR

1061
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,736
OUR MEAT WAGONS?

1062

1070
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,454
JIM LET'S BRING *
EM AROUND!

1071
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,627
NARRATOR: DOC SHERWOOD WAS
RIGHT SO MANY YEARS AGO.

1072
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,376
WALT NEEDED TO SEE THE WORLD
AND JUST LIKE HE PREDICTED

1073
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,884
FRANCE WAS WHERE MUCH OF HIS
ART WAS PERFECTED. BUT BY

1074
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:25,570
THE TIME WALT RETURNED HOME
TO KANSAS CITY HE WAS A

1075
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,115
CHAIN SMOKER. SO, NATURALLY,
HE NEEDED A JOB TO PAY FOR

1076
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,958
HIS NEW-FOUND HABIT. HE HAD
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR

1077
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,727
OR AN ARTIST, BUT AS HE PUT
IT, "IT SEEMED EASIER TO GET

1078
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,030
A JOB AS AN ARTIST".

1079
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,923
WALT
WAS CRUSHED!

1080
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,720
AND WHO BETTER
TO TURN TO FOR ADVICE?

1081
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:48,663
WHY
BIG BROTHER ROY, OF COURSE!

1082
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,973
ROY HAD BEEN WORKING AT A
BANK, AND WALT RUSHED RIGHT

1083
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,665
ON DOWN TO TELL HIS SAD
TALE.

1084
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,337
A COWORKER OF ROY'S

1085
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,217
KNEW ABOUT SOME FELLAS WHO
RAN A COMMERCIAL ART SHOP

1086
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,823
CALLED PESMEN-RUBIN

1087
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,340
AND THEY WERE LOOKING TO
HIRE AN APPRENTICE

1088
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,716
ROY GOT WALT AN
INTERVIEW AND, BOY,

1089
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,547
WALT
COULDA KISSED HIM!

1090
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:07,748
ROY!

1091
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,997
I LOVE YOU, OL' BROTHER

1092
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,196
OK, YOU'RE

FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH YOUR
BEST PORTFOLIOS, SOMETHING

00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,201
THAT'LL KNOCK THEIR SOCKS
OFF.

1095
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,389
YOU'LL DO THE TRICK.
OK?

1096
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,559
I KNOW YOU WILL.

1097
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,144
ROY O. DISNEY, YOU ARE THE

1098
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,532
BEST BROTHER IN THE WHOLE
WORLD!

1099

YOU ARE THE BEST BANK
TELLER IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

1100
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,142

BANK, JUST, UUMM!

1102
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,589
HE'S
AN ARTIST.

1103
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,381
NARRATOR: BUT NOT
ONLY DID WALT LAND THE GIG

1104
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,661
AT PESMIN-RUBIN,

1105
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,436
BUT AT A
WHOPPING

1106
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,802
$50 DOLLARS A
MONTH!

1107
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,899
HE ALWAYS WENT AFTER
HIS OWN DREAMS.

1108
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,607
THE DREAMS
HE'D HAD

1109
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,427
EVER SINCE HIS
AUNTIE MARGARET HAD GIVEN

1110
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,638
HIM HIS FIRST ART SUPPLIES

1111
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,611
AND SHE WAS JUST THE WOMAN

1112
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,763
WALT WANTED TO TELL ABOUT
IT.

1113
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,616
SAY! IS
THAT YOUR GAL?

1114
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,657
SHE SURE IS A
LOOKER!

1115
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,294
NO, SHE'S NOT
MY GAL

1116
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,834
. IT'S MY AUNTIE. AND,
YES, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL. AND

1117
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,800
YOU SHOULD LEARN TO BE MORE
POLITE.

1118
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,622
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHIN'
BY IT, I WAS JUST,

1119
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,595
SHE SURE
IS PRETTY

1120
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,393
AND I BET SHE'S
JUST AS SWELL, TOO.

1121
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,739
SHE SURE IS.

1122
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,542
I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM
TODAY WITHOUT HER.

1123
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,508
AND WHERE I AM TODAY IS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

1124
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,616
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE A REAL LUCKY GUY TO

1125
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:38,677
HAVE A NICE LADY LIKE THAT
AS YOUR AUNTIE.

1126
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:40,448
I SURE
AM.

1127
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,483
AND I'M ON MY WAY TO
TELL HER THAT, TOO.

1128
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,063
WOW! SHE SURE IS
A BEAUT!

1129
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:50,897
SHE'S NOT A
RACEHORSE FELLA! ALRIGHT?

1130
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:51,820
WOULD YOU TALK TO YOUR

1131
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,131
MOTHER WITH A MOUTH LIKE
THAT?

1132
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,858
NO.
NO. SEE,

1133
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,872
MY MOM HAS A
TENDENCY TO HIT ME OVER THE

1134
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,658
HEAD WHEN I'M BEING
IMPOLITE.

1135
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:03,594
WELL, SHE'LL

1136
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,034
EITHER KNOCKS SENSE INTO YOU
OR OUT OF YOU.

1137
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:06,617
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH.

1138
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,612
NOW YOU NEED TO LEARN
TO BEHAVE.

1139
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:12,283
I'LL TRY! BUT,

1140
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,847
SOMETIMES, I MISBEHAVE WHEN
I'M NOT EVEN TRYING.

1141
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,882
LISTEN, FELLA,

1142
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,863
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE THE
WORLD LIKE THAT.

1143
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:22,899
YOU NEED TO
STRAIGHTEN UP!

1144
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,296

YOU HAVE A
JOB?

1147
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,490
WELL, GET A JOB.

1148
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,471
YOU GIVE MY BEST
TO THAT PRETTY AS A PRINCESS

1149
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,775
AUNTIE OF YOURS!

1150
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,313
WHAT A
BEAUT!

1151
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,115
NARRATOR: WALT HEADED

1152
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,422
OVER TO THE HOTEL AS FAST AS
HE COULD. HE WAS AWFULLY

1153
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,321
OVER TO THE HOTEL AS FAST AS
HE COULD. HE WAS AWFULLY

1154
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,120
EXCITED TO TELL HIS AUNTIE
THE GOOD NEWS.

1155
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,753
HE FELT LIKE A STEAM ENGINE
COMING DOWN THE TRACK.

1156
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,591
THEN HE WAS

1157
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,563
BARRELING UP THOSE STAIRS AS
FAST AS HE COULD!

1158
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:56,750
SUDDENLY
HE WAS GRINNING

1159
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,302
AND KNOCKING
LOUDLY AT THE DOOR.

1160
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,905
HE
WANTED TO TELL HIS AUNTIE.

1161
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,018
HE WANTED TO TELL THE WHOLE
WORLD.

1162
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,336
UNCLE ROBERT!

1163
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,366
UNCLE ROBERT: HEY, WALTER!

1164
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,734
AUNTIE! YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE IT.

1165
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,081
THEY'RE
PAYING ME TO DRAW PICTURES!

1166
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,837
I GOT A JOB AT PESMIN-RUBIN.

1167
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:21,925
THEY'RE PAYING ME FIFTY
DOLLARS A MONTH!

1168
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,494
I'M A REAL
ARTIST NOW!

1169
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,913
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU.

1170
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:28,556
WHO IS IT, ROBERT?

1171
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:34,130
AUNTIE MARGARET, IT'S ME,
WALT!

1172
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,594
ROBERT: IT'S OUR
NEPHEW, MARGARET.

1173
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,869
ELIAS'S
SON, WALTER.

1174
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,372
WHO
ISIT?

1175
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,163
WHO?

1176
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,759
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

1177
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,150
AUNTIE MARGARET, IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE NEPHEW!

1178
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:49,868
IT'S WALT.

1179
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,220
YOU GAVE
ME MY TABLET,

1180
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,972
MY DRAWING
SUPPLIES.

1181
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,989
IF IT WASN'T FOR
YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT,

1182
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,185
I WOULDN'T BE AN ARTIST!

1183
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,617
YOU USED TO RAVE ABOUT MY
PICTURES!

1184
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,457
I'M
TIRED.

1185
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,622
I THINK I'M GOING TO
SLEEP FOR A WHILE.

1186
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,905
ROBERT:
I'M SORRY, WALTER.

1187
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,900
MARGARET
ISN'T FEELING WELL.

1188
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,903
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD COME
BACK ANOTHER DAY.

1189
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,818
I DON'T, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

1190
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:22,464
AUNTIE MARGARET,

1191
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,873
IT'S ME, WALTER,

1192
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,481
YOUR
KINDRED SPIRIT, THE ARTIST.

1193
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:35,123
WALTER, PLEASE, COME
HERE.

1194
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,014
MARGARET IS REALLY
SICK NOW.

1195
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,059
THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S
FIGHTING OFF PNEUMONIA.

1196
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:46,470
NOW SHE'S BEEN
GETTING ‘FORGETFUL LATELY.

1197
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:49,228
PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

1198
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,700
SURELY SHE
WOULD REMEMBER ME.

1199
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,248
IF I COULD JUST TALK TO HER
FOR A ONE MINUTE.

1200
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:52,941
WALT,
I'M REALLY SORRY,

1201
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,939
TRULY I

AND IMAGINE THAT THERE'S A
DOGHOUSE. OK?

1542
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:16,943
OK.

1543
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,851
HERE'S THIS SCUFFLE
GOING ON INSIDE, OK?

1544
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,242
AND THE DOG KEEPS GETTING
THROWN OUT!

1545
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,415
BY WHO?

1546
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,674
WELL, AT THE END YOU'LL FIND
out

1547
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,227
THAT THERE'S CAT LIVING
INSIDE!

1548
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,523
OH! THAT'S
SILLY!

1549
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:27,585
WELL, THEN YOU

1550
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,664
DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE
ANYTHING AT ALL.

1551
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:29,812
Just
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU

1552
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,822
AND
ABOUT HOW SILLY IT IS.

1553
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:32,720
AND
JUST THINK ABOUT HOW

1554
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,734
IT
MAKES YOU LAUGH

1555
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,827
AND THEN
JUST LAUGH. OK?

1556
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,327
OK

1557
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,454
(PHONE RINGS)

1558
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:40,862
HOLD ON,
VIRGINIA.

1559
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,330
FRED! CAN YOU
ANSWER THAT PLEASE?

1560
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,129
UBBE:
HE'S GOT IT WALT!

1561
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:45,328
CAN YOU TELL HIM TO
HANG IT UP

1562
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:46,677
AND LEAVE IT OFF THE HOOK SO
WE DON'T GET ANYMORE

1563
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:47,772
INTERRUPTIONS?

1564
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,103
UBBE: SURE

1565
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,153
FRED: HEY, CAN

WALT?

1567
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,748
SORRY, VIRGINIA.

1568
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,326
HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE MY PET
MOUSE?

1569
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,119
YES

1570
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,719
HEY, UBBE! SHOW HER THE
MOUSE!

1571
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:07,069
UBBE: WHERE'D IT GO?

1572
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:11,754
OH, I SEE HIM. THERE HE
GOES. THERE'S THE MOUSE.

1573
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,707
ALRIGHT, WHAT IS IT
FRED?

1574
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,860
THAT WAS THE
BANK, WALT.

1575
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,481
THEY SAID WE
BOUNCED OUR LAST 20 CHECKS,

1576
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,867
INCLUDING PAYROLL.

1577
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:20,949
THEY'RE
ADDING INTEREST AND FEES.

1578
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,566
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

1579
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:25,916
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO
CAN HELP US OUT?

1580
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,308
I MEAN, ONE OF YOUR INVESTOR
FRIENDS, MAYBE?

1581
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,481
NO, NO, NO, NO.

1582
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,719
I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE
INVESTORS.

1583
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:33,797
WE'RE ALL DRIED
UP, FRED.

1584
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:35,126
I TELL YOU WHAT,

1585
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,359
LET'S CONTINUE WORKING ON
ALICE'S WONDERLAND WITH

VIRGINIA.

1587
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,916
WE'VE ALREADY
INVESTED SO MUCH IN THIS.

1588
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,118
ALRIGHT?

1589
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,593

AND WITH
OUR CHECKS BOUNCING,

1595
01:05:52,749 --> 01:05:53,580
IT'S

1596
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,639
YEAH, T FEEL

01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,206
YOU KNOW

01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,987
CARTOONS?

1606
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,721
THIS IS YOUR MONEY, WALT.

1607
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:16,772
IF THERE'S ANY LEFT
OVER YOU SPLIT IT BETWEEN

1608
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,342
THE GUYS. ALRIGHT?

1609
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,160
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

1610
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,769
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

1611
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:28,214
NOW GO ON, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO VIRGINIA.

1612
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:29,750
NARRATOR:
NOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT

1613
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:31,354
WALT DISNEY BELIEVED IN,

1614
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:32,740
IT
WAS HIS TALENT.

1615
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,357
WHETHER THAT
TALENT WAS ART

1616
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,936
OR BEING THE
BEST SALESMAN THE WORLD HAD

1617
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:36,992
EVER KNOWN.

1618
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,959
HE MUST HAVE HIT
UP EVERY CLIENT HE'D EVER

1619
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:41,190
WORKED WITH IN HIS ENTIRE
CAREER.

1620
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,584
PLUS ALL THE ONES HE
NEVER WORKED WITH.

1621
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,168
HE WAS
GOING TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE

1622
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:46,952
LAUGH-O-GRAM STUDIOS,

1623
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,003
AND
HIS FRIENDS,

1624
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,869
EVEN IF IT
DROVE HIM INTO THE GROUND.

1625
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,600
SEE, ALL OF HIS EMPLOYEES,

1626
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,790
THE FELLAS,

1627
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,004
THEY BELIEVED IN
WALT AND HIS TALENT AND

1628
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,078
VISION, TOO.

1629
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,898
SO, HE JUST
COULDN'T GIVE UP.

1630
01:06:59,015 --> 01:06:59,948
NOT EVER.

1631
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,528
AND, GOOD THING, TOO,

1632
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,335
BECAUSE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE

1633
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:04,352
HEARD ABOUT IT,

1634
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,923
AND SENT MR.
MCCRUMB WALT'S WAY.

1635
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,820
MCCRUM: SO, I GET THESE
FINANCIAL GRANTS,

1636
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:12,020
ABOUT $500 EACH, TO
DO EDUCATIONAL FILMS,

1637
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:17,578
AND, WELL, WE'D LIKE
LAUGH-O-GRAM TO DO ONE.

1638
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,020
WALT: I'M
INTERESTED.

1639
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,192
MCCRUM: GOOD,

1640
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,952
WELL, IT'S CALLED "TOMMY
TUCKER'S TOOTH".

1641
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,630
IT'S FOR
THE DEANER DENTAL INSTITUTE

1642
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,788
OF KANSAS CITY.

1643
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:26,467
OK,

1644
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:27,407
WHAT'S THE PREMISE?

1645
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,228
WHAT DO
YOU WANT TO TEACH KIDS?

1646
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,063
LIKE, HOW TO BRUSH THEIR
TEETH?

1647
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,227
MCCRUM: IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING, YES.

1648
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,045
WELL, LET'S ASSUME YOU HAVE AN
OPEN POSITION

1649
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,869
AND YOU'VE TWO
EQUALLY QUALIFIED,

1650
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,420
PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.

1651
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,602
NOW
ONE HAS BAD TEETH,

1652
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,042
ONE HAS
GOOD TEETH.

1653
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,841
WHICH DO YOU
CHOOSE?

1654
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:44,006
I GUESS IT

1655
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:45,515
DEPENDS ON THEIR
PERSONALITIES, I SUPPOSE.

1656
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,608
SURE, BUT WELL,
LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY'RE

1657
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,084
IDENTICAL IN EVERY WAY,

1658
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,064
EXCEPT FOR THEIR TEETH.

1659
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,646
NOW ONE HAS PRISTINE, PEARLY
WHITES,

1660
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,022
AND THE OTHER HAS
DECAYING, ROTTING ONES.

1661
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,027
I SEE YOUR POINT.

1662
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,904
SEE, TOMMY TUCKER
TAKES CARE OF HIS TEETH

1663
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,840
AND
JIMMY JONES DOESN'T.

1664
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:02,001
WE HOPE
TO TEACH THE CHILDREN THE

1665
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,910
IMPORTANCE OF DENTAL
HYGIENE.

1666
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,402
OKAY, I'M IN!

1667
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,234
GOOD. GOOD, WELL,

1668
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:12,800
WE'LL CONTINUE OUR
DISCUSSION AT THE INSTITUTE.

1669
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,451
CAN WE, CAN WE TALK
HERE?

1670
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:20,257
MR. DISNEY, I'VE ASSEMBLED A
TEAM AT THE INSTITUTE.

1671
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:22,047
I THINK YOU'LL
FIND IT HELPFUL TO GATHER

1672
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,031
THE INFORMATION YOU NEED
THERE

1673
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,716
AND TO SIGN THE
PAPERWORK.

1674
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,661
BOY, THIS
IS, AH,

1675
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,331
THIS IS
EMBARRASSING.

1676
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,909
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. DISNEY?

1677
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,534
YOU CAN CALL ME WALT.

1678
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:39,047
IT'S JUST THESE ARE HARD
TIMES, MR. MCCRUM, AND

01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:40,775

1680
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,317
THAT THEY ARE.

1681
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:47,980
IT'S JUST I HAVE ONE PAIR OF
SHOES, YOU SEE?

1682
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:52,574
AND THEY'RE
AT THE COBBLER RIGHT NOW,

1683
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,960
AND I HAVEN'T THE BUCK-FIFTY TO
GET EM BACK.

1684
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,783
NOT A
PROBLEM AT ALL, WALT.

1685
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,095
AS A
MATTER OF FACT,

1686
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,216
I LIVE JUST DOWN THE STREET
FROM THE COBBLER.

1687
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,704
HOW ABOUT THIS,

1688
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,240
I'LL DROP YOU OFF,

1689
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,422
RETRIEVE
YOUR SHOES,

1690
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:07,657
AND THEN I'LL
PICK YOU UP FOR THE MEETING.

1691
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:08,733
GOSH, MR. MCCRUMB.

1692
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,494
I'LL PAY YOU BACK, I
PROMISE.

1693
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,660
I MEAN, YOU CAN

1694
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:12,680
TAKE IT OUTTA MY SALARY FOR
THE PROJECT.

1695
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,671
NOT A
PROBLEM AT ALL, WALT.

1696
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,879
LET'S CONSIDER IT ONE GOOD
CHRISTIAN HELPING ANOTHER.

1697
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:21,270
THAT'S AWFUL NICE OF
YOU, MR. MCCRUMB.

1698
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:22,950
IT'S AWFUL
NICE.

1699
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:24,925
WELL, SHALL
WE?

1700
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:26,291
NARRATOR: WALT WAS
THRILLED TO HAVE A JOB OF

1701
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:27,352
ANY KIND,

1702
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,329
AND THIS ONE WENT
REALLY WELL

1703
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,933
.HE LIKED
WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN

1704
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,082
INVOLVED IN "TOMMY TUCKER'S
TOOTH".

1705
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,761
SURE THE PAY WASN'T
GREAT,

1706
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:36,760
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE A
GREAT PAYOFF, ANYWAY

1707
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,934
ON ACCOUNT OF IT WAS
EDUCATIONAL

1708
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,397
AND IT WOULD
HELP CHILDREN TO TAKE CARE

1709
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,946
OF THEIR TEETH.

1710
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:45,936
WALT FELT LIKE HE HAD DONE
SOMETHING GOOD,

1711
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:50,235
BUT NOBODY HAD BEEN
