6
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,878
I'm still having nightmares.

7
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,613
Well, you did just find out that
your brother killed your father.

8
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,982
So are you coming out tonight,
love?

9
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,852
I can't. Gotta get
to the airport.

10
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,754
You're flying away
from me already?

11
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,389
You have a safe one.

12
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,857
I will.

13
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,625
I'll call you when I get to LA.

14
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,094
All right. Miss you.

15
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,528
Okay.

16
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,765
Bye.

17
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,628
What is it that you are
trying to tell me?

18
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,504
Please speak to me.

19
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:29,508
Please speak to me so
that I can help you.

20
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,246
I will help you.

21
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,721
I will help you.

22
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,922
I will help you...

23
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,875
Hi, can you sign in please?

24
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,278
Thank you.

25
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,149
You can go ahead and
have a seat over there.

26
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,795
Hi.

27
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,002
I make movies.

28
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,909
I'm sure you do.

29
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,178
Do you wanna be in one?

30
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,148
"Hi, can you sign in please?"

31
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,816
Hi, you must be Tyler's sister?

32
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,152
Yes.

33
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,821
I'm Dr. Owen. Come with me.

34
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,399
Hi!

35
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,800
God...

36
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,382
I'm glad we found you.

37
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,452
Found me? I'm not
very hard to find.

38
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,954
Well, you're not listed
as the next of kin.

39
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,424
I wasn't?

40
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,226
No, his grandmother is.
Your grandmother?

41
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,865
No, she wasn't my grandmother.
Um. Tyler is my half brother.

42
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,203
Oh.

43
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:50,108
My uh, my Dad and I don't
really talk. Or we haven't in
like 7 or 8 years anyway.

44
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,179
Guess he assumed Tyler wouldn't
want to talk to me either.

45
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,447
Why would you think that?

46
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:59,050
That's my dad. It's
just how he was.

47
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,154
Okay. Well, Tyler is a ward of
the state right now

48
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,824
and I actually have him here
under observation.

49
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,958
You have him here?

50
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,259
Yes.

51
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,195
Really? How did
you manage that?

52
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,030
I have special privileges.

53
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,132
Can I see him?

54
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:18,002
Will Tyler remember you?

55
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,138
He's blind.

56
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,042
I know that. Obviously.

57
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,747
Well, we used to talk on the
phone every couple of months.
So...

58
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:33,752
When was the last time
you talked to Tyler?

59
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,754
I don't know, um,
I don't remember.

60
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,021
Look, I didn't fly
all the way out here

61
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,857
to talk about my family issues.

62
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,062
I need to know if it's true.

63
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:48,066
If what's true?
If what's true?

64
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,169
Did he do it?

65
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,339
Yes, he killed his parents.

66
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,180
Look, I'll ask you
again, let me see him.

67
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,188
I have to get written
authorization from the state.

68
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,924
That's bullshit.
I'm out here at your request!

69
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,193
I flew out here,
let me see him!

70
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:19,230
I'm sorry Holly, I can't
just do that yet.

71
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,006
Look, I have a friend of
a friend in the DA's office.

72
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,074
Let me see
what I can do for you.

73
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,096
Good afternoon Tyler.

74
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,867
Dr. Owen...

75
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,837
What are you doing there?

76
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,873
Keeping my mind busy.
Just like you said.

77
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,945
Who is this, in this picture?

78
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,384
Is this someone
you used to know?

79
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,387
Who?

80
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,558
Your drawing, it's of a woman.

81
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm not drawing anyone.

82
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,017
Ugh, creeper.

83
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,668
Geez.

84
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,675
Hey.

85
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:15,046
Hi. Did you make it in all
right? I hadn't heard from you
yet so I was a little worried.

86
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,916
Yah, I'm sorry I've
just been exhausted.

87
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,184
Did you see your brother?

88
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,388
No, not yet.
The head doctor in charge says

89
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,690
he has to get permission
from the DA's office

90
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,359
before Tyler can have any
visitors face-to-face.

91
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,928
Even you?

92
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,396
Yeah, even me.

93
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,332
So how long will that be?

94
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:38,002
I don't know, he said not too
long so hopefully like a day or
two.

95
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,205
I hope so. I mean, you can't
stay out there forever.

96
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,541
Yeah, well, I can't get any
broker than I already am.

97
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,710
I'll give you a call tomorrow
after I talk to him, okay?

98
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,111
Miss you.

99
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,413

Hello?

129
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,732
Hi Holly! Dr. Owen here.

130
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,802
Yeah. I know. Saved your number.

131
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,905
Ah, gotcha.

132
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,974
So I was wrapping up earlier
today when I got a call from the
DA's office...

133
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,676
Oh! Okay. What'd they say?

134
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:36,881
You can see Tyler. It has to be
supervised, but you can see him.

135
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,017
Supervised? Why?

136
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,954
He not dangerous. Not to me.

137
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,824
Sorry. Nothing like the police
or anything. I just have to be
there.

138
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,002
Well, I kinda figured you'd be
there anyway. What's the catch?

139
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,937
No catch. Nothin' at all.

140
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,906
I told you I had friends.

141
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,715
So anyway, if you wanna stop by
sometime tomorrow afternoon
that'd be great.

142
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,851
My schedule's pretty open after
that and I can let you see him.

143
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,786
Okay. Great.

144
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,625
Dick.

145
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,138
Tyler.

146
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,741
Yes, Dr. Owen.

147
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,743
Remember when I told you that I
had someone that wanted to see
you?

148
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,946
Yes.

149
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:45,749
They're here now.

150
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,485
I know.

151
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,020
I can feel someone
else in the room.

152
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,889
Do you know who it is?

153
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,959
I don't know.

154
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,094
It's your sister.

155
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,763
Dad said I didn't have a sister.

156
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,866
Well, you do...

157
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,534
Holly...

158
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,769
She's here now...

159
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,710
Hi Tyler.

160
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,184
Do you remember me?

161
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,653
We used to
talk when you were a little boy.

162
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,295
We talked about cartoons and
the little boy down the street
that you liked to play with.

163
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,931
How sad you were
when he moved away.

164
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,275
I remember you said you
liked to draw comics.

165
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:48,212
No I didn't. I never said that.

166
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:52,917
I didn't start to draw until
after I lost my eyesight.

167
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,885
I'm sorry.

168
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,221
You're just trying to
get my attention.

169
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,891
You don't have to lie.

170
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,961
I didn't know what else to do.

171
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,964
Dad was right.

172
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,332
About what?

173
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,835
About you.

174
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,805
You didn't give a shit about me
or Dad and that's why you left.

175
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,345
Tyler, I promise,
that's not why...

176
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:25,583
That's what dad
said you would say.

177
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,620
Say? What?

178
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,889
Whatever you thought
I wanted to hear.

179
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,629
I don't want to talk to you
anymore. Please leave.

180
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,001
I'm sorry.

181
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:45,102
Sure you are.

182
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,103
I just have a question.

183
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,204
What?

184
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,205
Why are you so damned defensive?

185
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,206
I bet you already know.

186
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,908
I don't know.

187
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,877
What?

188
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,081
You've been questioning my
motive since pretty much the
second I got off the plane.

189
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,782
What is it?

190
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,751
Come with me.

191
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,162
You're suspicious of me.

192
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,898
Why do you think that?

193
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,369
It's very simple. You questioned
my motive for being here.

194
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:23,040
As far as I know, you have not
spoken to your family or Tyler
for a number of years.

195
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,409
No, I haven't.

196
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,845
Have you been to
your parents' graves?

197
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,748
You mean my father's grave?
Sarah wasn't my mother.

198
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,650
Okay, have you been to
your father's grave?

199
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,784
No, I haven't.

200
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:35,185
Do you plan on visiting it?

201
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,055
I haven't decided yet.

202
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,190
Your father left you
out of the will.

203
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:44,128
Yeah, I'm well aware.

204
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,697
He also specified that
if Tyler was a minor

205
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,966
and in the event that
he and your Stepmother passed,

206
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,934
you would not have
any legal rights to him.

207
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,304
Yeah, I am not surprised.

208
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,675
Are you done?
Because this is masochistic.

209
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:01,145
Tyler is my only living
relative. I flew out here to
make sure he was okay.

210
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:02,680
Why is that so hard
to understand?

211
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,083
I suppose I should learn how.

212
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,087
Look if you're curious as to

213
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,922
why I'm not visiting
my fathers grave,

214
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,457
maybe you should try to
understand that I'm not ready

215
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,859
to make peace with him yet,

216
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,728
especially after he essentially
brainwashed Tyler

217
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,131
into feeling
the way he does about me.

218
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:25,369
Don't suppose I could see those?

219
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,237
That wasn't a question.

220
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,844
Interesting...

221
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,980
It's all the same woman.

222
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,423
You know, I've, umm,
I've seen this woman.

223
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:50,394
I'm not surprised. A lot of
people would recognize her if
they saw these.

224
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,397
No I mean, like, I've "seen
her", seen her. In person.

225
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,766
That's impossible.

226
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,868
Why is that impossible?

227
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,271
Because she's been
dead since 1947.

228
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:08,746
Whatever, I seen her plain as
day. She was kind of a bitch.

229
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,214
You really don't know
who this is?

230
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,381
No.

231
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,751
Elizabeth Short?

232
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,252
Is that supposed to ring a bell?

233
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,287
The Black Dahlia?

234
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,757
Dahlia's aren't black.

235
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,927
The Black Dahlia was a nickname
that the Los Angeles press

236
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,997
gave to a woman, Elizabeth
Short, after she was killed.

237
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,932
Mm-hmm.

238
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,202
You've really never
heard of this?

239
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:37,207
I don't know. Oh, wait,
wasn't it a movie?

240
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,310
Elizabeth Short was
an aspiring actress

241
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,514
from Massachusetts.

242
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:47,151
She had a reputation about her,
of messing with men,

243
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:50,120
essentially sleeping her way
to the top.

244
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,257
She started to run with the
wrong crowd, got herself killed.

245
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,926
Great...

246
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,394
So why would Tyler
be drawing her?

247
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,798
I don't know.

248
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,935
He's a kid I can't imagine he
knows anything about what you
just told me.

249
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:09,540
Maybe he saw a special about
her on TV and it left some sort
of subliminal impression on him?

250
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:14,378
I don't buy it.

251
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,513
Well, I'm leaving now.

252
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,549
Going back to New York already?

253
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,984
No. Just leaving the office.

254
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,988
Okay. Alright. Well, stay
in touch, now.

255
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,925
If you want to do this again
let me know, I'd be glad to let
you talk to him again.

256
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,326
Yeah, whatever.

257
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,396
Bitch.

258
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,126
Speak to me.

259
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,135
Speak to me.

260
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,080
WHAT?!

261
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,389
Speak to me,

262
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:09,326
tell me what you want...

263
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,427
Ugh, disgusting.

264
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:30,600
Did you know how to fire the gun
before you lost your sight?

265
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:37,541
I mean, I saw people on TV do
it. It didn't seem that hard.

266
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:41,311
How were you able to aim the
shotgun in the proper direction?

267
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:48,685
Well, they were talking.
They were saying
'Don't shoot, don't shoot'.

268
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,655
So you kind of got lucky?

269
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,857
In a sense, yes.

270
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,359
How did you find the shotgun?

271
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,829
I had a gut feeling
about it,

272
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,798
where it was.

273
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,369
So it wasn't like you were
guided by something, or someone?

274
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,507
I guess that was my feeling.

275
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,612
I want to talk to you about
something else before we finish
up.

276
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:20,517
What?

277
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,188
Your drawings. You've been blind
since you were 10 years old.

278
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,824
But you keep sketching things
that you couldn't possibly

279
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,495
have seen before then,

280
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:35,365
in particular, the woman that
keeps appearing in them.

281
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:39,202
It's one thing that you draw
your room...

282
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,906
... its another thing that you
draw someone who has been dead
for over 60 years.

283
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,614
Is this someone who you saw on
television before you lost your
sight?

284
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,349
The internet? A book?

285
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:57,287
I see her. Here with me.

286
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,857
In your room, this facility?

287
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,659
Yes,

288
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,664
she speaks to me.

289
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,900
What does she say to you?

290
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,736
To hurt the ones who hurt me.

291
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,571
Your father?

292
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:19,576
Yes.

293
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,547
Has she said anything else to
you? Maybe her name?

294
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,849
Yes,

295
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,753
her name is Elizabeth.

296
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,434
Sir, block three
and block four are down!

297
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,903
Get the hell out of there!

298
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,568
Shhhh...

299
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,705
There's no need to
dream anymore...

300
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,581
There's no need to
hide anymore...

301
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:57,987
To lie anymore...

302
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,863
To carry the guilt of your
father's touch anymore...

303
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:15,171
I will...free...you...

304
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,268
AHHHH!

305
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,007
OH GOD!

306
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,809
NO!

307
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:42,025
AHHHHH!

308
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,261
Good evening, Betty.

309
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,004
Look at me.

310
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,278
You don't look so good.

311
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,016
I'm not.

312
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,952
I know what you did.

313
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:47,624
Got no money for no
back alley butcher.

314
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:51,761
What are you gonna do, you know?

315
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,930
At least I didn't
get a black eye.

316
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:57,667
Don't tell them you love them.
Don't do that.

317
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:04,407
You didn't have to do it.
Not by yourself.

318
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:08,711
Not like that.

319
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,250
You could have helped? How?

320
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:17,320
I know a guy.

321
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,789
Yeah? You're lucky.

322
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:23,226
He helps girls in
this situation.

323
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,200
You know how it is,
Norma Jeane.

324
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,870
They think they can do anything
they want to you,

325
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,773
and even if you try to say
something, you disappear.

326
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:13,009
Jenson? Jenson...

327
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:30,039
Good boy.

328
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:39,548
What is this place?

329
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,051
You don't feel it all around?

330
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:46,455
Something cold.
Something familiar.

331
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,330
This is where he
disposes of everything.

332
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,632
My dress,

333
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:00,069
the knives he used on me,

334
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:03,072
my blood.

335
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,210
You could almost call this home.

336
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:11,681
I don't understand.
What are you doing to me?

337
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,419
You don't know?

338
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:18,721
No!

339
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:21,490
Just like with your brother,

340
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:26,128
I'm gonna help you hurt the ones
who hurt you.

341
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,665
My father's the only one who
hurt me, now he's dead.

342
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,970
You haven't told me
thank you yet.

343
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,671
You didn't pull the trigger.

344
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,506
I helped him pull the trigger.

345
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,109
Did you help him
kill his mother too?

346
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:43,546
She had contempt.
For both of you.

347
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,581
You're sick!

348
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:49,251
No, I'm smart.

349
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:50,486
You said someone else
is planning to hurt me?

350
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,487
Yeah.

351
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:57,393
You really are blind. And I
thought it was just your
brother...

352
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:55,084
"911 emergency.
Do you require assistance?"

353
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,186
My name is Malcolm Gonzales.

354
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,421
And I would like to
report a murder

355
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:02,324
that I am about to commit.

356
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:06,395
The dead speak to me and
they tell me what to do.

357
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:15,071
I am going to put the phone
down now, so that you can find
me and that you can stop me.

358
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm leaving.

359
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,235
Okay.

360
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,504
Do you need anything
before I go?

361
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:53,509
No, I think I got this.

362
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,277
Okay, goodnight.

363
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,736
I'm not the one
you're looking for.

364
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:36,805
I knew you were coming.

365
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:39,008
How did you know?

366
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,911
I have a gift. So do you.

367
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,813
You see things.

368
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:48,550
Yes.

369
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,552
Looking for this?

370
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,426
How did you get in here?

371
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:01,030
Your door was unlocked.

372
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,435
I take it there are
no objections?

373
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,841
You really need to find
someone to talk to.

374
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,843
Maybe.

375
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,349
So what would you
like to talk about?

376
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,518
I don't know, what would
you like to talk about?

377
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,326
I still hear the voices

378
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:34,530
inside of my head.

379
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:36,765
And I've done everything
that I can do

380
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:41,770
to get rid of them.

381
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:46,775
But it looks like now there's
just one more thing to do.

382
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:51,780
But I'll be free...

383
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:55,617
...and so will you.

384
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:17,005
Really nice makeup job.
Original.

385
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,652
You don't like being touched.

386
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:33,021
I don't like men touching me.
Stop.

387
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,058
Why is that?

388
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,596
I don't know. You're the doctor
why don't you give me a
diagnosis?

389
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:44,700
Someone made you not
like to touched.

390
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:52,674
Someone hurt you...when
you were a child.

391
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,943
Please move away from me now.

392
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,079
Why?

393
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,180
You know why.

394
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:02,184
I'm not touching you.

395
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:06,688
It feels like you are.

396
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:15,431
I see you in there.

397
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,003
It's been so, so long.

398
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,839
But I always knew

399
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,708
that I would see you again.

400
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,488
Hello?

401
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,958
I see, I'll be right there.

402
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,164
Tyler's escaped.

403
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,101
I suggest you come with me.

404
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:14,156
Ma'am.

405
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:17,025
Tyler's gone.

406
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,862
Holly?

407
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:24,233
Holly?!

408
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:29,137
Are you still in there?

409
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,056
That's why I don't mind
coming here, good coffee.

410
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,691
Hm?

411
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,693
No thanks.

412
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,630
Don't know what
you're missing...

413
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,203
So you're Tyler's sister?
Didn't know he had one.

414
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,310
Sorry to hear about what
he did to your parents.

415
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:13,148
We worked the case. I actually
connected Tyler with Dr. Owen.

416
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,220
It's a shame, he seemed
like a good kid.

417
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,089
Yeah, he did.

418
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:23,725

431
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:27,282
You got me all tied up.

432
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,751
I'm ready.

433
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,291

What are you WAITING for?!?!

439
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,734
Welcome back, Elizabeth.

440
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:26,908
You still don't know
who I am, do you?

441
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,112
UGH!

442
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:37,018
AHHHH!

443
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,186
Do it again!

444
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:39,521
HA HA HA!

445
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,429
You spoke to me.

446
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,098
I was just a child.

447
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,904
I never asked for any of this.

448
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,145
I couldn't help who
my grandfather was.

449
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:25,267
HA HA HA HA HA!

450
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:29,838
Steven Cordell...
my Grandfather...

451
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,476
The man who took your life...

452
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:41,416
That was never me...

453
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,341
I love you. She won't
follow us anymore...

454
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,492
Harder...

455
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:44,613
Oh god...OH GOD...

456
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:48,984
Oooh God...oh God...

457
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,432
MMF!

458
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:06,368
Ha ha!

459
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,010
What?

460
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,913
I can feel her.

461
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,481
Elizabeth.

462
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,089
I feel her inside of me...

463
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,560
Screaming...

464
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:36,965
She tells me...

465
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:41,002
To hurt the ones that hurt me...

466
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,672
Just like she did with Tyler.

467
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:46,942
AHHHHHH!!

468
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,711
OH MY FACE!!

469
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:51,546
Our father raped us,

470
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,582
just like your grandfather did
with Elizabeth.

471
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:59,554
She and I...

472
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:03,158
We're just like any other girl.

473
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,028
Deep down inside...

474
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:11,032
We can't get enough of the
bad things you do to us.

475
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,612
She wants you.

476
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:29,084
I want you.

477
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,620
Forever.

478
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:35,590
UGH!

479
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:56,544
Again.

480
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:58,213
UGH!

481
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:00,548
Ha ha ha ha.

482
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,750
Yeah!

483
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:02,751
I like it, come on.

484
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:03,752
COME ON!

485
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:07,655
OH!

486
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:15,030
Is that all you got? Come on
you weak son of a bitch, give it
to me.

487
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:16,031
GIVE IT TO ME!

488
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:19,267
Come on! Please.

489
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,437
You can't get it up! You wanted
to touch me! You got me right
now!

490
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:39,287
Come on you son of a bitch.
Do it!

491
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,322
Fuck...my...face!

492
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:43,058
DO IT!

493
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,493
Fuck...fuck me...GO!

494
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,796
FUCK!

495
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:51,733
Come on! Come on! Do it!

496
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:55,804
Ohhh. AHHHHH!!!

497
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,076
DO IT!

498
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,144
Elizabeth wanted me
to tell you something.

499
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,713
Elizabeth wanted me to tell you

500
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:08,283
that you remind her
of someone.

501
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:12,754
That you remind her
of your GRANDFATHER.

502
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,726
All backed up...and
you still can't cum.

503
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,863
HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

504
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:30,772
