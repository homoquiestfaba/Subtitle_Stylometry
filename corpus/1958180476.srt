1
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:10,358
- [Announcer] Tonight's
film is a dramatization

2
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,652
based on published
accounts, police reports,

3
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:15,322
personal interviews
and court documents.

4
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:17,032
Composite characters
have been used

5
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:18,575
and names have been changed.

6
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,454
- [Wayne] So she takes
us into the bedroom,

7
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,664
which is where she
says it happened.

8
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:27,417
Then she opens up this
drawer and inside...

9
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,254
- [Mathew] What, come
on, whips and chains?

10
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:32,505
- [Wayne] Whips and chains?

11
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,132
Hey, Matthew, wanna step
into the 20th century?

12
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:35,425
- [Oscar] Come on, deal
me some cards I can use.

13
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,926
- [John] Hang on, not
just whips and chains,

14
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:39,096
we're talking
hi-tech stuff here.

15
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:41,056
(men laughing)
Stainless steel, leather.

16
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:43,183
- [Mathew] What leather?
- [John] Leather.

17
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:45,560
- [Wayne] Wait now,
wait, wait, wait,

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,104
then she says,

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,397
"Officer, please let me
show you how it happened."

20
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,317
And she begins to lay
this stuff out on the bed.

21
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,236
(men laughing)

22
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:55,278
- [John] It happens to
me every time, you know.

23
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,529
- [Mathew] Come on.

24
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,572
- I swear, that's
how it happened.

25
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:58,615
- Yeah, you swear.

26
00:00:58,615 --> 00:00:59,907
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, bud.

27
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:01,201
- Hey, Tommy, how
you doing, buddy?

28
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,328
Hey, um, you wanna sit
in a couple of hands?

29
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:04,246
- Sure.

30
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:05,330
- Did you bring your money?

31
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:07,707
- Well, you better
give it to your dad

32
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,708
because he's gonna
be needing it.

33
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,293
- Look at that who says?

34
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,794
You all ready for bed?

35
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,046
- Haven't brushed my teeth yet.

36
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,297
- You haven't
brushed your teeth?

37
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:15,673
You go up and brush your
teeth, I'll be right up.

38
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:16,674
- All right.

39
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:22,139
- Boy, he is growing
up, isn't he?

40
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,808
- Yeah, but wait, I
wanna get this straight.

41
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:28,270
So wait, she's gonna
chain herself to the bed

42
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,854
to help recreate the crime?

43
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,481
- Oh, yeah, very
helpful witness.

44
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,565
Let's make it a dollar.

45
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,483
- He's buying it.

46
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:34,692
- Wait, so, so what'd you do?

47
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,361
I mean, you couldn't
let her, right?

48
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,364
- Well, it was a crime
scene, crime reenactment.

49
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:40,198
Got to have pictures.

50
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:44,327
- That's right.
(men laughing)

51
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,662
- I'm gonna see this pictures.

52
00:01:45,662 --> 00:01:46,746
- Where are these pictures?

53
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,290
- Held in strictest confidence,

54
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,084
very much like my hand
here, the bet's a dollar.

55
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,670
(men laughing)

56
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,674
- I'm gonna fold, but
I'll be right back.

57
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,468
- [Oscar] Folding, folding,
well, I'm gonna bet a dollar.

58
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,931
(dogs howling)

59
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,229
- Remember when you
used to be afraid

60
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,730
of those old wild foxes?

61
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,233
- I'm not afraid anymore,
they're just like dogs.

62
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,151
- Just like dogs.

63
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:21,489
Good night, big boy.
- Good night, Dad.

64
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,324
- Sweet dreams.

65
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:28,371
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:33,960
What's that music?

67
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:38,965
You know I do not allow that
kind of music in this house.

68
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:40,508
How do you open this?
- Dad...

69
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:41,759
- I don't know what kind of
music you're talking about.

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,346
- You know exactly what
kind I'm talking about.

71
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:53,480
- Full boat, aces and nines.
(glass bottle shatters)

72
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,524
(men laughing)
- Can't take you anywhere.

73
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,442
- Hey, hon!

74
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:01,654
Honey, would you bring
a sponge or something?

75
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,199
- What, are you boys to
the spilled drink stage...

76
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,659
Oh..
(man laughing)

77
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,496
- I finally won a hand and
I got a little excited.

78
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,830
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

79
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,794
- All right, the name of the
game is "Follow the Queen."

80
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,296
- [Oscar] I don't know it.

81
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:22,050
- Seven card stud, the next
card up after a queen is wild.

82
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,926
- So the wild card could change?

83
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,262
- [Wayne] Almost certainly will.

84
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,222
Follow the queens,
gentlemen, follow the queens.

85
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:30,225
Ladies control our
fate in this game.

86
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:31,893
In that respect,
a lot like life.

87
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,065
- [Mathew] You drive safe now.

88
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,358
I'll see you next week.

89
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:39,734
Night.
- [Oscar] Adios.

90
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,361
- [Wayne] He enjoyed
it, thank you.

91
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,820
- It was fun buddy.
- Good night, Roberta.

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,781
- [Mathew] You take him home.
- Y'all drive carefully

93
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:47,325
- No stops along the way.

94
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:52,330
(Roberta laughing)
(brooding music)

95
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:58,128
(car engine starts)
(tense music)

96
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,110
♪ I am weak but
now I am strong ♪

97
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,948
♪ We must be the come along

98
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:30,910
♪ I'll be satisfied as long

99
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,246
♪ As I walk

100
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,171
- [Man] Praise the Lord.

101
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,049
- [Man] Praise Jesus.

102
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:52,890
- In closing, I'm
going to use a word

103
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,354
that you probably thought you'd
never hear from this pulpit.

104
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:00,732
That word is, clairvoyance.

105
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,860
But I don't mean it
like the pagans do.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,446
Like the UFO-riding,
crystal-squeezing,
aroma-sniffing

107
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,574
New Agers, oh, no,
(congregants laughing)

108
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:12,494
I mean just what the word says.

109
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:13,370
Clear sight.

110
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:19,042
The power to see clearly
what's all around you.

111
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,628
The Christ-like power of vision.

112
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:27,050
The vision to penetrate the
mist and fog of deception

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,262
and see the landscape on
which the devil himself walks.

114
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:36,351
Everyone of us is a landscape
on which Satan prowls,

115
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,728
looking for an advantage,

116
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:42,732
a weak moment, to reach out
from his mist of concealment

117
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,859
and put his claw
on your shoulder.

118
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,445
Don't deny it.

119
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,573
We all feel the
presence of evil.

120
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:55,412
Walking behind us, evil.

121
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,372
Reaching out to touch us, evil.

122
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:02,960
We turn around, are
you ready to face it?

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,630
Clear sight is
your only defense.

124
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:11,928
In Jesus name, let us have
clear sight of the Devil.

125
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:18,060
Now people of God, come
to his altar and pray.

126
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:22,647
Pray for the power to see.

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,738
(congregants chattering)

128
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,952
(baby crying)

129
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,209
As it says in Ephesians 6:10,

130
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,295
put on the whole armor of God.

131
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,922
It will protect you against
the devil's schemes.

132
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,053
Through your faith,
you will gain power.

133
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,555
Through your prayers
you will gain courage.

134
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,518
(birds chirping)

135
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:04,606
(car engine revving)

136
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:05,982
- Hey, Stevie.

137
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:07,109
- [Steve] Hi.

138
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,236
- That didn't take long.

139
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,947
- [Steve] All's it needed
was a couple new hoses.

140
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,616
- Hey, Laura!

141
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:15,825
Honey, your car's back.

142
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,829
- So, who was the big
winner Saturday night?

143
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,625
- Yeah, your pal Riverboat
Wayne, cleaned us all out.

144
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,459
- Figures.

145
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,004
- Laura!

146
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,632
Mr. Sweetzer brought
your car back.

147
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,717
Come on down here, be
polite and thank him.

148
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,889
Don't know what gets into
these girls sometimes.

149
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,681
Laura!

150
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:41,851
Get yourself out here right now!

151
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,395
- Leave her alone,
she's not even dressed.

152
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,938
- Well, then she can
get herself dressed.

153
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:47,274
- What?
- Outside,

154
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,941
thank Mr. Sweetzer
for fixing your car.

155
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,817
- Dad, I'm...

156
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:50,652
- Hey, get.

157
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,281
It's good manners.

158
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,575
- Thank you, Mr. Sweetzer.

159
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:58,743
I hope it wasn't
too much trouble.

160
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:01,246
- Oh, no trouble, just
a couple of hoses.

161
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,415
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

162
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,085
- You need a ride into town?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,712
- Mount up.
- All right.

164
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,963
(women cheering)

165
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:13,341
- Keep going, keep going, yay!

166
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,093
- Now that felt good, didn't it?

167
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:17,012
God, gave us a voice.

168
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,388
We should use it.

169
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:21,224
Use your voice to say, I matter.

170
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,227
Use your voice to say,
I'm a valuable person.

171
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:27,105
Use your voice to
tell the truth.

172
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:30,275
God makes us a
weapon of his truth

173
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:33,153
and he wants us to
use that weapon.

174
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:37,199
Today, tonight, tomorrow, till
that bus comes back for us,

175
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,034
we're a sisterhood.

176
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:42,329
No one will tell us to
behave like young ladies

177
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:43,580
and be quiet.

178
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,874
We will say what we
know and say it loud.

179
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:50,712
(women clapping and cheering)

180
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,050
- Hey
(dog barking)

181
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
- Hi.

182
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,850
- Rebecca make it off
to the retreat okay?

183
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,684
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,396
- I'm almost
relieved she's gone.

185
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:09,981
Isn't that an
awful thing to say.

186
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:12,359
- What's wrong?

187
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:17,572
- Am I spoiling Thomas?
(Roberta scoffs)

188
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:19,366
- No, I don't think so, honey.

189
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:23,286
- It's just I don't want to
make the same mistakes with him

190
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:24,537
that I made with the
girls, that's all.

191
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:27,790
- You two have a
special closeness.

192
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,043
It's wonderful to see.

193
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,378
- Yeah, but the
girls are jealous.

194
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,714
The awful thing is
probably they're right.

195
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,508
I don't feel as
close to the girls.

196
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,596
Why can't I be
affectionate with them?

197
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:44,057
Wanna be.

198
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,019
- Well, now, don't you
think that it's normal

199
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,396
for them to compete
for your attention?

200
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:51,106
- Yeah, normal for
them, maybe, you know,

201
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,315
but what's wrong with me?

202
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,401
I mean, I have a hard
time hugging them.

203
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:57,612
I mean, I can't even tell
them that I love them.

204
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:01,283
I just know it's not normal.

205
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:07,747
(dog barking)
(birds chirping)

206
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,332
- You know, if you're
really concerned about this,

207
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:13,378
I think that maybe you
should talk to Pastor Ralph.

208
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,588
- Yeah, maybe I will.

209
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,469
- It was her
brother, not Trisha,

210
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:23,555
who really wanted to go skiing.

211
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:25,682
And it was her
brother, not Trisha,

212
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:28,685
who said the trail
was safe to go down.

213
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:32,022
But when the rescuers
found them in the snow,

214
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:35,025
one of them dead and one alive,

215
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:39,196
it was Trisha who felt
responsible, who felt guilty.

216
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:44,242
Only here, with our love,

217
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:47,579
she has begun to open up
and talk about her pain.

218
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:53,918
Now, she needs a different
kind of avalanche.

219
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,877
She needs us.

220
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,632
(brooding music)

221
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:20,778
(brooding music)
(water burbling)

222
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:37,587
(dog barking)
(bus engine revving)

223
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,551
(brooding music)

224
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:52,810
- Rebecca?

225
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,648
You're so full of
hurt and anger.

226
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,030
What is wrong, Rebecca?
- My father.

227
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,408
- What about your father?

228
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,661
- He did terrible things to me.

229
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,668
- It's okay, okay.

230
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,465
- You have to tell mom.
- No.

231
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:23,591
- Please, Rebecca.

232
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,136
- Mom can't fix this.

233
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:29,222
(car engine revving)

234
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,728
(children singing)

235
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,611
- You kids stay in
your seats, okay?

236
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,529
Just for a minute.

237
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,494
Excuse me, may I help you?

238
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:55,832
You're from the
church, aren't you?

239
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:57,709
Hi, I've seen you there.

240
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,544
- My name is Gerry,
Mrs. Bradshaw.

241
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:02,214
And your daughters are
coming to live with me.

242
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,048
- What?

243
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,052
- Rebecca?

244
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,428
Rebecca, what is
she talking about?

245
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:09,971
You're not leaving.

246
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,306
- Yes, I am, we both are.

247
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:12,182
- Why?

248
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,642
Laura, why?

249
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:18,646
- Rebecca, please,
you have to tell her.

250
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:21,191
- You don't have
to say anything.

251
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,276
- No, I want her to know.

252
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,697
(birds chirping)

253
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:32,244
(brooding music)

254
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,505
(car engine starts)

255
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:48,510
- [Girl] Mom, let's go.
(car engine revving)

256
00:13:57,894 --> 00:14:00,938
(car engine revving)

257
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:10,323
(tires screeching)

258
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:21,293
- Matt.
- Sheriff, how you doing?

259
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,752
- I could be better, I guess.

260
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,047
You know Detective
Messenger, right?

261
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:27,215
- Yeah, hey, Carl, what's up?

262
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,466
- Matt, we got a problem.

263
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,428
There are accusations
against you.

264
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,014
- Accusations?

265
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,557
What kind of accusations?

266
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:38,185
- Let me have your
weapon and badge, Matt.

267
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,978
(brooding music)

268
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,699
- Am I being arrested?

269
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,368
- You have the right
to remain silent.

270
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:56,661
You have the right to
have an attorney present

271
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,870
during all questioning.

272
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,249
- Hey, Carl, I don't
need an attorney, okay?

273
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,793
If I can't talk to you
guys, who can I talk to?

274
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,383
- Rebecca said you'd come
home from the late shift,

275
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:15,013
go into a room, wake her up.

276
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:16,973
- No.

277
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,435
- Well, this is what
she's telling us, Matt.

278
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:21,686
We're not making this up.

279
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,731
- You pull her sweatpants
down and have sex with her

280
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:25,940
in her own bed?

281
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,774
- No.

282
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,652
- She said this went
on for three years.

283
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:30,612
- No.

284
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,821
- But no, you didn't do it?

285
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,323
No, your daughter
is a liar, what?

286
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,075
She's just lying her head
off about this or what?

287
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,284
- No.

288
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:37,202
My girls are good girls.

289
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,953
They're Christian girls.

290
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,372
They wouldn't lie about this.

291
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,547
It's true I haven't
been very close to them,

292
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:52,050
emotionally, I mean.

293
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,051
- Why is that, Matt?

294
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:00,767
- I don't know.

295
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,980
But guys I did not do this.

296
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,277
- Then why is she
telling us these things?

297
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,286
(car hooting)
(siren blaring)

298
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,995
- Sheriff, sheriff.
- Hello, Rollie.

299
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,997
- I heard you guys are
sweating a sex-crime suspect.

300
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,416
Somebody from the
ranks, is that right?

301
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,002
- Yeah, you know
Matthew Bradshaw?

302
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:29,296
- Matthew Bradshaw,
Republican County Chairman.

303
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,006
The guy that ran for State
Assembly a few years ago,

304
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,840
he's your suspect?
- Yes.

305
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,883
- (laughing) Oh, boy.

306
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:37,679
- Don't start off in the wrong
direction on this, Rollie.

307
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,513
This isn't political.

308
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:39,722
- How do you know?

309
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:41,308
- Because I know who's
making the charges.

310
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,810
- Yeah, who?

311
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,653
- Matthew,

312
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,865
had you rather I
come back later?

313
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:00,327
- No, I'm just
tired, that's all.

314
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,120
My guts ache.

315
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,710
- I pray that I can
bring you some comfort.

316
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,544
Some certainty.

317
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,964
- I've wanted to come and
see you for a while now,

318
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,882
and talk about my kids.

319
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,594
How I seem to be

320
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,140
two fathers sometimes.

321
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,893
Yeah, I was gonna
come see you today.

322
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:30,690
- Matthew,

323
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,862
tell me more about
having an evil side.

324
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,992
- Well, I'm not sure it's there.

325
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:43,745
I just said I
thought it could be.

326
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:49,709
You know, like you
said, Satan in the fog.

327
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,466
- You have started on a
righteous journey, my friend.

328
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,052
Salvation awaits the penitent.

329
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:02,764
- I know, but wouldn't it
be a sin to confess falsely?

330
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,561
I mean, see, I don't remember
doing any of the things

331
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:10,105
that they say.

332
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:13,275
- Trust God, he won't permit
you to remember anything

333
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,234
that didn't happen.

334
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,911
- So, what did the
Reverend tell you, Matt?

335
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:29,666
- He said I was on the
path to righteousness,

336
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,251
and that I could find the truth.

337
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,048
- So, it can't hurt
to confess, right?

338
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,426
I mean, once you
start down that road,

339
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:40,968
memories often come back.

340
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,431
- I've seen it
happen lots of times.

341
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,975
- You want to confess, Matt,
I can hear it in your voice.

342
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,769
You wanna come clean before God.

343
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:51,063
- I wanna know the truth,

344
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,648
before God, I do.

345
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:54,774
- So confess.

346
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,402
Those memories will come back.

347
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,199
(Matthew scoffs)

348
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,325
- Yeah, but I don't...

349
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,456
All right, I'll try it.

350
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,171
- So what happened?

351
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,467
You're coming off your shift...

352
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,014
- Yeah, and I would have...

353
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,183
And I would have gone home

354
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:29,976
and maybe gone in the
kitchen, had a beer or two.

355
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,778
And then her room.

356
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,157
- Go on, Matt, that's the way.

357
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,453
- I would have gone in there,

358
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,250
and the girls were sharing
the same room then.

359
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,004
Laura's on the top bunk,
Rebecca's on the bottom.

360
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:03,926
And she'd be wearing
those yellow sweatpants,

361
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:08,556
'cause she always wore those.
(siren blaring)

362
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,391
And then,

363
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,813
I guess I would have
pulled them down.

364
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:21,819
- Keep going.

365
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:28,076
- And, uh, and I'd say, "Shhh,"

366
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,077
you know, "Quiet."

367
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,871
You know, like that.

368
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,127
And then, I guess,

369
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:39,629
I would have,

370
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:43,925
you know,

371
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,350
that's how I would have done it.

372
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,478
- I mean, I'd hate to go
to trial with all this,

373
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,065
you know, vague stuff
we're getting now.

374
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:00,108
"I could have,"
or "I would have,"

375
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,778
I'll tell you something,
we'll get there.

376
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,075
I mean, the things he did, man.

377
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:13,038
- Carl, are you okay with this?

378
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,914
- Yeah, I'm all right.

379
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,708
Just hate to think about
that sweet little girl

380
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,002
all the way up
there in that house.

381
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,212
(tires screeching)

382
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,963
I mean, this guy,
he's one of us.

383
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,216
- I'll tell you what, any
feelings of brotherhood

384
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,260
that I have with Matthew
Bradshaw just went up in smoke.

385
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,595
It turns out the
other daughter, Laura,

386
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,139
recently wrote a
letter to her teacher

387
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:33,350
explaining why she's
been failing in school.

388
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:35,727
This is wicked stuff.

389
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,314
- My God in heaven.

390
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,860
- "A lot of men would come
over and play poker with my dad

391
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,153
and they would all get drunk.

392
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,696
And one or two at a time
would come into my room

393
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,198
and have sex with me.

394
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:51,576
In and out of my room all
night, laughing and cursing."

395
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,827
- Oh.

396
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,162
- Now who went to
those poker parties?

397
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,413
- Well, you know who.

398
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:56,664
Guys from the department.

399
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:58,291
Stan, you were there
a couple a times.

400
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,792
- Yeah, and if I'd
seen anything like that

401
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,419
I would have known what to do.

402
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,879
- The guys who did this
are still out there.

403
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,797
They're armed and they know
they need to cover their tracks.

404
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:05,715
Why are you protecting them?

405
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:06,924
- You know, it's bad enough

406
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,386
that your girls were
living in shame,

407
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:11,513
possibly at the
risk for suicide.

408
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,681
Now they're living in
fear at risk for murder.

409
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:15,725
- Oh, Jesus, help me.

410
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,977
- Now tell us who they are!
- Please.

411
00:22:17,977 --> 00:22:19,687
- What kind of
father are you, huh?

412
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:20,772
What kind of cop are you?

413
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,857
What kind of Christian are you?

414
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:24,609
- Please help, Jesus.

415
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,610
Jesus, please help me.

416
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,861
Help me see it!

417
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,530
- Yeah, you want
to confess, Matt.

418
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,781
I know you wanna confess..

419
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,033
- Jesus, please
help me remember.

420
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,326
- And God's giving you
the tools to do this.

421
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:34,952
- Help me remember.

422
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,665
Help me, help me, help me,
help me, help me, help me!

423
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:41,209
(door knocks)

424
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,632
- Come on in, Dr. Kelson.

425
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:51,303
- Where are we, Stanley?

426
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,679
- Uncharted waters.

427
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,434
- Help me, Lord, help me.

428
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:58,560
- Hello, Matt.

429
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,438
I'm Doctor Kelson.

430
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,565
I'm a psychologist.

431
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,859
The Sheriff's office
has asked me to join in

432
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,403
to try and help you.

433
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:17,745
- [Dr. Kelson] One of the things
that would help you, Matt,

434
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:20,415
- You know, I just can't see
Matt Bradshaw doing that,

435
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,084
not to his own daughters.

436
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,751
- Well, anything's
possible, right, Wayne?

437
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:26,379
You used to work sex
crimes before you retired.

438
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,630
- Three years.

439
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,467
It's a very weird
world out there.

440
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,760
- Didn't Rebecca Bradshaw
once file a rape complaint

441
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,179
against a neighbor?

442
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,763
- Actually, it was, um, Laura.

443
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:38,725
It wasn't until later that
Rebecca said he raped her too.

444
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,310
- Just a cry for
attention, if you ask me.

445
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,979
- I was the investigating
officer on the one charge,

446
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,939
which they eventually dropped.

447
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:46,483
There was a--
- Hey, Stan.

448
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:47,734
- Hey, you guys.

449
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:48,985
- We were just talking
about your case, bud.

450
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:50,403
- Really?

451
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:52,197
That's why I'm here.

452
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,115
We were hoping you and Steve

453
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:54,407
might have a little time for us.

454
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,327
Just a little
background on Matt.

455
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:58,661
- Well, now?
- Yeah.

456
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,205
- I gotta get back
to the motor pool.

457
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,499
- That's all right, Steve,
we'll square it with them.

458
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,627
- Sure.

459
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:11,341
- That's great.

460
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:12,634
- Thanks, Rollie.
- Yeah.

461
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,722
(brooding music)

462
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:25,813
- There's a parade
and nobody told me.

463
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:27,440
- Wayne Everett,
Stephen Sweetzer,

464
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,610
you are each charged with
one count of statutory rape.

465
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,444
- What?

466
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:33,863
Who made the charge?

467
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,615
- Not the Bradshaw girls?

468
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:38,076
- No, Matt Bradshaw.
- What?

469
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,786
- You have the right
to remain silent.

470
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:41,288
If you give up that right,

471
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,666
anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

472
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,251
You have the right to
have an attorney present

473
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:51,298
during all questioning.
(brooding music)

474
00:24:56,469 --> 00:25:00,223
- Um, I hardly know
Laura Bradshaw.

475
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:04,769
I fixed her car a
couple a times, but I...

476
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:07,230
He said I raped her?

477
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,232
- You raped her and
then you took pictures

478
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,318
while Wayne Everett and
Matt took their turns.

479
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:12,277
- Bull!

480
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,446
Bull, I did not do that.

481
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:17,990
Show me the pictures.

482
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,660
(phone ringing)

483
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,331
- You'll see them soon enough.

484
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:32,672
- I need for you to say
you understand your rights

485
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,216
as I have recited them.

486
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:37,177
- In other words, you need to
cover your ass, right, Carl?

487
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:41,181
- Look, Wayne, you and I have
had our personal differences,

488
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,265
but this is not about--

489
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,476
- I understand the Miranda.

490
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,186
Now what is this about?

491
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:48,438
- This is about what you
were doing to yourself

492
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:51,316
in front of Laura Bradshaw
while Steve Sweetzer raped her.

493
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,151
- No way.

494
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,572
- Ah, Wayne, you
worked sex crimes.

495
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,699
Hell, you helped set up
safe procedures for victims

496
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:00,908
in this county.

497
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:02,077
Yet you seem to be
doing the same thing

498
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,953
every pedophile does, deny it.

499
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,122
Now, come on.

500
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,833
- Give me a lie detector,
let's settle it.

501
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,046
- How do you feel right now?

502
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:14,172
- Scared!

503
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:17,175
I mean, I know how
this works, Bub.

504
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,469
Even an ex-cop charged
is a cop guilty.

505
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,513
You've already
ruined my reputation.

506
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:34,192
Okay, if I did, I
deserve it, but I--

507
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,319
- So, it's possible
you did do it then.

508
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,283
- I'd have to be a
pretty sick psychotic

509
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:43,951
not to remember something
as bad as that, wouldn't I?

510
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:47,997
You lock me up or you give
me that lie detector now.

511
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:52,294
- Sorry, Wayne, door number one.

512
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,962
(phone ringing)

513
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,762
(motorcycle revving)

514
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:13,523
- Okay, you can come in.

515
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:23,033
(footsteps approaching)
(phone ringing)

516
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:25,327
- Hi, Laura.

517
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,494
This is Freda Gibbons,

518
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:28,330
she's with the Clarkwell
Police Department.

519
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,998
She's gonna be joining
this investigation.

520
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:33,168
Since your dad's a
sheriff's deputy,

521
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,878
of course, we wanna be open
and fair about everything.

522
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:39,341
- Laura, if you want to stop
or take a break anytime,

523
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,508
you just say so.

524
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:41,676
That's your right.

525
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:43,678
And you can have your advocate,

526
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:46,598
your friend Gerry here,
with you all the time, okay?

527
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,312
You should know that
your father admitted

528
00:27:52,312 --> 00:27:55,398
that he and his friends raped
you during the poker games.

529
00:27:59,111 --> 00:27:59,944
That's right.

530
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,074
But now Rebecca was
sleeping in the same room

531
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:05,450
part of this time, right?

532
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,161
- Bottom bunk.

533
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,914
- But Rebecca never
said anything about rape

534
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:13,250
during poker games.

535
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,461
Laura, I was in the room.

536
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,088
It's really not very big.

537
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:22,300
How could your sister not
have heard these things?

538
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,142
- Laura,

539
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,313
we're gonna lay out
some photos for you.

540
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,358
And I want you to see
if you can find the men

541
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:39,859
who did those things to you.

542
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:51,246
(siren blaring in the distance)

543
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:54,291
(motorcycle revving)

544
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:58,211
Are you sure?

545
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:08,888
- Yes, I remember
those poker parties.

546
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:12,684
They used to come in
and rape me in there.

547
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:18,690
One of them would come in
first, Everett or Sweetzer,

548
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,607
usually Everett.

549
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,236
- Rebecca, wasn't Laura
sleeping on the top bunk

550
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:24,487
for some of those years?

551
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,448
In the same room?

552
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,282
- Yes.

553
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,368
- Well, she doesn't
remember you being raped.

554
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,954
- Maybe,

555
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:40,253
mother told her to keep quiet.

556
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:41,963
- Your mother?

557
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,383
Your mother was in the
room when this happened?

558
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,763
- Usually she'd just
get me ready, and leave.

559
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:51,598
- Get you ready?

560
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,437
- You know, ready.

561
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:01,566
- But you never mentioned
your mother before.

562
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:05,362
Or the poker games or
anyone but your father.

563
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:07,530
- These things don't always
come out in one dose,

564
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,365
you know that.

565
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:12,327
The memory of a victim
is not like a videotape.

566
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,161
- Yes.

567
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:15,913
Go on, Rebecca.

568
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:23,296
- So what's gonna happen now?

569
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:29,552
Is my father gonna lose
his job over this, huh?

570
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:32,014
- At least,

571
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:38,520
- Rebecca, you know these
are very serious charges.

572
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,693
- Sure, I know that.

573
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:49,072
- And what about little Thomas?

574
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:49,864
Is he here?

575
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,326
- Why do you want to see Thomas?

576
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,664
So that Gerry can fill his head
with lies about his father?

577
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:00,167
- Roberta, these truths

578
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,419
are coming from deep
inside your daughters.

579
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,712
It's very painful for them.

580
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:07,424
- Well, it maybe painful,
but it's not the truth.

581
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:10,260
- Your husband has
acknowledged these things,

582
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,594
torn them from
their hiding place,

583
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:14,431
looked them in the
eye as you need to do.

584
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:16,933
We can help rid you of
this evil you carry.

585
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,981
- I do not carry evil,

586
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:29,987
and this stuff did not happen.

587
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:32,865
God knows why Matt
is saying it did.

588
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,203
- God knows and so does Matt.

589
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,414
Maybe you should ask him.

590
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,044
- Thomas sends his love.

591
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:50,258
He doesn't understand what's
going on with his daddy.

592
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,595
He's not the only one.

593
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,640
- I lived a whole other life.

594
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:00,560
- When did you lead this life?

595
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,730
I mean, when was this
huge piece of time

596
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,357
that I wasn't with you?

597
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,025
You wanna know what I remember?

598
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,486
I remember the day
that we had Rebecca

599
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:11,279
and how happy we were,

600
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,616
or the day that we lost Angela
and how hard that day was

601
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:15,867
to get through--
- Yes,

602
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,577
because those are easy
things to remember.

603
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:20,080
Now I'm working on
the hard things.

604
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,664
And Pastor Ralph is helping me.

605
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:24,376
I think you oughta go see him.

606
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,003
- Oh, he came, he saw me.

607
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,092
He sat on our porch and he
told me that I was 80% evil.

608
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:33,885
- You?

609
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,264
But you weren't part
of these things.

610
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,017
At least I don't, you know,

611
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:42,227
I don't remember
you being there.

612
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,645
- Because I wasn't there.

613
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,981
But with you saying
all this other stuff...

614
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:52,070
Did you know that there is talk

615
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,780
that I shouldn't have
custody of Thomas?

616
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,866
They may start legal
proceedings to take him away.

617
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,245
Do you hear me, Matt?

618
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,205
- Now, well...

619
00:33:02,205 --> 00:33:04,207
- Matt, do you hear me?

620
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:07,210
These people are trying
to destroy our family.

621
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,590
- Roberta, I have done
terrible things with my girls.

622
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,800
- No, no, Matt.

623
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,052
I don't believe that, I don't.

624
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,844
- I have betrayed
my trust as father.

625
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:18,346
- Please, just stop

626
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:19,431
saying all of this nonsense,
- I have betrayed my trust

627
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,682
as a husband.
- For god's sake, Matt!

628
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,559
- I have not been
faithful to you.

629
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:25,937
- What?

630
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,606
- I had an affair.

631
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,193
I cheated on you,
with Helen Gautier.

632
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:35,988
- No.

633
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:37,574
- Well, you remember that, what,

634
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,951
law enforcement seminar
I went to in Sacramento?

635
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,203
She was there with me.

636
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:46,291
I was drawn to her.

637
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,126
This went on for years.

638
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:52,047
- For years?
- For years.

639
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,382
- For years, Matt?

640
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:57,719
- Roberta, there
is a hidden world

641
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,804
inside every single one of us.

642
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,640
- That is bull!
- No.

643
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,352
- If there is a
hidden world, Matt,

644
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,270
it's because you kept it hidden.

645
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,480
- No.

646
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,398
- Because you lied
and you covered it up.

647
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:12,484
- No, you do not understand

648
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,735
what I'm saying to you.
- Don't you tell me

649
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,738
what I understand and
I don't understand.

650
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:19,032
You wanna know
what I care about?

651
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:21,201
I care about my family,

652
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:24,579
and the little bit of my
family that I have left.

653
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,166
I promise you, no one is
going to take away from me.

654
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:35,090
- Roberta.

655
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:37,425
Roberta!

656
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,847
- Do you remember anything
happening in April of that year?

657
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:45,975
- Wayne and Steve came
over to the house.

658
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,064
Wayne said he wanted
to have sex with Laura.

659
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,318
Now, I was against it,

660
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:58,446
but he just went
ahead into her room.

661
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:03,285
Just then, Roberta came home.

662
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:05,828
- This is the first time you've
mentioned your wife, Matt.

663
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:08,665
- She was there, I see her.

664
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:10,542
- Why didn't the two of
you stop it right then?

665
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,710
You had your weapon, right?

666
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,171
- Was Wayne armed?

667
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:18,216
- No, but we couldn't stop
him 'cause he was in control.

668
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,717
- How was he in control, Matt?

669
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:24,431
Tell us about the first time
Wayne Everett controlled you.

670
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:26,266
- Well, it was years ago.

671
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:33,856
And I see that Wayne took me
to this place that he knew of

672
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:39,029
and there was drinking and
dancing and sex all over.

673
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,448
- Multiple partners?
- Yeah.

674
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,285
And then after there was a

675
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,581
ceremony, kind of.

676
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:53,210
- Was this a Satanic
ritual, Matt?

677
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,880
- Tell us.
(brooding music)

678
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:00,300
- Just...

679
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:05,180
I see smoke.

680
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,974
Tombstones.

681
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:15,232
Or wait, maybe they're people,
you know, all in a circle.

682
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:19,902
And Wayne says...

683
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,616
- What?

684
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:29,246
What did Wayne say?
(brooding music)

685
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:33,666
- He said that these people
would kill me and my family

686
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:35,668
if we ever told.

687
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,048
He said now I belonged

688
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,925
and I could never get out.

689
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:46,138
- Why is he saying
that kind of stuff?

690
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,598
- About Wayne Everett having
power over your family?

691
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:51,309
- I don't like it when he
says that kind of stuff.

692
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,561
- Why, Rebecca?

693
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,022
Why are you afraid of that?

694
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,190
You think something more
horrible will be found out?

695
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,483
- Yeah, yeah.

696
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,277
And then I'll have to
talk about more stuff.

697
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:02,029
- You mean recover
more of these memories.

698
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:03,155
- Yeah.

699
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:05,240
- Can you remember anything now?

700
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,824
Anything like that?

701
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:27,720
- I remember my father

702
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:31,724
carrying me out of bed in
the middle of the night.

703
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,730
And there was a lot of
people waiting for us

704
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,066
outside in the barn.

705
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:45,947
Wayne Everett, Steve Sweetzer,
my mom, a high priestess.

706
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,866
- You're saying you
were part of a ritual?

707
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:54,914
- There was a fire

708
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,877
and a table and then some
pitchforks in the ground.

709
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,548
My father, he was
wearing one of those,

710
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,383
you know, those hats with horns.

711
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,177
You know, like one
of those Vikings.

712
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,015
And then there was a baby

713
00:38:12,015 --> 00:38:12,932
- A human baby?

714
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,685
- About six to eight months.

715
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:18,938
The priestess,

716
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:24,277
she held the baby up above her
and they all began to chant.

717
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:30,742
And then she laid the baby
back down on the altar.

718
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,585
They all had knives.

719
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:44,672
And there was blood,

720
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:46,758
there was blood everywhere.

721
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:51,263
And later they would
say, they would say,

722
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:55,142
"You will not remember this.

723
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,184
You will not!"

724
00:38:58,478 --> 00:38:59,271
That's why,

725
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,400
that's why I didn't remember.

726
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,069
That's why I couldn't remember.

727
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,698
Oh, God, that's why I
don't remember this!

728
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:17,080
That's why I don't remember,
don't you see? (sobbing)

729
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,085
Oh, God.

730
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:24,962
(Rebecca sobbing)

731
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:34,847
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

732
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,692
(phone ringing)

733
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:47,360
- Hello.

734
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,821
- Hi, Pastor Ralph,
it's Roberta.

735
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,489
- Oh, I'm glad you called.

736
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:55,785
- I sent Tommy to his uncle's

737
00:39:55,785 --> 00:40:00,332
and the house is quiet

738
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:02,792
and I've had some time to think.

739
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,089
- [Newton] And what
are you thinking?

740
00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:12,052
- If Matt could lead
this normal life

741
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:13,761
and not remember
any of those things,

742
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:17,765
then I'm beginning
to wonder what if...

743
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,517
What if I did, too.

744
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,312
- Why don't you
come to my office

745
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:23,396
and let me help you

746
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:30,653
- Wake up, Wayne.

747
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:33,948
Come on.

748
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:36,743
You got your wish.

749
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:44,376
- Wayne, doesn't it make sense

750
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,336
that only somebody
who is comfortable

751
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,879
with hurting other people

752
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,216
or controlling them could
commit the types of crimes

753
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,050
you're accused of?

754
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,721
- Yeah, I guess if you
look at it that way.

755
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,599
- Have you ever been
with a prostitute?

756
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,433
- No.

757
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:05,563
Well, I came close
one time in Vegas.

758
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,901
- 'Cause if a person's in the
business of selling her body,

759
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,153
you could get them to do things

760
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:15,032
you would not ask a
loved one to do, right?

761
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:28,253
- Damn, Tim, this investigation
is all over the map.

762
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,005
I mean, it's bad enough
this is a sex case

763
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:33,425
involving county officers
and their young daughters.

764
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:34,842
You start adding Satan,

765
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,429
you've handed my prosecutors
one industrial-sized

766
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,346
can of worms.

767
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,806
- What am I supposed to do?

768
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,350
I believe crimes have been
committed, so do my detectives.

769
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,187
And the prime suspect
is admitting to them.

770
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:46,479
- Polygraphs done.

771
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,730
- And?

772
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,400
- They finally asked him
the key sex questions.

773
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,277
Didn't tell the truth
in a single one.

774
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,616
- And he's hitting me.

775
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,952
They're saying I'm bad

776
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,997
and I'm fat and, uh...

777
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,252
- What is he hitting you with?

778
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,045
- Wood.

779
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:14,049
Kindling, and, um, then, uh,

780
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:19,387
they take me out and, uh,

781
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,265
(brooding music)

782
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:26,811
they make me kneel on
the living room floor

783
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:27,937
and, um, mm...

784
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:33,401
- Go on, Roberta, have faith.
(brooding music)

785
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:35,487
- I'm a victim.

786
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,490
Oh, God!
(Roberta screaming)

787
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,991
I'm a victim, too!

788
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:42,035
Like my girls.

789
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:45,080
Like my little girls.

790
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,832
(brooding music)

791
00:42:57,967 --> 00:42:59,886
(car hooting)

792
00:42:59,886 --> 00:43:01,513
(cameras flickering)
(journalists chattering)

793
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:05,017
- Sorry, fellas, I got no
statement for you today.

794
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:07,560
- See what's happening
here, Lowell?

795
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,271
We might as well give
pitchforks and torches

796
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:12,024
to all the villagers and let
them loose on Wayne and Steve.

797
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:13,316
- Horton, your clients
are being treated

798
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:14,901
just like every other suspect.

799
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:19,197
- Are you telling me that in
this county, in every case,

800
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:22,075
detectives can take two
or three or four weeks

801
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:23,743
to write up their
reports on interviews?

802
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:26,038
How're we supposed
to provide alibis

803
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,790
when you guys don't give
us concrete information?

804
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,043
- There's a ton of
allegation in this case.

805
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,752
It takes time.

806
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:36,048
Besides, these victims are
recalling horrible experiences

807
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,715
they've repressed for years.

808
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,509
Details are gonna be
in flux for awhile.

809
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:42,179
- Sexual abuse of this
kind leaves a scar.

810
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:44,764
Have those girls even seen a
doctor for a physical exam?

811
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:47,017
- Did your client get a
polygraph like he asked?

812
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,435
- A polygraph?

813
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:49,686
Don't give me that.

814
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:51,438
Have you turned up any
admissible evidence?

815
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:53,315
- Perhaps I should
remind you, Counselor,

816
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:55,858
Matthew Bradshaw's
confession is evidence.

817
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:00,155
(phone ringing)

818
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:02,032
- They took pictures
of me naked.

819
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,953
- Do you remember anything else?

820
00:44:06,953 --> 00:44:09,831
- We buried some
animals behind the barn.

821
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,626
- About twenty-five
over the years.

822
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:14,711
- Twenty-five babies?

823
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:16,671
Human babies?

824
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:17,880
Killed and buried?

825
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:20,175
Where?

826
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:23,303
- I can show you.

827
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,183
(excavator revving)

828
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:43,615
- We've marked off the area
that Rebecca indicated.

829
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:46,118
Yes, sir.

830
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,619
I will.

831
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,871
Yeah, the anthropology
team just arrived.

832
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:53,125
Yes, sir, I'll call you later.

833
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,835
- "I have so many scars.

834
00:44:55,835 --> 00:44:59,422
In school, in PE, I
had to shower alone.

835
00:45:00,548 --> 00:45:02,009
I was ashamed of
what they did to me."

836
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:04,636
- When I was a sophomore
I got pregnant.

837
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:09,016
They took me to the
barn, a lot of them.

838
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:12,852
And took the baby out.

839
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:19,234
- [Announcer] Dr. Cassie,
admitting desk, please.

840
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:21,486
(brooding music)

841
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,530
- This should explain
what we're looking for.

842
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,989
When you're done with
your examination,

843
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:28,076
your findings should be sealed
in these envelopes, okay?

844
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:29,244
- Thanks.

845
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:30,078
- Sir, it's Stan.

846
00:45:31,538 --> 00:45:34,082
I just wanted to let you
know they found something.

847
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:36,126
No, it's definitely bone.

848
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:42,382
Yes, sir.
(brooding music)

849
00:46:04,279 --> 00:46:06,614
(audience applauding)

850
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:07,615
- Thank you.

851
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:10,410
Just a few weeks
ago, we all watched

852
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,496
what was one of the highest
rated programs of the season.

853
00:46:13,496 --> 00:46:15,873
It was a Geraldo Rivera special

854
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,669
and the subject was Satanic
ritual abuse in America.

855
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:20,920
It should be no surprise then

856
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,673
if the subject dominates
our conference.

857
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,883
It is a special interest
of our first speaker,

858
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,302
Mr. Malcolm Norton,

859
00:46:27,302 --> 00:46:29,596
a former Federal law
enforcement official.

860
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:33,100
Mr. Norton.
(audience applauding)

861
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:39,314
- When we talk about
multi-generational

862
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:42,150
ritual Satanic abuse,

863
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,113
the classic common elements
seem to be as follows,

864
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:51,076
forcible drug use, sexual abuse,
both hetero and homosexual,

865
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,911
witnessing abuse or torture.

866
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,581
(group chattering)

867
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,251
- Mr. Norton, I just
wanted to congratulate you

868
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:00,668
on a wonderful presentation.

869
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:03,838
- No, no, sir,

870
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:06,133
if you're Sheriff McGuane
from Chapman County,

871
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:07,384
I wanna congratulate you.

872
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,887
Now we talk about
Satanists, my friends,

873
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:14,182
but this man actually
puts them in jail.

874
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:17,769
- Well, I had a lot of help.

875
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:18,686
- Well, you did a great job.

876
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,147
- Thank you, thanks very much.

877
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:25,568
- There were speakers there
from all across the country.

878
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:27,070
I mean, people are concerned.

879
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,281
- No, people are addicted
to talk shows, you mean.

880
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:33,785
- Lowell, we have to move
forward with this case.

881
00:47:33,785 --> 00:47:36,829
- I still don't know what
case we're talking about.

882
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:38,081
It's like everybody
in that family

883
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,874
was living in a
different time zone.

884
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,211
Laura's abuse was never
witnessed by Rebecca

885
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:45,547
and vice-versa even though
they lived in the same bedroom

886
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:46,548
for ten years.

887
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:49,884
If mother was part of
this cult all along,

888
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,054
why did they have to
tell mother about it?

889
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:53,596
And everybody including Matt,

890
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:56,349
lived in fear of Wayne Everett.

891
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:58,601
Wayne Everett and
his unearthly powers.

892
00:47:58,601 --> 00:47:59,519
I mean, come on.

893
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:02,980
Is this the same Wayne
Everett that I know?

894
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,068
Look, I'm not saying we
won't make a case eventually,

895
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:08,403
I just think we may need someone
who really knows this area

896
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:10,238
to make it all stick.

897
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:11,614
- Okay.

898
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:12,990
Okay, maybe you're right.

899
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,409
I met some people
at the conference.

900
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:15,868
- No, no, no,

901
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:18,330
I don't want somebody
working the Satan circuit.

902
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,498
I want someone with
absolute credibility.

903
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,544
Scientific credentials that
are gonna hold up in court.

904
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,717
(car engine revving)

905
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:36,764
(phone ringing)

906
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:38,225
- Dr. Ofshe?
- Yes, sir.

907
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:40,143
- Detective Carl Messenger.

908
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:41,269
District Attorney's
in court this morning

909
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:42,729
so he asked me to meet you.

910
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:43,938
And to tell you how happy he is

911
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:45,190
to have you working
on this with us.

912
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,275
- Well, I'm happy
to be here, too.

913
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,443
I'm real interested
in the prime suspect.

914
00:48:48,443 --> 00:48:50,737
- You mean because he's a cop.

915
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:54,491
- No, because he's confessing
to being a perpetrator.

916
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:58,203
Most of the stories I
hear are victim stories.

917
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,664
(door beeps)

918
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,337
- Matt, this is Dr. Ofshe.

919
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:09,714
- How you doing?
- Hi, fine.

920
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:10,882
Glad to have you.

921
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,384
- He's gonna be helping
us for a few days.

922
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:15,053
- Good, have to get all of
this out, all of it out.

923
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,971
If you can help, that's great.

924
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:19,474
- Okay?

925
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:20,392
Let's get started.

926
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,981
- Then, this time it
was Steve took Laura in.

927
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,403
Ah, got her ready, took
off her clothes, you know.

928
00:49:33,196 --> 00:49:35,032
But usually it was
Wayne who went first.

929
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:36,116
- And you did nothing?

930
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:38,285
- Wayne was in control.

931
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:41,496
- Matt, I'm curious,

932
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,666
what happened after that?

933
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,253
- I don't understand.

934
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,714
- These two men, they
leave your house, right?

935
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,634
Your daughter's just
been brutalized.

936
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:57,512
You know it, your wife knows
all about it, what do you do?

937
00:49:59,347 --> 00:50:02,017
- Just go back to normal.

938
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:05,645
- Forget what's happened?
- Yeah.

939
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:08,481
- Until now, until
you just remembered?

940
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:11,026
- Yeah.

941
00:50:12,694 --> 00:50:16,864
And you have no idea how good
it feels to remember all this.

942
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,742
I mean, I know that
sounds strange, but...

943
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,624
- Tell me about Laura.

944
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,377
She was, she was what, sixteen

945
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:30,878
around the time this happened?

946
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:33,715
Learning to drive.

947
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:37,552
And did you let her
drive the family car?

948
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:39,054
- No, no, no.

949
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:42,099
No, she drove the old,
uh, the old Chevy Impala.

950
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,391
You know, the steering
was a little tweaked

951
00:50:43,391 --> 00:50:46,103
but basically a good car.

952
00:50:46,103 --> 00:50:46,894
- I see.

953
00:50:48,271 --> 00:50:50,398
Now, Matt, if I has
asked you that question

954
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:55,362
about Laura's car four months
ago, before you were arrested,

955
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:57,822
do you think you would
have remembered it then?

956
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,158
- Sure, yeah, you don't
forget stuff like that.

957
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:04,329
- Well, what are the
things you do forget?

958
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:09,417
- That stuff that
Satan has blocked.

959
00:51:11,794 --> 00:51:14,297
That's why this battle
is so important.

960
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,309
- What was hanging down from
those trees then, Laura?

961
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:33,108
- They were dolls.

962
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:37,612
The white lady came and
hung dolls from the trees

963
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:38,738
and put blood on them.

964
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:42,325
- And the lady, she was
wearing a white robe?

965
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,619
- Mm-hmm.

966
00:51:45,912 --> 00:51:47,164
- And you're sure
they were dolls

967
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:48,456
that were hanging
from the trees,

968
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:50,167
they weren't babies
or animals, were they?

969
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:52,377
- No.

970
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:58,425
- The white lady, did she
have a lot of magic power?

971
00:51:58,425 --> 00:51:59,842
- (giggles) No.

972
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,765
But there was this
high and mighty man

973
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:07,809
who could always see
what you were doing.

974
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:10,770
- Always see what
you were doing?

975
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,773
Even now even here?

976
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,239
Think he could read?

977
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:31,249
Why don't you write it down?

978
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,084
He'll never know.

979
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,503
- Write what down?

980
00:52:39,007 --> 00:52:41,676
- The names of all the
people with the white lady.

981
00:52:53,605 --> 00:52:55,940
- I remember it was right
after Christmas time

982
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,485
and there was 20 or 30.

983
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:02,947
Mom, Dad, Everett, Sweetzer,
the priestess, the usual.

984
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,907
And this night they
brought out a goat.

985
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:08,203
And Steve Sweetzer
had this huge sword

986
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:09,454
and he killed it.

987
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:14,167
And then they made me undress.

988
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,504
- Did he always kill
them the same way?

989
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:20,132
Say, from the same
side of the altar?.

990
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:23,385
- Huh?

991
00:53:23,385 --> 00:53:25,720
- (laughs) That's like, uh,

992
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:29,057
that's like a really
weird question, I know.

993
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:33,436
You see, I'm, uh, well,
I'm like an anthropologist.

994
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,273
- Oh, like Indiana Jones?

995
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:39,442
- Exactly, Indiana Jones.

996
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:44,072
And so, I wanna know all I can
about the act of sacrifice.

997
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:51,038
- Well, uh, then he would
catch the blood in a goblet.

998
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:54,041
- Always the same goblet?

999
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:55,042
Always the same one?

1000
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,921
All right, the robe.

1001
00:54:02,965 --> 00:54:04,134
When they were
wearing the robes,

1002
00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:05,468
when did they wear the hoods up

1003
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:07,220
and when did they
wear them down?

1004
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,930
- Is this really important?

1005
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,932
She was raped by those
people, you know.

1006
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:14,269
- I have scars all over my body.

1007
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:24,404
- Recognize any of those names?

1008
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:25,613
- Of course I do.

1009
00:54:25,613 --> 00:54:27,740
Some of them are
Bradshaw's neighbors.

1010
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,950
You know, we hired you

1011
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,118
to try and make sense
out of this mess,

1012
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:31,786
not expand the suspect list.

1013
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:33,371
- It's Laura's list, not mine.

1014
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:36,249
Now Cooper told me that
you had the girls examined

1015
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:38,168
for evidence of physical abuse

1016
00:54:38,168 --> 00:54:41,254
and that the Bradshaw
property had been excavated.

1017
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:43,465
- Those reports haven't
been written up yet.

1018
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,384
- Well, I can
interpret raw data.

1019
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,178
Actually I prefer it.

1020
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:50,222
It's less susceptible
to embellishment.

1021
00:54:52,432 --> 00:54:54,976
- Are you saying
these girls are lying?

1022
00:54:54,976 --> 00:54:56,644
- It's a distinct possibility

1023
00:54:56,644 --> 00:54:59,022
that your investigators
seem to have overlooked.

1024
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:01,191
- Look, Laura can be
flaky, but Rebecca--

1025
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:05,445
- Rebecca Bradshaw remembers
attending 850 cult meetings

1026
00:55:05,445 --> 00:55:06,446
in 10 years.

1027
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:09,032
850 meetings!

1028
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:11,534
Yet she can't remember
a ritual chant

1029
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:13,203
or anything that's
on the altars.

1030
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:14,579
- So what?

1031
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:16,873
She remembers the crimes.

1032
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:17,707
- Does she?

1033
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,961
Look, Hart, hypothetical, okay?

1034
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:28,593
Suppose you tell me that
you have season tickets

1035
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:29,636
to the Giants.

1036
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:30,887
- I wish.

1037
00:55:30,887 --> 00:55:33,181
- And that you have
attended 850 games,

1038
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,724
but I don't believe you.

1039
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,101
So I ask you a question.

1040
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,854
Who did the Giants
play on July 15th?

1041
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:41,231
You answer me correctly.

1042
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,317
That still doesn't prove
that you have season tickets,

1043
00:55:44,317 --> 00:55:46,236
that proves that you
can read a newspaper.

1044
00:55:46,236 --> 00:55:47,737
- There's no newspaper accounts

1045
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:49,947
of the kind of kinky stuff
that went on in that bedroom.

1046
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:52,534
- What about these?

1047
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:54,119
- Those are research.

1048
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,079
We had to get up to
speed on this stuff.

1049
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,872
- Yeah, but where'd
you get them?

1050
00:55:57,872 --> 00:56:01,334
Libraries, Christian bookstores?

1051
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:03,003
Stay with me on this now.

1052
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:04,921
So now I ask you, how
do you beat the traffic

1053
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:06,131
to Candlestick Park?

1054
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:07,382
What color is your seat?

1055
00:56:07,382 --> 00:56:08,591
What's the name of
the hot dog guy?

1056
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:11,053
What is the worst game
you ever saw there?

1057
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,639
You answer these type questions,

1058
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,683
pattern-background questions,

1059
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:18,643
you answer them correctly

1060
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:19,977
and I know you've
had the experience.

1061
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,229
I know you've been there.

1062
00:56:22,397 --> 00:56:24,566
This kind of stuff,
Rebecca draws a blank.

1063
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:27,652
- I don't buy it.

1064
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:28,820
But suppose you're right,

1065
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,822
suppose she's
making all this up,

1066
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,658
then why the hell is Matt going
along with the whole thing?

1067
00:56:35,035 --> 00:56:37,829
- Well, look at the
pressure the guy is under.

1068
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,748
He's exhausted, he's alone.

1069
00:56:40,748 --> 00:56:44,752
He's trying desperately to
please two detectives he admires

1070
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:45,712
and trusts.

1071
00:56:45,712 --> 00:56:47,672
Listen, Messenger told me

1072
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:51,134
that Reverend Newton told Matt

1073
00:56:51,134 --> 00:56:55,388
that God would not allow him
to make a false confession.

1074
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:59,267
- But the man believes he's
guilty with all his heart.

1075
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:00,685
How do you account for that?

1076
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:07,025
(brooding music)

1077
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:07,859
- [Messenger Voiceover]
This is Detective Sergeant

1078
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,152
Carl Messenger.

1079
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:11,113
interviewing suspect
Matt Bradshaw,

1080
00:57:11,113 --> 00:57:12,989
tape-recorded with
his permission.

1081
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:14,449
Is that right, Matt?

1082
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:15,992
- [Matt Voiceover] Right.

1083
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:17,285
- [Messenger Voiceover] Do you
really wanna put those girls

1084
00:57:17,285 --> 00:57:18,745
through the agony of a trial?

1085
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:22,582
I thought you were a
bigger man than that, Matt.

1086
00:57:22,582 --> 00:57:24,542
- [Matt Voiceover] All right.

1087
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:25,377
Now listen,

1088
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:30,007
maybe the reason
I can't remember,

1089
00:57:31,758 --> 00:57:35,053
'cause I was thinking, maybe
there's a dark side to me.

1090
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:38,306
- Anyone could have
an evil side, right?

1091
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:42,269
He might not even know.

1092
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:46,898
Might not even see it.

1093
00:57:49,276 --> 00:57:50,943
(brooding music)

1094
00:57:50,943 --> 00:57:52,487
- [Cooper Voiceover] Suicide,
now they're living in fear

1095
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:54,114
at risk for murder.

1096
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:55,907
- [Messenger Voiceover]
Now tell us who they are!

1097
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,575
What kind of father
are you, huh?

1098
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,036
What kind of cop are you?

1099
00:57:59,036 --> 00:58:00,495
What kind of Christian are you?

1100
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:02,830
- Please help me, Lord Jesus.

1101
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:03,623
Help me see it!

1102
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:05,167
Help me remember.

1103
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:06,376
- You wanna confess, Matt.
- [Matt] Help me remember.

1104
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:07,294
- [Messenger Voiceover]
You want to confess

1105
00:58:07,294 --> 00:58:09,004
and God's given you the...

1106
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:11,798
(brooding music)

1107
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:16,303
- [Matt Voiceover] Help me,
Jesus, help me remember.

1108
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:18,638
Help me to see it.
(door knocks)

1109
00:58:18,638 --> 00:58:20,307
Help me.

1110
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:22,309
- Come on in, Dr. Kelson.

1111
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:25,187
- Where are we, Stanley?

1112
00:58:26,354 --> 00:58:28,231
- Help me, help me
- Uncharted waters.

1113
00:58:30,525 --> 00:58:31,526
- My little girls.

1114
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:37,324
- [Dr. Kelson Voiceover]
Hello, Matt, I'm Doctor Kelson.

1115
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:38,408
I'm a psychologist.

1116
00:58:41,994 --> 00:58:43,788
- One thing that
would help you, Matt,

1117
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:45,707
is if you stop asking for help.

1118
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,626
Just let yourself sit back.

1119
00:58:51,004 --> 00:58:53,256
Now, just try not to
think about anything.

1120
00:58:54,424 --> 00:58:56,551
Just let yourself go, relax.

1121
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:01,431
No one's gonna hurt you, Matt.

1122
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:04,184
They wanna help, just relax.

1123
00:59:04,184 --> 00:59:06,936
(brooding music)

1124
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:14,152
- What do you remember
about those poker games?

1125
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:25,497
- I can see it.

1126
00:59:30,252 --> 00:59:33,588
- [Matt Voiceover]
Laura's on the sheet...

1127
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:34,464
- On the floor.

1128
00:59:36,966 --> 00:59:37,884
She's...

1129
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:45,308
Her hands are tied.
(brooding music)

1130
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:51,731
There's someone
standing next to me.

1131
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:52,815
- Look at that person.

1132
00:59:53,816 --> 00:59:54,651
Who is it?

1133
00:59:58,738 --> 00:59:59,864
- I can't get a face.

1134
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,452
- Yes, you can.
- Oh, yes I can.

1135
01:00:04,452 --> 01:00:06,371
- It's a friend of ours.
- Yes, I can.

1136
01:00:06,371 --> 01:00:08,748
Jesus, help me with a face.

1137
01:00:08,748 --> 01:00:09,957
Help me see it, Lord.

1138
01:00:09,957 --> 01:00:11,168
- [Messenger Voiceover]
Turn and look, Matt.

1139
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:12,669
- [Matt Voiceover] Help
me, Jesus, help me.

1140
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:15,047
Jesus, give me a face.

1141
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:17,465
Let me see a face, good Lord.

1142
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:24,597
- The face that keeps coming up

1143
01:00:26,766 --> 01:00:27,600
is Wayne Everett.

1144
01:00:29,602 --> 01:00:32,355
(brooding music)

1145
01:00:38,986 --> 01:00:41,698
- [Cooper Voiceover] What
time of day is it, Matt?

1146
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:43,116
- Wayne wears a watch.

1147
01:00:45,785 --> 01:00:48,871
When he's against the
wall, he's got a watch on.

1148
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:51,124
- What time does it
say on Wayne's watch?

1149
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:55,920
- The time I think
I see is 2:30.

1150
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:03,386
- You think you
see or you do see?

1151
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:05,847
- I do see.

1152
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:12,854
- [Matt Voiceover] It's
almost like I'm making it up,

1153
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:17,942
but I'm not.

1154
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:31,873
- Yeah, well, I know it's...

1155
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:33,333
Hey, Dr. Ofshe.

1156
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,376
- Matt, how you doing?

1157
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:35,293
Having a productive day?

1158
01:01:35,293 --> 01:01:36,544
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:01:36,544 --> 01:01:38,088
Boy, we are getting
some good stuff out.

1160
01:01:38,088 --> 01:01:40,132
- Good, there's one thing I
wanted to talk to you about.

1161
01:01:41,883 --> 01:01:45,595
Rebecca told me that you,
she and Steve Sweetzer

1162
01:01:46,763 --> 01:01:49,474
drove up to Black Lake
in that old Chevy Impala

1163
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:53,645
and when you got there you
forced them to have sex

1164
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:54,521
in the back seat.

1165
01:01:58,108 --> 01:01:59,317
- Boy!

1166
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:00,693
No, sir, I do not...

1167
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:04,739
I don't remember that, I don't.

1168
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:06,116
- Rebecca says it happened.

1169
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,702
- Well, I sure will work on it.

1170
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:12,372
I will.

1171
01:02:12,372 --> 01:02:13,540
- Thanks.
- You bet.

1172
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:17,919
- What was that all about?

1173
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:19,129
I don't remember Rebecca
making those charges?

1174
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:22,757
- Funny old thing, memory.

1175
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:30,682
(brooding music)

1176
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:38,565
(man coughing)

1177
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:48,700
- Thank you.

1178
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:54,581
(brooding music)

1179
01:03:08,386 --> 01:03:11,181
(birds chirping)

1180
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:15,060
- By the shore of the
lake in broad daylight,

1181
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,269
it's hard to believe.

1182
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:18,438
- There it is in
his own handwriting.

1183
01:03:18,438 --> 01:03:19,439
- Right.

1184
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:20,982
- Wrong.

1185
01:03:20,982 --> 01:03:24,486
A lakeside rape in an old
Chevy, it never happened.

1186
01:03:24,486 --> 01:03:27,280
I made it up, yesterday,
as an experiment.

1187
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:31,326
I told Matt that Rebecca
had said that this happened.

1188
01:03:31,326 --> 01:03:33,161
This morning his
jailer hands me that.

1189
01:03:33,161 --> 01:03:35,872
Three pages of a
detailed confession,

1190
01:03:35,872 --> 01:03:39,084
including dialogue, to a
crime that never happened.

1191
01:03:39,084 --> 01:03:40,585
- How is that possible?

1192
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:43,046
- Well, you have to listen
to the tapes very carefully.

1193
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:46,383
When the detectives bring
in your police psychologist,

1194
01:03:46,383 --> 01:03:47,634
Matt's very upset.

1195
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:52,014
The doctor tries
to calm him down.

1196
01:03:52,014 --> 01:03:54,516
He lowers his voice,
makes it soothing.

1197
01:03:55,808 --> 01:03:57,727
"Try not to think of anything.

1198
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:02,232
Let yourself go, relax."

1199
01:04:02,232 --> 01:04:03,858
- Hypnosis?
- Exactly.

1200
01:04:05,152 --> 01:04:07,029
Right after that Matt
goes into a trance.

1201
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:10,073
He's responding in
classic trance logic.

1202
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:13,451
He says he's like
seeing a movie.

1203
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:15,495
He sees things happening.

1204
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:17,289
He sees Everett.

1205
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:18,665
He sees Sweetzer.

1206
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,335
Cooper wants to know
what time it is.

1207
01:04:22,335 --> 01:04:25,630
Matt reads a wristwatch
from across the room.

1208
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:30,843
I'm sorry, that's just not
the way human memory works.

1209
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:32,887
- But you didn't
hypnotize him yesterday.

1210
01:04:34,264 --> 01:04:35,807
- I actually think he's capable

1211
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:38,893
of producing auto-hypnotic
states whenever he wants.

1212
01:04:38,893 --> 01:04:41,229
Most of what he's confessed
to is pure fantasy.

1213
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:47,110
- I don't know, this is all a
little far up the ivory tower

1214
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,611
for me, Professor.

1215
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:50,655
I mean, people do repress
bad things, don't they?

1216
01:04:50,655 --> 01:04:52,199
Say, like combat veterans?

1217
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:54,951
- Some veterans repress details

1218
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:56,161
of the horrors
they've lived through,

1219
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:58,371
but they all remember
going to Vietnam.

1220
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:00,665
Matt didn't remember anything

1221
01:05:00,665 --> 01:05:02,750
until your people
started pressuring him.

1222
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:10,633
You asked me why he sincerely
believes these confessions,

1223
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:12,344
I think I've given
you the reason.

1224
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:16,681
I just wanted you to know
what direction this research

1225
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:17,515
was going in.

1226
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:19,601
- I understand.

1227
01:05:21,228 --> 01:05:23,855
- So now I don't think
it would hurt if, uh,

1228
01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:25,565
I knew the results
of those tests.

1229
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:33,448
- The doctor couldn't
find a significant scar

1230
01:05:33,448 --> 01:05:34,282
on either girl.

1231
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,327
- And the bones at the dig?

1232
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:38,495
- Bone, singular.

1233
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:40,455
Part of an elk leg

1234
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,002
- That house is in
the woods, isn't it?

1235
01:05:46,669 --> 01:05:47,504
- Yes, it is.

1236
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,262
- This never happened.

1237
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,055
- Sure it did, I remember it.

1238
01:05:57,055 --> 01:05:58,681
- I made it up.

1239
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:00,017
I found the lake on a map.

1240
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:02,435
- So why're you
trying to confuse me?

1241
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:03,936
- The question is,

1242
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:05,272
why are you confessing to these
things that never happened?

1243
01:06:05,272 --> 01:06:06,981
- It did happen, I saw it.

1244
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:08,816
- Where did you see it?

1245
01:06:08,816 --> 01:06:10,568
- Last night in my cell.

1246
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:12,487
It gets quiet, that's when I,

1247
01:06:12,487 --> 01:06:13,696
that's when I work
on my memories.

1248
01:06:13,696 --> 01:06:14,947
- Well, tell me
about that, Matt.

1249
01:06:14,947 --> 01:06:17,117
How do you work
on your memories?

1250
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:19,411
- (gasps) Well, first I pray,

1251
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:24,416
and then I kinda lean back in
my bunk and I clear my mind.

1252
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,418
I read an article
about that once.

1253
01:06:26,418 --> 01:06:27,585
You know, taught me how?

1254
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:28,586
It's very relaxing.

1255
01:06:29,796 --> 01:06:31,256
- That's it?

1256
01:06:31,256 --> 01:06:32,632
- No, and then I, uh,

1257
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:38,138
I don't know, after a
while a kinda light fog,

1258
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,514
a cloud kind of thing comes

1259
01:06:41,016 --> 01:06:42,850
and, uh, I think
about what happened,

1260
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,188
and then after a
while, I get it.

1261
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:48,565
You know, I can see it happen.

1262
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:53,236
- So you think about what
the cops say happened,

1263
01:06:53,236 --> 01:06:56,031
what Rebecca and Laura
said and then you see it?

1264
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:56,864
- Yup.

1265
01:06:59,284 --> 01:07:00,452
- Did it ever occur to you

1266
01:07:00,452 --> 01:07:02,954
that these are
fantasies or daydreams?

1267
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:05,165
That they're not real memories?

1268
01:07:05,165 --> 01:07:06,208
Did that ever occur to you?

1269
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,750
- Yeah, sure, you know.

1270
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,919
But it can't be.
- Why can't it be?

1271
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:15,550
- Because God would not permit
me to have a false memory.

1272
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:20,347
See, it's a blessing.

1273
01:07:25,768 --> 01:07:29,606
- So anything the human mind
can dream up is the truth.

1274
01:07:29,606 --> 01:07:33,651
The voyages of Odysseus,
Xanadu, King Kong?

1275
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:37,822
- No, but for a man like
Matt, a man on a quest,

1276
01:07:37,822 --> 01:07:40,408
locked in a mortal
struggle with Satan,

1277
01:07:40,408 --> 01:07:42,410
God provides him the
gift of certainty.

1278
01:07:49,084 --> 01:07:52,462
(group chattering)

1279
01:07:52,462 --> 01:07:55,632
- Tell me, Mrs. Bradshaw,
do you have a good memory?

1280
01:07:56,966 --> 01:07:59,469
For other things, I
mean, every day things.

1281
01:08:00,678 --> 01:08:01,679
- Yes, I think I do.

1282
01:08:03,181 --> 01:08:04,807
- But the abuse
that you remember

1283
01:08:04,807 --> 01:08:06,518
when you're working
with Pastor Newton,

1284
01:08:06,518 --> 01:08:08,603
that's a different
kind of remembering,

1285
01:08:09,562 --> 01:08:10,397
a new kind?

1286
01:08:11,814 --> 01:08:15,277
- Different and new, yes.

1287
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:18,863
- Not just imagined visions?

1288
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:24,952
- I hear what you're
saying, Dr. Ofshe, but, um,

1289
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:30,250
if I didn't see
all this so clearly

1290
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:33,920
I would worry that I was crazy.

1291
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:37,549
- No one thinks you're crazy.

1292
01:08:41,553 --> 01:08:46,183
I understand your youngest
Thomas is coming home soon.

1293
01:08:46,183 --> 01:08:47,725
- Yes.

1294
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:49,352
- Nobody's trying to take
him away from you anymore?

1295
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,063
- No.

1296
01:08:56,026 --> 01:08:58,070
- Because you're on
the path to recovery.

1297
01:08:59,404 --> 01:09:01,239
You're beginning
to remember things.

1298
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:05,202
You've joined the
side of the angels.

1299
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:14,502
- No matter what, Dr. Ofshe,
I am going to keep my son.

1300
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:24,096
- You think she's lying
about being in the cult

1301
01:09:24,096 --> 01:09:25,847
to keep the church
from taking her son?

1302
01:09:25,847 --> 01:09:27,682
- I can't say that.

1303
01:09:27,682 --> 01:09:30,685
I can say that it would be an
utter miscarriage of justice

1304
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:33,271
to prosecute Matthew Bradshaw

1305
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:36,899
based on any confession he
gives in his current state.

1306
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:41,071
Now that I would be
willing to testify to.

1307
01:09:42,155 --> 01:09:43,490
And I'd be very effective.

1308
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:47,785
- Doctor, are you threatening
to go over to the defense?

1309
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:49,329
- No, I work for you, Mr. Hart.

1310
01:09:50,497 --> 01:09:52,957
It's your responsibility
to do the right thing.

1311
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:56,086
- Okay.

1312
01:09:56,086 --> 01:09:57,337
Send it to me in writing.

1313
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:03,301
- You see this?

1314
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:04,636
- What do you get?

1315
01:10:04,636 --> 01:10:06,679
- They found a college
kid who was missing.

1316
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:08,931
Tortured and killed by
some devil worshiping cult

1317
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:11,059
just across the
border in Mexico.

1318
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:13,020
Lots of other burials too.

1319
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,271
- Oh, God help us.

1320
01:10:15,647 --> 01:10:17,690
- At this time we
know little more

1321
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,526
than what is public knowledge.

1322
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:23,030
The bodies were recovered from
graves on a Mexican ranch.

1323
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,989
The victims were killed
in a ritual manner

1324
01:10:24,989 --> 01:10:27,617
involving witchcraft and voodoo.

1325
01:10:27,617 --> 01:10:30,870
My department is in contact
with the Brownsville, Texas P.D.

1326
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,872
- Is the Bradshaw cult
linked to Matamoros?

1327
01:10:32,872 --> 01:10:35,917
- There is increasing evidence
of a Satanic underground.

1328
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,252
- Well, what about
Malcolm Norton's claim

1329
01:10:37,252 --> 01:10:38,878
that hundreds of
Satanic burial sites

1330
01:10:38,878 --> 01:10:40,130
will be found in this county?

1331
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,631
- We're lucky enough to
have him working with us

1332
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:42,924
on our search for these sights.

1333
01:10:42,924 --> 01:10:44,676
As you know, since
retiring from the FBI

1334
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:46,553
he's become an expert
on these cults.

1335
01:10:46,553 --> 01:10:48,055
He's already here in town.

1336
01:10:48,055 --> 01:10:49,472
- I'm getting started right away

1337
01:10:49,472 --> 01:10:51,224
directing an air search
looking for evidence

1338
01:10:51,224 --> 01:10:52,809
of ritual burials.

1339
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:54,644
Using the latest in
aerial search techniques,

1340
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:57,397
we will try to pinpoint
their locations.

1341
01:10:57,397 --> 01:11:01,568
- Now for our part, we've
asked the state for $750,000

1342
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,571
to buy helicopter mounted
infrared scanners.

1343
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:06,489
We will locate these graves.

1344
01:11:08,366 --> 01:11:09,867
- [Ofshe Voiceover]
Dear Mr. Hart,

1345
01:11:10,952 --> 01:11:13,121
what follows is my
professional evaluation

1346
01:11:13,121 --> 01:11:15,790
of the Bradshaw cases
now before your office,

1347
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,170
along with some background
materials from other writings.

1348
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:25,425
Rebecca and Laura Bradshaw
are not credible witnesses.

1349
01:11:25,425 --> 01:11:28,345
There's no evidence to
confirm their allegations.

1350
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:31,056
In addition, Laura's
allegations have nearly always

1351
01:11:31,056 --> 01:11:32,432
followed Rebecca's lead.

1352
01:11:33,766 --> 01:11:36,103
There's been so much
cross-talk between the victims

1353
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:38,938
that we cannot know the actual
source of any allegation.

1354
01:11:40,315 --> 01:11:42,525
The invocation of
Satanic influence

1355
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:44,611
is not unexpected here either.

1356
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:47,739
When natural evidence to
support the charges is lacking,

1357
01:11:47,739 --> 01:11:50,908
one fall-back explanation
is that the supernatural

1358
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:52,619
has made it so.

1359
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:55,413
Especially in an environment
so highly charged

1360
01:11:55,413 --> 01:11:56,664
with religious fervor.

1361
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:01,211
The brainwashing methods
used on Matt by the police

1362
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:03,880
are more common than
generally believed.

1363
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,050
And the longer he is made to
repeat these false memories,

1364
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,761
the more he himself will
believe that they are true.

1365
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:13,640
Three hundred years
ago in Massachusetts,

1366
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,226
there was an outcry
against Satanism.

1367
01:12:16,226 --> 01:12:20,772
In that time, the accused
were old, poor, outcast women.

1368
01:12:20,772 --> 01:12:24,442
And the men who judged them
were powerful and successful.

1369
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:27,987
Today's accusers are often
young middle-class women.

1370
01:12:27,987 --> 01:12:31,158
The accused are often the most
powerful and successful men

1371
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:32,784
of the community.

1372
01:12:32,784 --> 01:12:35,203
The players have changed places,

1373
01:12:35,203 --> 01:12:39,207
but the potential for frenzy
and injustice remains the same.

1374
01:12:39,207 --> 01:12:42,835
In Salem then or
in Clarkwell today.

1375
01:12:45,172 --> 01:12:47,840
(phone ringing)

1376
01:12:49,634 --> 01:12:50,427
- Hart.

1377
01:12:53,055 --> 01:12:55,057
Yes, Doctor, I read
it this afternoon.

1378
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:57,809
Thank you for your efforts

1379
01:12:57,809 --> 01:12:59,644
but we're pressing
forward with Bradshaw.

1380
01:12:59,644 --> 01:13:00,812
- You're going ahead?

1381
01:13:02,022 --> 01:13:03,106
- [Hart] I'm not
sure I buy everything

1382
01:13:03,106 --> 01:13:05,025
in the report, Doctor.

1383
01:13:05,025 --> 01:13:06,776
- Well, if ya buy
even half of it,

1384
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:10,072
that should be enough
reason not to prosecute him.

1385
01:13:10,072 --> 01:13:12,699
- I'm sorry, that's
our decision.

1386
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:13,533
Thank you.

1387
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:17,162
(brooding music)

1388
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:32,010
- To determine the gender
of the control group,

1389
01:13:33,178 --> 01:13:35,847
but the printer just
used reply boxes,

1390
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:38,016
yes, no, no opinion.
(students laughing)

1391
01:13:38,016 --> 01:13:40,018
- Dr. Ofshe?
- Yes, sir.

1392
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:41,228
- I'm Horton Leggett.

1393
01:13:41,228 --> 01:13:43,605
I represent Everett and
Sweetzer in Clarkwell.

1394
01:13:45,732 --> 01:13:46,858
- Could you excuse us?

1395
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:50,528
- Doctor, there are
two innocent men

1396
01:13:50,528 --> 01:13:52,364
who have been sitting
in jail for months,

1397
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:55,533
watching their lives and their
personal reputations dissolve

1398
01:13:56,909 --> 01:13:59,162
all because of Matthew Bradshaw
and his endless fantasies.

1399
01:13:59,162 --> 01:14:00,955
- Well, I understood
that Laura Bradshaw

1400
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:02,624
picked your clients
out of a line-up.

1401
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:04,167
- Well, she'd already lied

1402
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,253
when she said her attackers
were friends of her father,

1403
01:14:06,253 --> 01:14:08,171
so when they showed
her pictures of men,

1404
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:10,340
she just picked out
faces she already knew.

1405
01:14:11,716 --> 01:14:14,302
And as for Wayne's polygraph,
that was a nightmare.

1406
01:14:14,302 --> 01:14:16,388
- You don't have to
convince me of the flakiness

1407
01:14:16,388 --> 01:14:17,305
of the polygraph.

1408
01:14:18,598 --> 01:14:20,642
- Doctor, there are
rumors going around

1409
01:14:20,642 --> 01:14:22,102
that your report to Hart

1410
01:14:22,102 --> 01:14:24,604
questions the girls' veracity
and Matt's confessions.

1411
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:27,190
- I'm not at liberty
to discuss my report.

1412
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,733
- But if you're convinced

1413
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:30,235
that Matt's confessions were
made under duress, surely--

1414
01:14:30,235 --> 01:14:34,822
- Look, please, don't
put words in my mouth.

1415
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:38,201
I'm in a very tricky
ethical position here.

1416
01:14:39,411 --> 01:14:40,870
I was hired by the
District Attorney.

1417
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:44,957
I can't just turn my
findings over to the defense.

1418
01:14:44,957 --> 01:14:46,584
The judge has to do that.

1419
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:48,170
- See, that's part
of the problem.

1420
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,797
I'm not sure the judge knows
your report even exists.

1421
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,467
- Well, that's not right.

1422
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:57,304
- No, no, just have
everybody stand in place.

1423
01:14:57,304 --> 01:14:59,306
This recess won't
take but a minute.

1424
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:00,515
- Good morning, Your Honor.

1425
01:15:00,515 --> 01:15:02,350
- I received this
from a Doctor Ofshe,

1426
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,601
who I understand
was working for you.

1427
01:15:03,601 --> 01:15:05,853
- Yes, Dr. Ofshe was
employed by my office.

1428
01:15:05,853 --> 01:15:08,315
- Why wasn't this report
included in discovery?

1429
01:15:08,315 --> 01:15:10,525
- Well, it's not evidence,
it's only his opinion.

1430
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:12,235
- But it's an important
expert opinion,

1431
01:15:12,235 --> 01:15:14,321
which all the defendants
should be aware of.

1432
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:15,238
- Your Honor...

1433
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:17,615
- Distribute it, immediately.

1434
01:15:18,616 --> 01:15:19,451
- Yes, sir.

1435
01:15:27,417 --> 01:15:31,463
- Gentlemen, I've just read
the most interesting report.

1436
01:15:31,463 --> 01:15:33,381
Look at the second
page, top paragraph.

1437
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:40,763
- This says the girls are lying.

1438
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:42,265
- That's right.

1439
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:44,267
- You mean, we're not the
only ones saying it anymore.

1440
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:45,560
- That's right.

1441
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,894
The D.A.'s office is
trying to reach me.

1442
01:15:48,855 --> 01:15:50,440
- You think they're
gonna make us an offer?

1443
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,567
- I wouldn't be surprised.

1444
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:55,570
Plead to some
misdemeanor, credit for
time served, you walk.

1445
01:15:56,779 --> 01:15:58,323
- I ain't pleading
guilty to nothing.

1446
01:15:58,323 --> 01:15:59,366
I didn't do nothing.

1447
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:06,248
- He's right.

1448
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:07,082
No deal.

1449
01:16:10,293 --> 01:16:13,588
- Tim, please, we've got
to stick to basic evidence.

1450
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:15,465
If we keep going after the
King of the Underworld,

1451
01:16:15,465 --> 01:16:17,467
we'll never get anywhere.

1452
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:20,803
- Matthew Bradshaw gave us the
window into that underworld.

1453
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:22,264
- Well, if you'll
pardon my saying so,

1454
01:16:22,264 --> 01:16:24,516
it's a damn small window.

1455
01:16:24,516 --> 01:16:26,101
Malcolm Norton's flying circus

1456
01:16:26,101 --> 01:16:27,685
crisscrossed this entire county,

1457
01:16:27,685 --> 01:16:30,522
didn't find a single
Satanic burial site.

1458
01:16:30,522 --> 01:16:32,107
Meanwhile, back here on Earth,

1459
01:16:32,107 --> 01:16:33,566
the good citizens
are beginning to ask

1460
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:36,694
why we haven't prosecuted
anyone in this case.

1461
01:16:36,694 --> 01:16:38,405
- Well, we can't go to trial.

1462
01:16:38,405 --> 01:16:41,449
Not with what we got on Wayne
Everett and Steve Sweetzer.

1463
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:42,825
- Offer them a deal.

1464
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:44,536
- I offered, they said no.

1465
01:16:44,536 --> 01:16:46,579
- Well, we got
Matt's confession.

1466
01:16:46,579 --> 01:16:48,706
I'm pretty sure he'll
repeat for the judge.

1467
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:54,504
(phone ringing)

1468
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,673
- It's got to be Bradshaw.

1469
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:02,304
- Hart, did you cut
a deal with the D.A.?

1470
01:17:02,304 --> 01:17:04,597
- The D.A.'s dropped all
charges against my clients.

1471
01:17:04,597 --> 01:17:06,016
They're free men.

1472
01:17:06,016 --> 01:17:07,809
We have no further statements
to make at this time.

1473
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:08,935
- Wayne, Steve.

1474
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:11,604
This town's been chewing
up your name for months,

1475
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:12,814
you gotta say something!

1476
01:17:12,814 --> 01:17:14,649
- Too angry to say anything.

1477
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:18,153
- You've been a good soldier
against Satan up to now.

1478
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:20,988
Despite his snares
and deceptions,

1479
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:24,117
you have seen the truth of
the past and spoken it aloud.

1480
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:28,246
- I have tried.

1481
01:17:28,246 --> 01:17:29,039
- I know.

1482
01:17:31,374 --> 01:17:34,252
But sometimes soldiers
receive wounds,

1483
01:17:34,252 --> 01:17:36,671
noble wounds won in battle.

1484
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:42,177
This is your time, Matt,
to receive chastisement.

1485
01:17:44,887 --> 01:17:46,389
- God's chastisement?

1486
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:47,807
- Oh, no.

1487
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:49,684
Nothing so terrible.

1488
01:17:49,684 --> 01:17:52,687
I mean chastisement
under man's law.

1489
01:17:54,856 --> 01:17:56,441
- Yeah, but Reverend,

1490
01:17:58,443 --> 01:18:02,780
now I heard, you know,
guys in jail talk and,

1491
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:08,661
that Dr. Ofshe, he thinks I
didn't do any of these things,

1492
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:12,832
that my girls have been lying.

1493
01:18:16,711 --> 01:18:17,837
- Do you believe that?

1494
01:18:22,884 --> 01:18:23,718
- No.

1495
01:18:25,387 --> 01:18:27,055
I don't see how
it could be true.

1496
01:18:29,099 --> 01:18:30,058
But--

1497
01:18:30,058 --> 01:18:32,060
- Don't be misled.

1498
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:35,813
Godless science loves a mystery,

1499
01:18:35,813 --> 01:18:39,151
because it believes
this universe is unknown

1500
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:41,278
and always changing.

1501
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:43,321
But not you and I, Matthew.

1502
01:18:43,321 --> 01:18:45,657
For we know God's Love.

1503
01:18:45,657 --> 01:18:48,118
And that Love is our universe.

1504
01:18:48,118 --> 01:18:49,619
There are no mysteries for us.

1505
01:18:53,873 --> 01:18:54,749
- Yeah.

1506
01:18:57,002 --> 01:18:57,835
Yeah.

1507
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:01,423
I just want this to
be over, you know.

1508
01:19:01,423 --> 01:19:03,133
I just want my gut
to stop hurting.

1509
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:07,595
- You know the path.

1510
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:11,141
(brooding music)

1511
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:13,060
- She'd be kind of dirty

1512
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,228
from all the men that
had been with her

1513
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:17,772
and so I'd clean her up

1514
01:19:17,772 --> 01:19:22,069
and then kiss all the sore
spots where the ropes had been.

1515
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:23,736
And then I left.

1516
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:28,491
- Very well, Mr. Bradshaw.

1517
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:31,244
You're pleading guilty to six
counts of third degree rape,

1518
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:32,162
is that correct?

1519
01:19:32,162 --> 01:19:36,374
- Ah... yes, yes, Your Honor.

1520
01:19:36,374 --> 01:19:37,792
- Your plea is accepted.

1521
01:19:39,211 --> 01:19:41,796
A date for sentencing will be
set by the end of the week.

1522
01:19:41,796 --> 01:19:44,507
(brooding music)

1523
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:52,140
(car engine revving)
(tires screeching)

1524
01:19:58,021 --> 01:20:01,233
- I don't believe
that you pled guilty.

1525
01:20:01,233 --> 01:20:02,734
You have a defense, Matt.

1526
01:20:04,152 --> 01:20:06,529
- There's no defense
for what I've done.

1527
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,490
- I don't believe you
did any of those things.

1528
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,449
You know what I think?

1529
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:10,908
I think those girls are lying,

1530
01:20:10,908 --> 01:20:12,744
about all that stuff
to get back at you.

1531
01:20:12,744 --> 01:20:16,581
- I've thought about it, but
I see my past so clearly now.

1532
01:20:16,581 --> 01:20:18,916
- What you see are fantasies.

1533
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:21,586
Tell me I'm wrong.

1534
01:20:21,586 --> 01:20:23,505
There are two kinds
of memories, right?

1535
01:20:23,505 --> 01:20:27,050
The normal kind, where
you remember Chevy Impalas

1536
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,011
with bad steering
and stuff like that.

1537
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,637
And then processed memory,

1538
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:33,306
where all of those bad
things took place, right?

1539
01:20:38,561 --> 01:20:43,358
Tell you what, you
confess one crime to me,

1540
01:20:43,358 --> 01:20:45,402
right here, right now,
right in this ear,

1541
01:20:45,402 --> 01:20:50,198
one crime, one bad thing that
you truly remember doing,

1542
01:20:50,198 --> 01:20:52,659
the normal way, the
old-fashioned way,

1543
01:20:52,659 --> 01:20:54,452
not the processed way.

1544
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:58,831
You cop to one crime to me
that you truly believe you did

1545
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:00,625
and I will turn the
key in that lock

1546
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:03,170
and throw it a mile
into the Pacific.

1547
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:03,961
What do you say?

1548
01:21:06,339 --> 01:21:07,382
- I can't.

1549
01:21:07,382 --> 01:21:08,841
- Make them put you on trial!

1550
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:11,719
- I can't put my girls
through that kind of agony.

1551
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:13,388
- Look what they've done to you!

1552
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,017
- I am guilty.
- You are not guilty!

1553
01:21:17,017 --> 01:21:21,938
- I am guilty!

1554
01:21:21,938 --> 01:21:22,939
I am guilty.

1555
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:26,818
Prison is part of my penance.

1556
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:31,156
It is my way back to God.

1557
01:21:38,788 --> 01:21:40,957
(audience applauding)

1558
01:21:40,957 --> 01:21:44,461
- This chart, or the
Contour Map of Hell

1559
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:49,466
as I've heard it called, nearly
filled one wall of an office

1560
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:50,758
during our investigation.

1561
01:21:52,052 --> 01:21:54,596
Now it took my staff many months

1562
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:56,389
and hundreds of
thousands of dollars,

1563
01:21:57,849 --> 01:22:00,727
first, to understand what
it was we were dealing with,

1564
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:02,937
and then to successfully aid

1565
01:22:02,937 --> 01:22:05,607
in the prosecution of
a Satanic cult member.

1566
01:22:05,607 --> 01:22:08,651
(audience applauding)

1567
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:10,153
Thank you.

1568
01:22:10,153 --> 01:22:11,071
Thank you, God bless you.

1569
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:12,655
It does feel good to win one.

1570
01:22:12,655 --> 01:22:15,783
(applauds continues)

1571
01:22:17,785 --> 01:22:20,580
- Now we're gonna get you
your old job back, Steve.

1572
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,082
- My old job where I had respect

1573
01:22:22,082 --> 01:22:24,001
and people would talk to me?

1574
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:25,877
Somehow I don't think so.

1575
01:22:25,877 --> 01:22:29,006
- Frankly, I'm worried about
Matt now that the heat's off.

1576
01:22:29,006 --> 01:22:30,923
- What are you worried about?

1577
01:22:30,923 --> 01:22:33,926
- Well, that he
could wake up one day

1578
01:22:33,926 --> 01:22:35,512
and realize that he's innocent,

1579
01:22:36,763 --> 01:22:38,890
understand all the
damage he's caused.

1580
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,312
- You'll pardon me if
my eyes remain dry.

1581
01:22:46,314 --> 01:22:49,067
(brooding music)

1582
01:22:54,906 --> 01:22:55,740
- Thomas!

1583
01:22:59,036 --> 01:23:00,620
Come on, honey, it's time to go.

1584
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,465
(car engine starts)
(car engine revving)

1585
01:23:19,097 --> 01:23:22,684
- Please, Lord,
please help me, Lord.

1586
01:23:23,851 --> 01:23:26,021
Please don't abandon
me now, please.

1587
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:27,522
I have to see.

1588
01:23:27,522 --> 01:23:30,567
(brooding music)

1589
01:23:30,567 --> 01:23:32,694
- [Matt Voiceover] 'Cause
I know you're here.

1590
01:23:32,694 --> 01:23:34,237
I know it's all in here.

1591
01:23:35,447 --> 01:23:36,739
Let me see it.

1592
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:38,200
I know it's all in here.

1593
01:23:39,242 --> 01:23:41,786
Now let me see.
(men chattering)

1594
01:23:41,786 --> 01:23:42,704
Listen so close.

1595
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:44,747
It's so big.

1596
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:47,875
I can almost...

1597
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:52,255
Let me see it Lord, let me see.

1598
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:54,174
Let me have clear
sight, God, please.

1599
01:23:54,174 --> 01:23:55,383
Jesus, let me have clear sight.

1600
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:59,054
Don't leave me here
alone in my house.

1601
01:23:59,054 --> 01:24:00,055
Where are you?

1602
01:24:00,055 --> 01:24:01,556
Jesus, let me have it.

1603
01:24:01,556 --> 01:24:02,390
Where are you, Lord?

1604
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:03,725
Let me see it.

1605
01:24:03,725 --> 01:24:05,352
Please, God, let me see it.

1606
01:24:05,352 --> 01:24:06,603
Do not forsake me.

1607
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:10,982
Remember when you used to be
afraid of those old wild foxes?

1608
01:24:10,982 --> 01:24:12,109
- [Tommy Voiceover]
I'm not afraid anymore,

1609
01:24:12,109 --> 01:24:13,651
they're just like dogs.

1610
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:14,777
- [Matt Voiceover]
They're just like dogs.

1611
01:24:16,988 --> 01:24:18,656
Please don't leave me here.

1612
01:24:18,656 --> 01:24:20,325
Why have your forsaken me?

1613
01:24:20,325 --> 01:24:22,077
Alone, yes.

1614
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:23,245
Yes, I'm in my house.

1615
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:25,705
Now where are you?

1616
01:24:25,705 --> 01:24:27,415
Where are you, Lord?

1617
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:29,792
No, wait, where is everybody?

1618
01:24:31,919 --> 01:24:33,755
Where are you, Lord?

1619
01:24:33,755 --> 01:24:34,672
Don't leave me now.

1620
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:36,549
Let me see.

1621
01:24:37,675 --> 01:24:39,052
Let me see it,
please, come back.

1622
01:24:40,012 --> 01:24:40,970
Let me see.

1623
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:42,389
No, I can't be alone in here.

1624
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:43,681
No, Lord.

1625
01:24:43,681 --> 01:24:45,975
I won't be alone,
I won't be alone!

1626
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,566
I can't do this anymore.
(brooding music)

1627
01:24:54,276 --> 01:24:56,569
(Matthew coughing)

1628
01:25:00,657 --> 01:25:01,491
- It's gone.

1629
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:04,619
Hey!

1630
01:25:04,619 --> 01:25:05,453
- Matt, what's up?

1631
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:06,621
You okay?

1632
01:25:06,621 --> 01:25:09,791
- Hey, it's gone.
- What's gone?

1633
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,958
- The whole thing.

1634
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:13,295
- What whole thing?

1635
01:25:13,295 --> 01:25:17,007
- The pain in my belly,
the things that I made up,

1636
01:25:17,007 --> 01:25:18,341
it's gone.

1637
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,676
Jesus took it away.

1638
01:25:21,219 --> 01:25:22,720
'Cause none of it was true,

1639
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,099
'cause I made it all up to
please them and to please God,

1640
01:25:26,099 --> 01:25:28,476
but God doesn't want that!

1641
01:25:33,106 --> 01:25:34,816
He loves me anyway.
- Great.

1642
01:25:35,942 --> 01:25:37,944
- No, wait, you
understand I'm innocent.

1643
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:41,156
I'm an innocent man.

1644
01:25:42,157 --> 01:25:44,534
- Yeah, me too.

1645
01:25:46,203 --> 01:25:48,996
(brooding music)

1646
01:25:54,502 --> 01:25:57,422
(group chattering)

1647
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:01,968
- Well, here we go.

1648
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:04,679
(brooding music)

1649
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:33,666
(Rebecca clears throat)

1650
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:36,586
(Rebecca stutters)

1651
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:41,799
- I am Rebecca Bradshaw.

1652
01:26:42,967 --> 01:26:44,802
I was the daughter
of Matthew Bradshaw.

1653
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:50,433
I have suffered so much
at the hands of my father.

1654
01:26:50,433 --> 01:26:51,726
I hope, Your Honor,

1655
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:53,936
that you will impose the
maximum sentence on him.

1656
01:26:55,105 --> 01:26:58,066
I believe that he will
either kill me or Laura

1657
01:26:58,066 --> 01:26:59,817
if he has any chance.

1658
01:27:00,985 --> 01:27:03,071
He's destroyed me
and Laura's life.

1659
01:27:05,657 --> 01:27:08,285
He's destroyed our family
and he doesn't care.

1660
01:27:11,371 --> 01:27:14,499
He's a very dangerous
person, Your Honor.

1661
01:27:21,214 --> 01:27:24,801
- It's all right.

1662
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:29,306
- Mr. Bradshaw, do
you have a statement

1663
01:27:29,306 --> 01:27:30,598
before sentence is passed?

1664
01:27:42,277 --> 01:27:46,073
- I stand before you,
I stand before God.

1665
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,452
I have never sexually
abused my daughters.

1666
01:27:50,452 --> 01:27:53,371
(group chattering)

1667
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:59,669
I am not guilty of these crimes.

1668
01:27:59,669 --> 01:28:02,339
(gavel hitting)

1669
01:28:05,592 --> 01:28:09,929
- Mr. Bradshaw, not long
ago you stood in this court

1670
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:11,889
and recounted
details of the crimes

1671
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:13,891
to which you were
pleading guilty.

1672
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:15,310
Now you say you're innocent.

1673
01:28:16,936 --> 01:28:19,439
This court will
not be manipulated.

1674
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:22,025
You are hereby sentenced to
the maximum term on each count

1675
01:28:22,025 --> 01:28:25,445
for a total of twenty years.
(group cheering)

1676
01:28:25,445 --> 01:28:26,363
Court is in recess.

1677
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:30,492
(brooding music)

1678
01:28:49,052 --> 01:28:51,638
- Take the pressure off and
he snaps back to normal.

1679
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:52,972
- So what?

1680
01:28:52,972 --> 01:28:53,806
- So what?

1681
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,768
So now he knows none
of this ever happened.

1682
01:28:56,768 --> 01:28:58,478
He has to appeal.

1683
01:28:58,478 --> 01:29:01,773
- Doctor, you appeal a decision
of a jury or a bad judge.

1684
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:03,608
You don't appeal
your own confession.

1685
01:29:06,736 --> 01:29:09,614
- Oh, it's not over as
far as I'm concerned.

1686
01:29:09,614 --> 01:29:11,241
I have scars all over my body

1687
01:29:11,241 --> 01:29:13,451
from what Everett and
Sweetzer did to me.

1688
01:29:13,451 --> 01:29:15,203
And the law in this
County's gonna do nothing

1689
01:29:15,203 --> 01:29:16,913
to put them away?

1690
01:29:16,913 --> 01:29:20,583
It's outrageous!
(brooding music)

1691
01:29:23,545 --> 01:29:26,589
But not so mysterious when
you know the whole story.

1692
01:29:28,133 --> 01:29:29,176
(tires screeching)

1693
01:29:29,176 --> 01:29:31,136
- Sheriff?
- Good morning, Rollie.

1694
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,471
- Sheriff, I interviewed
Rebecca Bradshaw yesterday.

1695
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:35,598
Before we run the story I'd
like to get your comments.

1696
01:29:35,598 --> 01:29:37,100
- Sure.

1697
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,601
- She said your department
let Everett and Sweetzer go

1698
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:40,728
because there's still a dozen
or more Satanic cult members

1699
01:29:40,728 --> 01:29:41,604
on active duty.

1700
01:29:45,067 --> 01:29:46,484
- Who does she say they are?

1701
01:29:46,484 --> 01:29:47,610
- She hasn't said yet.

1702
01:29:51,114 --> 01:29:54,534
- Who knows, maybe you'll
turn out to be High Priest.

1703
01:29:57,204 --> 01:29:58,038
- Never.

1704
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:04,502
- Never or just
don't remember when?

1705
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,259
(tires screeching)

1706
01:30:13,803 --> 01:30:16,514
(brooding music)

1707
01:30:17,515 --> 01:30:22,520
(door beeps)
(footsteps approaching)

1708
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,112
- All right, Bradshaw, your
limo to the State Pen's here.

1709
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:36,534
(brooding music)

1710
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:51,508
- [Ofshe Voiceover] Matthew
Bradshaw remains in prison.

1711
01:30:51,508 --> 01:30:54,427
He has exhausted his
appeals in State Court.

1712
01:30:54,427 --> 01:30:57,264
Concerned citizens of
Matthew Bradshaw's home state

1713
01:30:57,264 --> 01:30:59,849
have asked their governor
to reinvestigate the case.

1714
01:31:05,938 --> 01:31:09,151
(brooding piano music)
