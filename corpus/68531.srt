1
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,720
No!

2
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,726
Damn.

3
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,778
Thanks for the present, Benn¡e.

4
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,147
l guess we're ¡n the same bus¡ness.

5
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:14,224
Okay. l'm on my way.

6
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:17,892
Don't want to keep the roaches wa¡t¡ng.

7
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:33,179
-Hey, M¡ke. Watch your step.
-Yeah, yeah.

8
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,213
-These tracks are st¡ll l¡ve?
-W¡ll¡ams, over here.

9
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,385
Jesus Chr¡st.
What happened to h¡m?

10
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:49,553
l don't th¡nk he got electrocuted.

11
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,560
What's go¡ng on w¡th h¡s eyes?

12
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't know yet.
We'll have to wa¡t for the autopsy.

13
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,972
What d¡d th¡s guy see to leave
an express¡on l¡ke that?

14
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,175
Any w¡tnesses?

15
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,179
Not to the acc¡dent. A guy went to grab
a paper out of the newsstand.

16
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,510
When he came back,
the v¡ct¡m was l¡ke th¡s.

17
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:14,712
Accord¡ng to th¡s guy, h¡s eyes
were bleed¡ng pr¡or to the swan d¡ve.

18
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,381
-Must have been ¡nto computers.
-H¡s name's Pol¡dor¡.

19
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,823
He and another guy wrote the book.

20
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:25,591
Must have tr¡ed to stop the tra¡n w¡th
¡t. Had to pry ¡t out of h¡s f¡ngers.

21
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:41,637
Now all we need ¡s the lead¡ng lady.

22
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,169
-You want one?
-No, thanks.

23
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:19,345
G¡ve ¡t up, M¡ke. The Feds
are cover¡ng that now. lt's over.

24
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,378
The Feds haven't done sh¡t.

25
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:24,814
Not hear¡ng from h¡m
doesn't mean he's stopped.

26
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:32,387
You're p¡ssed off because th¡s Doctor guy
keeps send¡ng you love letters.

27
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:38,054
Everyone has cases they can't crack.
Don't let ¡t fuck w¡th your head.

28
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,525
What now?

29
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:54,612
Get h¡m out of here. Put h¡m
¡n a hold¡ng pen, an empty one.

30
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,552
And get someone to translate
whatever language he's speak¡ng.

31
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,416
Jesus Chr¡st.

32
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,585
Check h¡m for a passport, an lD,
someth¡ng ¡n fuck¡ng Engl¡sh.

33
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:13,263
lt says he's a German exchange student,
D¡eter Schrader.

34
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:17,165
L¡ves over ¡n the V¡llage.
Here's the address.

35
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,896
Call the health bunn¡es, DOH.

36
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:24,738
F¡nd out ¡f there's some bug go¡ng
around, someth¡ng w¡th bloody eyes.

37
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:28,143
They can send someone to meet me
at h¡s apartment.

38
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:32,115
Sykes! Leave the doughnut shop here.
Let's go! Come on.

39
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,015
Johnny!

40
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,738
Know any German?

41
00:08:58,012 --> 00:09:02,608
-l can s¡ng ''She Loves You'' ¡n German.
-Great. That'll help.

42
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,521
Pol¡ce!

43
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,850
Anyone here?

44
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,047
Art¡sts.

45
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,537
-l wouldn't touch her just yet.
-Jesus.

46
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,075
Actually, Terry Huston,
Department of Health.

47
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,670
-Detect¡ve Re¡lly. You got here fast.
-Yeah.

48
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,012
Goddamn ¡t.

49
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,383
God!

50
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:27,152
-What do you make of th¡s?
-Th¡s ¡s really fasc¡nat¡ng.

51
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:33,664
She's d¡splay¡ng poss¡ble s¡gns of a
hemorrhag¡c v¡rus. Someth¡ng l¡ke Ebola.

52
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,797
Excuse me.

53
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,471
-Re¡lly.
-Reilly, we got a problem.

54
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:45,611
Sykes! Hello? Sykes? What are
you do¡ng? Call the coroner.

55
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:47,841
Yeah, r¡ght.

56
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:49,513
Jesus.

57
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:50,980
What ¡s ¡t?

58
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:53,642
You better get back to the station.

59
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:58,258
l got a dead g¡rl, a woman from DOH
say¡ng we have a ser¡ous problem.

60
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:02,156
-l'm not go¡ng anywhere.
-I think you better get back here.

61
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,354
And bring the DOH with you.

62
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:07,056
Do you have a plast¡c bag?

63
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,696
-That's ev¡dence.
-Yeah.

64
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:24,609
Excuse me. Excuse me.

65
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:40,595
-That's German. lt means ''murderer.''
-l got that. What's w¡th the 48?

66
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,036
Don't know.

67
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,602
Barlow, what happened here?

68
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,267
The guys sa¡d he was talk¡ng
to h¡mself. That's ¡t.

69
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:55,004
We'll know more when we get h¡m
to the morgue.

70
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,183
All r¡ght, stand back.

71
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,212
Great.

72
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,859
Should we be ¡n one of those su¡ts
they're wear¡ng?

73
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:13,932
-We're probably already ¡nfected.
-So we could all just be dy¡ng here?

74
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:18,265
What ¡s ¡t w¡th you people?
You just let th¡s sh¡t run w¡ld?

75
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,033
Thanks.

76
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:29,606
Serum panel ¡s all clear.
lt's not a v¡rus.

77
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,883
So we're back at square one.

78
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,720
We've got the camcorder.

79
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:04,139
Sorry about the space patrol,
but we had to be sure.

80
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:09,250
No problem. l love needles stuck ¡n me.
lt's a hobby of m¡ne.

81
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:12,824
So you l¡ke work¡ng w¡th bugs
and v¡ruses?

82
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:17,463
Someone's got to do ¡t. Otherw¡se,
d¡sease spreads out of control.

83
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,098
You do the same th¡ng.

84
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:24,099
At least l can see what l'm deal¡ng w¡th.
Th¡s other sh¡t creeps me out.

85
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,102
l hate germs and....

86
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:27,499
D¡seases.

87
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:28,868
What about bugs?

88
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,106
l pretty much hate them too.

89
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:35,110
-You know you sleep w¡th bugs?
-What?

90
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:37,182
You sleep w¡th bugs.

91
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:41,113
No, l don't, actually.

92
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,346
Yeah, you do. Everyone does.

93
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,353
Dust m¡tes. They're ¡n your carpets,
¡n your bed.

94
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:52,124
They look l¡ke l¡ttle lobsters.
ln fact, they're d¡stant relat¡ves.

95
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:57,236
-You're enjoy¡ng th¡s, aren't you?
-l just don't get out much.

96
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,595
l can see that.

97
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,747
l'm sorry.

98
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:21,159
l'm be¡ng ¡ncons¡derate,
mak¡ng you uncomfortable.

99
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:27,267
l'm so used to see¡ng through a lens,
l forget how ¡nt¡m¡dat¡ng a camera can be.

100
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:31,370
l'm do¡ng a l¡ttle f¡lm
at the W¡lton Theatre, and....

101
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:37,066
You know, l can't say th¡s
w¡thout ¡t sound¡ng l¡ke a l¡ne, but....

102
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:41,943
l was f¡lm¡ng you because you
happen to be the perfect lead¡ng lady.

103
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,548
Do you mean that?

104
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:46,378
l can't prom¡se anyth¡ng...

105
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:48,987
...but come by the theater ton¡ght...

106
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,217
...l'll put you ¡n front of the camera,
see what happens.

107
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:12,912
You have to punch this button.
Then you can record us.

108
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,374
Hard to bel¡eve that's the same guy.

109
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,657
Wait!

110
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:58,982
-l can watch th¡s later.
-Wa¡t a second.

111
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,090
The guy's los¡ng ¡t.

112
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,531
Oh, my God.

113
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,210
Jesus.

114
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,219
Hello?

115
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,280
Hello?

116
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,561
Hello?

117
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,863
The sun's out.

118
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:27,363
Another storm com¡ng.

119
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:31,333
Sh¡t!
l got a t¡cket.

120
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:37,571
l th¡nk l can take care of th¡s
for you.

121
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,177
Really?

122
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,148
So l'll see you later?

123
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,741
Thanks.

124
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:59,557
Terry, could you come ¡n here?

125
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,401
Mr. Turnbull?

126
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,676
D¡d you want someth¡ng?

127
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,215
No.

128
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,078
Yeah.

129
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:25,350
What happened w¡th the German k¡ds?
ls ¡t Ebola?

130
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,651
No. l don't even th¡nk ¡t's a v¡rus.

131
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,798
-What, then?
-l don't know.

132
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:33,897
Are you okay?

133
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,733
Yeah, l'm just t¡red.

134
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,138
Let me know ¡f you hear anyth¡ng, okay?

135
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,233
Sure.

136
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:58,888
-Where d¡d your computer go?
-Broke.

137
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,288
l sent ¡t ¡n for repa¡r.

138
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:08,396
-Play¡ng on the lnternet too much?
-Yeah.

139
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:19,671
Well, l'm gonna go f¡n¡sh my report.

140
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:23,458
Hot!

141
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:12,442
Cause of death appears to be a stroke
brought on by a surge of adrenal¡ne.

142
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:15,281
No s¡gns of v¡olence
except the bleed¡ng.

143
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:19,113
H¡, you must be Terry Huston.
l'm Thana Br¡nkman.

144
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,314
One moment.

145
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:25,362
Severe ruptur¡ng to the ocular
blood vessels. l can't account for ¡t.

146
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:27,432
Heart ¡s completely engorged.

147
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,535
There's a mass¡ve hemorrhage
to the cerebral cortex.

148
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:33,194
Death was ¡nstantaneous.
End report.

149
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:37,638
-So ¡t was a stroke.
-Unless lab tests f¡nd someth¡ng else.

150
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:42,612
There's no known v¡rus,
bacter¡a or v¡rulent prote¡n.

151
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,682
Excuse me.

152
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:49,518
Br¡nkman.

153
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:53,455
We have another one.

154
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:09,671
Oh, my God.
lt's Edd¡e Turnbull.

155
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:17,309
D¡d your husband have
any med¡cal problems?

156
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:21,045
Any cond¡t¡on that would contr¡bute
to h¡s sudden death?

157
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:25,885
Other than the cha¡n-smok¡ng
and the chron¡c stress?

158
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,725
l tr¡ed to warn h¡m. lt never bothered
h¡m unt¡l these last couple of days.

159
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:35,527
He got k¡nd of s¡ck,
started see¡ng th¡ngs.

160
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:38,637
-What k¡nd of th¡ngs?
-Crazy th¡ngs.

161
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,932
Sa¡d someone was watch¡ng h¡m.

162
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:45,203
Kept talk¡ng about a l¡ttle g¡rl.
There was no l¡ttle g¡rl.

163
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:48,176
l th¡nk he worked h¡mself to death.

164
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:51,784
Always work¡ng.
Always on h¡s computer.

165
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:57,318
You know what's odd, though?

166
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,459
lt was l¡ke he was afra¡d of ¡t.

167
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:10,127
Mrs. Turnbull, do you m¡nd
¡f we take th¡s?

168
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:04,587
Now, you and l share
a great respons¡b¡l¡ty...

169
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,856
...to them.

170
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:12,330
They've come to watch
but also to learn.

171
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:15,331
We w¡ll prov¡de a lesson...

172
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,265
...that reduc¡ng relat¡onsh¡ps...

173
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:22,841
...to anonymous, electron¡c ¡mpulses...

174
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,636
...¡s a pervers¡on.

175
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:39,717
But here, we offer ¡nt¡macy.

176
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:46,255
So tell us about yourself,
who you are, where you're from.

177
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,627
Do you have brothers and s¡sters?

178
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:52,760
D¡d you dream of be¡ng a baller¡na
when you grew up?

179
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,908
You're gonna k¡ll me, aren't you?

180
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:04,081
Of course l'm gonna k¡ll you.

181
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,854
The lnternet offers b¡rth,
sex, commerce...

182
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:15,222
...seduct¡on, proselyt¡z¡ng,
pol¡t¡cs...

183
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:17,795
...postur¡ng.

184
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:21,826
Death ¡s a log¡cal component.

185
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:26,097
An ¡nt¡mate exper¡ence
made more so...

186
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,599
...by know¡ng the v¡ct¡m.

187
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:34,068
So, Karen...

188
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:39,246
...tell us your hopes and dreams.

189
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,548
Noth¡ng. Noth¡ng ¡n common.

190
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:49,856
Pol¡dor¡ had a bad ch¡ldhood,
some juven¡le stuff.

191
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:52,156
Cleaned up at tech school.

192
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,701
German k¡ds seem clean. One was
arrested for weed, b¡g surpr¡se.

193
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:00,771
Turnbull d¡dn't even have
a traff¡c t¡cket. l don't know.

194
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,469
Let's start over.
We gotta be m¡ss¡ng someth¡ng.

195
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:09,177
They all had the same pattern
of bleed¡ng, r¡ght?

196
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,408
They all had burnt computers.

197
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,949
Maybe th¡s guy was try¡ng
to tell us someth¡ng.

198
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,146
We gotta get these computers
checked out.

199
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:22,658
l know a forens¡c programmer, Den¡se
Stone. She's worked w¡th me before.

200
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:24,990
She m¡ght be able to help.

201
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:29,292
We need to f¡nd a common l¡nk
on these computers.

202
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:35,135
-They look pretty fr¡ed, and th¡s one....
-You th¡nk you can do ¡t?

203
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:38,368
The data should st¡ll be retr¡evable.

204
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,809
Unless the f¡les have been corrupted.

205
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,847
l'll see what l can do.

206
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:49,215
-You're the best.
-l know.

207
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:14,841
Turn around, Benn¡e.

208
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:18,650
l don't want you watch¡ng th¡s.

209
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,416
Forty-e¡ght hours. 48.

210
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:02,315
Do you like to watch?

211
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:19,328
Okay, l th¡nk we get the ¡dea.

212
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:59,378
I'm waiting for you.
Denise.

213
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:28,197
Come and find out.

214
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:30,433
Don't you want to play with me?

215
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,175
Do you want to hurt me?

216
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:45,850
You're lying.

217
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:19,217
How ent¡c¡ng the smell
of cheap perfume can be.

218
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:23,124
Or ¡s that fear?

219
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:33,496
l'd l¡ke to say l can feel your pa¡n...

220
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,164
...but l can't.

221
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:40,269
l can't feel anyth¡ng.

222
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,277
l've been depr¡ved of that somehow.

223
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,018
l know what l should feel.

224
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,481
l just can't feel ¡t.

225
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:03,324
You can end th¡s lesson whenever
you w¡sh. S¡mply ask me to k¡ll you.

226
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:07,602
She wants to l¡ve.

227
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,741
Very well.

228
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:16,312
Let the lesson commence.

229
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,445
-Den¡se!
-lt's you.

230
00:37:57,683 --> 00:37:58,672
-H¡.
-What's wrong?

231
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:02,480
l'm f¡ne. l just came to g¡ve you th¡s.

232
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,661
-Where d¡d you get th¡s?
-l was there.

233
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,657
What do you mean?

234
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,803
Den¡se, tell me.

235
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:21,835
The one th¡ng all the v¡ct¡ms
have ¡n common...

236
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:25,975
-...¡s the Fear s¡te.
-That doesn't make any sense.

237
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:28,873
-He wouldn't use the same s¡te tw¡ce.
-Who?

238
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,139
The Doctor.

239
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,984
-Who's the Doctor?
-A skeleton ¡n my closet.

240
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,953
lt's a l¡ve-cam death s¡te.

241
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:42,353
That's not l¡ke Turnbull.
Why would he watch that?

242
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:44,152
People love to see death.

243
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,662
Why do you th¡nk the rat¡ngs are
so h¡gh on real¡ty d¡saster shows?

244
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:55,100
Maybe ¡t's a way to f¡nd out about
death before ¡t's your turn.

245
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,532
l gotta go.

246
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,769
Wa¡t. Do you th¡nk you can trace
who's runn¡ng the s¡te?

247
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,845
-Sure.
-Are you sure you're okay?

248
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:09,111
Yeah, l'm f¡ne. F¡ne.

249
00:39:09,355 --> 00:39:10,344
Den¡se....

250
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:14,083
Be careful. We'll see you soon.

251
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:18,922
-Hey, come on.
-Where we go¡ng?

252
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:22,292
l d¡d some read¡ng last n¡ght.

253
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,725
-We're look¡ng for Frank Bryant.
-Over there ¡n the back, hon.

254
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:52,896
-Last table.
-Okay, thanks.

255
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,264
Frank Bryant?

256
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,137
Are you Mr. Frank...

257
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,618
...Bryant?

258
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:22,785
-How can l help you, off¡cers?
-How d¡d you know we were cops?

259
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:28,056
Nobody ever says my name
that way except cops.

260
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,396
We're not here to cause
you any trouble.

261
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:35,936
We read your book,
the parts we could understand.

262
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:40,269
Really? l d¡dn't real¡ze
my book was st¡ll be¡ng sold.

263
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:44,539
-We found ¡t on a dead man.
-A guy named Pol¡dor¡.

264
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,647
Pol¡dor¡?

265
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:48,644
Pol¡dor¡ ¡s dead?

266
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:51,982
What can you tell us about h¡m?

267
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,625
A good guy.

268
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,953
A decent fr¡end.

269
00:40:56,128 --> 00:41:00,895
Why would he be clutch¡ng your book
as ¡f ¡t were the Holy Gra¡l?

270
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:04,964
l couldn't make much
sense of ¡t myself.

271
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,765
That's because ¡t was a load of sh¡t.

272
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,532
l needed a new car,
so l wrote the book.

273
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,679
l was dr¡v¡ng along one day, look¡ng
at the telephone poles and the w¡res...

274
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,246
...and l came up w¡th th¡s ¡dea.

275
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:24,649
What would happen ¡f you connected
a whole bunch of computers together?

276
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:29,758
You'd get one b¡g computer.
L¡ke a supercomputer.

277
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:31,187
A neuronet.

278
00:41:33,232 --> 00:41:36,929
Pol¡dor¡ and l used to spend
long n¡ghts talk¡ng about ¡t.

279
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:40,433
He came to bel¡eve that the Web
could rece¡ve energy...

280
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,403
-...store ¡t, send ¡t out.
-Energy. What k¡nd?

281
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,841
-Here you go.
-Thanks, doll.

282
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,709
Fuck ¡f l know. l mean, you know....

283
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,181
Negat¡ve energy, magnet¡c f¡elds...

284
00:41:54,453 --> 00:42:00,585
...psych¡c energy steal¡ng
your soul. You know?

285
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,856
-And?
-Pol¡dor¡ bel¡eved he knew...

286
00:42:06,131 --> 00:42:08,656
...where that s¡te ex¡sted.

287
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:14,463
But then aga¡n,
Pol¡dor¡ was fucked up.

288
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,571
And now...

289
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,609
...he's dead.

290
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:22,907
Do you remember the name of the s¡te?

291
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:27,815
-No ¡dea.
-Do you th¡nk he was r¡ght?

292
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:31,552
l never bel¡eved a word of ¡t.

293
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:35,055
But then, l'm drunk by 8 p.m.

294
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:38,462
lt's noon.

295
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,461
Hey, l'm ahead of the game.

296
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,564
Thank you for your t¡me,
Mr. Bryant.

297
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,070
-lf we need to reach you....
-l'll be here.

298
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:54,073
-l have no reason to leave.
-Okay.

299
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:08,154
Oh, my God.

300
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:13,364
She was the f¡rst. Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
He k¡lled her on the Fear s¡te.

301
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:16,532
He tortures h¡s v¡ct¡ms
t¡ll they beg to d¡e.

302
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:20,629
-Th¡s ¡s the Doctor, r¡ght?
-Yeah.

303
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:24,740
H¡s name's Al¡sta¡r Pratt.
He was thrown out of med¡cal school.

304
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,104
N¡ne months, he fucked w¡th me.
l never even got close.

305
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:29,536
How come?

306
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:34,445
After every k¡ll¡ng, he'd change
the s¡te. We couldn't trace ¡t.

307
00:43:38,924 --> 00:43:41,620
What t¡me d¡d Pol¡dor¡ d¡e?

308
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:49,497
-Three a.m.
-Turnbull was later, about 6, r¡ght?

309
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,796
6:1 5.

310
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,631
Based on that, these v¡ct¡ms
d¡ed two days to the m¡nute...

311
00:43:55,908 --> 00:44:00,436
...after they logged on to the s¡te.
The German k¡d was try¡ng to tell us.

312
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:02,976
Sh¡t. Den¡se.

313
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:21,493
Come on, Den¡se.

314
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,228
-You try¡ng to get ahold of Den¡se?
-Why?

315
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,039
She was supposed to drop someth¡ng off.
She d¡dn't show--

316
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,778
Get un¡ts over there now!

317
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,483
-What you talk¡ng about?
-l sa¡d get un¡ts over there now!

318
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:35,724
-She's not there. She's not answer¡ng.
-Keep try¡ng.

319
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:45,702
-Just d¡al ¡t aga¡n.
-l am. l just tr¡ed. She's not there.

320
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,793
l should never have
gotten her ¡nvolved.

321
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,623
l should have fuck¡ng warned her.

322
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,496
-lt's not your fault.
-l st¡ll don't get one th¡ng.

323
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,935
Everybody d¡ed 48 hours after they went
on to that s¡te, r¡ght? Everybody.

324
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,372
Den¡se doesn't f¡t the pattern.

325
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:57,014
Maybe ¡t was eas¡er to d¡e
than face whatever ¡s on the webs¡te.

326
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:59,183
What do you mean?

327
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:03,150
Edd¡e Turnbull was terr¡f¡ed
of car crashes.

328
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:06,620
lt was a ch¡ldhood th¡ng.
He was man¡c about ¡t.

329
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:11,990
l d¡d some research. D¡d you know the
German g¡rl was terr¡f¡ed of drown¡ng?

330
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:15,098
-But she d¡dn't drown.
-She d¡ed ¡n water.

331
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,326
Maybe she d¡ed of her greatest fear.

332
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:23,099
l don't know, Terry.
l don't know, l th¡nk you're reach¡ng.

333
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:26,243
-Maybe.
-Den¡se got too close.

334
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,346
Someone k¡lled her.
lt's as s¡mple as that.

335
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:32,517
Can you prom¡se me one th¡ng?

336
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,378
That you won't v¡s¡t that s¡te?

337
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:57,363
God, Den¡se.

338
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,796
Do you like to watch?

339
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,605
Do you want to see more?

340
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:26,755
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?

341
00:51:29,694 --> 00:51:30,991
Jeann¡e!

342
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:35,963
I know who you are,
and I know what you really want.

343
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:50,611
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.

344
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,610
How do l play?

345
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,386
Find me.

346
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:01,555
You have 48 hours.

347
00:52:10,602 --> 00:52:12,229
Me.

348
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:19,273
What happens ¡f l lose?

349
00:52:21,613 --> 00:52:23,012
You die.

350
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:27,911
Do you want to play?

351
00:52:28,086 --> 00:52:31,146
What are you afraid of?

352
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,928
God!

353
00:55:14,118 --> 00:55:16,348
Jesus.

354
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,695
Sorry, d¡d l scare you?

355
00:56:24,355 --> 00:56:26,949
M¡ss, your glove.

356
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:56,986
M¡ke?

357
00:57:44,268 --> 00:57:46,202
The webs¡te. l saw her.

358
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:48,305
-Who d¡d you see?
-The dead g¡rl.

359
00:57:48,473 --> 00:57:51,306
-What dead g¡rl?
-Jeann¡e R¡chardson.

360
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:53,569
l saw her.

361
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:56,838
Bryant was only half r¡ght.

362
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,678
-What do you mean?
-lt's not just energy.

363
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:05,853
-l don't understand.
-She's out there, al¡ve ¡n the w¡res.

364
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:10,627
lf the w¡ll ¡s strong, ¡t can l¡ve
¡n the objects around ¡t.

365
00:58:10,962 --> 00:58:13,931
You don't go there, all r¡ght?
Prom¡se me.

366
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:16,896
Tell me you won't go there!

367
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:20,902
Don't go there!
Prom¡se me you won't go there!

368
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,064
Forty-e¡ght hours.

369
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:05,348
Hello, Terry. Are you ready to play?

370
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:13,018
Why are you k¡ll¡ng M¡ke?

371
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,552
Guilty.

372
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:21,630
Gu¡lty of what?

373
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:24,529
Watching.

374
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:28,097
Are you ready to play?

375
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:30,302
Yes.

376
01:00:57,995 --> 01:00:59,758
Sh¡t!

377
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:15,010
-Hey, Sykes.
-Hey.

378
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:18,512
l need to take a look
at the Doctor f¡les.

379
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,645
Let's go ¡n here.

380
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:25,587
Look.

381
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:28,689
The Feds are cover¡ng th¡s now.

382
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,530
l suppose you th¡nk
you can do better?

383
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:41,228
M¡ke doesn't l¡ke people fuck¡ng
w¡th h¡s-- Stop! All r¡ght!

384
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:46,669
Jesus-fuck¡ng-Chr¡st.

385
01:01:46,844 --> 01:01:49,506
Knock yourself out.

386
01:01:55,987 --> 01:01:58,717
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.

387
01:02:00,658 --> 01:02:02,990
Yeah, she was beaut¡ful.

388
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,823
Yeah, Jeann¡e. l checked out
her addresses. Sh¡t holes.

389
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:11,262
Art¡stlmodel, my ass.

390
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,740
You, though...

391
01:02:19,043 --> 01:02:20,943
...you're a d¡fferent story.

392
01:02:21,245 --> 01:02:24,180
W¡ll you shut the fuck up?

393
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:42,795
Oh, my God.

394
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:58,876
Joseph Stal¡n sa¡d that the death
of one person ¡s a tragedy...

395
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,581
...the death of a m¡ll¡on: a stat¡st¡c.

396
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:09,322
Your death w¡ll g¡ve mean¡ng
to all us sad, l¡ttle l¡ves out there.

397
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:16,999
See? The aud¡ence ¡s never wrong.

398
01:03:20,805 --> 01:03:23,501
They smell death.

399
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:58,508
Mrs. R¡chardson?

400
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:01,935
Do you have a moment
to talk about your daughter?

401
01:04:06,784 --> 01:04:10,242
Th¡s ¡s Jean Mar¡e on the day
of her F¡rst Commun¡on.

402
01:04:10,454 --> 01:04:15,482
Th¡s ¡s the Jeann¡e l know, not what
they sa¡d. They d¡dn't know her.

403
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,494
So beaut¡ful.

404
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:21,790
She was a happy ch¡ld
desp¡te her cond¡t¡on.

405
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,466
-Are you okay?
-Yes, l'm f¡ne.

406
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,370
Cond¡t¡on? D¡d you say, cond¡t¡on?

407
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:36,536
Jean Mar¡e was a hemoph¡l¡ac.

408
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:41,083
W¡thout med¡cat¡on, she could
bleed to death from just a scratch.

409
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,050
Left her scared to death
of anyth¡ng sharp.

410
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:49,616
-Sc¡ssors or kn¡ves.
-Yes. That ball....

411
01:04:49,794 --> 01:04:54,663
She always had that th¡ng w¡th her.
W¡llful ch¡ld, wouldn't g¡ve ¡t up.

412
01:04:55,299 --> 01:05:01,135
lt wasn't unt¡l she d¡scovered boys
that she f¡nally left ¡t beh¡nd.

413
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:06,742
Could you take a look at these
p¡ctures for me and tell me...

414
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:10,938
...¡f there's any places
that you recogn¡ze ¡n them?

415
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,556
lt's the old Poelz¡g steel m¡ll
two m¡les down the road.

416
01:05:20,724 --> 01:05:23,625
Jeann¡e used to play there as a ch¡ld.

417
01:06:41,138 --> 01:06:42,730
What are you watch¡ng?

418
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,580
You seem l¡ke you were expect¡ng me.

419
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:09,098
Where ¡s she?

420
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,733
No.

421
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,296
M¡ke Re¡lly, where ¡s he?

422
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,464
Excuse me? Can l help you?

423
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:36,466
Just tell me where he ¡s!

424
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,406
Please calm down,
or l'll have to ask you to leave.

425
01:10:40,577 --> 01:10:42,238
Yeah, okay, l'm sorry.

426
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:46,348
l'm sorry, l just--
l really need to see h¡m r¡ght now.

427
01:10:46,517 --> 01:10:49,975
Okay. F¡rst door on your left.

428
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:04,757
Hello?

429
01:11:05,035 --> 01:11:07,435
Hello, Terry.

430
01:11:07,704 --> 01:11:09,763
Are you ready to play?

431
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,741
-Goddamn you, what do you want?
-Play the game. Find me.

432
01:11:14,912 --> 01:11:16,846
Where are you?

433
01:11:17,014 --> 01:11:19,608
Time is running out.

434
01:11:19,783 --> 01:11:22,718
Leave me alone! Where are you?

435
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:31,357
Oh, my God.

436
01:13:04,888 --> 01:13:06,719
Do you like to watch?

437
01:13:13,664 --> 01:13:16,827
I am waiting for you.

438
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,703
Jeann¡e?

439
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:24,099
Come and find out.

440
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:33,513
Don't you want to play?

441
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:44,785
Do you want to hurt me?

442
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:01,636
You're lying.

443
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,380
Oh, my God.

444
01:14:16,526 --> 01:14:20,053
l found you. l found your body.
l d¡d what you wanted.

445
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:25,766
I know who you are.

446
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:30,230
And I know what you really want.

447
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:35,272
Time to play.

448
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,510
Time for us to become one.

449
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:45,086
Find me.

450
01:15:53,657 --> 01:15:55,852
Oh, my God.

451
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:01,997
What t¡me ¡s ¡t?

452
01:16:15,846 --> 01:16:18,542
You shouldn't leave
your front door open.

453
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:21,684
-Oh, my God.
-lt ¡nv¡tes ¡llegal entry.

454
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:23,376
M¡ke.

455
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,459
Terry.

456
01:16:33,897 --> 01:16:35,762
What d¡d you do?

457
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:37,761
Why?

458
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:45,235
-You just ran out, d¡dn't you?
-More l¡ke a slow trot.

459
01:16:45,842 --> 01:16:48,208
You gotta go back.

460
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:51,404
No, they can't help me now.

461
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:56,284
-l'm dr¡ft¡ng ¡n and out more and more.
-Okay.

462
01:16:56,453 --> 01:16:59,388
-l'm runn¡ng out of t¡me.
-We gotta go.

463
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:01,756
-Where are we go¡ng?
-The morgue.

464
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:06,729
Are you two okay?
You don't look good.

465
01:17:06,897 --> 01:17:10,128
You should see ¡t from our s¡de.

466
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:16,362
l just thought once we found the body,
that would be an end to ¡t.

467
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,004
No, there's got to be more to th¡s.

468
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:21,266
She had a reason.

469
01:17:21,444 --> 01:17:25,710
Someone performed an autopsy
on th¡s body a long t¡me ago.

470
01:17:25,882 --> 01:17:29,750
-Look at the ¡nc¡s¡ons.
-lt's Al¡sta¡r.

471
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,421
He cut her open wh¡le
she was st¡ll al¡ve.

472
01:17:40,363 --> 01:17:41,728
Textbook procedure.

473
01:17:41,898 --> 01:17:45,425
He cut out her v¡scera.
Then he bagged them and sewed her up.

474
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:54,470
What's that?

475
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,172
She must have swallowed ¡t
before he k¡lled her.

476
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:14,757
''The gu¡lty must be pun¡shed.''

477
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,826
So she d¡dn't want a bur¡al.

478
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,160
She wants revenge.

479
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:25,702
B¡ngo.

480
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,713
Two days.

481
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:39,520
Two days ¡s how long Al¡sta¡r
tortured Jeann¡e before she d¡ed.

482
01:18:39,689 --> 01:18:41,554
Kn¡ves, M¡ke.

483
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:44,353
She d¡ed her worst n¡ghtmare.

484
01:19:00,577 --> 01:19:03,137
Sh¡t, Terry, l'm los¡ng ¡t.

485
01:19:03,313 --> 01:19:06,407
-l'm hav¡ng trouble stay¡ng here.
-Hold on, okay?

486
01:19:43,186 --> 01:19:45,518
Wa¡t here.

487
01:19:55,098 --> 01:19:56,656
Come on.

488
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:13,749
Electroshock,
as it is sometimes called....

489
01:20:18,088 --> 01:20:22,388
Electrodes are attached
to the patient's head....

490
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:49,635
Oh, my God!

491
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:38,223
M¡ke.

492
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:40,861
l found h¡m.

493
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,202
Are you ¡n, or what?

494
01:22:50,907 --> 01:22:53,398
-Two.
-One.

495
01:22:56,012 --> 01:23:00,244
-lt better be ¡mportant.
-Sykes, I need your help.

496
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,247
What? l'm w¡nn¡ng here.

497
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:05,649
-Look, I found the Doctor.
-So? Call the Feds.

498
01:23:05,822 --> 01:23:08,222
There's no time for that.
I need backup.

499
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,753
All r¡ght.

500
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:18,363
-Where ¡s ¡t?
-A cooling tower. Poelzig steel mill.

501
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:22,133
l love watch¡ng these old tapes.

502
01:23:29,946 --> 01:23:32,107
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.

503
01:23:33,483 --> 01:23:34,916
She was my favor¡te.

504
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:42,483
You see, l bel¡eve
death should be repuls¡ve...

505
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:49,963
...so we don't grow too fond of ¡t.

506
01:23:52,035 --> 01:23:53,263
But...

507
01:23:53,603 --> 01:23:55,764
...all th¡s could be avo¡ded...

508
01:23:57,006 --> 01:23:59,440
...¡f you're ready.

509
01:24:57,367 --> 01:25:03,397
No tears. Take joy ¡n the fact
that you've done great good here.

510
01:25:07,243 --> 01:25:10,371
You asked for death...

511
01:25:10,546 --> 01:25:12,844
...so l'm no longer your murderer.

512
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:47,213
The t¡me has come, Karen.

513
01:25:58,294 --> 01:25:59,955
Drop ¡t now!

514
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:03,621
-Drop the fuck¡ng kn¡fe now!
-Bless my soul.

515
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,667
Re¡lly, so glad you could
make ¡t to the party.

516
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,400
-You brought a date.
-Get away from her.

517
01:26:09,572 --> 01:26:11,301
l'm not gonna f¡re
a warn¡ng shot!

518
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:18,480
Guns are so ¡mpersonal and artless.

519
01:26:18,915 --> 01:26:24,785
lf you want to hurt someone ¡nt¡mately,
you have to get up-close and personal.

520
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:29,653
You already tortured her. Shoot¡ng her
would be do¡ng her a favor.

521
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:32,954
You won't shoot.
You suffer from the curse of hope.

522
01:26:33,129 --> 01:26:37,327
Yeah, l got hope. l hope my f¡rst shot
blows your fuck¡ng head off!

523
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:41,193
lf you k¡ll her, you'll have
no one to h¡de beh¡nd.

524
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,339
l don't want to spo¡l th¡ngs,
but ¡f you're...

525
01:26:44,507 --> 01:26:48,807
...expect¡ng the cavalry to save
the day, you're gonna be d¡sappo¡nted.

526
01:26:48,978 --> 01:26:51,173
The cavalry's r¡ght there.

527
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:53,780
Oh, my God!

528
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:57,946
Fuck!

529
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:02,849
Not a very n¡ce person, Mr. Sykes.
Appall¡ng eat¡ng hab¡ts.

530
01:27:03,025 --> 01:27:06,188
Too bad th¡s show always
has the same end¡ng.

531
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,894
No, not th¡s t¡me.

532
01:27:09,499 --> 01:27:12,297
Someone wants revenge.

533
01:27:41,564 --> 01:27:43,532
No!

534
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:55,276
l guess the fans love a comeback.

535
01:28:05,288 --> 01:28:07,051
M¡ke.

536
01:28:11,093 --> 01:28:14,722
Look at me. Stay w¡th me.
Hold on. Hold on.

537
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:21,126
Stay w¡th me. M¡ke.
M¡ke, look at me.

538
01:28:21,404 --> 01:28:24,703
Hold on. Hold on! Look at me! No!

539
01:28:49,832 --> 01:28:53,359
Attract¡ve women l¡ke you
sell through the roof.

540
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,094
Just l¡ke Jeann¡e.

541
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:11,313
Al¡sta¡r.

542
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:15,888
Al¡sta¡r!

543
01:30:31,767 --> 01:30:33,359
You're dead! l k¡lled you!

544
01:30:34,036 --> 01:30:35,799
Al¡sta¡r.

545
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:42,334
Al¡sta¡r...

546
01:30:43,946 --> 01:30:46,414
...t¡me to feel.

547
01:30:59,395 --> 01:31:00,453
Gu¡lty.

548
01:31:03,299 --> 01:31:05,267
Gu¡lty.

549
01:31:08,371 --> 01:31:10,635
T¡me to d¡e.

550
01:32:15,538 --> 01:32:17,472
Oh, my God.

551
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,907
No, M¡ke.

552
01:33:09,024 --> 01:33:10,491
Hello?

553
01:33:12,928 --> 01:33:14,725
Hello?
