00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,941
I KNOW IT'S
OUR BEST OPTION...

537
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,444
BUT I DON'T LIKE
YOU GOING OFF.

538
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,448
SO...

539
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,953
GET BACK FAST, OK?

540
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:29,954
OK.

541
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,493
Jim: YEAH, IT HAPPENED
ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO.

542
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,994
SEPTEMBER.

543
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,114
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT
TO TAKE A BREAK,

544
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:15,116
WE CAN STOP
ANY TIME, HUH?

545
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,619
NO, IT'S OK.

546
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,120
I DIDN'T KNOW MATT THEN.

547
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,622
HE TALKS ABOUT HER
A LOT, THOUGH.

548
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:23,123
YEAH?

549
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,625
JUST HOW GREAT
HIS MOM WAS

550
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,127
AND HOW HE MISSES HER
AND STUFF.

551
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:29,630
HE NEVER SAYS
HOW SHE DIED.

552
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,131
DID YOU EVER ASK HIM?

553
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,634
HE JUST SAYS SHE GOT SICK.

554
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,136
WELL,
IT WAS AN ANEURISM.

555
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,638
IT HAPPENED
REALLY QUICK,

556
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:39,139
AND SHE WAS GONE.

557
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,641
OH. SORRY ABOUT THAT,
MR. HENLEY--

558
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,526
WHOA!

559
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,527
DON'T MOVE.

560
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,528
OH, MAN.

561
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,029
NO, NO. NOW,
JUST DON'T MOVE.

562
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,148
JUST DON'T MOVE
A MUSCLE, ALL RIGHT?

563
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,650
JUST GET IT
AWAY FROM ME.

564
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,651
NOW, JUST DON'T TALK.

565
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,285
OW! AAH!

566
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:53,787
I GOT BIT!

567
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:54,789
I GOT BIT!

568
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,802
MY BATTERIES ARE DEAD.

569
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:10,805
DUH. YOU ONLY
USE THEM 24/7.

570
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,809
ARE WE JUST GONNA
SIT HERE ALL DAY?

571
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,931
THE FACT IS,
IF SOMEONE'S AFTER US,

572
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,933
THEY COULD GET US
JUST AS GOOD SITTING INSIDE

573
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,935
AS THEY COULD
WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE.

574
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,437
BUT DAD SAID THERE WAS
NO ONE HERE, ANYWAY.

575
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,942
WE STICK TOGETHER,
ALL RIGHT?

576
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:38,949
IT HURTS!

577
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,335
IT REALLY HURTS.

578
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:42,336
I DON'T WANNA
DIE, PLEASE!

579
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,338
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

580
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:48,592
YOU WEREN'T BITTEN.

581
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,593
YEAH, I WAS.

582
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,099
THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.

583
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,601
IT GOT YOUR WALLET.

584
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,740
SOME OF THESE
ARE REALLY OLD.

585
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,742
THIS ONE'S FROM 1850.

586
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:23,744
GREAT EPITAPH.
LISTEN.

587
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:26,247
"POORLY LIVED
AND POORLY DIED,

588
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,249
POORLY BURIED,
AND NO ONE CRIED."

589
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:29,250
COOL.

590
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,251
GOTTA GET THAT.

591
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,255
PEOPLE DIDN'T
LIVE VERY LONG BACK THEN.

592
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,759
SOME OF THESE GUYS
WERE DEAD IN THEIR 20s.

593
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:39,760
MM-HMM.

594
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,762
WELL, MINING
WAS DANGEROUS WORK.

595
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,671
HEY, GUYS...

596
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,173
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

597
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:25,438
I THINK DAD MIGHT HAVE
BEEN WRONG ABOUT THAT TAPE.

598
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,191
COME ON, LET'S GO.

599
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,571
THAT WAS WEIRD.

600
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,573
THOSE COLORS,

601
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,074
IT WASN'T
A RATTLESNAKE.

602
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,075
NO.

603
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,576
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS?

604
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,578
I DON'T KNOW.

605
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,079
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

606
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,083
WHAT'S THAT?

607
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,089
IS THAT
A HALLUCINATION?

608
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,091
I DON'T THINK SO.

609
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,593
WELL,
WHAT IS IT?

610
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,097
IT'S NOT A MIRAGE.

611
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,598
WE'RE TOO CLOSE.

612
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,100
COME ON.

613
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,239
DAD SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT US.

614
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,741
SOMEBODY KILLED
THOSE PEOPLE,

615
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,242
AND IT WASN'T
TOO LONG AGO.

616
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,245
MATT, WE DON'T KNOW
THAT ANYBODY KILLED ANYBODY.

617
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,246
YEAH, WE DO.

618
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,248
IT WAS ON TAPE.
I'M NOT A KID, PATTY.

619
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,749
I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE.

620
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,250
THEN LET'S NOT PRETEND
THAT EVERYTHING'S COOL,

621
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,251
'CAUSE IT'S NOT.

622
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,252
SO NOT.

623
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,757
OK. BUT A GRAVE
DOES NOT MEAN MURDER.

624
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,259
HEY, IF NOBODY'S HERE,
NO PROBLEM.

625
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,262
THEN THAT'S OUR ASSUMPTION.

626
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,764
WE--WE HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD ANYTHING HERE, RIGHT?

627
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,266
WE HAVE NO REASON
TO THINK OTHER THAN

628
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,769
BEING SPOOKED
BY SOME GRAVES

629
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,270
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE
IS HERE.

630
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,772
WELL, WHAT'S THE PLAN
IF WE'RE NOT ALONE?

631
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,780
YOUR DAD DIDN'T LEAVE US
WITHOUT PROTECTION.

632
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,781
WHOA.

633
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,783
NOW, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.

634
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,788
BUT IF WE DO...

635
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,289
WE'LL BE GLAD WE HAVE IT.

636
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,161
YOU SURE?

637
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,551
NO, IT'S GLASS.

638
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:21,555
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY PUT GLASS
OUT IN THE DESERT?

639
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:22,556
COME ON.

640
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,682
"GROUND ZERO:

641
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,685
"SITE OF THE FIRST

645
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,691
THAT LIKE
AN ATOMIC BOMB?

646
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,695
SORT OF.

647
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,197
WOULDN'T IT HAVE
LEVELED THAT OLD TOWN?

648
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:52,202
NO. THE NEUTRON BOMB
WAS A RADIATION DEVICE.

649
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,203
IT WAS DESIGNED
TO KILL PEOPLE,

650
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,205
LEAVE THE BUILDINGS
STANDING.

651
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,206
NO WAY.

652
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,208
YEAH.

653
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,212
MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF RADIATION.

654
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,714
THEY NEVER USED IT.

655
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,717
SO WHERE'S THIS
GLASS COME FROM?

656
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,720
WELL, WE'RE STANDING
RIGHT WHERE THE BOMB EXPLODED.

657
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,721
GROUND ZERO.

658
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,225
INTENSE HEAT FROM
THE DETONATION MUST HAVE...

659
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,728
MUST HAVE TURNED
THE SAND INTO GLASS.

660
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,730
WOW.

661
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,732
ARE WE, LIKE,
GETTING RADIATED NOW?

662
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,735
NO, THAT WAS
OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

663
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,736
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT KILLED EVERYBODY

664
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:27,738
IN THE TOWN?

665
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:31,124
NO. I'M SURE
THEY WERE EVACUATED.

666
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:35,629
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
THEY LEFT SO MUCH STUFF BEHIND.

667
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,132
COME ON. WE'VE BEEN WALKING
ABOUT 3 HOURS.

668
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,633
WE GOTTA MAKE TIME.
LET'S GO.

669
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,890
Patty: NO.

670
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:50,143
NO, HE SAID HE'D BE BACK
IN THE AFTERNOON <i>SOMETIME.</i>

671
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:51,645
HE SHOULD
BE BACK BY NOW.

672
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:55,148
HE'S ONLY
BEEN GONE 5 HOURS.

673
00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:57,651
IF HE'S NOT BACK
BY SUNDOWN,

674
00:43:57,651 --> 00:43:59,152
WE WALK BACK OUT,

675
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,654
STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD
TO THE DINER.

676
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:02,656
THAT'S 35 MILES.

677
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,658
BUT IT WILL BE DARK,
IT WON'T BE SO HOT,

678
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,660
AND--AND WE'LL
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

679
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,162
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

680
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:09,663
WHO KNOWS
WHAT THE HELL'S OUT THERE?

681
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,164
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL
IS HERE?!

682
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:13,166
STOP IT,
BOTH OF YOU!

683
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,172
NOW...

684
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:21,175
I MAY JUST BE
YOUR STEPMOTHER,

685
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,177
BUT I'M THE ADULT,

686
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,179
AND I WILL DECIDE
WHAT WE DO

687
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,680
AND WHEN WE DO IT.

688
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,681
YOU GUYS GOT THAT?

689
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:30,183
I GOT IT.

690
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:32,686
YOU <i>ARE</i> JUST
MY STEPMOTHER.

691
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,692
NEVER TRIED TO BE
ANYTHING ELSE, KATE.

692
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,699
NOW, IF YOU TWO CAN
COEXIST FOR A MOMENT,

693
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,201
I'M GONNA GO FIND
A LADIES ROOM,

694
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:48,702
SUCH AS IT IS.

695
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:49,703
GOOD LUCK.

696
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:50,704
THANKS.

697
00:44:50,704 --> 00:44:52,205
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT I DECIDE

698
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:53,707

00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:30,387
YEAH...YOU'RE OK.

00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,389
YEAH. YEAH.

713
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:54,995
LONG WAY DOWN.

714
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,641

01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,247
NO, I AM NOT CONFUSED.

901
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,249
IT'S 2 OR 3 MILES WEST
OF WEAVER.

902
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,250
I TOLD YOU THAT!

903
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,755
OK. I'M GONNA
TAKE AT FACE VALUE

904
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,256
THAT YOU GOT A BOY
LOST OUT THERE

905
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,258
IN THE DESERT TONIGHT.

906
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,259
BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE.

907
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,762
NOW, FIRST OF ALL,

908
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,764
THERE IS NO WEAVER.

909
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,265
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

910
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,767
THERE WAS
NO TOWN OUT THERE

911
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,769
WHERE THE PEOPLE
WALKED OUT IN 1948

912
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:34,770
AND NEVER RETURNED.

913
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,772
LOOK, I WAS JUST THERE.

914
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,274
MY FAMILY AND I,
WE WERE JUST IN THE TOWN.

915
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,776
WELL, SEE,
THERE YOU GO.

916
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,778
YOU KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THESE THINGS

917
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,780
YOU SAY
ATTACKED YOU, BUT...

918
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,281
YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM.

919
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,783
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ME

920
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,284
WHETHER THEY WERE
HUMAN BEINGS.

921
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,287
YOU WANT TO VERIFY THIS
WITH MY WIFE?

922
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,789
SHE'S ACROSS THE STREET
GETTING FOOD FOR THE KIDS.

923
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,290
NOW, COME ON.

924
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,793
WE ARE NOT DESERT WACKOS.

925
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,796
I CAN SEE THAT.

926
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,799
BUT I CAN ALSO SEE THAT
YOU'VE HAD A VERY LONG,

927
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,801
EXHAUSTING HIKE
THROUGH A HOT DESERT

928
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,302
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DAY.

929
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,805
COME ON, LET'S JUST
STAY FOCUSED, OK?

930
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,807
YOU GOT YOUR
16-YEAR-OLD BOY

931
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,308
LOST OUT THERE
IN THE DESERT.

932
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,311
I PROMISE YOU,

933
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,314
AT SUNRISE I'LL HAVE
MEN ON HORSEBACK,

934
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,315
I'LL HAVE ATVs,

935
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,316
I'LL HAVE
A FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT

936
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,319
SEARCHING THE DESERT
LOOKING FOR YOUR BOY.

937
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:27,323
AND WE'LL FIND HIM,
PROBABLY BY 8 A.M.

938
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,824
RICH, COULD I BORROW YOU
FOR A SEC?

939
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,328
OK.

940
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,331
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
MR. HENLEY.

941
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,342
HEY, MISTER.

942
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,346
OVER HERE.

943
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,866
Speaker: NUMBER 48,
YOUR ORDER'S READY.

944
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,869
THAT'S US.

945
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,871
I'LL GET IT.

946
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:36,642
SOMETHING WRONG?

947
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,906
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S
OUT THERE, OK?

948
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,910
BUT YOU SAW
WHAT YOU SAW.

949
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,912
WHAT, YOU MEAN THE TOWN?

950
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,414
YEAH. EVERYONE'S
PART OF IT ALL.

951
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,416
PART OF WHAT?

952
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,919
NOBODY KNOWS.

953
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,922
YOU, SEE, THERE'S
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT

954
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,425
SOME KIND OF NEUTRON
BOMB EXPLODED THERE

955
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,426
BACK IN THE FORTIES,

956
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,927
AND THERE WAS
ALL THESE PEOPLE

957
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,428
DIDN'T WANT TO
BE EVACUATED,

958
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,431
SO THEY HID OUT IN
THE MINES UNDER THE TOWN,

959
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,934
AND THEN THEY GOT
ALL THIS...THIS RADIATION.

960
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,938
WHAT'S OUT THERE NOW
IS THEIR OFFSPRING.

961
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,440
ALL MUTATED AND WEIRD

962
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,443
AND BARELY HUMAN.

963
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,945
AND THE ANIMALS...

964
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,447
THEY'RE MONSTERS.

965
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,949
AND THEN...

966
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,450
THEN THERE'S
SOME PEOPLE SAY

967
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:36,952
THAT THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

968
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,453
THAT THE TOWN
WAS BUILT

969
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,956
ON SOME KIND OF SACRED
INDIAN BURIAL SITE,

970
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,457
AND IT'S THE SPIRITS
OF THE DEAD

971
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,959
COMING BACK TO HAUNT.

972
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,961
SUPERNATURAL.

973
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,967
YOU EVER HEAR
OF AREA 51?

974
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,470
YOU MEAN IN SCI-FI,

975
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,472
THAT GOVERNMENT
RESEARCH THING?

976
01:07:56,472 --> 01:08:00,476
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
DOESN'T EXIST.

977
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,978
OFFICIALLY.

978
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,980
BUT I'VE SEEN IT.

979
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,482
THEY'RE DOING SOME KIND
OF RESEARCH OUT THERE

980
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,485
WITH E.T.s
AND ALIENS.

981
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,487
AND THEY'VE GOT...

982
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,488
A BIG HANGAR

983
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,491
AND SOME KIND OF
CRASHED SPACECRAFT,

984
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,493
AND THEY SALVAGED
SOME OF THE BODIES

985
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,994
OUT OF IT.

986
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,999
WAIT, UH, YOU THINK
IT'S ALIENS?

987
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,001
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

988
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:28,003
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

989
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:34,009
I'M SAYING YOU SHOULD
JUST GET IN YOUR CAR

990
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,011
AND--AND DRIVE
OUT OF HERE.

991
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,013
DON'T LOOK BACK,

992
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,516
JUST G-G-GO.

993
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,519
GO.

994
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,961
JUST GO.

995
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,963
IT'S HER, I SWEAR.

996
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,966
SHE'S THE GIRL
IN THE VIDEOTAPE.

997
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,969
PATTY, YOU GO.
PLEASE.

998
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,470
I'LL GO.

999
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,489
HELP YA?

1000
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,492
UH, WE NEED SOME KETCHUP.

1001
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,496
WAS SOMEONE ELSE
WORKING HERE BEFORE?

1002
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,000
BECCA, SHE
JUST GOT OFF. WHY?

1003
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,002
NOTHING. MY SISTER
TOOK THE ORDER.

1004
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,005
SHE THOUGHT...NOTHING.

1005
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,645
THERE'S A MOTEL
AT THE END OF MAIN STREET.

1006
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,147
I CALLED AND, UH,

1007
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,149
THERE'S A ROOM
WAITING FOR YOU THERE.

1008
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,150
THANKS.

1009
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,651
TRY AND GET
SOME SLEEP, OK?

1010
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:53,155
UH, SUNRISE IS AT 5:45.

1011
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:54,156
WE'LL BE LEAVING THEN,

1012
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,157
AND, WELL,
IF YOU'LL BE HERE,

1013
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,158
YOU CAN RIDE WITH ME.

1014
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,161
LISTEN, MY SON
HAS PHOTOGRAPHS.

1015
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,163
THAT TOWN IS THERE.

1016
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,668
LET'S JUST TRY
AND FIND ETHAN FIRST.

1017
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,671
YOU CAN GO LOOKING FOR
YOUR GHOST TOWN AFTER THAT.

1018
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,172
DEAL?

1019
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:12,675
5:45.

1020
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,176
YEAH.

1021
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,205
HE WAS
TALKING TO ME.

1022
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,207
I--I WASN'T
TALKING TO HIM.

1023
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,709
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO HIM.

1024
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,211
COME ON.

1025
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,718
LET'S GO.

1026
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,726
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK.

1027
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,729
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

1028
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,234
DAD, THE GIRL
FROM THE VIDEO,

1029
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,735
THE ONE WE THOUGHT
WAS DEAD--

1030
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:14,737
WELL, SHE'S NOT.

1031
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,739
SHE'S WORKING
AT THE DRIVE-IN.

1032
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:17,740
HERE?

1033
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,741
YEAH.

1034
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:19,742
SHE MADE OUR FOOD.

1035
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,243
KATE PICKED UP THE ORDER

1036
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,244
WHEN OUR NUMBER
WAS CALLED.

1037
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,245
THE GIRL--

1038
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,746
WAS THE SAME ONE
ON THAT TAPE.

1039
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,249
WHERE?
WHICH ONE IS SHE?

1040
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,750
Matt: I ALREADY
CHECKED IT OUT.

1041
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,753
SHE'S NOT THERE NOW.
SHE JUST GOT OFF WORK.

1042
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:34,256
BUT SHE WAS THERE.
I SAW HER.

1043
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,258
OK, OK,
I BELIEVE YOU.

1044
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,759
THAT'S A GOOD
THING, RIGHT?

1045
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,261
I MEAN,
SHE'S NOT DEAD.

1046
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,763
WHAT ABOUT ETHAN?
ARE THEY GOING OUT?

1047
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,766
SUNRISE.
FULL-ON SEARCH.

1048
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,267
AIRPLANES
AND EVERYTHING.

1049
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,770
DAD, WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM THERE ALL NIGHT.

1050
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,773
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO,
THEN WE HAVE TO GO, NOW.

1051
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:51,773
LOOK, I HEAR YOU,

1052
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,275
BUT WE'D NEVER
FIND HIM AT NIGHT,

1053
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,776
AND I'M NOT TAKING
ANY OF YOU

1054
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,278
BACK OUT THERE, OK?

1055
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,279
WE SHOULD
CALL HIS PARENTS.

1056
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,281
THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN
TILL SUNDAY.

1057
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,782
THEY DROVE UP
TO SAN FRANCISCO.

1058
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,285
OH, RIGHT.
I FORGOT.

1059
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,789
WELL, THEN, I'LL LEAVE
A MESSAGE FOR THEM

1060
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,290
WHEN WE GET
TO THE MOTEL.

1061
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:09,291
WELL, LET'S HOPE

1062
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,792
WE CAN LEAVE ANOTHER
ONE IN THE MORNING

1063
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,294
THAT SAYS
EVERYTHING'S OK.

1064
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,329
THEY OK?

1065
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,831
YEAH. SOUND ASLEEP.

1066
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,834
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

1067
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,840
YOU SHOULD COME
TO BED, TOO, JIM.

1068
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,844
NO, I WON'T SLEEP.

1069
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,345
I'M FINE.

1070
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,348
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1071
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,854
[SIGHS] I JUST
KEEP THINKING.

1072
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,355
I KEEP SEEING--

1073
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,357
I MEAN, I WAS
RIGHT BEHIND HIM,

1074
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,858
AND THEN HE WAS GONE.

1075
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:25,867
I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE
