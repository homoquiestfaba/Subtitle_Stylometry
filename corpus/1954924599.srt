It was my birthday.

"Sure."

and drinking and drinking.

And then the staff was like,
"Do you want to party?"

46

I was like...

checking me out,

'cause they were looking at me
like I look at tacos.

71
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,054
But then I thought about it.

72
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,324
"Oh, my God,
I just turned on a man.

73
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,426

00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,333
Man, I called my girlfriend.

75
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,136
I said, "You better not mess up.
I have options."

00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,706
Uh-huh.

77
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,841
I have memory.

78
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,177
A few years back, I was doing
a show at the Comic Strip,

79
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,081
and my idol, Mr. Paul Rodriguez,
was in town doing a benefit.

80
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,087
He calls up the Comic Strip,
and he says, he says,

81
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,522
"Hey, listen, I'm doing
a benefit up the street.

82
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,091
"Y sabes que, vato?

83
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,626
"I'm gonna come down there,
and I want to do some shots.

84
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,693
Some tequila, some tacos."

85
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,195
I'm like, "Let's do it."

86
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,429
He shows up to the club,
and he says,

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,231
"All right, get in the car.
Let's go."

88
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,300
"Where are we going?"
"We're going to Juarez."

89
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,035
"Juarez?
Let's eat some tacos here."

90
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,905
"I can't afford you here.
Let's go to the other side."

91
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,208
[makes engine noise]

92
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,210
So we wind up on the other side,

93
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,645
and we wound up
killing some tacos,

94
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,513
and, you know, we wound up
crossing the border.

95
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,283
And when we crossed the border,
it was a few months after

96
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,019
I taped a bunch
of water commercials here.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,588
You guys remember
the water commercials?

98
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,490
Yeah, and then they pulled me
off the advertising

99
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,924
because they said I was too fat
to sell water.

100
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,426
Whatever.

101
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,195
So we're crossing the border,
and Immigration was right there,

102
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,364
and they're checking the cars,
and we're in a blue van.

103
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,733
My buddy Jim, who's sitting
over there, was driving,

104
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,835
and Border Patrol comes
over to the window,

105
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,170
and he goes---
he opens the door

106
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,672
and he sees me.

107
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,408
He goes, "Oh, my God.
It's you. You're hysterical.

108
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,642
And I go, "What do you think
of this guy?"

109
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,344
And Paul was like,
"Hey, what's up?"

110
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,679
And the guy was like,
"Oh, my God."

111
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,380
So we wound up taking pictures
at the border.

112
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,349
And it was so funny,
'cause we're outside the car,

113
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,418
and we're pretending
to be arrested, right?

114
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,119
People are driving by going,

115
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,156
"Let Paul Rodriguez
and Pikachu go!"

116
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,259
They're American!
Let 'em go!"

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,896
[laughing]

118
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,865
It was priceless.

119
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,634
We crossed the border,
and Paul was like,

120
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,236
"I want to go hang out
and have a good time."

121
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,840
He went to this place
off the 1 0 called Jaguars.

122
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,275
[crowd cheers]

123
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,844
It's a "male,"
you know, gentleman's club,

124
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,212
whatever you want to call it.

125
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,014
So we go in there, and I'm like,
"Oh, my God."

126
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,682
As soon as we walked in,
I'm like---

127
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,551
I'm thinking Paul's
gonna be all like,

128
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,252
"Shh, I don't want nobody
to know I'm here."

129
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,054
Goes over to the DJ,
and the DJ's like,

130
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,457
"All right, ladies,
look who just walked in:

131
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,292
Paul Rodriguez!"

132
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,394
All of a sudden, there's,
like, 32 lap dances

133
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,729
that stop like that.

134
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,664
And all these girls,
they bum-rush Paul.

135
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,735
And I'm like, "Wow,
I got to get funnier."

136
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,106
So we're hanging out there
for a couple of hours.

137
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,741
So we wind up outside
in the parking lot,

138
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,843
And this girl jumped
into the car, and she's like,

139
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,044
"Oh, my God, Paul Rodriguez.

140
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,146
"I love you.
My mama's a huge fan too.

141
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,714
Here. Please, please, please."

142
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,117
And he, "Whatever, whatever,
okay, come here, come here."

143
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,719
"Here, please,
talk to her on the phone."

144
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,755
"Ora."

145
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,590
He looks at me
in the front seat,

146
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,191
and he goes, "Hey, tu, Iglesias.

147
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,527
Here, be me."

148
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,763
He put me on the phone
with the girl's mom.

149
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,698
I'm like, "Hey, senora.
How you doing?

150
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,066
"Yeah, you know, uh...

151
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,634
"your daughter,
she's a real angel.

152
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,070
Yeah. That's what
they call her here."

153
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,305
[audience laughing]

154
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,909
Yeah, man, I love Paul.

155
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,377
Like I said, Paul's the...
you know,

156
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,446
one of the main reasons
why I got into comedy.

157
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,715
And he used to mess
with me a lot; trust me.

158
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,350
In my last special,
I talked about

159
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,118
how I had a Volkswagen Beetle.

160
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,221
It was a true story.
I really had a Beetle.

161
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,124
And I got rid of it because
I got tired of the fat jokes.

162
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,393
When you're a fluffy guy
and you have a little car

163
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,829
and all of your friends
are professional comedians...

164
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,264
oh, they'll make you cry.

165
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,832
Paul, especially.

166
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,868
"How the hell did you manage
to squeeze inside of that?

167
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,070
"Hombre, I have never seen
a car expand before

168
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,472

00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,541
"How do you get a stretch mark
on the windshield?

170
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,875
"That's what I want to know.

171
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,411
When you fart,
does it go faster?"

172
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,480
One after another after another.

173
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,348
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

174
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,118
And you know what it is?
It's Karma.

175
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,686
'Cause ten years ago,

176
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,689
I did a joke
about Paul Rodriguez on TV.

177
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,191
I used to be on a show

178
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,159
on the Nickelodeon Network
called AII That.

179
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,228
Some of you remember?
Yeah?

180
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,863
That was me, a lot smaller.

181
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,097
I was only two X's.

182
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,300
I was a dos equis.
Yeah.

183
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,536
Anyway, as soon as the TV show
season was over,

184
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,238
they gave all
the cast members gifts.

185
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,174
They gave this one girl a TV,
this one kid a DVD collection.

186
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,810
Since I was the only one
who had his own car,

187
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,447
they gave me a car alarm
with a remote start to it.

188
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,183
A lot of cars have those now,
but think back ten years ago.

189
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,818
There was only a few
that had the...

190
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,955
[imitates alarm beeping,

191
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,756
My friends went,
"Where'd you get that?"

192
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,494
I looked at them, and I said...
"Nickelodeon!"

193
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,628
"That's bad!"

194
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,063
I go to show it off
to everybody.

195
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,131
I show it to my mom, I said,
"Mom, go to the car.

196
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,000
I got to use the bathroom.
I left you a present."

197
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,068
[gasps]
"Un present, okay!"

198
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,302
So she goes to the car,

199
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,338
and I started the car
from the kitchen.

200
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,406
[imitates alarm beeping,

201
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,709
" El diablo! El diablo!

202
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,511
El diablo!"

203
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,812
I had to run outside.

204
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,980
"Mom, it's not the devil.

205
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,481
Lookit, lookit, lookit."

206
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,417
[imitates alarm beeping,

207
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,852
"Nickelodeon!"

208
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,587
"Oh, my God, mijo.

209
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,889
Oh, my God, you scared me."

211
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,259
"Oh, my God, mira.
Smell, smell, smell.

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,593
Smell, mijo, smell. "

213
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,798
I wind up doing a show
in Hollywood at a comedy club,

214
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,535
and I'm working with my idol,
with Paul Rodriguez.

215
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,603
Soon as the show was over,
we go---you know,

216
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,872
we're walking out the door,
and he walks up to me

217
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,075
and he says, "You know, I like
the whole fluffy thing you do.

218
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,810
"It's catchy. Sounds cute.

219
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,913
Keep eating."

220
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,049
We walk outside, and my car
is parked there first

221
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,651
because I showed up late.

222
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,253
So I'm---you know, my car's
right there and Paul walks by.

223
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,288
"All right, take it easy."

224
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,023
He walks right in front
of my car.

225
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,226
And my friend goes,
"Dude, show him your car.

226
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,028
Show him Nickelodeon."

227
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,063
And I couldn't help it,
you know, freakin'...

228
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,265
[imitates alarm beeping,
car engine starting]

229
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,500
"Hey! Hijole!"

230
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,468
What the hell? What is this?"

231
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,670
"Paul!"

232
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,139
"Nickelodeon!"

233
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,509
"Hombre, cabron pinche, Fluffy,
you gave me a heart attack.

234
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,544
You take it easy."

235
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,380
Valet brings his car around,
a brand-new Porsche 91 1.

236
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,149
The car was nice.

237
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,418
You know, it pulls up.
[imitates roaring engine]

238
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,453
Valet gives him the keys.

239
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,955
He turns around and looks at me.

240
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,590
"Hey, tu, Fluffy.

241
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,058
Check it out."

242
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,894
I'm like, "Whatever.
It's not Nickelodeon."

243
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,529
[imitates car alarm beeping]

244
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,631
The door pops open.

[imitates whirring, beeping]

[imitates whirring]

248
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,172
"I'm not through yet."

[laughing and cheering]

255
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,034
A lot has changed, El Paso.

256
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,435
A lot has changed.

257
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,739
One thing's for sure;
I'm still the fluffy guy.

258
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,941
[cheering]

259
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,514
And I say "fluffy" 'cause that
is the politically correct term.

260
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,216
For those of you
that don't remember,

261
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,587
I used to say that there
were five levels of fatness.

262
00:10:55,688 --> 00:11:00,925
Reason why I say "used to say"
is because now there are six.

263
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:05,063
Uh-huh. I met the new one
in Las Cruces.

264
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,500
The original five levels
are big, healthy,

265
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,703
husky, fluffy and damn!

266
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,706
People ask, "What could
be bigger than damn?"

267
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,940
The new level's called,

268
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,942
"Oh, hell, no!"

269
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,045
[laughter, applause]

270
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,052
What's the difference?

271
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,055
You're still willing to work
with level five.

272
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,690
Example: If you're
on an elevator

273
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,125
and you're with your friend,
and this really big guy gets on

274
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,827
and you and your friend look
at each other,

275
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,896
and you're like, "Damn!"

276
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,533
But you still let the big guy
ride your elevator.

277
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,168
That's the difference.

278
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,237
Level six, you see walking
towards your elevator.

279
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,339
[deep grunting]

280
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,344
"Oh, hell, no!"

[rumbling]

282
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,346
"No!"

[rumbling]

284
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,916
"No!

285
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,017
No!"

286
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,687
That's the difference.

287
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,324
The guy that I met
was 6"8', 614 pounds.

288
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,028
[audience gasping]
Uh-huh, "Aw, hell, no."

289
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,263
And he was offended at my show,

290
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,532
not by anything that I said
but because of the fact

291
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,736
that now, at the shows,
I started selling T-shirts,

292
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:22,307
and, apparently,
I didn't have his size.

293
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,877
Keep in mind, I go all the way
up to 5X on the T-shirts,

294
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,212
and he was like...

295
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,681
[in deep, raspy voice]
"You don't have my size."

296
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,783
I was like, "Dude,
I didn't know they made you."

297
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,884
[laughter]

298
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:40,759
I have up to 5X,
I don't have [growls] "X"

299
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,861
with a picture of a dinosaur
on the back of the tag,

300
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,530
you know.

301
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,532
No.

302
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,201
And by the way, you guys,
I want to let you know now

303
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,537
here in this theater
and all over the world,

304
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,039
wherever anybody's watching
this special,

305
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,410
if you ever see me in public,

306
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,281
either at a restaurant
or at a hotel or anywhere,

307
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,216
and you want to stop me
and say hello

308
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,418
or take a picture or anything,
please.

309
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,188
I welcome it and it's an honor
if you were to do that.

310
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,590
I do not mind at all.

311
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,425
[cheering and applause]

312
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,195
Stop me anytime you want.

313
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,765
I'm the same person.

314
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,737
The same guy.

315
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,141
Thank you.
Seriously,

316
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,410
the same guy you see now is
the same guy you'd see outside.

317
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,012
I don't change, you know.

318
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,381
You're not gonna walk up and go,
"Gabriel, can I talk to you?"

319
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,017
I'm not going to be like,
"Be gone from me.

320
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,486
"Gabriel is my stage name.

321
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,455
I'm not even Mexican;
I'm Scandinavian."

322
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,492
No, trust me, I'm the same
pendejo you'll see outside.

323
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,493
I don't mind.

324
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,761
I love it, you guys, trust me.

325
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,762
You guys make it possible

326
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,363
for me to have
an incredible life

327
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,899
and take care of my family,
so I'm all for it.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,100
Not a problem.

329
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,101
Trust me,

330
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,636
right now it's so crazy

331
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,139
'cause I'm still adjusting
to people walking up to me.

332
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,107
I'm checking into the hotel,

333
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,776
and they already knew me,
which was crazy.

334
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,110
I go like,
"Uh, hi, I'm checking in."

335
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,111
"Here's your key, sir."

336
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,113
"But, um, um..."

337
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,815
"We know it's you, sir."

338
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,816
I'm like, "Ah!"

339
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,918
[laughs]

340
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,355
You know,
I think that's awesome.

341
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,891
I needed that,
like, six years ago.

342
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,227
One time, I was trying
to check into a hotel

343
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,796
in Chicago
at 1:00 in the morning

344
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,497
because I missed my flight.

345
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,500
Nobody's at the front desk,
just the little bell

346
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,203
and a sign that said
"Ring for service."

347
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,304
So there I am.

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,143

Ching, ching,
ching, ching, ching.

354
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,319
All of a sudden, I heard this.

355
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,288
"I hear the bell."

356
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,061
All of a sudden,
this lady came out.

that damn bell?

"Um, I'm checking in."

361
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,777
"You know what time it is?
It's tomorrow."

362
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,045
"I know, I missed my flight."

363
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,047

[imitates typing]

370
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,161
"What's your name?"

371
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,063
"My name is Gabriel Iglesias."

373
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,432
"Yes, Iglesias."

"Okay, 'E'-glesias,
okay, E-G-L-I..."

375
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,672
"No, no, no, no,
it's Iglesias with an 'I."'

393
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,372

"Whatever.

Give me a hard time."

404
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,233
A lot has changed, though, man.

405
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,702
For those of you that don't know
by now, I finally became a dad.

406
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,939
[cheering and applause]
Yeah.

407
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,174
Thank you.

408
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,943
Hell, yeah.

409
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,112
He's ten.
[laughing]

410
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,080
Surprised me too.

411
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,016
Yeah, they found me.

412
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,250
And it's not what you think.

413
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,252
I didn't discover
that I had a lost child.

414
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,554
It's just that I hooked up
with a beautiful woman

415
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,157
who had a pre-started family,

416
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,825
so basically I became
a stepfather.

417
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,628
You know, I just took over
the payments.

418
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,033
Best part for me is that my
new son looks exactly like me.

419
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,534
He's fluffy too.

420
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,602

Yeah, he's a little---
damn.

424
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,376
And he's the cutest kid.

425
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,944
You talk to him---
his name is Frankie---

426
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,646
like, "Frankie,
what do you like to do?"

427
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,617
"I like microwave burritos
and PlayStation."

428
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,552
"Me too."

429
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,256
Only problem is he wakes up
early, 5:00 every morning.

00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,290

"What?"

00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,961
"I'm hungry."

434
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,864
"Me too.
Make something."

435
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,466
And he does.

436
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,401
I can hear him in the kitchen
making Hot Pockets,

437
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,438

00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,743
And he opens the door
and doesn't close it,

441
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,745
and the whole house freaking---

Oh, my God,

446
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,990
and he's so cute because right
now he's going through puberty,

447
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,026
and I think it's hysterical.

448
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,194
His mom doesn't think so.

449
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,429
She's like, "No."
I go, "Yeah,

450
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,664
I caught him
checking out a girl."

451
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,665
"How do you know?"

00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,567

"Baby, don't worry.

I'll be the man.

he's watching Cinemax.

00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,534

we smell like food.

522
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,103

our own cologne, huh?

all the time.

530
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,351
or do you do that
in public too?"

531
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,120
Like, no, of course
I do the voices in public.

532
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,489
I have to make myself laugh.

533
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,923
You know,
I like doing the voices

534
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,893
in places
where people can't see me.

535
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,296
Like drive-throughs.

536
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,764
Oh, I'm evil
at a drive-through, man,

537
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,300

'cause they know me.

538
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,101
I mean, they really know me.

Look at some of you---
"IHOP? "

551
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,698
Yeah, let me explain this one.

552
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,800
Next time you go to an IHOP,
look for the podium.

553
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,201
Usually on the weekends,

554
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,337
they'll have the podium set up
right at the front door,

555
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,939
and when you walk in, they'll
have a host and they'll ask you,

556
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,274
"How many in your party?"

557
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,409
And you tell them two, three,
four, whatever the case,

558
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,944
and then when it's time
for your seats,

559
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,546
they'll call you
with the little freaking---

560
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,680
you know,
they got the microphone

561
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,482
on the side of the wall,
and they'll go,

562
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,519
"Paging party of four, paging
party of four, now serving."

563
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,222
When that party walked away,
I grabbed her microphone

564
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,125
and I said,
"Paging Mexican party of 47,

565
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,595

now serving."

566
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,665

was like...

571
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,645
I was at an IHOP one time
during an earthquake.

572
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,013
Wasn't a big one.

573
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,082
It was enough to feel it,
but not freak out, you know.

You gotta choose which one
you want, you know.

Do you want earthquakes,
tornados,

584

it's an earthquake.

590

an earthquake or a big truck?"

00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,541
No.

696
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,211
Anyways, that's as far
as I'll go with that.

697
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,046
"He said he wasn't gonna
get political."

698
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,147
Yeah, I know.

699
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,382
Gotta change that up, you guys.

700
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,217
A lot of things are changing.

701
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,251
A lot.

702
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,419
Got the relationship now.

703
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,087
It's going good.
I love my girlfriend.

704
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,522
She's here in the house
tonight too.

705
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,557
[cheering, applause]

706
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,560
It's awesome.

707
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,563
We rarely fight.

708
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,298
And I think that's
so freaking cool.

709
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,466
And I know why.

710
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,135
It's because I do this
for a living.

711
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,137
Uh-huh, and she knows

712
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,140
whatever we argue about will
eventually end up right here.

713
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,408
[laughter]

714
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,276
It slows her down.
You ought to see her.

715
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,711
"You know what I think?"

716
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,813
"Go ahead, say it, say it."

717
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,384
Uh-huh.

718
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,852
Yeah.

719
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,320
The only problem I have
with my girl sometimes

720
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,855
are her friends.

721
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,524
I don't like her friends,
'cause they're haters.

722
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,858
[scattered cheering]
They are.

723
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,859
Look, the guy's clapping.

724
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,361
Yeah, I know, man.

725
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,029
It sucks.
Every time I leave the house,

726
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,531
and I go out of town
for the weekend,

727
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,366
they show up, and they start
throwing little monkey wrenches

728
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,734
in there, you know.

729
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,903
[in female voice]
"So he's not here?

730
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,905
"Where is he?
How come you're not with him?

731
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,173
"What's the story?
What's the deal?

732
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,474
"How long have you
been together now?

733
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,742
"You're not engaged?
You're not married?

734
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,010
"What's up?
Is he gonna adopt Frankie?

735
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,044
"What's the word?
What's going on?

736
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,245
"How come you don't have a ring?

737
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,880
"Norma has a ring
and she's a puta.

738
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,315
How come you don't have a ring?"

739
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,718
[laughter, applause]

740
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,890
So I'll get these
messed-up phone calls

741
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,059
at, like, 2:00 in the morning
when I'm the road, right.

742
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,227
[mimics phone ringing]

743
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,261
"Hello."

744
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,763
[mimics crying]

745
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,098
"Baby?"
"Yeah?"

746
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,766
"Are you okay?"
"Mm-hmm."

747
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,267
"What are you doing?"
"Nothing.

748
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,269
"I'm just here at the house,

749
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,371
watching Cheaters. "

750
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,842
"Great."

751
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,343
Oh, wow, did you see that?

752
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,377
I almost fell.

753
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,179
Ooh!

754
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,814
If I fall now, show's over.

755
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,716
[mumbling]
Oh, my God.

756
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,218
Yeah, there'll be people
outside.

757
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,720
"We're standing here live
in front of the Plaza Theatre.

758
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,556
"Where authorities believe
Fluffy lost control.

759
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,391
"Seven people were
reported injured,

760
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,626
"three were rushed
to the hospital.

761
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,161
"Authorities had this to say,

762
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,262
'Damn!"'

763
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,400
[cheering, applause, whistling]

764
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,507
Whoo!

765
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,276
Thank you.

766
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,111
They'd be interviewing people.
"Ma'am, what happened?"

767
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,946
"It got dark."

768
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,114
"Sir, what did you see?"

769
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,116
[mimics roaring, thud]

770
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,085
"Se cayo Pikachu."
Yeah, l know.

771
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,653
"He fell."

772
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,021
Uh-huh.

773
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,857
But, no, anyways, let me finish
to tell you what happened.

774
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,859
So my girl started tripping out,

775
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,528
and I start getting
these weird phone calls.

776
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,695
Finally, I got tired of it.

777
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,030
I said, "You know what?
I don't need this.

778
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,365
"You know, I don't need it.

779
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,300
"From now on when I take off
on the road,

780
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,135
no more phone calls."

781
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,970
- Yeah!
- Look at that guy. "Yeah!"

782
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,305
Are you here by yourself?

783
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,340
[laughter]

784
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,508
Uh-huh.

785
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,743
Whatever, dude.

786
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,712
[applause, cheering]
Anyway...

787
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,981
Here's the thing: I took my girl
to the Apple store.

788
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,249
And I got her an iPhone.

789
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,918
I got myself one
and I said, "From now on,

790
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,753
we're texting each other."

791
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,822
And believe it or not,
she was cool with that,

792
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,990
because anytime she would
send me a text,

793
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,992
I would reply like that.

794
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,160
I could be anywhere.

795
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,495
Freaking in the bathroom.
Freaking...

796
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,996
[mimics ding]

797
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,998
"What are you doing?"

798
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,834
[laughs]

799
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,836
"I'm blowing it up!

800
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,504
I love you." Send.

801
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,172
And she'd reply,
"Oh, my God, me too.

802
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,007
I love you!"

803
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:47,010
It sounds so stupid, but it was
working out perfectly

804
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,012
until one night I got drunk.

805
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,681
[audience oohs]

806
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,216
Oh, you want to hear this?

807
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,051
all: Yeah!
- You want to hear this?

808
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,219
all: Yeah!

809
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,653
- So check this out.

810
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,656
I'm leaving a comedy club
in San Jose, California.

811
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,592
And I'm walking back
to my hotel room,

812
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,460
which is one block away.

813
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,895
As I'm walking, I pass in front

814
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,898
of this bar on the corner
called Cinebar.

815
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,400
It's got all kinds of cinema
and movie memorabilia in there.

816
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,436
Looks cool;
I'm walking in front,

817
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,439
and there are people in that bar
that just left my show.

818
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,642
So I walk in front,
and I heard, "Fluffy!

819
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,677
Hey, let me buy you a shot!"

820
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,714
I was like, "Well, you know,
I don't want to be rude."

821
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,948
[laughter]

822
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,417
Can't have that, right?
So I walked in.

823
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,186
I said, "What's---you know,
I'm on way back to my room.

824
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,554
I'll just do
a couple shots, whatever."

825
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,256
So you know, one shot
and then somebody, "Me too."

826
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,291
"All right, me too.
Vamonos. Let's do it."

827
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,126
"Me three." "Me four."

828
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,795
1 5 shots of tequila later...

829
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,797
[audience oohs]

830
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,799
[whistling, cheering]

831
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,635
It occurs to me,

832
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,403
"I think I should go."

833
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,072
I start walking
towards the door.

834
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,642
I took three steps,
the cold air hit me.

835
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,977
I got dizzy and I fell.
Hard.

836
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,279
I know I fell hard,

837
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,314
'cause when I hit the ground
I farted.

838
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,482
[laughter]

839
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,484
[mimics fart]

840
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,920
"Oh, my God, I farted!"

841
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,321
My buddy Martin ran over,

842
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,756
and he helped me
up off the ground.

843
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,790
"You okay, Gabriel?"

844
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,191
[mumbling]

845
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,693
We stumbled back
to the hotel room,

846
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,361
I sit down in the lobby,
and I'm just like...

847
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,896
[exhaling]

848
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,164
"Are you okay, Gabriel?"

849
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,565
"I'm okay, man.
Where's my phone?

850
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,567
I gotta let my girl know
I'm okay."

851
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,735
"You're holding it."

852
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,637
"Oh, thank you, Martin.
I love you.

853
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,306
"I love you.
You're a good friend, man.

854
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,640
You're a good friend."

855
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,542
He goes, "What are you doing?"
"I'm gonna text."

856
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,544
"Dude, just call her."
"No!

857
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,547
"If I call her, she's gonna know
something's up.

858
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,549
"I'm gonna text her.
Watch.

859
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,886
"Baby, I made it back
to the hotel.

860
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,488
"I love you.

861
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,490
Kissy-face."

862
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,092
Send.

[mimics ding]

864
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,562
"How did it go?"

865
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,597
[laughing]
"I farted!

866
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,933
"I shouldn't tell her that,
huh, Martin?

867
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,934
"Okay.

868
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,269
It went good."

869
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,971

Send.

870
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,474

after your show?"

00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,477
"Oh, here we go."

872
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,145
My buddy Martin is like,

873
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,814
"Gabriel, man, Gabriel,
don't tell her---

874
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,649
"don't tell her you were
at a bar getting drunk, man.

875
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,783
Don't tell her."

876
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,786
"Martin, I have to tell her
the truth, bro.

877
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,455
"We're cool like that, man.

878
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,123
"I can talk to her.

879
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,459
"I can---I could tell her
anything, man.

880
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,628
"She's not like your old lady,
you know.

881
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,997
Trippin' all the time."

882
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,265
"Hey, Martin, take the pictures
of the cochina

883
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,367
off the internet."

884
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,868
"Whatever."

885
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,069
"Oh, I'm sorry,
did I say that out loud?

886
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,571
Forgive me, bro."

887
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,572
"Gabriel, lie."

888
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,673
"I can't lie, man."

889
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,341
"Lie!"
"I can't lie!"

890
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,542
"Are you that honest?"

891
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,212
"No, I just won't remember
the lie.

892
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,514
"Why get in trouble two times
for the same stupid thing?

893
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,815
You know what I'm saying, bro?"

894
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,450
So I sent the message.

895
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,186
"Baby, I made it...

896
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,622
Oh, delete, delete, delete."

897
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:46,823
[chuckles]

898
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:50,027
"Baby, I went next door

899
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:54,398
"with Martin to Cinebar.

900
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,233
"Had a nice time.

901
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,835
"Kissy face, kissy face.

902
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,405
"Kissy face.

903
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,639
Send."

904
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,974
[imitates cell phone chiming]

905
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,275
"Lucky you.

906
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,711
"Wish I could've been there
with you.

907
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,746
"Tell Martin I said hi.

908
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,048
I love you."

909
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,617
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

910
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,520
Martin, I just told
my girlfriend

911
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,990
I was at a bar with you,
and she didn't get mad.

912
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,927
What the hell is she doing?

913
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,129
[laughter, applause]

914
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,274
Man, she told me
to tell you hi.

915
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,143
And she don't even like you.

916
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,712
So I scroll back
to read what she read,

917
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,314
and apparently, my stupid iPhone

918
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,116
has this memory
spell check feature,

919
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,419
and it didn't recognize
the word, "Cinebar."

920
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,689
It flipped it and turned it
into Cinnabon.

921
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,992
So apparently, at 1 0:00
at night, my girlfriend thought

922
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,262
I was having cinnamon rolls
with my friend, Martin,

923
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,932
which normally,
would sound like an ugly lie,

924
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,667
but considering her boyfriend
is known

925
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,702
as "the fluffy guy"
who loves "chocolate cake,"

926
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,137
it sounds real.

927
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,172
I was like, "Oh, my God.

928
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,841
"Martin, check it out!

929
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,909
My iPhone lied for me."

930
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,011
[laughter, applause]

931
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,448
I love you, iPhone!

932
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,852
BlackBerry can't do that.

933
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,221
[cackling]

934
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,023
A month later, my girlfriend
heard me tell the story,

935
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,558
and she's like,
"That's a funny joke."

936
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:29,926
I go, "It really happened."

937
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,228
"How come you didn't tell me?"

938
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,064
I said,
"The phone didn't let me."

939
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,532
And her friends are right there.

940
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,100
"See, he's out there
getting wasted,

941
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,435
sending you messed-up texts."

942
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,637
"Whatever. Shut up, haters."

943
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,407
Yeah, a lot of things
are going on.

944
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,510
Um, in the house here tonight,
you guys,

945
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,245
I'm very happy she was able
to make it.

946
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,379
A lot has been going on.

947
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,815
My mom once again
here at my special...

948
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,049
is in here.

949
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,618
[audience cheering]

950
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,286
Where you at, Ma?

951
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,854
I know you're out here.

952
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,289
Oh, there she is.

953
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,391
[audience cheering]

954
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,628
Andale.

955
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:10,000
She almost didn't make it here
tonight, you guys, almost.

956
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,737
Uh, a month ago, my mom
got admitted to the hospital.

957
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,871
She got a little sick.

958
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,207
Somebody forgot to take
their medication, uh-uh.

959
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,843
"I don't need it pa'que...
pa'que neces...ay, ay."

960
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,044
Yeah, uh-uh, remember that?

961
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,045
Remember that? Right?
Anyway, Mom...

962
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,446
Sorry, I have to throw it at her

963
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,781
so she makes sure
she takes her medicine.

964
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,483
Got to give my little shout-outs
right now.

965
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,485
Right here in the front row,
you guys...

966
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,554
if anybody saw my last DVD,
in the bonus features,

967
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,588
this gentleman right here,

968
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,323
Freddy Franco---
Fred Franco---

969
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,494
has attended over 250
of my shows.

970
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,331
Over 250 of my shows.

971
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,601
In about five
or six different states.

972
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,537
At first,
my girlfriend was like,

973
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,872
"Psycho."

974
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,041
But he's not---
he's cool.

975
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,175
We've hung out with him.

976
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,010
Just a---one of the greatest
fans ever,

977
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,479
and so I have to give him
his props, you know.

978
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,349
He, uh, took some time
off of work to come out here.

979
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,751
So thank you, Freddy.

980
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:02,886
Man.

981
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,087
Cabron, you're die-hard.

982
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,655
Please don't ever
turn psycho, please.

983
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,691
'Cause I have some psychos
out there.

984
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,526
They'll show up, and they'll
hang out by the car.

985
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,428
"Gabriel."
[laughing nuttily]

986
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,734
It's funny because this is my---
this is my third special.

987
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,336
In the last special that I did,

988
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,672
I did a bunch of references
to police officers.

989
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,942
And they weren't exactly
flattering references or jokes.

990
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,911
You know, I was just
kind of like saying,

991
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,847
you know, the whole doughnut
thing and, um...[laughs]

992
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,884
Apparently, they became fans
in some weird way,

993
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,588
because I started getting phone
calls to do police functions.

994
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,924
In December,
I had five Christmas parties.

995
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,659
I got a phone call
from my agent.

996
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,628
He's like, "Gabe, check it out.

997
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,529
"CHP, California
Highway Patrol,

998
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,265
wants to hire you to do a show."

999
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,733
I go, "Really?
What does it pay?"

1000
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,901
"They want you
to donate your time."

1001
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,638
"I think I'm busy."

1002
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,240
"They told me to let you know
you have a warrant

1003
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,242
in the city
of Fresno, California."

1004
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,112
I'm like, "Oh, they're good."

1005
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,781
So I did the show.

1006
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,416
And I'm gonna tell
you guys right now---

1007
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,917
I'm gonna tell you guys
right now,

1008
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,153
it was one of the scariest shows
I ever did.

1009
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,656
A room full of nothing but cops.

1010
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,424
Everybody's drinking a lot.

1011
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:19,229
And I'm scared, because if they
get ghetto, who do I call?

1012
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,531
You know, I got to go out
in the parking lot

1013
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,666
and find some gang member.

1014
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,735
"Hey, back me up!"

1015
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,103
So the show went good.

1016
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,706
It went so good that they
asked me to do another show

1017
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,374
in California, in San Diego,

1018
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,344
for the California
Highway Patrol Border Division.

1019
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,979
And I tried to make up an excuse

1020
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,314
that my car
wasn't working right.

1021
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,649
They said, "No worries.
We understand."

1022
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,919
They sent a patrol car
to my house

1023
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,088
with a freaking
uniformed officer.

1024
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,957
And I was like, "Oh, my God."

1025
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,829
Best part was I didn't tell
my family he was coming.

1026
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,364
Oh, yeah, sometimes
you have to create

1027
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,299
your own entertainment.

1028
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,467
It was hysterical.

1029
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,668
5:00 rolled around.

1030
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,303
I'm like, "He should be here
any minute."

1031
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,272
Sure enough...
[imitates doorbell ringing]

1032
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,773
"Frankie!

1033
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,442
Frankie, can you
get the door, please?"

1034
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,210
"Okay, Gabriel."
So he goes to the door.

1035
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,379
Comes back, and he's got,
like---you know, he's like...

1036
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,147
[whispering]
"Gabriel.

1037
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,017
Gabriel, the police are here."

1038
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,719
"Why are you whispering?"

1039
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,221
'"Cause something's
gonna happen."

1040
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,889
When he said that, I'm like,

1041
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,692
"Oh, I got to freaking
let him have it now, right?"

1042
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,894
I said, "Oh, my God, Frankie,
they found me."

1043

We got to see Chico's."

1389
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,105
You watch, man.

1390
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,807
There'll be people freaking out.

1391
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,942
[British accent]
"I say, we must go try Chico's."

1392
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,144
[laughter]

1393
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,311
"It sounds splendid."

1394
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,479
"Yes, it does."

1395
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,647
"Drink a taco.

1396
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,049
"I never thought
I'd see the day.

1397
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,283
"I'm going to try it.

1398
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,519
El Paso it is."

1399
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,220
Oh, man.

1400
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,456
But, no. I got Chico's Tacos
and cakes.

1401
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,624
[cheering]

1402
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,292
You know?

1403
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,328
One night at one show,

1404
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,198
I received 1 1 chocolate cakes.

1405
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,634
And it was local,
so I took 'em home.

1406
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,269
And that is an argument

1407
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,404
that nobody in this building
has ever had

1408
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,972
at 3:00 in the morning.

1409
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,742
'Cause you don't just walk
into the house with 1 1 cakes.

1410
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:20,943
You make some noise.

1411
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,178
You know.

1412
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,814
[imitates doors slamming open
and footsteps]

1413
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,884
And I walk in
with the last two cakes,

1414
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,319
and my girlfriend's
in the kitchen.

1415
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,154
And she's, like,
"What the hell is this?!"

1416
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,956
I'm trying to be cute.
"It's a bakery."

1417
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,058
[laughter and applause]

1418
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,895
"Where did you get
all this cake?"

1419
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,598
I said, "Baby, the people
at the show brought it."

1420
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,867
"Are you gonna eat all of it?"

1421
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,535
"Eventually.

1422
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,305
I'm not gonna do it
in one hit, you know?"

1423
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,440
Freaking two hours later.
"Clear!"

1424
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,944
[laughter]

1425
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,380
"How do you know someone
isn't trying to poison you?"

1426
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,748
"With cake?
Are you serious?"

1427
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,684
It's, like,
you live by the cake,

1428
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,886
you die by the cake, you know?

1429
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,221
No.

1430
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,489
Uh-uh.

1431
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,958
So we're going back
and forth, right?

1432
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,359
We wake up Frankie,

1433
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,927
and Frankie walks
into the kitchen

1434
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,130
at 3:00 in the morning,
and he's, all...

1435
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,398
[mumbling]

1436
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,604
"Where did all the cake
come from?"

1437
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,772
"The people
at the show brought it."

1438
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,341
"Tell 'em I said thank you."

1439
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,043
"I'll tell 'em
you said thank you, Frankie."

1440
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,812
"Gabriel, how come
they bring you cake?"

1441
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,515
'"Cause ten years ago,
I did a joke where I said,

1442
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,583
'"I love chocolate cake.'

1443
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,152
Now people bring me cake."

1444
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,287
"You should say
you love Transformers."

1445
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,889
[laughter]

1446
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,624
I'll start doing it, all right?

1447
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,325
So my girl's, like,
"Baby, put Frankie to bed."

1448
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,227
I go, "Frankie,
you got to go back to sleep."

1449
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,795
[grunting]
"Want some cake?"

1450
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,197
"Yeah."

1451
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,533
So I grab one of these tiny
cakes that somebody brought me.

1452
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,901
One of those little tiny ones

1453
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,069
that has the plastic cover
and the sticker on the side.

1454
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,771
And I handed to him.
I go, "Here."

1455
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,173
He goes, "A little piece?"

1456
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,275
I go, "Dude, it's a small cake.

1457
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,277
You can have the whole thing."

1458
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,279
And the look
that came over his face

1459
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,183
at 3:00 in the morning
was like he got a gift from God.

1460
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,584
[laughter]

1461
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,386
I said, "Here,"
and he was, like....

1462
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,855
[humming reverential
religious tune]

1463
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,027
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

1464
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,129
[whistling and applause]

1465
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,599
"Take it to your room."

1466
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,901
[singing in Latin]

1467
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,003
[laughter and applause]

1468
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,745
I went to go take him
to school the next morning.

1469
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,614
He's in the bathroom crying.

1470
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,115
[imitates sobbing]

1471
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,617
"Hey, are you okay?"

1472
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,052
"Oh, my stomach!"

1473
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,253
"Your stomach?

1474
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,487
Too much cake?"

1475
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,722
"Yeah."

1476
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,023
"Was it good?"

1477
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,291
"Hell, yeah."

1478
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,859
"I'll see you in the car."

1479
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,962
20 minutes later,
he comes to the car,

1480
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,230
and he's all sweaty.

1481
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,664
[breathing heavily]

1482
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,032
"You all right? What happened?"

1483
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:58,234
"I blew it up."

1484
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,401
"Get in the car."

1485
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,036
[imitates engine revving]

1486
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,339
I get him to school
45 minutes late.

1487
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,474
Usually, when I drop him off,
you guys,

1488
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,710
I leave him on the side
of the school,

1489
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,411
and they have, like,
a drop-off zone

1490
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,247
with cones and a supervisor

1491
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,549
to make sure
that your kid gets off safely.

1492
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,684
When you're 45 minutes late,
there's nobody there,

1493
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,053
so I left him
in front of the school.

1494
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,355
And apparently, that's a no-no.

1495
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,889
You're not supposed to do that.

1496
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,258
I didn't know, you know?

1497
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,459
[engine purring, tires squeal]

1498
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,693
"Go for it."

1499
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,228
"I'm not supposed to..."

1500
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,297
"I know, dude. Just go.
You're late. Go."

1501
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,765
[grunting]

1502
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,066
[door closes, squeaking]

1503
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,768
Out of nowhere,
here comes the principal.

1504
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,903
And I know it's the principal,
'cause he's, like,

1505
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,372
"It's the principal!
It's the principal!

1506
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:37,806
It's the principal!
It's the principal!"

1507
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,442
"Dude, relax. I'm 30.
I don't give a damn."

1508
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,344
Here comes the principal.

1509
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,749
"Sir? Sir, this is not
the designated drop-off area.

1510
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,952
"Please take your child to
the other side of the school.

1511
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,954
You cannot leave him here."

1512
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,155
I was, like...

1513
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,024
[whispering]
"Watch this."

1514
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,358
Senora...

1515
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,661
[speaking Spanish]

1516
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,763
[laughter]

1517
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,835
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

1518
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,671
"That's how you do it, homeboy.

1519
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,039
That's how you do it."

1520
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,342
That principal was amazing,
'cause she was, like,

1521
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,378
"Usted no puede
dejar su hijo aqui.

1522
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,649
"Saca la huelta a la otro lado
de Ia escueIa.

1523
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,320
"Aya, si, si,
aqui, no, no.

1524
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,790
"Aya, si, si, aqui, no, no.

1525
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,026
Yo no soy pendeja."

1526
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,362
[applause, cheering
and laughter]

1527
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,338
Did that really happen?

1528
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,639
Yes.

1529
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,140
Mm-hmm.

1530
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,710
I felt so bad 'cause when
I picked up Frankie, he's like,

1531
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:48,877
"The principal yelled at me."

1532
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,878
I'm like, "I'm sorry."

1533
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:50,913
"I'm gonna tell my mom."

1534
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,781
"No.

1535
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,083
It's all right, dude."

1536
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,151
We're having a good time
right now with his mom.

1537
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,386
And it sucks, you guys,

1538
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,288
'cause we got into a fight
that weekend.

1539
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,590
Eh... it was not too big,

1540
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,126
but it was, like, it was---
it could have been prevented.

1541
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,062
My girlfriend's backing
the car up out of the driveway,

1542
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,397
and somebody had left,
like, this---

1543
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,498
I guess they were moving,

1544
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,167
and they left this big box
behind the car,

1545
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,369
and my girlfriend's backing up,

1546
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,337
and I go,
"Baby, baby, there's a box."

1547
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,338
"I got it."

1548
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,506
[crashing sound]

1549
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,640
[laughter]

1550
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:19,908
Even Frankie was like,

1551
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,877
"Mom, he told you
there was a box right there."

1552
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,278
"Shut up!"

1553
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,914
So we get inside the house,
and I looked at her and I said,

1554
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,517
"What the hell is your problem?"

1555
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,419
And sure enough,
Frankie walks up.

1556
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,854
[whimpering
"You guys are going to fight."

1557
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,422
I'm like, "Oh, shoot---
no, no, no, I'm sorry, Frankie.

1558
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,423
We're not fighting."

1559
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,424
"You're yelling at my mom."

1560
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:36,792
"No, no, no, no, no,
I love your mom.

1561
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,827
She just didn't hear me."

1562
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:39,862
"You're not mad at her?"

1563
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:40,929
"No, I'm not mad at your mom.

1564
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,664
"Baby, I love you, I love you.

1565
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,299
See, I love your mom---
I love you."

1566
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,467
[kissing]

1567
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,769
"I love your mom;
everything's cool.

1568
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,303
"You want to go play
some video games or something?

1569
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,239
Come on, I'll go play with you."
"Okay." "Okay, come on.

1570
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,907
I'm not mad at your mom,
dude, come on, let's go.

1571
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,175
Say bye to your mom."
"Bye, Mom."

1572
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,443
"Come on, let's go,
come on, we're cool.

1573
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:55,811
I'm not mad at her;
come on, let's go."

1574
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,213
[mouthing]

1575
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,718
"Come on, let's go."

1576
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,586
See, some of you are laughing,
some are like,

1577
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,588
"Did---
can he really say that?"

1578
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,358
[laughing]
I snuck it in there, huh?

1579
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,526
[sighs]

1580
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,127
No, no fighting.

1581
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,797
But I had to make up the fact
that I yelled at Frankie.

1582
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:17,199
I go, "Frankie, whatever
you want to do, let's do it."

1583
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,634
"Gabriel, can we go
to an arcade?"

1584
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:19,802
"Arcade?

1585
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,838
Dude, you have a Nintendo Wii
at your house."

1586
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,073
And then I had a flashback
to 20 years ago.

1587
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,308
[in shrill voice]
"¿Que, que? Arcade?

1588
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,177
"Cabron, tu tienes
un Nintendo en la casa.

1589
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,112
You have a Nintendo at home."

1590
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,815
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I'm turning into my mom.

1591
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,849
Come on, dude, let's go."

1592
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,350
[imitates engine]

1593
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,253
I take him to this big old
freaking arcade, right?

1594
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,522
And I felt so out of it
because I didn't know

1595
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,058
you couldn't put money
in the machines anymore.

1596
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,526
I'm---
Man, I remember quarters.

1597
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,594
I'm thinking,
"Here, five bucks,"

1598
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,662
and he's, like,
looking at me like,

1599
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,497
"Hmm?"

1600
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:49,565
"What? Go play,"

1601
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,866
and he's like---
he came right back.

1602
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,967
"All done."
I'm like, "Dude."

1603
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,235
I didn't know this.

1604
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,670
You have to go
to another machine,

1605
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,638
put in money,
and then it gives you a card,

1606
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,141
and then you swipe that card
to play video games.

1607
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,810
And the game he wants to play
doesn't cost a quarter.

1608
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,479
It costs three dollars.

1609
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,713
A game.

1610
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,982
Big old machine called
Dance Dance Revolution.

1611
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:07,983
[light cheering]

1612
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:08,984
Some of you know this game?

1613
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,552
Yeah, maybe, sort of.

1614
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,155
For those of you that don't know
the game, it's pretty simple.

1615
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,023
It's a dancing game,
and there's a big screen

1616
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,391
and then arrows come out
to music,

1617
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,860
and whatever arrow comes out,

1618
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,597
that's the arrow you have
to step on when it comes out.

1619
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,700
Kind of cool,
but all the music is techno

1620
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,368
and it's loud.

1621
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:28,003
I know I'm getting older
'cause I'm like,

1622
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,138
"They got to turn that down."

1623
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,674
[as male announcer] "Dance
Dance Revolution Revolution.

1624
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:33,809
Get ready."

1625
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,244
And the kids are like,
"I'm ready."

1626
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,112
"Select music."

1627
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:40,482
[beatboxing techno]

1628
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,483
[light cheering]

1629
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,851
And that's what they dance to.

1630
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,386
"Ready, go!"

1631
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:47,422
[beatboxing techno]

1632
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,892
[audience cheering]

1633
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,067
"Perfect."
And the kid's like, "Whoo!"

1634
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:03,438
And I'm like...
[panting]

1635
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,408
I love this game,

1636
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:09,344
but they need to have something
that's more fluffy-friendly,

1637
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,514
so that fluffy people
and parents can hang and enjoy.

1638
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,617
We're watching this game
for over an hour.

1639
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,352
I told Frankie,
"Let's go play another game

1640
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,922
and then we'll come back
when the line goes down."

1641
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,623
"The line never goes down."

1642
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,824
Great.

1643
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,827
So I'm watching kid
after kid after kid.

1644
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,364
You know, like, "Serious?

1645
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,732
How much is it?"

1646
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,067
"It's three dollars a dance."

1647
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,569
"Three dollars a dance?"

1648
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,803
And then I thought about it.

1649
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,472
Well, I paid $20
two nights ago, so...

1650
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,141
I guess three dollars
isn't that bad.

1651
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,242
[laughs]

1652
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:43,445
Now that I think about it.

1653
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,080
Some of you are clapping,
some are like,

1654
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,715
"I don't get it."

1655
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,818
Yeah, whatever, anyway.

1656
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,920
So kid after kid.

1657
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,690
Then I found something out.

1658
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:58,460
You can always spot that one kid
who you just know

1659
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,729
is going to grow up
to be a little bit more...

1660
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,565
creative...

1661
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,934
than others
by the way he plays the game.

1662
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,070
And all the other little kids---
they know something's up.

1663
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,237
They're like, "You got to watch.

1664
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,939
"When Benji plays,
you got to watch.

1665
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,541
Watch."

1666
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,476
Sure enough,
here comes Benji, right?

1667
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,211
"Dance Dance Revolution.

1668
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,346
Get ready."

1669
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,748
[in effeminate voice]
"I'm so ready."

1670
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,486
I'm like, "Whoa...
oh, it's on."

1671
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,021
"Select music."

1672
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,524
[beatboxing techno]

1673
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,959
"Ready, go!"

1674
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,594
This dude took off.

1675
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:35,697
[beatboxing techno]

1676
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,274
[audience cheering]

1677
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,846
"Perfect."

1678
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,681
"I know."

1679
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,349
I'm like, "Wow."

1680
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,517
Frankie's like, "I'm next."

1681
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,119
I go, "You can't follow that.

1682
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,287
"You better come over here and
play some Street Fighter, man.

1683
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:00,756
"Let me show you
how to throw a fireball.

1684
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,491
Get your butt over here."

1685
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,860
Oh, my God.

1686
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,229
I had to make it up to him
another way.

1687
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,330
I had to take him...

1688
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,799
to Disneyland.

1689
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,668
I stopped going to Disneyland
a long time ago.

1690
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:13,835
Because you know what?

1691
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:17,205
Those roller coasters
are not fluffy-friendly.

1692
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,407
Disney cares.

1693
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,708
That's why there's safety there.

1694
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,610
You know, they have
all those different harnesses.

1695
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,681
And if you're over 300 pounds,
just stay in the parking lot.

1696
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,449
You know, 'cause they got
the whole, you know...

1697
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:31,953
[clicking]

1698
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,989
You're fluffy, forget it.

1699
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,992
That's why I love
a ghetto-ass carnival.

1700
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,594
You know, those ones
they build in, like, six hours?

1701
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,963
I can still ride
those roller coasters.

1702
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,032
It's only one bar,
three clicks, that's it.

1703
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,067
If it locks, good.

1704
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,669
If it doesn't, "Hold on!"

1705
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,372
[hissing, clicking]

1706
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,907
Plus, fluffy people never fall.

1707
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:52,908
We never fall.

1708
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,042
You know who falls?

1709
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,777
The skinny guy
that got stuck next to us.

1710
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,512
[laughter]

1711
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:59,448
That's who...
[screams]

1712
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,449
More room.

1713
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,852
[laughs]

1714
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,487
But me and Disney, no.

1715
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:06,555
No mas.

1716
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,291
But I had to
because I messed up.

1717
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,960
I fell asleep on the couch,
and I woke up all, you know...

1718
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:12,994
[groaning]

1719
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,496
...and Frankie was watching TV.

1720
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:18,734
He goes, "Look, Gabriel,
look, Disneyland."

1721
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:20,902
And I was like, "Dude,
what's the big deal, okay?

1722
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:21,903
"It's Disneyland.

1723
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,172
What, you've never gone?"

1724
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,477
all: Aw...

1725
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,747
- "My dad never took me."

1726
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,783
Oh, mother...

1727
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:36,685
Next morning...

1728
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,019

1729
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,020
[brakes screeching]

of Disney."

1732
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,026
We walk in the park;
he's all happy.

1733
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,895
[laughs]

1734
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,397
We get into the middle
of the park, and he's so funny.

1735
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,199
He starts getting winded.

1736
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,169
I thought it was hysterical
because up until then,

1737
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,037
I only saw myself get like that,
you know.

1738
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,573
[panting]

1739
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,075
So to see
a little ten-year-old version...

1740
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,643
[high-pitched panting]

1741
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,744
[shrieks]

1742
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,312
[laughing]
Hysterical. I was dying.

1743
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,181
I go, "Frankie,
you want to take a break?"

1744
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,683
"Mm-hmm, Gabriel,
this park is big."

1745
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,951
I'm like, "See?

1746
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:13,121
"It's not a small world
after all.

1747
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,290
Like, whatever, dude, sit down."

1748
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,325
So we're sitting down, waiting.

1749
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,961
All of a sudden, I start getting
recognized at Disneyland,

1750
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,196
and that, for me, was cool.

1751
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,564
You know,
people were walking by.

1752
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,800
[indistinct whispering]

1753
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,668
"Fluffy, can we take a picture?"

1754
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:27,803
"Sure."

1755
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,604
[whooshing]
And then... more people.

1756
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:30,939
"It's him."

1757
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,574
"It's that guy."

1758
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:33,975
"Pikachu."

1759
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,610
Now I have, like,
ten people around me

1760
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,746
like I'm a new character
at the park.

1761
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,681
Best part is
Frankie starts getting annoyed.

1762
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,116
He's like...

1763
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,685
[groaning] "Why don't
they leave you alone?"

1764
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,254
"Frankie, these are the people
that come to the shows.

1765
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:49,124
They're the reason
why you have a PlayStation."

1766
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,559
[exhaling]

1767
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,595
[as Frankie]
"Thank you."

1768
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,764
"Here, now, start taking
the pictures."

1769
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:56,865
[laughs]

1770
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,099
So I told Frankie,

1771
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,467
"Frankie, what ride
are you going to get on?"

1772
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:00,502
"Ride?"
"Yeah.

1773
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,003
What ride do you want
to get on?"

1774
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,906
"I don't want to get on a ride."

1775
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,475
"What the hell are we doing
at Disneyland?"

1776
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,377
"The commercial said
that Disneyland is

1777
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,813
the happiest place on Earth."

1778
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,216
"Oh, my God.

1779
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,484
"That's IHOP.

1780
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,021
The hell are we doing here?"

1781
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,993
We're hanging out at IHOP, and,
you know, we started talking,

1782
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,096
and it was kind of like a little
bonding moment because Frankie---

1783
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,765
his dad isn't in the picture and
my dad wasn't in the picture,

1784
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,234
so for some reason, you know,

1785
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,769
we got a little connection
going on and it's pretty cool.

1786
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,838
Frankie told me something,
and it got me right here.

1787
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,640
He goes--- you know,
I'm talking to him.

1788
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,041
I said, "Frankie," I says,

1789
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,278
"do you ever want to, you know,
talk or see your real dad?"

1790
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,448
And he goes,
"You are my real dad."

1791
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,184
I was like, "Oh..."

1792
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,819
And then he followed it up
with this---

1793
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,455
"I want my last name
to be Iglesias."

1794
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,790
[grunting]

1795
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,025
And then his mom walked in.

1796
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,994
"Me too."

1797
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,763

they work together.

1798
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:02,831

Eh, another time, I took 'em
to IHOP, you guys--- too funny.

1803
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,610
We walk in there,
we got my buddy Noah.

1804
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,747
We went to go eat, tore it up,
walked out into the parking lot,

1805
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,249
and discovered
that my car had been stolen.

1806
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,250

1807
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,485

"We got to walk."

1811
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,226
My buddy Noah---
he's trying to be helpful.

1812
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,094
He's like, "Gabriel,
don't you have OnStar?"

1813
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,330
I'm like, "Yeah,
but it's in the car, stupid."

1814
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,332
"Well, can't you call
the 800 number?

1815
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,700
Maybe they can track your car."

1816
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,335
I'm like, "Oh, shoot,
Noah, you're a genius."

1817
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,703

1818

1819
