1
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:53,761
Okay. My turn, my turn.
Um, I got one.

2
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,097
Great, but can you make it

3
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:56,631
a little more challenging
this time?

4
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,667
Okay. Check this out.

5
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:03,604
I spy with my little eye

6
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:07,075
something yellow

7
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:11,479
and round,
and it eats dots.

8
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,916
Seriously, Ralph?

9
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,450
Yeah, seriously.
You're never gonna get it.

10
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,887
Well, obviously,
it's Pac-Man.

11
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,454
No, that's not

12
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,890
Why is that obvious?

13
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:23,759
Name one other thing
in this whole arcade

14
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:26,094
that is yellow and round
and eats dots.

15
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:27,595
I can name two things.

16
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,797
Ms. Pac-Man
and Baby Pac-Man.

17
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,766
Boom!
I accept your apology.

18
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,969
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
But was it Pac-Man?

19
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,871
Yeah, you got me.

20
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:38,907
Knew it.
All right, riddle me this

21
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,611
do you or do you not think
that Zangief waxes?

22
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,545
No way. Look at the guy.
He looks like a yeti.

23
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:45,914
I don't know.

24
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,950
I mean, if the fur
were confined to his chest,

25
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:49,117
I might agree

26
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,652
but look at those
two very specific

27
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,087
tuffets of shin hair

28
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,622
poking out of his boots.

29
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:56,658
That does not just happen,
Ralph. That is a choice.

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,627
You're totally right, kid.

31
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:00,929
He's baby smooth
everywhere else.

32
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,931
I rest my case.

33
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,601
My mind is blown!

34
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,002
Let's go get a root beer.

35
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:10,172
Okay, let's see
what you got, kid.

36
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,840
Ooh!

37
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,842
Nice one. Okay.

38
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,577
I think I got one
in the chamber.

39
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,614
Ew!

40
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,549
Gross.
Thank you.

41
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:21,817
Hey, wanna sneak into Tron?

42
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,652
Doesn't that game
have a virus?

43
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:26,121
No. I'm sure
they fixed it.

44
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:27,990
Whoo!

45
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:30,459
I'm gonna beat
my speed record!

46
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,962
Hey, wait for me!

47
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,137
Ralph.

48
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:43,672
Yeah?

49
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,843
I don't think
they fixed the game.

50
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:47,912
Uh No.

51
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:50,013
Help!

52
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:52,182
Hey, Tron!

53
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:53,984
Tronny!

54
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:56,720
Tronny boy!

55
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,722
Help!

56
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,056
Do you realize

57
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,759
we're basically just, like,
zeroes and ones

58
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,529
floating around the universe
like tiny specks of dust?

59
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:08,897
Like, doesn't the very nature

60
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,666
of our existence
make you wonder

61
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,001
if there's more to life
than this?

62
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,870
Why would I wonder
if there's more to life

63
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:17,105
when the life
I got is perfect?

64
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,741
I mean, sure. Doesn't
look so hot on paper.

65
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,710
I'm just a bad guy
from some old video game

66
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:22,878
who wrecks a building.

67
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,513
And yeah, for 27 years,

68
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:26,815
I was a total zero
without any friends.

69
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,884
But now,
I got a best friend

70
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,152
who just happens to be

71
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:32,020
the coolest kid
in the whole arcade.

72
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:34,022
Aw, thanks, pal.

73
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,025
Watch this.

74
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:39,195
Home run!

75
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:40,731
All right, let's go
watch the sunrise.

76
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:43,098
Are you really saying

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,201
there's not one single,
solitary thing

78
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,270
about your life
that you would change?

79
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:49,272
Well, think about it.

80
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:52,208
You and me get to
goof off all night long.

81
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,843
Litwak shows up, we go to
work, we put in our hours.

82
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,212
Then the arcade closes

83
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:58,214
and we get to do it
all over again.

84
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,916
The only thing I might do
different in that scenario

85
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:02,951
would be not having
to go to work.

86
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,754
Other than that,
I wouldn't change a thing.

87
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:06,955
Huh?

88
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:10,193
Hey, where'd our sunrise go?

89
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:12,230
All right,
let's get you plugged in.

90
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,132
That's a plug-in alert.

91
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,633
Litwak hasn't plugged in
a new game in forever.

92
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,802
Let's go see what it is!
Yeah!

93
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,904
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Minor emergency.

94
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,141
Hey, Felix, Calhoun,
what's getting plugged in?

95
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:26,775
Well, Ralph, Sonic thinks

96
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:28,844
it's gonna be
a new pinball machine.

97
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,346
What do you think,
lady love?

98
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:33,983
I'll bet you a shiny nickel
it's a blood pressure machine.

99
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:36,085
Kids love those things.
Ooh.

100
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,821
Please be a racing game.
Please be a racing game.

101
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,658
Please be a racing game.

102
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,762
"Whiffee"? Or, "Wifey"?

103
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,033
Well, it's either wiffle ball,
or an arranged marriage game.

104
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,767
It's actually pronounced
"Wi-Fi," Ralph.

105
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:52,935
Yeah, that's what I said.

106
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:54,669
And Wi-Fi is the Internet

107
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,938
which is an online community

108
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,106
where human beings
go to shop

109
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:58,941
and play games and socialize.

110
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,709
Ooh, fun!

111
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,111
Oh, no, it is not.

112
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:04,347
That sign right there
says "Wi-Fi."

113
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,816
What it should say
is "Die-Fi."

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,054
That's a little humor there.

115
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,156
But seriously, the Internet
is nothing to laugh at.

116
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:14,924
It is new, it is different,

117
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:16,359
and therefore
we should fear it.

118
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,761
So keep out, for Pete's sake,
and get to work.

119
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,863
The arcade's about to open.

120
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:23,733
Figures, we finally get
something new plugged in

121
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,667
and we're not even allowed
to go in there.

122
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,636
Totally not fair.

123
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:30,206
A new racing game
would've been cool.

124
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,240
Something wrong
with your game?

125
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:32,809
No, no.

126
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,211
It's just every bonus level's
been unlocked.

127
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,213
I know every shortcut.

128
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,982
Man, I'd kill for even
just a new track.

129
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:42,885
New track? You already got,
like, three choices.

130
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,220
Yeah, I know,
but don't you ever wish

131
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,655
something new
and different

132
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:46,989
would happen in your game?

133
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,057
Nope.

134
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,160
Really? Well,
agree to disagree.

135
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:53,029
Wait, I don't wanna disagree.

136
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,730
No, no. It's just
a fancy way to say

137
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,232
we don't have to
argue about it.

138
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,067
We're arguing?
I don't wanna argue.

139
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,770
Relax. Stop making it
a thing.

140
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:03,406
Go to work. I'll see you
tonight, stench vessel.

141
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:04,373
All right.

142
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:12,050
She wants a new track,
I'll give her a new track.

143
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,223
Come on, Nafisa!
Let's play Sugar Rush!

144
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:21,057
Pick Vanellope, Swati.

145
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,792
She's got
the best superpower.

146
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:25,194
Yeah, the glitch. I love her.

147
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,195
Drivers,

148
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:28,431
start your engines.

149
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,300
You're gonna lose today,
Princess.

150
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:34,438
While, yes, I am technically
a princess, Taffyta

151
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,441
I'd rather you just think of
me as plain old Vanellope

152
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,942
the racer who's about to
kick your butt.

153
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,847
Three, two, one, go!

154
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,888
And pardon me, excuse me,
coming through.

155
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,757
Whoo-hoo!

156
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,060
Whoo!

157
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:02,098
And one, two, three gumballs
right on cue.

158
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,066
Yeah, I love it
when she glitches.

159
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,039
Ooh! Huh.

160
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,141
Excuse me.
I must have fallen asleep.

161
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:14,278
Oh, fun. I'm winning.

162
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:18,080
Vanellope takes a huge lead.

163
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:20,718
No one's gonna catch her now.

164
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,456
She's gonna love this.

165
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,395
Right on time.

166
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:32,995
What?

167
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,966
"Looking for something new

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,267
"and different?

169
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:40,337
"Then take this track."

170
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,372
Oh, Ralph,
you old son-of-a-gun.

171
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,840
I'd say I got a little time
for a detour.

172
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,276
Whoa!

173
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:49,146
Hey, look, I think
I unlocked a new track.

174
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:51,914
Never seen that before.

175
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,352
This is awesome!

176
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,521
Hey, thanks, Ralph!

177
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:59,323
You're welcome!

178
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,091
Get back up
on the track, Swati.

179
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:02,459
You're going to lose.

180
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,929
I can't.
It's like it's driving itself.

181
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:10,133
Whoo!

182
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,036
What is wrong with
this thing?

183
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,371
What?

184
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,314
No, no!

185
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:23,815
Kid!

186
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:33,190
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

187
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,158
Kid! Kid!

188
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,892
Oh, kid, I'm so sorry,
are you okay?

189
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:38,894
Oh, my gosh.

190
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,330
What an amazing track!

191
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,166
Thank you, Ralph! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

192
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,501
You're welcome!

193
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:47,070
You know I take my duty
as your hero very seriously.

194
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,238
Wait a minute.

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,140
You took a serious
doody where?

196
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,577
Vanellope, get up here.

197
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,214
We have a situation.

198
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:00,417
Mr. Litwak, the Vanellope
racer wasn't working

199
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,387
and I think maybe I
turned the wheel too hard.

200
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,222
Whoa.
I'm real sorry.

201
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:06,556
It's okay, Swati.

202
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,425
I think I can get it back
on there pretty easy.

203
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,927
What did you do, Ralph?
Nothing.

204
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,029
Leave him alone.

205
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,964
He was just trying to
make the game more exciting.

206
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,967
Yeah, why don't you relax,
Taffyta? Litwak will fix it.

207
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,969
All right, on you

208
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:20,570
Oh!

209
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,906
Okay. Still not a problem.

210
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:24,107
He'll just order a new part.

211
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,375
Well, I'd order a new part

212
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:27,077
but the company
that made Sugar Rush

213
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,245
went out of business
years ago.

214
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,114
I can try to find one
on the Internet.

215
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,215
Good idea.
Oh, me too.

216
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:33,984
Good luck, that'll be like
finding a needle in a

217
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,519
I found one! On ebay!

218
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,254
Really? How about that?

219
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,456
See? Those kids
have it under control.

220
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,491
They're just gonna get
another wheel from the eboy.

221
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,293
Are you
kidding me? How much?

222
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,595
That's more than this game
makes in a year.

223
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,230
Aw, I hate to say it,

224
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,566
but my salvage guy
is coming on Friday

225
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,369
and it might be time to sell
Sugar Rush for parts.

226
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:55,439
Aww.
Where's he going?

227
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,107
Litwak's gonna
unplug the game.

228
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:58,241
Get out of here!
Go, scram, let's go, run!

229
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,677
Go, run, run,
run, run!

230
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,799
Let's go!
Run!

231
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,253
Gangway!

232
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:11,288
Yeah,
you heard him, gangway!

233
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,423
Stop it! No running!

234
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,325
What are you people doing
out of your game,

235
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:16,493
for Peter's sake?

236
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,462
The arcade is open!

237
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,263
Sugar Rush
is getting unplugged.

238
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:30,340
We're homeless!
Yeah, yeah, we're homeless!

239
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:32,976
Oh, what are we going to do?

240
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:36,380
Y'all, calm down, calm down.
Get a hold of yourselves.

241
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,014
I don't want to be gameless.

242
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:41,218
An unplugging.
Good Lord.

243
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,320
I haven't seen
this many gameless characters

244
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:45,324
since Space Invaders
went down.

245
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,124
Um

246
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,159
Where are we gonna live?

247
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,529
Well, you can stay here until
the arcade closes, I guess

248
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,063
and then we'll figure out

249
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,967
where the heck
we're gonna put you all.

250
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:11,183
Okay.

251
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,384
Here we go.

252
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,652
I raided Gene's fridge.

253
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,053
Good news, he's got pie.

254
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,556
Took a bunch of his pillows
and junk, too.

255
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,992
I'm thinking we make a fort
up here, or like a yurt.

256
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,694
Or we could take
these pillows

257
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,061
If we stack them right,

258
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,164
we can make an igloo
out of pillows.

259
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,334
Like a pillow igloo.
Pigloo. Pigloo!

260
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,302
So what do you think, kid?

261
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,374
Fort, yurt, or the obvious
best choice, pigloo?

262
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:39,377
I can't believe I don't have
a game anymore.

263
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,547
I mean, like, what am I
gonna do all day?

264
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:45,216
What? Come on,
are you kidding?

265
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,684
You sleep in,
you do no work,

266
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,085
then you go to Tapper's
with me every night.

267
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,054
I've literally
just described paradise.

268
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,056
But I loved my game.

269
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:54,024
Oh, come on.

270
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,326
You were just bellyaching
about the tracks

271
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,494
being too easy.

272
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,663
No, that doesn't mean
I didn't love it.

273
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, sure,
it was kind of predictable

274
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:07,037
but still I never really knew
what might happen in a race.

275
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,606
And it's that,
it's that feeling,

276
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,576
that not-knowing-what's-
coming-next feeling.

277
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,648
That's the stuff.
That feels like life to me.

278
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,017
And if I'm not a racer,
Ralph

279
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,386
what am I?

280
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:23,754
Well, you're my best friend.

281
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,189
That's not enough.

282
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,324
Hey.

283
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:28,159
No, I just

284
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:31,130
I'm sorry,
I know I'm being weird.

285
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,734
I think maybe I just need
to be alone right now.

286
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:37,770
Oh.

287
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:41,305
Okay.

288
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,776
I'll meet you over at Tapper's
in a little while, I guess.

289
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:46,513
If you want.

290
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,314
All right, now

291
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,582
we found some good homes

292
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,518
for so many of our chums
from Sugar Rush

293
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,286
and we're just hoping
a few more of you

294
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,454
will open your doors

295
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,456
and your hearts
to those in need.

296
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,259
Well, I suppose
that large green olive

297
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,094
will fit in nicely
with my decor.

298
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,329
I'm a sour ball.

299
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:08,132
Well, beggars can't be
choosers, can they?

300
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,667
Come along, condiment.

301
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:11,435
Mm-kay.

302
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:14,407
Marvelous.
That just leaves the racers.

303
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,807
We're, like, adorable.

304
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,576
You sure are.

305
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,745
So, any takers?

306
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,715
Um

307
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,452
Anyone?

308
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,690
Felix, I know
we've never once talked about

309
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,659
having a family before, but

310
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,561
I know, it feels
like the kind of thing

311
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,129
you just jump into
with both feet

312
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,865
and nary a plan.

313
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,667
Felix and I will
give them sanctuary.

314
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,202
Can I get a quick word
with you two?

315
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,607
Look, I get it.

316
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,309
You've been married
six years,

317
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,711
you're looking to
spice things up

318
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:54,813
but trust me,
adopting 15 children

319
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,647
is the wrong kind of spice.

320
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,583
Those things
are basically feral.

321
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:03,588
Pardon me, sir, but those
youngsters are lambs.

322
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,391
Lost little lambs in need of
two kind, caring shepherds.

323
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,559
That's right.

324
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,730
Besides, how hard
can parenting be?

325
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,564
You treat the child
like your best friend

326
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,433
you give them
everything they want

327
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:16,868
and you just love
their little socks off.

328
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,235
Right, Tammy?

329
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,805
Darn-tootin'.

330
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,472
Huh?

331
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,642
Come and get it.

332
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:24,710
Get your own candle.

333
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:27,378
Hey, Mom,
why does your lame TV

334
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,880
only have one channel?

335
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:31,750
Well,
hate to say I told ya

336
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:33,351
Ow!

337
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,363
Hey, Tapper?

338
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,466
No, Ralph.
I haven't seen Vanellope.

339
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,535
Not since the last time
you asked me 30 seconds ago.

340
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:52,771
Sorry. I'm just
worried about her.

341
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:56,842
She's glitching like crazy,
and acting super insecure.

342
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,877
Oh. And get this,
she said

343
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,381
being friends with me
wasn't enough for her.

344
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:04,248
Not enough?
I'm a great friend!

345
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,917
Right, Tapper? Right?

346
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,285
I'm sorry.
Who's acting insecure?

347
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,655
Ralph, come on.

348
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:12,457
The kid just lost her game.
Give her a break.

349
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,560
There you are Oh.

350
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:16,662
Hey, Ralph.

351
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,230
Hey, Felix. Since when
do you drink root beer?

352
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,465
Since tonight.

353
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,501
Yeah, I hear you, buddy.

354
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,736
Hey, listen. This one was
supposed to be for Vanellope.

355
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:25,904
I guess you can have it.

356
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,639
Doesn't look like
she's coming.

357
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:28,807
Thanks.

358
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,509
You know,
I can't help but think

359
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:32,711
this whole mess
is somehow

360
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:35,414
partially my fault.

361
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,483
It figures. Just when
my life was perfect.

362
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,318
Mine was, too.

363
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,722
But, hey,
now I'm a father of 15.

364
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,324
Isn't that just a blessing?

365
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:53,365
Eeeee-oh-boy!

366
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,634
Wait. What'd
you say, Felix?

367
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,836
Um, isn't that
just a blessing?

368
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,438
No, the weird sound thing.

369
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,906
Oh. Eeeee-oh-boy?

370
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,941
Yeah. Eee-oh

371
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:04,309
Sorry, say it again?

372
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,311
Eeeee-oh-boy.
Eeeee-oh-boy!

373
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,447
Eee-oh-boy!
Eee-boy! Say it again?

374
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,614
Eeeee-oh-boy!
Eeeee-oh-boy.

375
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,950
Eeeee-oh-boy
eboy! eboy! eboy!

376
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:13,051
eboy? eboy?
eboy.

377
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:14,786
Yeah.

378
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:15,987
Um, what are you getting
at there, Ralph?

379
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:17,756
That kid out in the arcade

380
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:19,391
said there was
a steering wheel part

381
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:22,594
on the Internet, it's
something called eboy or

382
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,996
ebay! That's it,
it was ebay!

383
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,665
Ralph, are you thinking about

384
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,000
going to the Internet
and finding that part?

385
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,136
Getting that part's
the only thing

386
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,037
that's gonna fix the game
and that's the only thing

387
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,040
that's gonna make
Vanellope happy again.

388
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,874
And if Sugar Rush is fixed,

389
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,009
all those lovable scamps
living in my house

390
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,412
and destroying my sanity

391
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:42,848
will have homes
of their own again!

392
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,951
Ralph, this is an important mission.
A noble mission!

393
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:46,952
I will cover for you.

394
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,887
Thanks, pal.

395
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,556
Ralph, what about your tab?
You owe me for the root beer.

396
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,325
Oh, Felix is gonna
cover for me.

397
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:55,727
Drinks on the house, everybody!
Felix is paying.

398
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,564
Shoryuken!

399
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,867
Eeeee-oh-boy.

400
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,607
Boo!

401
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,742
Ralph, what is wrong
with you?

402
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:12,078
Start churning butter

403
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,679
and put on your church
shoes, little sister

404
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:17,649
'cause we're about to
blast off!

405
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,851
What are you
even talking about?

406
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:20,920
Oh, we're going to
the Internet.

407
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:21,854
What?

408
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,688
Yeah, to find the part
to fix your game.

409
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,756
No way!

410
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:25,992
Yeah, I probably
should've just said,

411
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,759
"We're going to the Internet."
We're going to the Internet!

412
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:29,962
Yeah, we are!

413
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,697
Hey, Surge,
are we glad to see you.

414
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,066
We want to report
some malfeasance

415
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:35,534
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

416
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,103
Yeah, we saw
some undesirables

417
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:39,738
causing a real donnybrook
over there.

418
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,874
Oh, heck no.
Not on my watch.

419
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,077
Appreciate the tip.

420
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,448
So, all we gotta do
is find this eboy place.

421
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,051
Ebay.
Right, ebay.

422
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,386
So we go there,
get the steering wheel

423
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:55,888
we have it delivered
to Litwak before Friday.

424
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,455
He'll fix your game.

425
00:17:57,457 --> 00:17:59,025
Everything goes back
to the way it was.

426
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,827
Boom! Happily ever after.

427
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,460
This is a shockingly sound,

428
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:03,963
well-thought-out idea
for you, Ralph.

429
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,097
No offense.

430
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,631
I know. And none taken.

431
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,800
Ooh, here it comes.

432
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls

433
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,073
I give you the Internet!

434
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,776
Huh.

435
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:18,811
The Internet is
not nearly as impressive

436
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:20,680
as how Sonic described it.

437
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,949
Yeah, I gotta admit,
I'm underwhelmed.

438
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,483
Where do you think
they keep their ebay?

439
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,451
Beats me.

440
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,553
Hello, anybody here?

441
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,989
Anyone? Hello!

442
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:32,158
We're looking for ebay!

443
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,061
Ooh. Did you hear that, kid?
Sweet echo.

444
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,528
Check this out.

445
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:42,602
Hoolie-hoo!
Hoolie-hoo!

446
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,804
Okay, connect to network.

447
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,906
Bingo.

448
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,979
Password is "high score"
with a zero instead of an "o."

449
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:52,812
Yes.

450
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:55,049
And we are online.

451
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,190
Hoolie-hoo!

452
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,792
Hoolie-hoolie-hoo!

453
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,494
Ooh, Ralph, look.

454
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,763
Cool. Mood lighting.

455
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,968
Ahhh! That's a gremlin!
Stay away! It's a gremlin!

456
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,438
It looks like
a tiny Mr. Litwak.

457
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:21,476
IP address 415-1037-483.

458
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,911
Oh, cool! Come on, Ralph,
let's follow him!

459
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,079
Hey, wait for me!
Kid, come back! Wait!

460
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,048
Hey!
Don't leave without me!

461
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,516
IP address 415-1037-483.

462
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,820
Vanellope!

463
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,622
I can't breathe.
I don't fit.

464
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:42,228
Whoo-hoo!

465
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,531
Yeah! Whoo!

466
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:58,911
Kid!

467
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,713
Ralph! Isn't this great?

468
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:02,615
No, it is not!

469
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,018
Whoo-hoo!

470
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,290
No, no, no.

471
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,199
Whoa!

472
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,161
Sweet mother
of monkey milk!

473
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,197
Whoa!

474
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,665
Kid, I don't think
we're in Litwak's anymore.

475
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,634
We most certainly
are not, friendo.

476
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:58,740
We are in the Internet!
Come on, Ralph!

477
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,249
Holy cow!

478
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:10,616
Look at all this stuff.

479
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:11,917
Whoa.

480
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,790
This is the most beautiful
miracle I've ever seen.

481
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,858
But it's so big.

482
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,094
It goes on
forever and ever.

483
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:22,628
How are we
possibly gonna find

484
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,829
ebay out there?

485
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,632
Hey, kid. Kid, don't worry.

486
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:27,868
I'm sure
there's someone out here

487
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,870
who could give us directions.
Oh!

488
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,271
Look at that little egg guy.

489
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,006
He's got on one of those hats
that smart people wear.

490
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:34,841
I bet he could
help us. Come on.

491
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,609
Welcome back
to the search bar, madam.

492
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,676
I hope you were able
to find

493
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,312

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,254
Where can I find ballet?

497
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:49,122
Ballet shoes? Ballet classes?
Ballet folklorico?

498
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,257
tights?

499
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:51,324
Girls' size small.

500
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:54,327
Oh, little Madeline's
trying ballet now, is she?

501
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,169
I hope this lasts longer
than the soccer phase.

502
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,033
Hmm.

503
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,902
I found 23 million results

504
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,304

girls' size small.

505
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,640

507
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:11,945
They never say thank you.

508
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,980
Oh, hello, sir.

509
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,949
Interesting, you don't seem to
have a search history.

510
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,384
Well, let's start one for you.

00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,198
Looks like no one put
Humpty Dumpty together again.

518
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,066
This guy's
a little soft-boiled.

519
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:34,201
I'm pretty sure
he's just trying to

520
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,702
guess what you're gonna say.

521
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:36,970
Yes. I'm sorry,

522
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:39,739
but my autofill
is a touch aggressive today.

523
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:42,075
Let me try.

Oh.

00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:48,949
I only found one result
for your query.

527
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,352
Hmm. Isn't that interesting?

528
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,720
What? How did you?

529
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:55,422
Ah, the Internet's
very intuitive.

530
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,324
Thank you, Mr. KnowsMore.

531
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:59,092

00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,702
Slow traffic
will be fined for speeds

535
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:10,939
less than three megabytes
per second.

536
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,266
Wow, I guess
we know where to go

537
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:42,068
if we ever need
a pair of goggles.

538
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,904
There's a whole building
full of them.

539
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,375
Oh! There it is! ebay!

540
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,316
Ralph, we're really
gonna do it.

541
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,217
We're actually gonna
save my game.

542
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,452
Told you not to worry.

543
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,955
We just gotta keep our eyes
on the prize and stay focused.

544
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,224
Get rid of belly fat
using this one weird trick.

545
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,859
Ooh! I love weird tricks.

546
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,793
Sassy housewives
want to meet you.

547
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:08,094
They do?

548
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:09,129
Congratulations,
you're a winner!

549
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,030
Really?

550
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,798
These ten child stars
went to prison.

551
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,966
Number six will amaze you.

552
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,134
Ooh. That sounds
interesting.

553
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:15,336

But there's a lot of
cool stuff here.

557
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,243
I'll be right here if you
change your mind, brother.

558
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,143
Ooh, how about you, lady?

559
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,746
You wanna get rich

00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,051
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next item up

561
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,953
a black velvet painting
of a sorrowful kitten.

562
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,522
Bidding starts at 49.99.

563
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:35,423
850 for the beaver,

564
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,865
the beautifully
taxidermied beaver

565
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,162
a gently used
artificial hip

566
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,164
and the bidding's open
at $10. Do I hear 20?

567
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,532
Do I hear 350?
Who'll give me 350?

568
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:45,499
50, 50, 50 now.

569
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,000
Who'll give me 350?
400!

570
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,336
Going once,
going twice and sold!

571
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:49,503
The tortilla chip shaped like

572
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:52,440
international superstar Beyonce Knowles
goes for 400.

573
00:24:52,442 --> 00:24:54,208
Yay! So happy.

574
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,310
Are you understanding
how this game works?

575
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:59,480
I think all you have to do is
yell out the biggest number

576
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,016
and then you win this stuff.

577
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,917
And I thought
Qbert's game was weird.

578
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,884
Hey, kid, hop up here

579
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:06,187
and see if you can tell

580
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:07,669
where they keep
their steering wheels.

581
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:09,190
Uh, there's a bunch of

582
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,459
sports memberabilia.

583
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:14,362
And big baby clothes
called "lingerie."

584
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:16,564
Huh.
Go to the right, move right.

585
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:19,300
Oh. There's a row with a
bunch of old video game junk!

586
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:21,469
Oh, there it is!
There it is! I see it!

587
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,004
Oh, someone else
is trying to win it.

588
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:24,605
Come on! Hurry, let's go!

589
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,673
We got 275.

590
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,908
And with 30 seconds left
in the auction, we have 275.

591
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,210
Move! Move! Hey!

592
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:30,578
That's ours! Out of the way!
Do I hear a three?

593
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,946
I'll give you three!
I got three!

594
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,180
Can I get a 305? 305?
Can I get a 3-5?

595
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,182
305.
305, can I get a 310?

596
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:36,517
Can you bid 310?
310.

597
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,185
315.
320.

598
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:39,253
325.

599
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,188
Oh, man, this guy is good.

600
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,957
He keeps coming up with
numbers like it's nothing.

601
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,126
I have three-and-a-quarter.
Do I hear 350?

602
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,427
350? 350?
Watch this.

603
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,929
1,000!

604
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:50,197
We now have a bid of 1,000!

605
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,433
Way to go, kid!
That is a huge number.

606
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:54,001
Thank you.
Check this out.

607
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:55,569

00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,105
that should arrive
Wednesday morning.

629
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,574
That's two whole days before
Litwak scraps your game.

630
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,443
We're way ahead of schedule.

631
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:36,645
We rule!

632
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,913
I'll just need
a credit card number.

633
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,615
Sorry, what's a
credit card number?

634
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:43,084
A credit card number.

635
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:45,288
Number. Right.
Uh, seven.

636
00:26:45,922 --> 00:26:47,288
Excuse me?

637
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,324
Sorry, no. You're right,
ridiculous. I meant 11.

638
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,126
Those aren't
credit card numbers.

639
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:53,628
I'm pretty sure they are.

640
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,329
How exactly do you intend
to pay for this item, sir?

641
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,566
You owe $27,001.

642
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:59,133
What?

643
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,536
Dollars? Dollars like money?

644
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,405
Yes, and if you don't
have a credit card

645
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,307

Venmo,

646
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:08,342

647
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:10,044
Uh

648
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,648
You're gonna laugh. Okay.

649
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:17,451
So this big galoot, he
left his wallet at home.

650
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:20,321
Yeah, yeah, I did leave
my wallet at home,

651
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:22,158
in my wallet room.
And the door's locked.

652
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:24,125
Uh-huh.

653
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,394
Look. If you don't pay
within 24 hours

654
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,563
you will be in violation
of the unpaid item policy

655
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,031
you will forfeit the bid,
and you will lose this item.

656
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,034
Next!

657
00:27:34,337 --> 00:27:35,537
Hey, buddy,
you going to eboy?

658
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,639
Well, I got some free advice
for you. Don't.

659
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,641
What a scam!

660
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:42,413
We were so close,
and we would have gotten

661
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:45,614
Look, their signs
aren't even real!

662
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,422
What the heck? Dang Internet.

663
00:27:56,693 --> 00:28:00,060
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

664
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,229
Hey, kid. What's going on?
What's wrong?

665
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:03,398
If I don't have
a steering wheel,

666
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't have a game,
I'm gameless.

667
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,570
There's only one steering
wheel in the whole Internet

668
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:11,373
and we blew our chance
to get it. We blew it!

669
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,341
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

670
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,075
We came here
to save your game,

671
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:16,177
and that's what
we're gonna do.

672
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:17,245
Right.

673
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,613
Okay?
Okay, yeah.

674
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,049
There you go.

675
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:24,252
Now look,
all we got to do

676
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:27,355
is figure out a way to earn
a little bit of moola.

677
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:30,759
We're video game characters,
Ralph. We don't have moola.

678
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,461
Unless you can think
of some magical way

679
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:35,265
to get rich
playing video games.

680
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,535

Right this way, miss.

684
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,409
Dang pop-up blockers.

685
00:28:47,411 --> 00:28:49,744
Why does everybody
gotta be so mean?

686
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:52,113
Ooh! There he is! Oh, thank
goodness you're still here!

687
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:55,283
Me and my friend here, we got
24 hours to make $27,001

688
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,618
or she loses her game.

689
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,786
Yeah, can you please tell us

Come on, click here, and
I'll take you to my website.

693
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:10,298
You got an ample carriage
there, buster.

694
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,566
Causing a little drag.

695
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:12,767
Sorry. You're getting close
to the edge.

696
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:13,869
Huh?

697
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:16,805
You see the?
The edge. The edge!

698
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:21,576
By the way,
my name is JP Spamley

699
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:23,111
and I'd like to welcome
the both of you

All right,
step into my parlor.

702
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:31,620
This is your website?

703
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:33,288
I know what you're thinking,
not to worry.

704
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,823
My anti-virus guy
was just here.

705
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,224
Clean as a

706
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:37,626
Oh!

707
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:38,727
Dang it!

708
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:39,828
Oh, my gosh.
That's embarrassing.

709
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,696
Anyway, I know
it's a bit of a mess

710
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,265
Hey, Gord!

711
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:44,833
But I do have a system here,
I really do.

712
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:47,135
If I can just
find that Gord!

713
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:49,304
I just got to find this list.

714
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:50,539
Oh, there you are.

715
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,575
These guys are looking to
get rich playing video games.

716
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:54,897
What do you got for them,
partner?

717
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:05,687
Thank you.

718
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:09,324
"Fishwife's amulet,
Wizard Quest, three dollars."

719
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:11,293
"Foxhole hammer,

720
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:13,194
"Zombie Crusades,
five dollars"?

721
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:14,729
Now, those there are

722
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,198
some of your more
commonplace, low-dollar items.

723
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,401
Can you back up a sec,
Mr. Spamley?

724
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,469
Um, you're saying if we find

725
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,204
the Golden Cleats

726
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,840
from Pro League Soccer

727
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:27,509
we find those and bring them
back here to you

728
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:30,813
then a human being in the
real world will pay us $15?

729
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:31,847
Yes, ma'am.

730
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:34,382
Welcome to the exciting world
of loot hunting.

731
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:35,650
Folks go into games

732
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:37,652
they harvest
the most coveted items

733
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,521
and they sell them
on my website

734
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:41,556
to the highest bidder.
Ha-ha?

735
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,258
Okay, but here's the thing

736
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,327
we need like
a buttload of money.

737
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,765
So, do you have any more
lucrative items, maybe?

738
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:49,399
Gord!

739
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,399
Gord!

740
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,401
Oh, there you are.

741
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:57,172
Thank you, buddy.
You're such a nice guy.

742
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,574
Is $40,000 lucrative
enough for you?

743
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:00,676
Whoa!
Whoa.

744
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,344
It's more than enough.

745
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,279
I got a guy
in Des Moines, Iowa

746
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,182
who will pay 40 grand
for Shank's car

747
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,884
from a game
called Slaughter Race.

748
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:10,452
A racing game?

749
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,420
That's right. Slaughter Race
is the most popular

750
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:14,422
online racing game
out there.

751
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:16,358
However,
it is wicked dangerous.

752
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,760
We ain't afraid of danger.

753
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:19,762
This kid's the best racer
in the whole world.

754
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:22,798
We'll get you that car,
no problemo.

755
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,267
Slaughter Race!
Enter at your own risk.

756
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,680
Okay, this game
is kind of amazing.

757
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:40,483
Meh, the attention to detail
is pretty impressive.

758
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:43,586
I don't think
I've ever been in a game

759
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:44,820
with smog before.

760
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:48,958
Nice kitty. Nice kitty.
Easy, boy. Easy.

761
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,930
Let's just find Shank's car
and get outta here.

762
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:55,932
Agreed.

763
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:03,271
Look. Look.
Whoa!

764
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:04,440
There it is.

765
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:06,475
That car is gorgeous.

766
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,444
No wonder it's worth so much.

767
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:11,781
Aw, sugar.

768
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:14,417
Players. They beat us to it.
Aw.

769
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,585
31 hours
of continuous gameplay

770
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:19,321
and we've finally
found Shank's car.

771
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:21,257
Let's jack this ride.

772
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,459
Oh, yeah, DirtySocks,
it's on.

773
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,461
Jim! Jimmy?

774
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:28,364
You're not playing that
horrible game again, are you?

775
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:29,598
No, Grandma!

776
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,933
I'm doing my homework.

777
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,468
Okay, like I said

778
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,905
Let's jack this ride.

779
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:41,779
Well, well, well.

780
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,784
While the cat was away,
these mice tried to play.

781
00:32:50,354 --> 00:32:52,488
Hey, I think
that might be Shank.

782
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,989
Listen up, mice

783
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:57,059
anyone who tries to play
with this cat's ride

784
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:58,561
is gonna get got.

785
00:32:58,563 --> 00:33:01,564
You're going down, Shank.

786
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,966
Pyro. Give those punks
the works.

787
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,470
With pleasure.

788
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:10,673
End of the road!

789
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,844
Gosh dang it!
Now we gotta start all over.

790
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,411
Ralph, maybe

791
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:17,346
Hey, where are you going?

792
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:19,515
I am scared.

793
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,683
If we get burned up
in here,

794
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:21,984
that's it, we're dead,
we're gone.

795
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,686
So, I think we should
get outta here right now.

796
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:26,522
No, wait, wait.
I have an idea.

797
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,026
Hey, Shank?

798
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:31,594
What's up, Pyro?

799
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:33,896
Um, do you ever reckon
we're going a bit too hard

800
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:35,431
on the players?

801
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:38,467
Honestly, no, I don't.

802
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:42,471
Of course, I have empathy for
players like DirtySocks537

803
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:44,475
and BabeRaham_Linkin

804
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,575
but if we just let them win,

805
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:48,878
where's the life lesson?
You know?

806
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,381
Mmm.
Yeah, but to Pyro's point

807
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:54,817
I mean, those players
work so hard to get here.

808
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,585
I hear you, Felony

809
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:58,754
but imagine a game
without challenges.

810
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:01,724
The same predictable thing
every single time

811
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:02,926
who wants that?

812
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:03,960
Shank's right.

813
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:07,030
I just saw a really
insightful TED talk

814
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:09,065
and I can't really remember
what the guy said.

815
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:11,101
It was more about
how he made me feel.

816
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,602
But I think, ultimately,
the point was

817
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:16,772
I honor your journeys, guys.

818
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,842
And we honor yours,
Butcher Boy.

819
00:34:18,844 --> 00:34:19,976
Thank you.

820
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:20,977
Hey, Shank,

821
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:22,779
did you ever wonder
what it would be like

822
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:24,647
if someone actually
did get your car?

823
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:26,116
Well, I know one thing

824
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,717
whoever does will have to
be the best of the best.

825
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,390
Good day to you, madam.

826
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:35,591
Who are you?

827
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:38,995
I'm here from the, uh,
Department of Noise.

828
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:41,097
And the thing is, we've been
getting some complaints

829
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,766
down at HQ.

830
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,701
Uh, Larry's the one
who takes the calls.

831
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,069
Anyways, someone told Larry

832
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:47,403
that we've been
hearing a lot of

833
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:48,805
gun sounds
and screaming sounds

834
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,774
and what-have-you.
That sort of thing.

835
00:34:50,776 --> 00:34:54,079
Whoa! This is nice.

836
00:34:55,613 --> 00:34:58,514
Where have you been
all my life?

837
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:00,616
Uh, so I came to
check on things.

838
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,185
Oh, I'm sorry, who did
you say you were again?

839
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,654
Oh, I'm Larry?

840
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,589
Uh, you said
Larry took the call.

841
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,932
Good job, Larry!

842
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,436
Yeah, worked like a charm!

843
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:26,643
Are you kidding me?
Someone got Shank's car?

844
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:28,513
And I need yours. Sorry.

845
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:32,818
I'm just
I'm just gonna go.

846
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:37,689
This is the worst day
of my life!

847
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:40,657
It's a shame
we have to leave so soon.

848
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,192
This game is cool.

849
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:43,226
Just get us out of here

850
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:45,495
so we can get this car
to Spamley and get paid.

851
00:35:45,497 --> 00:35:46,730
No problem.

852
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,100
Uh-oh.

853
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,970
Look at this guy
coming in hot.

854
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,989
You mess with the bull, you
get the horns, little girl!

855
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:17,162
You still have value,
Butcher Boy.

856
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:22,899
Oh, no!
It's that Shank lady.

857
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:24,200
She looks upset.

858
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:26,503
Ah, don't worry,
I'll lose her.

859
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:36,680
Where are you going?

860
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:39,182
Kid, get back on the track.
I'm gonna lose my cookies.

861
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:41,520
There is no track.
I can drive anywhere.

862
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,188
Whoo!

863
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:59,203
Oh, kid, she's coming up
right behind us.

864
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:00,570
Oh, hello!

865
00:37:00,572 --> 00:37:02,572
I believe you have
something of mine.

866
00:37:02,574 --> 00:37:03,976
Yeah, come and get it.

867
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,156
Ooh!

868
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:21,026
This girl can drive.

869
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:33,337
Would you hurry up
and lose her?

870
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,339
I'm trying!

871
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,142
Hang on, chumbo!

872
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:46,052
I don't like this!

873
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,931
Whoa! Mother Hubbard,
this lady can really drive.

874
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,799
Kid, fire!
Do you see the fire?

875
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:03,968
Dead end! Dead end!

876
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,636
Not for me. Bye-bye, Shanky.

877
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,273
Whoo-hoo!

878
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,042
Oh, yeah!
That's the stuff.

879
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:12,143
Good job, kid.

880
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:14,979
Oh, yeah,
I feel like me again.

881
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,983
One exit straight ahead.

882
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:36,834
You're not gonna lose me
that easy.

883
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,135
How did you?

884
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,669
Uh, you might wanna keep
your eyes on the road.

885
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,938
Kid!

886
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:51,882
Yo, Department of Noise,
get out of my car!

887
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:53,317
Oh, man,
what are we gonna do?

888
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,219
You just stay put,
don't panic.

889
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:56,387
I'm gonna talk to her.

890
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:57,922
Ralph, be careful.

891
00:38:57,924 --> 00:39:00,991
It's fine.
This is what heroes do.

892
00:39:03,696 --> 00:39:05,164
My bottom is stuck.

893
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:10,835
This car is not designed
for a big boy.

894
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:12,703
I'll tell you that. Hi.

895
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:15,206
You guys really thought
you could just steal my car?

896
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,741
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

897
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,344
No, wait, listen. We aren't
normally car thieves.

898
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:23,848
My friend here,
she's a candy kart racer.

899
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,849
You should see her
racing around

900
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,684
her sweet little track

901
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,152
in her cookie wafer car
we built together.

902
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:33,991
And, well, the thing is, her
perfect little game broke

903
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:35,993
and it was my fault

904
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:38,162
so we're here
to try to fix it

905
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:39,330
and we need money to do that,

906
00:39:39,332 --> 00:39:41,065
and someone was
gonna pay us money

907
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:42,766
to steal your car
Okay, okay.

908
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:44,802
and so we took it.
You can stop crying.

909
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:46,070
Though I do respect

910
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:47,771
your wonderful display
of vulnerability.

911
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,474
Thank you.

912
00:39:49,476 --> 00:39:51,375
I get it, I do.

913
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,911
Friendship is
everything to us, too.

914
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,247
Right, guys?
Word. We're like family.

915
00:39:56,249 --> 00:39:58,082
That's really great.

916
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:00,084
So, does this mean
we can keep your car?

917
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:03,087
Absolutely not.
But I do want to help.

918
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:04,255
Hey, you got
your phone on you?

919
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,390
You know it.
Let's make a video.

920
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:08,493
Pyro, hit big boy
with the blow and go.

921
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:09,760
I'd love to.

922
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,061
Wait. What's the?

923
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:13,864
What are you doing?

924
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,068
Say something, first thing
that comes to your mind.

925
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:19,404
I'm gonna wreck it!

926
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:21,506
Good. All right.
Turn it off.

927
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:24,175
Ow.

928
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:25,410
What the heck
did you do that for?

929
00:40:25,412 --> 00:40:26,611
Yeah.

930
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:29,447
There are much better ways
to make money on the Internet

931
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:31,148
than stealing cars

932
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,319
such as becoming
a BuzzzTube star.

933
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,153
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

934
00:40:36,155 --> 00:40:38,390
Oh, come on.
Everybody knows BuzzzTube.

935
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,325
It's the video-sharing site.

936
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,026
I'm just starting
your account

937
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,362
All right, there you go.

938
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:48,132
If this thing goes viral,
you can make a lot of money.

939
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:50,235
A friend of mine,
chick named Yesss

940
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:52,136
she's the head algorithm
over there.

941
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:53,505
Tell her I sent you.

942
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:54,972
Yesss will hook you up.

943
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:57,174
Wow, that's really nice
of you.

944
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:59,143
I'm not sure if "nice"
is the right word.

945
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:01,045
Well, thank you.

946
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:02,414
I should be thanking you,
little sister.

947
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,981
That race was fun.

948
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:05,816
Oh.

949
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:06,818
Well, thank you again.

950
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:08,286
Uh You know

951
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:11,189
While we're talking shop,
what move did you do

952
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:13,123
to get through
that tunnel of fire?

953
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,826
Was it a power drift into
a drift jump, maybe, or?

954
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:17,362
Maybe.

955
00:41:17,364 --> 00:41:19,464
If you ever wanna come back
for a rematch

956
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,366
I'd be happy
to kick your butt again.

957
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:22,567
See you.

958
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,116
Whoa.

959
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:39,319
Show-off.

960
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:43,054
Man, oh, man,
that place was scary.

961
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:45,223
I know.
It was so exciting!

962
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:47,125
No, exciting is
when you smile.

963
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:48,859
Scary is when
you clench your butt,

964
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,495
and my butt
is still clenched.

965
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:52,530
Oh, come on, are you
honestly telling me

966
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:55,866
that Shank lady wasn't the
coolest person you ever met?

967
00:41:55,868 --> 00:41:58,370
Cool? Name one cool thing
about her.

968
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:00,871
Um, let's see, she looks
cool, she talks cool

969
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,041
she drives cool, her hair
is cool, her car is cool

970
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,210
Wait a minute, are you
saying my hair isn't cool?

971
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:09,447
What? No! I'm just saying
the game was next-level.

972
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,050
There was no one telling you
what to do or where to go.

973
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,386
Hey, just where do you think
you're going?

974
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:16,288
To BuzzzTube.
It's this way.

975
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,556
No, no, no. We're going
back to Spamley's.

976
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,558
He can give us
some easier loot to find.

977
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,395
No, we're supposed to
see Shank's friend.

978
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,964
Oh, come on. I don't trust
that Shank one bit.

979
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,166
Well, I do.
Well, I

980
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:30,101
Hello, mister.
Who are you?

981
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:32,003
I'm your friendly
ebay alert messenger.

982
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,239
Huh. An actual eboy.

983
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:37,609
Just here to let you know your
bid expires in eight hours.

984
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:40,912
Eight hours.
Okay, thanks, eboy.

985
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:42,547
You got it, Jackson!

986
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:46,451
Chumbo, if we nickel-and-dime
it with Spamley

987
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:48,286
it will take 20 years

988
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:50,055
to make enough money
to buy the wheel.

989
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:53,124
All right, fine.
We'll do it your way.

990
00:42:53,126 --> 00:42:54,959
But I'm telling you right now,
that BuzzzTube place

991
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:56,263
is a terrible idea.

992
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:07,105
Man, there are all kinds of
videos in here.

993
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:09,574
Yeah, if you like
babies and cats.

994
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:11,443
Look, there's you!
Oh, yeah.

995
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,944
I'm gonna wreck it!

996
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,315
I wonder
why those little guys

997
00:43:17,317 --> 00:43:19,084
are giving your video
all those hearts?

998
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,318
Because obviously
they love me.

999
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,554
I told you this place
was a good idea.

1000
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,422
Yeah,
sure you did, doof.

1001
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:26,991
Now, who we supposed to see
about getting paid again?

1002
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:30,295
The head algorithm.
Her name is Yesss.

1003
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:32,332
No. No. No.

1004
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:35,601
Uninspired, cliched

1005
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:37,502
Ugh! YouTube's got this one.

1006
00:43:37,504 --> 00:43:40,205
Chewbacca Dad? Really?

1007
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:43,441
Yeah, it's like Chewbacca Mom,
but it's a daddy.

1008
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:44,976
No!

1009
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:48,079
Heyo! Are you
the head of Al Gore?

1010
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:51,983
I am the head algorithm
of BuzzzTube

1011
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:53,686
which means
I curate the content

1012
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:56,555
at the Internet's most
popular video-sharing site.

1013
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:58,323
Which means, I don't
have time to trifle

1014
00:43:58,325 --> 00:44:00,959
with every shoeless,
mouth-breathing hobo

1015
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:02,227
that trundles
into my office.

1016
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:03,629
Call security, Maybe.

1017
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:07,332
Yes. But, Yesss,
this is the leaf blower guy.

1018
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:08,501
Who?

1019
00:44:08,503 --> 00:44:10,135
The man
with the undulating jowls.

1020
00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:11,537
So?

1021
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:14,005
His video has
1.3 million hearts.

1022
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:15,674
Well!

1023
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:18,209
Why didn't you tell me

1024
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:20,178
I was in the presence
of a genius?

1025
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,614
Grab him a drink.

1026
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:23,214
Yeah, this lady
named Shank

1027
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:24,517
she actually made the video.

1028
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,685
She's the one who told us
to come see you.

1029
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:29,020
No wonder
your video's so dope.

1030
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:30,656
Shank is for real cool.

1031
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:32,023
Right?

1032
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:33,392
She is not.

1033
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:35,361
I'm the cool one
getting all the hearts.

1034
00:44:35,363 --> 00:44:38,364
Well, that's right,
you big baby.

1035
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:40,399
Yeah.

1036
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:41,567
Um, what'd you say
your name was?

1037
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:43,234
Ralph, Wreck-It Ralph.

1038
00:44:43,236 --> 00:44:46,505
Well, Wreck-It Ralph,
you are trending!

1039
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:50,509
And these are for you. Hearts,
hearts, hearts, hearts.

1040
00:44:50,511 --> 00:44:52,110
Hearts, hearts, hearts!
Hearts, hearts, hearts!

1041
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:53,244
Yes! Hearts!

1042
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,250
Uh, not to buzzkill
the lovefest

1043
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:00,018
you guys got going on here

1044
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,587
but Shank kinda
told us that

1045
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:05,056
viral videos can make,
like, actual money?

1046
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,125
Oh, hearts are money, honey.

1047
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:09,328
Your Buzzzy account converts
hearts into dollars.

1048
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,696
Ka-ching!

1049
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:12,531
$43,000!

1050
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:15,501
Kid, we only needed $27,001.
We're done.

1051
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:18,437
Oh, no, no, no.

1052
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:20,406
That's $43.

1053
00:45:20,408 --> 00:45:24,443
43? That's not even
half of 27,001.

1054
00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:27,746
And we only have eight
hours left to save my game.

1055
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:30,683
Ugh. Well, I hate to say it,
but that ain't happening.

1056
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:32,384
Your video is tapped out.

1057
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:33,819
But I thought
I was trenching?

1058
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,354
Trending.

1059
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,523
You were.
But that was 15 seconds ago.

1060
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:39,492
Now, you're not.

1061
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:40,694
Thanks for stopping by,
though.

1062
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:43,362
Aw!

1063
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:44,597
What are we gonna do, kid?

1064
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,533
All right, pal, I have
an idea. And hear me out.

1065
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:50,769
What if we go back
to Slaughter Race

1066
00:45:50,771 --> 00:45:51,971
and I ask Shank really

1067
00:45:51,973 --> 00:45:56,308
No, no, no. We're not going
back to that death trap.

1068
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,544
Yesss, what if I made you
a whole bunch of videos

1069
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:01,180
of me doing all kinds of them
crazy things?

1070
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:02,815
You mean
saturate the market?

1071
00:46:02,817 --> 00:46:05,317
That could get you
a lot of hearts fast.

1072
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:06,552
Have you thought
this through at all?

1073
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,355
What do you plan on even doing
in these videos?

1074
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:11,657
I'll just copy
whatever's popular.

1075
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:14,260
Genius. Yo, Maybe,
what's trending right now?

1076
00:46:14,262 --> 00:46:16,462
Mmm-hmm. Let's have
a lookie-lookie.

1077
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,531
As usual, human suffering
is number one

1078
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,232
followed by hot pepper

1079
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:21,500
eating challenges

1080
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:23,202
video game walkthroughs

1081
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:24,637
oh, screaming goats
are back

1082
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,740
unboxings, cooking demos,
makeup tutorials

1083
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:30,743
and lastly, ugh, bee puns.

1084
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:33,281
Let's "bee" friends.

1085
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:36,615
Two weeks in a row, guys.

1086
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:38,617
That's a fortnight
of bee puns.

1087
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:41,453
He won't be doing any bee puns.
They're beneath you.

1088
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Oh, I'm doing a bee pun.
Oh, yes, I am.

1089
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:47,192
And I'm eating a hot pepper,
and I'm putting on makeup

1090
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:48,627
and whatever else it takes!

1091
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,330
Because, kid, we came here
to save your game

1092
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:52,631
and we're gonna do it.

1093
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:54,500
I love it! Ha!

1094
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:56,302
That is what the Internet
was made for!

1095
00:46:56,304 --> 00:46:57,738
Now, let's get to work.

1096
00:47:00,308 --> 00:47:01,775
Seen it.

1097
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,609
Saw that one.

1098
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:05,646
Seen it. Seen it.

1099
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:07,914
Huh?

1100
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:18,390
Yo, McNeely,
you remember Wreck-It Ralph?

1101
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:19,859
That bad guy
from the old video game?

1102
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:21,895
Yeah, exactly.

1103
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:23,195
I'm gonna send you
a super random video.

1104
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:24,496
Check it out, dude.

1105
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:25,938
Yeah, I'll give it a heart.
Whatever.

1106
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:38,845
Hey, everybody, welcome to
Up To the Meme-ent!

1107
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,379
I'm your host,
Dani Fernandez.

1108
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:41,881
Nobody knows
who's making them,

1109
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:43,650
but the whole world
is going bonkers

1110
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,352
over a series
of truly bizarre videos

1111
00:47:46,354 --> 00:47:48,755
starring '80s-era bad guy
Wreck-It Ralph.

1112
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:50,690
Check out what
everyone is buzzing about

1113
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,224
over at BuzzzTube.com.

1114
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:53,860
Hey, guys,
Wreck-It Ralph here

1115
00:47:53,862 --> 00:47:56,462
with the ghost pepper
challenge.

1116
00:47:56,464 --> 00:47:58,165
Supposed to be spicy.
We'll see about that.

1117
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:00,432
Mmm. That's not so

1118
00:48:00,434 --> 00:48:02,702
Oh, it's very hot!
Oh, make it stop!

1119
00:48:02,704 --> 00:48:04,504
Yo, McNeely,
another one just dropped.

1120
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,639
Check it out, dude.

1121
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:07,607
Where are these things
coming from?

1122
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:08,742
Hey, Josey,

1123
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:09,843
did you see
the pepper challenge?

1124
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,944
Oh, not yet.

1125
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:13,412
I'm watching the one
where he just smacks his lips.

1126
00:48:13,414 --> 00:48:14,781
It's disgusting.

1127
00:48:14,783 --> 00:48:16,248
You don't want
any real hard lines.

1128
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,685
You just want to blend that
out there, like this

1129
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,587
And that, my friends,

1130
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:23,423
is how you achieve
the perfect cat eye.

1131
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:24,524
I always start

1132
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,927
with the hootnanny.
Shift it into a floss.

1133
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:31,296
And now I finish with
a hot Marat. Huh? Huh?

1134
00:48:31,298 --> 00:48:32,832
Follow along with me,

1135
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:36,603
and I'm gonna give this little
cloud a little friend

1136
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:38,371
in the form of a tree.

1137
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,675
Everybody needs a friend.

1138
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,809
Look at these guys.

1139
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:44,778
Look at this one,
sleeping under his ear.

1140
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,980
You couch potatoes.
Wake up.

1141
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:49,949
We've been baking
at about 950 degrees

1142
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:51,451
now for six hours

1143
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:52,952
so she should be ready.

1144
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:57,323
Voila! Burnt pie!

1145
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:58,792
Let's have a little whiff
of this here.

1146
00:48:58,794 --> 00:49:00,662
My hair,
my hair! My hair!

1147
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:03,530
This man is on fire.

1148
00:49:03,532 --> 00:49:05,632
Literal and figurative fire.

1149
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:07,500
But he still needs
200 million hearts

1150
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:08,935
in the next five hours

1151
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:10,937
or this beautiful child
loses her game.

1152
00:49:10,939 --> 00:49:13,440
That's why
I'm on to phase two

1153
00:49:13,442 --> 00:49:15,942
you, my elite Pop-Up Army.

1154
00:49:15,944 --> 00:49:18,044
I need you out there
popping up

1155
00:49:18,046 --> 00:49:20,547
and getting clicks
all over the Internet.

1156
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:23,450
I'm talking Tumblr,
Instagram, Mashable.

1157
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:24,851
Be my pied pipers and

1158
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,520
lead that beautiful traffic
to BuzzzTube

1159
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:29,758
because Wreck-It Ralph
needs his hearts.

1160
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:36,362
Hey, mister! Hey, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you, you.

1161
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:37,831
You don't wanna miss this.

1162
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:38,865
It's the latest
Wreck-It Ralph video.

1163
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:40,435
Click it. Click it!

1164
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,815
Man oh Manischewitz,
that looks so fun.

1165
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:57,051
Yesss, can I be a pop-up?

1166
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:59,686
I don't know. Can you be
annoyingly aggressive?

1167
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:02,522
I don't know.
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1168
00:50:02,524 --> 00:50:04,726
Can I? Can I? Can I?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

1169
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,894
Oh, yes, you're perfect. Here.

1170
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:09,496
Thank you!

1171
00:50:09,498 --> 00:50:10,630
If you're going, I wanna go.

1172
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,068
No, baby, you've got to stay
here and be my movie star.

1173
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,370
What? No, no, no. Me and the
kid are like shoes and socks.

1174
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:18,738
Or peanut butter and bacon.

1175
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,540
One cannot exist
without the other.

1176
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,808
Go on, kid, tell her.

1177
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,776
It's true.

1178
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:26,346
In fact, it's so true
that we will be fine

1179
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:28,414
if we're apart
for a minute.

1180
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,918
Come on, pal. It's my game
we're trying to save.

1181
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,521
I just wanna get out there
and be useful.

1182
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:34,554
But without me?

1183
00:50:34,556 --> 00:50:36,589
What if you get lost?
You're just a kid.

1184
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:38,758
Oh, and you're
some mature adult?

1185
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Well, I'm bigger.

1186
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:42,695
Don't be insecure,
big fella.

1187
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:44,999
She's not gonna get lost.
I promise.

1188
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,769
She'll be in
my personal web browser.

1189
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:51,404
And your app comes
with BuzzzFace

1190
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:53,606
so you can keep in touch
anywhere on the Internet.

1191
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:55,441
See, I'll be fine.

1192
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:57,345
I know, I just

1193
00:51:01,117 --> 00:51:03,984
We haven't been apart
in like six years.

1194
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:05,888
I'm going to miss you.

1195
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,789
You'll be fine, too.

1196
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,557
The more hearts
your videos get,

1197
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,525
the faster
we'll get the wheel.

1198
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,128
And then we can go home.

1199
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,662
Look, we'll be celebrating

1200
00:51:15,664 --> 00:51:17,898
at Tapper's this time
tomorrow, buddy.

1201
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,803
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1202
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,070
Bye!

1203
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:25,906
Be careful, huh?
Don't be a dummy.

1204
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,812
So where exactly
are you sending her?

1205
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:34,081
Since candy girl
comes from an arcade game

1206
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:36,043
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

1207
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:39,153
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bad idea.

1208
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:41,789
Those games are dangerous,
and they rot your brain.

1209
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,090
Why don't we
send her somewhere

1210
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:45,759
a little more totally
different than that

1211
00:51:45,761 --> 00:51:48,162
and nowhere near there?

1212
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:51,431
Let's see.
Family Friendly Fansites.

1213
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,667
That sounds safe, and she is
technically a princess

1214
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:55,703
so how about this one here

1215
00:51:55,705 --> 00:51:57,137
with the sweet little
pink castle?

1216
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:58,305
I love it.

1217
00:51:58,307 --> 00:52:02,211
Okay, I'll redirect our newest
pop-up to OhMyDisney.com.

1218
00:52:07,984 --> 00:52:11,153
Jeez Louise, this place
is bonkers! Whoa!

1219
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,895
To infinity and beyond!

1220
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:25,699
Aw, come on. Princesses
and cartoon characters?

1221
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:27,167
Lame.

1222
00:52:27,169 --> 00:52:29,870
Hey, easy there.

1223
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:32,074
Oh, I mean,
no offense or anything.

1224
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:35,175
Well, time to get to work.

1225
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:36,710
And for your final question.

1226
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:39,780
"My friends
would describe me as?"

1227
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,883
"Smart, funny,
kind, or brave."

1228
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:43,886
Um

1229
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,987
Kind, I guess?

1230
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:51,025
Based on your answers,
your princess BFF is

1231
00:52:51,027 --> 00:52:52,826
Snow White!

1232
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:54,228
I do believe our friendship

1233
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,230
will be the fairest
of them all!

1234
00:52:56,232 --> 00:52:59,566
Hey, wanna meet my BFF?
It's Wreck-It Ralph.

1235
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:01,568
Just click here
to see his new video.

1236
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:04,505
Thank you.

1237
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:07,141
Yeah, um, in Captain America:
The First Avenger

1238
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,043
Red Skull refers to Yggdrasil,

1239
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:11,211
the World Tree,
Guardian of Wisdom and Fate.

1240
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:13,080
Are we to believe, sir,

1241
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:14,684
that you are a descendant
of that tree?

1242
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,551
I am Groot.

1243
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:19,586
Okay, okay.
Thank you very much.

1244
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,755
Um, what is Drax really like?

1245
00:53:21,757 --> 00:53:23,258
I am Groot.
Thank you.

1246
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,593
Yeah. Are you a conifer
or a fruit-bearing tree?

1247
00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:27,661
I
Excuse me.

1248
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:28,729
I'll take this one.
He is Groot,

1249
00:53:28,731 --> 00:53:29,830
I am Vanellope,

1250
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,152
click here
to meet Wreck-It Ralph.

1251
00:53:32,568 --> 00:53:35,736
Eh, this is almost too easy.

1252
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:37,137
Hey, do you
have a permit for that pop-up?

1253
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:38,572
Uh

1254
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:41,075
That's unauthorized clickbait.
You're coming with us, kid.

1255
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:42,943
Boop!

1256
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:44,305
She's getting away.

1257
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:47,750
This way.

1258
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:49,317
Ooh!

1259
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:50,519
Sorry, mister!

1260
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:57,092
Hey, can't you read?
Cast members only!

1261
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:00,561
I think she
went down this way. Come on.

1262
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:01,895
Roger that.

1263
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:03,030
Did you see
a kid come through here?

1264
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,766
She came running through here
like a headless hen.

1265
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:08,802
Any sign of her?

1266
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:10,804
No, maybe she went down

1267
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:12,107
to the Air Bud pavilion.

1268
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:13,829
Come on. Let's check it out.

1269
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:22,117
Uh, hi!

1270
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:27,989
Whoa, whoa.
Ladies, I can explain.

1271
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,959
See, I'm a princess, too.

1272
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:32,793
Wait, what?
Yeah.

1273
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:34,828
Princess Vanellope
Von Schweetz

1274
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,765
of the, uh, Sugar Rush
Von Schweetzes.

1275
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:39,067
I'm sure you've heard of us.

1276
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:41,269
It'd be embarrassing for you
if you haven't.

1277
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:44,738
Huh. What kind of
a princess are you?

1278
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,907
What kind?

1279
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:47,741
Do you have magic hair?
No.

1280
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,344
Magic hands?
No.

1281
00:54:49,346 --> 00:54:51,612
Do animals talk to you?
No.

1282
00:54:51,614 --> 00:54:52,746
Were you poisoned?
No!

1283
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,015
Cursed?
No!

1284
00:54:54,017 --> 00:54:55,716
Kidnapped or enslaved?
No!

1285
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:57,318
Are you guys okay?
Should I call the police?

1286
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,853
Then I have to assume
you made a deal

1287
00:54:58,855 --> 00:55:00,255
with an underwater
sea witch

1288
00:55:00,257 --> 00:55:01,156
where she took your voice

1289
00:55:01,158 --> 00:55:03,657
in exchange
for a pair of human legs?

1290
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,027
No! Good Lord,
who would do that?

1291
00:55:06,029 --> 00:55:07,628
Have you ever had
True Love's Kiss?

1292
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,897
Ew! Barf!

1293
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,031
Do you have daddy issues?

1294
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:11,299
I don't even have a mom.

1295
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:13,101
Neither do we!

1296
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:15,636
And now for
the million-dollar question.

1297
00:55:15,638 --> 00:55:18,139
Do people assume
all your problems got solved

1298
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:20,041
because a big strong man
showed up?

1299
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:22,177
Yes! What is up with that?

1300
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,778
She is a princess!

1301
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:26,881
Who made your gown?

1302
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:28,715
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

1303
00:55:28,717 --> 00:55:30,018
Oh, this old thing?

1304
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,886
Oh, I'd so love to
have one of my own.

1305
00:55:31,888 --> 00:55:32,987
As would I.
Me too!

1306
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:34,789
So cool.
Best outfit ever!

1307
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:35,957
Ooh! I want one, too,
you guys!

1308
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:37,360
I'll get my mice on this.

1309
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:42,864
So this is love.

1310
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:47,235
All hail Princess Vanellope,
the queen of comfy!

1311
00:55:47,237 --> 00:55:49,204
Yay, Vanellope!

1312
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:52,006
Of all the thingamabobs
in this entire world

1313
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:54,175
I never thought
I'd get to wear a real

1314
00:55:54,177 --> 00:55:55,677
what's it called again?

1315
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,113
Oh, yeah. Shirt.

1316
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:02,016
I once had a dream
that I might wear a shirt

1317
00:56:02,018 --> 00:56:04,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait! What's going on?

1318
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:06,221
Uh, she's singing.

1319
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:09,390
Yeah, but there was like music
and a spotlight.

1320
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:11,226
Wait, you all
saw it too, right?

1321
00:56:11,228 --> 00:56:12,427
That's what happens

1322
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:14,729
when a princess
sings about her dreams.

1323
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:18,032
Oh, that's never happened
to me. I mean, not even once.

1324
00:56:18,034 --> 00:56:19,934
Why don't you give it
a try?

1325
00:56:19,936 --> 00:56:22,904
What is it you really want?
Sing about that.

1326
00:56:22,906 --> 00:56:24,372
Okay. Uh, sure.

1327
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:26,109
Huh. I could do that.
Um, let's see.

1328
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:32,914
Oh, steering wheel
Oh, steering wheel

1329
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:36,351
Oh, yes
I want a steering wheel

1330
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,723
Well, there is a lot
to unpack here.

1331
00:56:41,725 --> 00:56:43,057
Mmm-hmm.

1332
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:45,393
So, this steering wheel
you sing of,

1333
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:46,995
that's a metaphor?

1334
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:49,197
Oh, no, no, no, it's not
a metaphor. I just

1335
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,799
I literally want
a steering wheel.

1336
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:54,002
I think the issue is
I was a little pitchy.

1337
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:55,437
Maybe a little.

1338
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:58,840
But sometimes
your song can't start

1339
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:00,977
until you go someplace
to reflect.

1340
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:03,445
What works for some of us

1341
00:57:03,447 --> 00:57:07,050
is finding a form of water
and staring at it.

1342
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:09,083
What?

1343
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:11,420
Oh, yes, I like to stare
at a wishing well!

1344
00:57:11,422 --> 00:57:12,820
I stare at the ocean.

1345
00:57:12,822 --> 00:57:13,988
Horse trough.

1346
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,123
Soap bubbles!

1347
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,827
Wait, you're saying if I just
stare at some water

1348
00:57:18,496 --> 00:57:20,296
Uh, important water.

1349
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:23,131
Right. Of course.
"Important water."

1350
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:25,467
I stare at
the important water

1351
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:28,803
and somehow magically I'll
start singing about my dream?

1352
00:57:28,805 --> 00:57:29,871
For sure.
Mmm-hmm.

1353
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:32,474
Uh, yeah, I don't think so,
ladies, but thanks.

1354
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,877
Five minutes,
Princesses.

1355
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:38,480
Another "Which Disney Princess
Are You?" quizlet

1356
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:40,181
starts in five minutes.

1357
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:42,484
Okay, thank you.

1358
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:45,521
Well, I guess it's back
to the gowns, girls.

1359
00:57:45,523 --> 00:57:47,789
It was lovely to meet you,
Vanellope.

1360
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:49,924
And best of luck
finding your song.

1361
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,200
Uh-huh.

1362
00:57:58,202 --> 00:57:59,501
What did she just say?

1363
00:57:59,503 --> 00:58:01,437
We don't know.
We can't understand her.

1364
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:03,138
She's from
the other studio.

1365
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,872
Ah.

1366
00:58:04,874 --> 00:58:07,075
Hi, everybody.
Wreck-It Ralph here

1367
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:09,811
with a little box
I'm gonna open.

1368
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:11,280
Let's see what we got here.

1369
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:14,583
A "Pancake Milkshake
Fun Set." Huh.

1370
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:16,085
Got a little heft to it.

1371
00:58:16,087 --> 00:58:17,885
Something wobbling
around in there.

1372
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:19,355
Wonder if we got
the kitty or the bunny.

1373
00:58:19,357 --> 00:58:20,489
Let's open it up.

1374
00:58:24,928 --> 00:58:26,228
Man, who would've
guessed a bee pun

1375
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,497
would be the thing
to put us over the top?

1376
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:30,299
Huh. That's the Internet
for you.

1377
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:33,302
All right, it is uploading.

1378
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:34,536
Hey, mister!

1379
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:35,903
Oh. Hi, eboy.

1380
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:37,172
Just here to let you know

1381
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:39,907
your bid does expire
in 30 minutes.

1382
00:58:39,909 --> 00:58:41,977
Thanks, little eboy.

1383
00:58:41,979 --> 00:58:42,980
You got it, chairman.

1384
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:44,912
You hear that, Yesss?

1385
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:46,382
We don't have
a lot of time left.

1386
00:58:46,384 --> 00:58:47,549
Okay. We just gotta

1387
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:49,884
No, no, no.

1388
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:51,587
No! Not you!

1389
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:53,255
What? Why are you
angry at the lollipop?

1390
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:54,423
What does that mean?

1391
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:56,025
The file's not loading.

1392
00:58:56,027 --> 00:58:57,960
If this doesn't load,
we're not gonna make it.

1393
00:58:57,962 --> 00:59:00,862
Hmm.
You don't have enough hearts.

1394
00:59:00,864 --> 00:59:02,231
Ralph, where are you going?

1395
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:04,073
I'm going down to the floor
to get some hearts.

1396
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:05,401
Ah! Genius! Good thinking.

1397
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:08,070
Now, someone get me
tech support in here, stat!

1398
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:13,442
Only one person.

1399
00:59:13,444 --> 00:59:14,943
Hey, guys, come and
check out my video,

1400
00:59:14,945 --> 00:59:15,878
you're gonna love it.

1401
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,914
Right, right over here.
Yep, here we go.

1402
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,549
What are you
You guys!

1403
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:22,451
Aw. A cat?

1404
00:59:22,453 --> 00:59:26,357
You're gonna like this better
than some dusty old cat.

1405
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,424
Aw.

1406
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:29,558
What?

1407
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,527
Give me that hose, partner.

1408
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:34,997
You know you love me, give me those hearts.
There we go.

1409
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:37,599
Hey, folks, where are you going?
Give my video a heart.

1410
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:40,237
That's it.
Let's see who's in here.

1411
00:59:40,938 --> 00:59:41,939
Hello?

1412
00:59:43,207 --> 00:59:44,442
Anybody in here?

1413
00:59:47,311 --> 00:59:49,246
What the heck is this place?

1414
00:59:50,981 --> 00:59:52,516
Some kind of libary?

1415
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:56,251
"Wreck-It Ralph is back."

1416
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:58,954
Hey, they're talking about me.

1417
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:02,024
Gee whiz,
the Internet is so positive.

1418
01:00:02,026 --> 01:00:04,560
"Fix-It Felix, Jr.
was my favorite game."

1419
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:06,328
Hmm. Mine, too.

1420
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,366
"Ralph's videos stink."

1421
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,299
What?

1422
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:12,334
"So stupid."

1423
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:14,472
"Ralph is the worst."

1424
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:17,375
"I hate him."

1425
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:20,978
"He's so fat and ugly."

1426
01:00:23,214 --> 01:00:27,552
"Just a worthless bum,
alone on a pile of bricks."

1427
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:37,426
Yo, Ralph,
you in here, dude?

1428
01:00:37,428 --> 01:00:39,029
Hey, I got to show you

1429
01:00:40,297 --> 01:00:41,332
Oh.

1430
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:44,333
First rule
of the Internet

1431
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:47,236
do not read the comments.

1432
01:00:47,238 --> 01:00:48,473
I should have told you that.

1433
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,740
Look.

1434
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:54,042
This place can bring out
the worst in some people

1435
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:55,645
but you gotta ignore all this.

1436
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:59,047
This isn't about you, Ralph.
It's about them.

1437
01:00:59,049 --> 01:01:01,049
I don't care.
It's fine.

1438
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:05,524
People hated me my whole life
for being the bad guy.

1439
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:08,257
It's just a good reminder

1440
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:09,626
that this is the only heart

1441
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:10,628
that really matters.

1442
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:13,061
Vanellope gave me this

1443
01:01:13,063 --> 01:01:14,497
and as long as she likes me

1444
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:16,332
I don't need anybody else.

1445
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,000
And I sure
don't need the Internet.

1446
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:19,469
Hold on.

1447
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,504
It's not all bad.

1448
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:23,506
The Internet
can also be a place

1449
01:01:23,508 --> 01:01:26,008
where you find a steering
wheel at one website

1450
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,345
and make enough money
to buy it at another one.

1451
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:31,481
Congratulations, Ralph.
You did it.

1452
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:32,749
Wait, really?

1453
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:35,117
Yes, check your
Buzzzy account.

1454
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,086
You needed 27K,
you got over 30 grand!

1455
01:01:38,088 --> 01:01:39,322
Oh, my gosh!

1456
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:40,757
This is great!

1457
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:42,692
Thank you, Yesss. I couldn't
have done it without you!

1458
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:44,092
That's really true.

1459
01:01:44,094 --> 01:01:45,528
Hey, eboy?

1460
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,095
What do you need, ace?

1461
01:01:47,097 --> 01:01:48,665
Can you give me a ride?

1462
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,735
Let's hop along, Cassidy.

1463
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:54,473
Come on, song, come on.

1464
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,041
I'm reflecting.

1465
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,041
What is it that I want?

1466
01:01:59,043 --> 01:02:00,410
What is my quest?

1467
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,380
What is my dream?

1468
01:02:04,616 --> 01:02:07,049
Well, ladies, I tried.

1469
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:09,519
No song for this princess,
I guess.

1470
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,456
Ooh! Huh.

1471
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,057
How does this thing work?

1472
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:16,459
Hey, kid, can you see me?

1473
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:18,361
Yeah! Yeah,
you're right there.

1474
01:02:18,363 --> 01:02:20,463
We did it! We got the money!

1475
01:02:20,465 --> 01:02:22,799
No way, Ralph!
That's great!

1476
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,301
I'm on my way to ebay
right now with the eboy.

1477
01:02:25,303 --> 01:02:26,569
We're almost there, champ.

1478
01:02:26,571 --> 01:02:27,704
Good work, eboy.

1479
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:30,139
Hey, meet me out in front of
ebay in five minutes, okay?

1480
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:31,708
Okay, I'll see you soon.

1481
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,576
We're going home, kid!

1482
01:02:33,578 --> 01:02:35,745
Our lives can finally
get back to normal.

1483
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:36,747
Whoo-hoo!

1484
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,318
Wow, I can't believe it.
I get to go home.

1485
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,720
So, I guess that's it.

1486
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:46,791
I guess I just wanted a
a steering wheel.

1487
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,159
And now, I got it, so

1488
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,463
whoo-hoo.

1489
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:57,734
Slaughter Race?

1490
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:09,445
What can it be that calls
me to this place today?

1491
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:12,148
This lawless car ballet?

1492
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,652
What can it be?

1493
01:03:15,654 --> 01:03:19,756
Am I a baby pigeon
sprouting wings to soar?

1494
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:21,491
Was that a metaphor?

1495
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:24,694
Hey, there's a dollar store

1496
01:03:24,696 --> 01:03:28,331
Look!
I'm rhyming

1497
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:32,635
My spirits climbing

1498
01:03:32,637 --> 01:03:36,341
As I'm called through
this fog of mace

1499
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:40,844
To this place called

1500
01:03:40,846 --> 01:03:44,516
Slaughter Race

1501
01:03:47,652 --> 01:03:49,519
Welcome back
Watch your head

1502
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,421
Hate to see you
end up dead

1503
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:52,923
Let's get
this party rollin'

1504
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:54,691
Is that appliance stolen?

1505
01:03:54,693 --> 01:03:56,192
We have
Fallen wires

1506
01:03:56,194 --> 01:03:57,360
Dumpster fires
Creepy clowns

1507
01:03:57,362 --> 01:03:58,661
And burning tires

1508
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:00,363
That great white
in the sewer

1509
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:01,564
You'll be happy
that you knew her

1510
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:02,665
Fin bump!

1511
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,400
Dogs and cats
They sure taste great

1512
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:06,336
With a side of license plate

1513
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:07,671
Some find us deplorable

1514
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,873
Well, I think
you're adorable

1515
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,376
We may be a motley crew
But our hearts ring true

1516
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:16,245
And just for you
A face tattoo

1517
01:04:31,864 --> 01:04:35,568
Slaughter Race

1518
01:04:37,603 --> 01:04:41,270
My heart's in flight
And wow, it's a blast

1519
01:04:41,272 --> 01:04:44,440
Feels like my dreams
are real at last

1520
01:04:44,442 --> 01:04:48,579
No trace of a frown
upon your face

1521
01:04:48,581 --> 01:04:50,246
Flying so fast

1522
01:04:50,248 --> 01:04:51,849
Setting the pace

1523
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:55,786
Living the life
Loving the chase

1524
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:58,756
Now is the time
Here is the place

1525
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:02,695
This Slaughter Race!

1526
01:05:12,972 --> 01:05:16,540
I know I should go

1527
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:20,611
But home feels so slow

1528
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:26,784
These roads are paved
with dreams

1529
01:05:26,786 --> 01:05:29,220
Happy dreams
Not creepy clown dreams

1530
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:34,290
What would Ralph say

1531
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:38,429
If it turns out I stay?

1532
01:05:38,431 --> 01:05:42,032
In this place called

1533
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:47,738
Slaughter

1534
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,778
Race

1535
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:02,486
In this place called

1536
01:06:02,488 --> 01:06:05,991
Slaughter

1537
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:11,263
Race

1538
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:19,970
That old, tired laptop

1539
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:22,706
moving at a sloth speed?
Bid on a new one today!

1540
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,541
Do you wanna get rich
playing video games?

1541
01:06:24,543 --> 01:06:25,776
Click here to

1542
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:27,978
Oh. Ralph. Ralph!
Hey, there.

1543
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,046
Oh, hey, Spamley.

1544
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,380
What's the good word,
brother?

1545
01:06:30,382 --> 01:06:32,816
Well, the good word is I just
paid for the steering wheel

1546
01:06:32,818 --> 01:06:34,351
and we are going home.

1547
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:35,452
Congratulations.

1548
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:36,720
Thanks.

1549
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:38,856
Hey, have you seen
Vanellope anywhere?

1550
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:40,958
Oh, uh, your little chum?
Uh, no, no, I haven't.

1551
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,993
Hope she's not lost.

1552
01:06:42,995 --> 01:06:44,930
Let me try to reach her
on this doohickey.

1553
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:57,508
See over there?
Over that mountain?

1554
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,743
Yeah.
That's the Sequoia Speedway.

1555
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,378
It's gonna be unlocked
next month.

1556
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,380
Hey, what are you doing
in that awful game with her?

1557
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,915
I think
the track will end

1558
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:07,518
right over there. Yo,
it's gonna be so tight.

1559
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,553
Oh, I love it.

1560
01:07:09,555 --> 01:07:10,854
Hey, can I tell you something

1561
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:13,091
that I don't think
I could ever tell Ralph?

1562
01:07:13,093 --> 01:07:14,525
Of course.

1563
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,060
I know it sounds crazy

1564
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:19,565
but the second I walked
into this game, it felt

1565
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:22,633
Well, it felt like home.

1566
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:25,003
I mean, more than
Sugar Rush ever did.

1567
01:07:25,005 --> 01:07:27,005
Oh, yeah? How so?

1568
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:28,839
'Cause it's like my dream.

1569
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:31,042
It's full of weirdos

1570
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:34,411
and the racing
is super dangerous

1571
01:07:34,413 --> 01:07:36,749
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

1572
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:38,917
I mean, back home,

1573
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:41,385
I know exactly
what's gonna happen next

1574
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:44,390
because Ralph's dream is to
do the same thing every day.

1575
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,693
Hmm.

1576
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:53,430
Here's something
I wish I'd learned years ago.

1577
01:07:53,432 --> 01:07:55,099
There is no law

1578
01:07:55,101 --> 01:07:58,535
saying best friends
have to have the same dreams.

1579
01:07:58,537 --> 01:07:59,538
You know?

1580
01:07:59,973 --> 01:08:01,105
Whoa.

1581
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:02,774
Yeah.

1582
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:06,144
You are a very
wise person, Shank.

1583
01:08:06,146 --> 01:08:08,545
And a good friend, too.

1584
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:09,914
Thank you.

1585
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:12,083
Around here, peeps like
to say, "Shank you."

1586
01:08:13,787 --> 01:08:15,720
You know,
after you go home

1587
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:17,621
and your life
gets back to normal

1588
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:19,590
you are always
welcome here.

1589
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:22,593
But that's the thing,
I want this to be my normal.

1590
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:24,664
I want this to be my life.

1591
01:08:25,497 --> 01:08:26,867
I can't go home now.

1592
01:08:28,902 --> 01:08:30,136
I just can't.

1593
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:39,478
Wow.

1594
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:41,613
You know,
where I come from,

1595
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:43,915
that's called
a kick in the face.

1596
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,850
I can't believe it.

1597
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:48,820
A straight-up donkey kick
to the teeth.

1598
01:08:48,822 --> 01:08:50,824
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

1599
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:52,893
No, this can't be right.

1600
01:08:54,194 --> 01:08:56,027
No, she's been brainwashed.

1601
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:57,528
That's what this is.

1602
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,563
Because the Vanellope I know

1603
01:08:58,565 --> 01:08:59,998
would never abandon me
like that.

1604
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,766
I gotta get her out
of there now.

1605
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:04,035
Hey, easy now, tiger.

1606
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,169
I admire the impulse

1607
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:07,705
but you charge in there
like some white knight

1608
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:09,207
she's liable to hold it
against you.

1609
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,643
So what? I'm supposed to
just let her stay in a game

1610
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:12,777
that's obviously bad for her?

1611
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:13,978
Of course not.

1612
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,914
Then how do I make her leave?

1613
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:19,017
She thinks it's so cool
and exciting in there.

1614
01:09:19,019 --> 01:09:22,887
Unless you know how I can
make the game boring or

1615
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:26,691
Wait. You know about viruses
and stuff, right, Spamley?

1616
01:09:26,693 --> 01:09:28,660
Who's asking?
Whoa.

1617
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:29,994
Back home, me and the kid

1618
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:32,597
used to goof off
in this game called Tron.

1619
01:09:32,599 --> 01:09:35,166
But then it got a virus that
made the motorbikes go slow

1620
01:09:35,168 --> 01:09:37,168
and then Vanellope stopped
wanting to hang out in there.

1621
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:38,836
So, is there a way

1622
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:41,005
to do something
like that to Slaughter Race?

1623
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,042
Oh, there's ways.

1624
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,510
Follow me.

1625
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:50,848
I got mothers' maiden names

1626
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,184
social security numbers,
PIN numbers

1627
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:54,619
Now, this area down here

1628
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:56,187
is what's called the Darknet.

1629
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:58,056
A lot of shady characters
hang out down here

1630
01:09:58,058 --> 01:10:00,224
so try to keep a low profile.
Gord!

1631
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:02,026
Oh, there you are.

1632
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:04,562
Now Gord here, he's
dabbled in virus-making.

1633
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:06,564
But his cousin, this guy
we're gonna go see

1634
01:10:06,566 --> 01:10:09,536
Double Dan, this dude
is a virus-making machine.

1635
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:11,736
Oh, oh, here we go.

1636
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:13,771
Are you sure this is safe?

1637
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,606
Is it safe?
Of course it is.

1638
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:18,576
Just whatever you do, do not
look at his little brother.

1639
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:20,080
Oh, he has a little brother?

1640
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,683
Double Dan!

1641
01:10:25,685 --> 01:10:27,085
Long time no see.

1642
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:28,586
Who are you?

1643
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:29,988
JP Spamley.

1644
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,990
Uh, we met one time
over at Friendster

1645
01:10:31,992 --> 01:10:35,626
which tells you
it had to be a long time ago.

1646
01:10:35,628 --> 01:10:37,096
Oye. What are you looking at?
Nothing.

1647
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:38,197
Are you looking at my brother?

1648
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,264
No, sir.
Don't you look

1649
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:40,232
at my little brother.

1650
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,567
Oh, no, I wasn't.
He's very self-conscious!

1651
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:46,871
You?

1652
01:10:46,873 --> 01:10:48,740
What are you doing here?

1653
01:10:48,742 --> 01:10:49,974
Uh

1654
01:10:49,976 --> 01:10:52,211
The reason I came to
your neck of the face

1655
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:55,013
I mean, there's a face
in your neck. I mean, woods.

1656
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:57,349
Neck of the woods. The reason
I'm here is 'cause I

1657
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:59,817
Well, I heard
a little tumor, rumor

1658
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:01,253
I heard a rumor
that you could, well,

1659
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:03,654
give me a harmless virus
kind of thing

1660
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:04,622
that might be able to

1661
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:06,624
slow down
the Slaughter Ra game?

1662
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:08,360
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:11,196
My cousin Gordon told me
that you wanted to crash it.

1664
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:12,297
Crash it? No!

1665
01:11:12,299 --> 01:11:14,166
No, no, no.

1666
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:15,767
I don't want
anyone getting hurt.

1667
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:16,901
Hmm.

1668
01:11:16,903 --> 01:11:18,971
If there's a way
to just, uh

1669
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:19,938
I don't know

1670
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,274
just make the cars
go slow or something

1671
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:24,876
so the game is boring

1672
01:11:24,878 --> 01:11:27,012
and my friend
comes back home to me.

1673
01:11:27,014 --> 01:11:30,916
Allow me to
introduce you to Arthur.

1674
01:11:32,286 --> 01:11:34,319
Easy there, boy.

1675
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,155
He's keen.

1676
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:39,992
Arthur's what I call
an insecurity virus.

1677
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:42,827
Means he looks for
little flaws and weaknesses

1678
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:44,731
that make a program insecure.

1679
01:11:47,268 --> 01:11:50,035
You release him into that
Slaughter Race game,

1680
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:52,770
Arthur will find some defect
in the code.

1681
01:11:52,772 --> 01:11:54,339
Then he'll copy that defect

1682
01:11:54,341 --> 01:11:57,076
and spread it
all over the game

1683
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:00,711
until everything becomes,
quote, unquote, "boring"

1684
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:03,148
just like you wanted.

1685
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,316
Okay.

1686
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:06,218
Just to be super clear here

1687
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,685
no one gets hurt, right?

1688
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:08,821
Are you stupid?

1689
01:12:08,823 --> 01:12:09,988
Well, uh

1690
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,191
Because the only way
anyone gets hurt

1691
01:12:12,193 --> 01:12:13,691
is if you are stupid.

1692
01:12:13,693 --> 01:12:15,194
All you have to do

1693
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:18,730
is make sure the virus stays
in Slaughter Race.

1694
01:12:18,732 --> 01:12:20,732
Right. Don't be stupid.

1695
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:22,067
Make sure it doesn't get out
of Slaughter Race.

1696
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:23,168
Goiter it. Gah!

1697
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,336
Got it! Got it.
Get out!

1698
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:25,871
Thank you,
you're a cyst face.

1699
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:27,039
Out!
I mean, assistance.

1700
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,907
Thank you for your
cyst face Assistance.

1701
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,375
Get out!
Goodbye!

1702
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:31,944
Ugh.

1703
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:36,915
Ah! Fiddlesticks!
Well, that's game.

1704
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,250
Ah, beginner's luck.

1705
01:12:38,252 --> 01:12:39,918
Come on, kid.
I know a hustle

1706
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,019
when I see one.

1707
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:44,123
Player's on the way.
Thanks, Bob.

1708
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,724
Let's roll!
Game faces on, guys.

1709
01:12:45,726 --> 01:12:47,826
Show time. You ready
for your first race?

1710
01:12:47,828 --> 01:12:50,229
Um, yeah. I think so.

1711
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:52,831
Hey, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

1712
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah, no, I know.
I'll be fine.

1713
01:12:55,002 --> 01:12:57,138
Mmm. You didn't tell
Ralph yet, did you?

1714
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:00,105
Not exactly.

1715
01:13:00,107 --> 01:13:02,741
Come on, V.
He's your best friend.

1716
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:04,042
You gotta let him know

1717
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:05,777
you're planning on
staying here for a while.

1718
01:13:05,779 --> 01:13:08,780
I know. But he's gonna
get really upset.

1719
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:10,782
Yeah, he might,
but you guys

1720
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:13,385
you'll talk, you'll work it
out, you'll figure it out.

1721
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:15,187
Yeah, but what if we don't?

1722
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:17,990
What if his feelings
get hurt so bad

1723
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,058
he won't wanna be
my friend anymore?

1724
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:23,295
Look.
All friendships change

1725
01:13:23,297 --> 01:13:25,130
but the good ones

1726
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:26,466
they get stronger
because of it.

1727
01:13:27,935 --> 01:13:29,835
Uh, Shank,
I hate to bother you

1728
01:13:29,837 --> 01:13:32,171
but the player is waiting.

1729
01:13:32,173 --> 01:13:34,039
I'm not gonna tell you
what to do, kid.

1730
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:35,109
It's your call.

1731
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:36,977
Yeah, okay.

1732
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:38,977
All right.

1733
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:40,147
Let's race.

1734
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,464
Scanning for insecurities.

1735
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:00,734
Scanning for insecurities.

1736
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:05,271
"Precious Car-go."

1737
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:07,239
Deliver the car
to Bert's Chop Shop

1738
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:10,175
but watch out
for Shank and her crew.

1739
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:30,028
Power drift
into a drift jump!

1740
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,030
I saw it! You're amazing!

1741
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:33,033
Thank you.

1742
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:45,180
Scanning for insecurities.

1743
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,952
Looks like we're not finished.
Come on, V.

1744
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,954
Ralph?

1745
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:01,827
Huh.

1746
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:04,330
Okay. Relax. Relax!

1747
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:05,531
I'll just call him
after the race.

1748
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,166
It'll be okay.

1749
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:08,368
Ralph will be fine.

1750
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,273
Insecurity detected.

1751
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:14,875
Copying insecurity.

1752
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:22,582
Distributing insecurity.

1753
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:26,152
Distributing insecurity.
Distributing

1754
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:29,057
What is happening?

1755
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:36,262
What's going on, Spamley?

1756
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:38,298
The whole place
is going crazy.

1757
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,366
I thought that virus was just
supposed to slow down her car.

1758
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:41,467
It was.

1759
01:15:41,469 --> 01:15:43,429
It must've found something
real unstable in there.

1760
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:47,040
It's her glitch.

1761
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,541
Game reboot begins

1762
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:50,376
in 60 seconds.

1763
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:52,178
Whoa, hey! Hey, Ralph,
you can't go in there.

1764
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,146
They're gonna
reboot the game

1765
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:54,480
and anything that doesn't
belong in there

1766
01:15:54,482 --> 01:15:55,581
will be deleted.

1767
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,150
Yeah, and if I don't
get her outta there,

1768
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,520
Vanellope's gonna die!

1769
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,423
Come on, kid. The game's crashing.
Let's go.

1770
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:04,991
I think it's my glitch.

1771
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:08,094
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
destroy your game.

1772
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,164
We'll be fine, but your code
isn't part of this game.

1773
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,968
We got to get you out of here now.
Follow me to the exit.

1774
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,610
Oh, no, no!

1775
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,251
Kid!

1776
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:34,387
Kid, where are you?

1777
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:36,589
The server
is rebooting, Ralph.

1778
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:38,659
Both of you have to
get out of here now.

1779
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:39,928
Kid, I got you. I got you.

1780
01:16:41,963 --> 01:16:43,162
Game reboot

1781
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:47,133
in five, four, three

1782
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,035
two, one.

1783
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,007
Reboot in progress.

1784
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,511
Come on, Vanellope. Wake up.

1785
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:00,681
Come on. Don't leave me, kid.

1786
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,651
Ralph?

1787
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:07,455
Oh. There you are.
You okay, kid?

1788
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:11,658
Ralph, I messed up so bad.

1789
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,360
No. No, you didn't,
it's okay.

1790
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:17,430
This is all because of me
and my glitch.

1791
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,332
I should've
just stayed with you

1792
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,034
instead of following
some stupid dream.

1793
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:25,608
I've ruined everything.

1794
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:28,009
No, kid, no.

1795
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,680
Ah, look. I didn't mean
for it to happen like this.

1796
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:36,485
It was not supposed
to be this bad.

1797
01:17:39,387 --> 01:17:42,355
You didn't mean
for what to happen?

1798
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:46,027
I mighta,
kinda sorta put a

1799
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:50,397
harmless little virus
in the game.

1800
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,633
A virus?

1801
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,201
You did this?

1802
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,337
I wouldn't have done anything

1803
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,705
if I hadn't heard you
tell Shank

1804
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,507
that you wanted to live in
Slaughter Race forever.

1805
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,210
So you were spying on me?

1806
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,380
Hey. You're not exactly
innocent here.

1807
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,048
You were gonna ditch everybody
and abandon Sugar Rush.

1808
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,050
Oh, please.
I'm one of 16 racers.

1809
01:18:11,052 --> 01:18:12,386
They'd never miss me.

1810
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:13,720
What about me?

1811
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,255
Why would I ever spend
another second with you

1812
01:18:16,257 --> 01:18:17,426
after what you did?

1813
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,563
No!

1814
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
No.

1815
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,368
Vanellope,
where are you going?

1816
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,770
Wherever you're not.

1817
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:31,103
Wait a minute.
I can explain.

1818
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:32,806
No! You will not
follow me.

1819
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,374
Vanellope, please

1820
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,109
A friend would never do
what you did. Never!

1821
01:18:37,111 --> 01:18:39,546
So you leave me alone!

1822
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,216
Vanellope, no, no, no! Please!

1823
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,785
Please! What did I do?

1824
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,520
Scanning for insecurities.

1825
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,190
Vanellope, come on,
don't leave me!

1826
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,559
Insecurity detected.

1827
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,432
Copying insecurity.

1828
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:01,502
Oh, no, no, no.

1829
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,239
Distributing insecurity.

1830
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:14,283
Come on.

1831
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,086
Where is it?

1832
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,524
Ooh!

1833
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:27,562
Oh, no.

1834
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:45,414
You are such an idiot.

1835
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:01,662
What is your problem, Ralph?
I told you, don't follow me.

1836
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:03,865
Friend?

1837
01:20:03,867 --> 01:20:06,166
Cut that out.
You're scaring me.

1838
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,302
Friend!
Huh? Whoa!

1839
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,205
What the?
Friend?

1840
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,644
Friend!

1841
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,518
Sweet mother of Ralph!

1842
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,519
In breaking news,

1843
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:26,653
the Internet
is under assault

1844
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:29,489
as a massive
denial-of-service attack

1845
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,357
crashes servers
across the web.

1846
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,693
The Wreck-It Ralph virus

1847
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:35,164
is fast-moving
and destructive.

1848
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,567
Friend? Huh?

1849
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:43,839
Friend?

1850
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:50,778
Huh?

1851
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,747
Experts are still trying to
understand who or what

1852
01:20:52,749 --> 01:20:54,651
the virus's intended
target may be.

1853
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:58,888
Friend.

1854
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,689
Friend.

1855
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,258
Friend!

1856
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,528
Friend!

1857
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:10,598
I found 130 results for

1858
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,636
"Where does my high school
girlfriend live now?"

1859
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:15,435
You're welcome.

1860
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,172
Mr. KnowsMore!
Hmm.

1861
01:21:17,674 --> 01:21:18,873
Oh, delightful!

1862
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,541
You're that courteous
little cherub

1863
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,209
who says "please"
and "thank you."

1864
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,544
What can KnowsMore
help you find today?

1865
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,612
There's a whole

1866
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:25,913
Whole Foods,
a hole in the ozone

1867
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:28,616
A Whole Lotta Love by
British rockers Led Zeppelin?

1868
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:31,418
No! No! There's a whole bunch
of Ralphs chasing me.

1869
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,955
Friend

1870
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:35,890
This would probably be
an appropriate time

1871
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:37,192
for me to shutter my site.

1872
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:46,299
How long you think

1873
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,669
before they get in here?

1874
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:49,791
Precisely one second.

1875
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:53,408
Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1876
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,575
Hey, hey, hey!

1877
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:55,877
It's me!
It's the real me!

1878
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:58,446
Ow!

1879
01:21:58,448 --> 01:22:00,782
Ralph?
My apologies.

1880
01:22:00,784 --> 01:22:01,916
I followed those things here.

1881
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,358
I think they're looking
for you, kid.

1882
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:07,455
Yeah, you think?
What did you do?

1883
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:10,591
I'm so sorry.
I don't how this happened.

1884
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:11,693
Well, I think
it's fairly obvious.

1885
01:22:11,695 --> 01:22:14,328
It happened because
an insecurity virus cloned

1886
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,831
all of your needy, clingy,
self-destructive behavior.

1887
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,533
The very behavior
which left unchecked

1888
01:22:18,535 --> 01:22:19,901
can destroy friendships

1889
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:23,571
and in this particular case,
the entire Internet!

1890
01:22:25,475 --> 01:22:27,341
KnowsMore!
You have all the answers.

1891
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,643
Official query

1892
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:30,678
what do I do if clones of me

1893
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,281
are trying to capture
my friend? Search.

1894
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:36,784
I find two results
for your query.

1895
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,920
Either you put all the clones
in therapy.

1896
01:22:38,922 --> 01:22:40,888
Not very realistic.

1897
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,857
Or, the anti-virus district
is surrounded

1898
01:22:42,859 --> 01:22:44,926
by a gate made from
security software.

1899
01:22:44,928 --> 01:22:45,893
If Vanellope could somehow

1900
01:22:45,895 --> 01:22:47,395
lead all of the clones
through the gate

1901
01:22:47,397 --> 01:22:49,397
they would be deleted
all at once.

1902
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:52,600
Sort of a co-dependent
pied piper situation.

1903
01:22:52,602 --> 01:22:55,336
Wait. We know a pied piper.

1904
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,771
We do?
Yesss.

1905
01:22:56,773 --> 01:22:58,339
Who?
Yesss!

1906
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,341
Yeah, but who is it?

1907
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:02,846
Oh, you mean Yesss!

1908
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:09,650
Thanks for your help,
KnowsMore.

1909
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,385
It's a bit of an empty gesture
at this point,

1910
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:13,588
wouldn't you say?

1911
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:14,989
Guess I forgot
to tell Ralph

1912
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:16,724
that when you
break the Internet

1913
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:19,527
you don't literally
have to break the Internet.

1914
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:20,762
I can't believe he did this.

1915
01:23:20,764 --> 01:23:23,397
Yeah, well, I mean,
dude obviously made

1916
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,533
some real questionable
choices here.

1917
01:23:25,535 --> 01:23:29,670
But he also made a bee pun to
save his best friend's game

1918
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:33,476
so what can I say, kid,
life's complicated.

1919
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:36,513
You ready to pied the piper?

1920
01:23:39,549 --> 01:23:41,551
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

1921
01:23:42,987 --> 01:23:46,088
It's me, your bestest friend
in the whole wide world

1922
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,490
who you can't live without!

1923
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,027
Friend!

1924
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,830
Wow, from up here I can see
how I do come across as

1925
01:23:55,832 --> 01:23:57,598
needy, and clingy,

1926
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,970
and self-destructive
like KnowsMore said.

1927
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:02,670
Listen, kid

1928
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:03,538
I don't blame you

1929
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,807
for not wanting
to be my friend anymore.

1930
01:24:05,809 --> 01:24:07,976
I never said I didn't
want to be your friend.

1931
01:24:07,978 --> 01:24:11,679
I said you were acting like
a bad friend. Which you were.

1932
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,414
I know I was, but I

1933
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,549
Hey, my babies!

1934
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:17,685
That's the anti-virus district
straight ahead. Whoo!

1935
01:24:17,687 --> 01:24:19,355
All right, to be
continued, okay?

1936
01:24:27,031 --> 01:24:29,031
Whoo-hoo!
We're gonna make it!

1937
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:46,480
You guys okay?

1938
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:47,749
I'm fine!

1939
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:50,752
Yeah, all good.
Look, we can still do this.

1940
01:24:50,754 --> 01:24:53,055
Come on, big man.
Help me turn this thing over.

1941
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,490
Uh

1942
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,694
Uh, guys?

1943
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:12,506
Friend?

1944
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:14,776
That is unsettling.

1945
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:19,917
Friend.

1946
01:25:20,618 --> 01:25:22,184
Get Vanellope out of here now.

1947
01:25:22,186 --> 01:25:23,318
What about you, Ralph?

1948
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,455
Just go. I got a date with
the man in the mirror.

1949
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:27,825
Hey, you!

1950
01:25:30,694 --> 01:25:33,161
You keep away from her!

1951
01:25:33,163 --> 01:25:35,831
I'm gonna wreck it!

1952
01:25:38,035 --> 01:25:40,871
She's not your friend!

1953
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:43,439
She's my friend!

1954
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:45,908
Here it is, this way.

1955
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:47,978
Come on, kid.
We gotta move.

1956
01:26:00,557 --> 01:26:01,892
Eeeee-oh-boy!

1957
01:26:18,976 --> 01:26:20,044
No!

1958
01:26:21,078 --> 01:26:22,744
Whoa!

1959
01:26:22,746 --> 01:26:25,916
Vanellope!

1960
01:26:30,587 --> 01:26:32,856
Hey! Let go of me!

1961
01:26:35,526 --> 01:26:36,994
Kid!
Ralph!

1962
01:26:41,832 --> 01:26:43,565
Hey!

1963
01:26:43,567 --> 01:26:46,001
Hey, get back here!

1964
01:26:46,003 --> 01:26:47,004
Huh?

1965
01:26:48,772 --> 01:26:50,205
You put her down!

1966
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:52,040
Whoa!

1967
01:27:14,132 --> 01:27:15,699
Vanellope!

1968
01:27:31,949 --> 01:27:35,220
You know, you're acting
like a real bad guy here!

1969
01:27:35,886 --> 01:27:38,287
No!

1970
01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:39,821
Well, you are!

1971
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:41,759
And I will never
be your friend!

1972
01:27:45,963 --> 01:27:47,265
Hey, doofus!

1973
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:49,166
Ralph!

1974
01:27:56,907 --> 01:27:59,144
Catch me if you can,
you big dummy!

1975
01:28:05,849 --> 01:28:07,250
I got you, little sister.

1976
01:28:10,955 --> 01:28:12,621
Now go!
Get out of here!

1977
01:28:12,623 --> 01:28:14,290
Ralph!
Go!

1978
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:17,095
No!
Don't hurt him!

1979
01:28:17,761 --> 01:28:18,829
Please, no!

1980
01:28:23,634 --> 01:28:26,102
Stop it!
You're squishing him!

1981
01:28:27,839 --> 01:28:29,839
You're gonna
kill my best friend!

1982
01:28:34,045 --> 01:28:36,314
Fine! You win!
You win, okay?

1983
01:28:39,818 --> 01:28:42,120
Just please put him down.

1984
01:28:44,756 --> 01:28:47,290
I'll be your
only friend, okay?

1985
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,358
Just let him go.

1986
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,962
No! No, kid.

1987
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,131
Huh?

1988
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:56,999
That's it.
That's it. Yeah.

1989
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:59,869
Put him down
and I'll go with you

1990
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:01,370
and we'll be
best friends forever.

1991
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,874
Just me and you.

1992
01:29:04,876 --> 01:29:06,077
That's what you want, right?

1993
01:29:09,347 --> 01:29:10,747
Well,
that's not what I want!

1994
01:29:12,417 --> 01:29:14,984
It's not right to hold
a friend back from her dreams!

1995
01:29:14,986 --> 01:29:17,120
You don't own her!

1996
01:29:17,122 --> 01:29:19,922
That's not how
friendship works!

1997
01:29:19,924 --> 01:29:21,759
You need to let her go!

1998
01:29:23,895 --> 01:29:24,896
Hey.

1999
01:29:28,933 --> 01:29:30,034
You need to let her go.

2000
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:36,141
I know. It's gonna hurt
a little bit when you do.

2001
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:40,044
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's gonna hurt a lot.

2002
01:29:41,913 --> 01:29:44,115
But you're gonna be okay.

2003
01:29:46,784 --> 01:29:48,484
And we're gonna be okay.

2004
01:29:48,486 --> 01:29:49,754
Right, kid?

2005
01:29:51,389 --> 01:29:54,058
Of course we are. Always.

2006
01:29:56,194 --> 01:29:59,262
See? No matter
where she goes

2007
01:29:59,264 --> 01:30:02,098
or where she lives

2008
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,367
she's always gonna
be our friend.

2009
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:06,836
And we just gotta trust her.

2010
01:30:06,838 --> 01:30:09,274
Because that's what
best friends do.

2011
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:11,876
Right?

2012
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,792
Thanks, buddy.

2013
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,196
Wow!

2014
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:34,797
I feel good about this.

2015
01:30:34,799 --> 01:30:36,799
Mmm.

2016
01:30:36,801 --> 01:30:39,137
Mmm.

2017
01:30:41,172 --> 01:30:42,339
Ralph, look!

2018
01:30:42,341 --> 01:30:44,275
I think you fixed
your insecurity!

2019
01:30:46,278 --> 01:30:47,511
You're right.

2020
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:49,845
Whoo-hoo!

2021
01:30:49,847 --> 01:30:51,013
Ralph, no!

2022
01:30:53,017 --> 01:30:54,518
Whoa!

2023
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
Park it right here, Ralph!

2024
01:30:56,522 --> 01:30:58,854
Your ol' pal
JP Spamley's gotcha!

2025
01:30:58,856 --> 01:31:01,025
Whoo!

2026
01:31:02,361 --> 01:31:03,427
Wow, that didn't work.

2027
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:09,966
Look up there!

2028
01:31:09,968 --> 01:31:11,836
It's a big strong man
in need of rescuing.

2029
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:21,479
Hah!

2030
01:32:10,329 --> 01:32:12,364
Mmm.

2031
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,335
Oh, thanks, Frogger.

2032
01:32:16,868 --> 01:32:18,003
Wait a minute.

2033
01:32:18,537 --> 01:32:20,170
Who are all of you?

2034
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:22,205
We're friends of Vanellope's.

2035
01:32:22,207 --> 01:32:24,374
Yeah, and any friend
of Vanellope's

2036
01:32:24,376 --> 01:32:26,009
is a friend of ours.

2037
01:32:26,011 --> 01:32:27,878
You're welcome.

2038
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,246
Ralph!

2039
01:32:29,248 --> 01:32:31,348
Looking good, big fella!

2040
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,983
Heyo!

2041
01:32:34,086 --> 01:32:35,285
This dress is not made
for a big boy.

2042
01:32:35,287 --> 01:32:37,287
It's going right up
the back alley there.

2043
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:38,955
Let me just make
a little adjustment.

2044
01:32:38,957 --> 01:32:41,391
There we go.

2045
01:32:41,393 --> 01:32:42,993
Internet users are breathing

2046
01:32:42,995 --> 01:32:45,295
a collective sigh
of relief tonight.

2047
01:32:45,297 --> 01:32:47,631
Just as mysteriously
as it appeared,

2048
01:32:47,633 --> 01:32:50,035
the Wreck-It Ralph virus
has vanished.

2049
01:32:56,308 --> 01:32:58,408
You know what
I just realized?

2050
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:01,144
The sun never rises
or sets here

2051
01:33:01,146 --> 01:33:03,113
because everything's
always on.

2052
01:33:03,115 --> 01:33:05,682
Well, now, isn't that
an astute observation?

2053
01:33:05,684 --> 01:33:07,250
I know, right?

2054
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:08,452
You know,
other than KnowsMore,

2055
01:33:08,454 --> 01:33:10,220
I'm probably the smartest guy
on the Internet.

2056
01:33:10,222 --> 01:33:12,255
Yeah. Yeah.

2057
01:33:12,257 --> 01:33:15,258
Yo, V. We're about to come
back online. You ready?

2058
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:16,660
Be right there!

2059
01:33:16,662 --> 01:33:19,329
Hey, Ralph,
don't be a stranger!

2060
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:21,932
Well, I can't be much stranger
than you, Shank.

2061
01:33:21,934 --> 01:33:24,336
Oh. That's a good dad joke.

2062
01:33:25,638 --> 01:33:27,337
Hey, don't forget.

2063
01:33:27,339 --> 01:33:29,272
You know Shank added
my code and everything,

2064
01:33:29,274 --> 01:33:31,108
so I'll be able
to regenerate.

2065
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,242
I'm gonna be totally safe.

2066
01:33:32,244 --> 01:33:34,679
No, I know.
It's gonna be great.

2067
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:36,279
You found your dream game.

2068
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:37,549
Yeah, I did.

2069
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,451
I did.

2070
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:42,452
So, uh

2071
01:33:42,454 --> 01:33:45,489
I guess I should probably
head in there now, you know?

2072
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:48,460
Oh, before you go,
I wanted to give you this.

2073
01:33:49,528 --> 01:33:52,362
Oh, I'm so sorry
I broke it, Ralph.

2074
01:33:52,364 --> 01:33:54,398
No, no. It's okay.

2075
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,435
Now we can both
have a half. See?

2076
01:33:58,505 --> 01:33:59,505
Yeah!

2077
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:09,014
I love you so much.

2078
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:11,518
I'm really gonna miss you.

2079
01:34:13,385 --> 01:34:15,320
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

2080
01:34:16,523 --> 01:34:18,056
I really am.

2081
01:34:23,663 --> 01:34:24,664
All right.

2082
01:34:26,566 --> 01:34:28,501
Okay, getting a little clingy
on me, here.

2083
01:34:31,404 --> 01:34:33,438
Go on. Get out of here.

2084
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,720
The world's
waiting for you, kid.

2085
01:35:32,332 --> 01:35:34,398
I'll be honest,

2086
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,701
it still feels kind of
weird around here.

2087
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:38,736
I mean, a lot has changed.

2088
01:35:38,738 --> 01:35:40,204
Even though we got
that steering wheel

2089
01:35:40,206 --> 01:35:41,272
and saved Sugar Rush

2090
01:35:41,274 --> 01:35:43,443
it's never really gonna
be the same.

2091
01:35:45,445 --> 01:35:46,644
For one thing,
the racers aren't even

2092
01:35:46,646 --> 01:35:48,246
that obnoxious anymore.

2093
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:50,648
Oh, golly. I'm sorry
you didn't win, Taffyta.

2094
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:53,284
Pfft! Our friendship
is much more important to me

2095
01:35:53,286 --> 01:35:54,585
than winning, Rancis.

2096
01:35:54,587 --> 01:35:56,320
Losing builds character!

2097
01:35:56,322 --> 01:35:58,256
Everyone's a winner, Taffyta.

2098
01:35:58,258 --> 01:35:59,790
Felix and Calhoun,

2099
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:00,992
as goofy as they are,

2100
01:36:00,994 --> 01:36:03,427
they turned out to be
pretty great parents.

2101
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:04,729
I gotta hand it
to you two,

2102
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:07,231
how on earth did you
tame those things?

2103
01:36:07,233 --> 01:36:08,599
It's simple, Surge.

2104
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,202
The key to parenting is

2105
01:36:14,173 --> 01:36:16,140
And then what you do is

2106
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:21,846
And that is the secret
to raising perfect children.

2107
01:36:21,848 --> 01:36:25,283
Wow, I wish every parent
could hear that.

2108
01:36:25,285 --> 01:36:26,651
I'm keeping busy, too.

2109
01:36:26,653 --> 01:36:28,586
I finally joined
Zangief's book club.

2110
01:36:28,588 --> 01:36:30,655
Good point, Bison.
And how about you, Ralph?

2111
01:36:30,657 --> 01:36:32,590
Do you feel Dostoyevsky

2112
01:36:32,592 --> 01:36:35,192
intended to make
narrator unreliable?

2113
01:36:35,194 --> 01:36:36,661
Um

2114
01:36:36,663 --> 01:36:38,864
I do and I don't.

2115
01:36:38,866 --> 01:36:41,432
You do, and you don't.

2116
01:36:41,434 --> 01:36:44,201
Duality.
That's really deep, Ralph.

2117
01:36:44,203 --> 01:36:45,503
Thanks, Sonic.

2118
01:36:45,505 --> 01:36:48,239
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

2119
01:36:48,241 --> 01:36:50,575
Oh. And we got this new thing
we do every Friday night

2120
01:36:50,577 --> 01:36:52,677
where we all go and hang out
in a different game.

2121
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:54,345
I actually hosted this week.

2122
01:36:54,347 --> 01:36:55,746
Heyo!

2123
01:36:55,748 --> 01:36:58,349
Hope you're all hungry.
I made burnt pie.

2124
01:36:58,351 --> 01:37:00,217
What's burnt pie,
Wreck-It?

2125
01:37:00,219 --> 01:37:02,520
Oh, it's just a pie
that you burn.

2126
01:37:02,522 --> 01:37:03,454
You can use any pie.

2127
01:37:03,456 --> 01:37:05,222
You just leave it
in the oven too long.

2128
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:11,529
Yeah, we really do
have a lot of fun.

2129
01:37:11,531 --> 01:37:14,866
I guess that's pretty much
all the news I got for you.

2130
01:37:14,868 --> 01:37:17,602
Oh, man, your stories
never disappoint, Ralph.

2131
01:37:17,604 --> 01:37:19,203
I just wish
we could hang out sooner.

2132
01:37:19,205 --> 01:37:20,706
Yeah. Me, too.

2133
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:22,406
When did you say you were
getting those days off?

2134
01:37:22,408 --> 01:37:25,209
Uh, our upgrade
starts on January 25th,

2135
01:37:25,211 --> 01:37:26,912
so, like, two months
from now.

2136
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:29,580
Oh, that'll go by in a flash.
Oh, speaking of which

2137
01:37:29,582 --> 01:37:30,682
you want me to bring you
anything from home

2138
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:31,683
when I come visit?

2139
01:37:31,685 --> 01:37:33,752
Oh! You know what
I cannot find

2140
01:37:33,754 --> 01:37:35,519
anywhere on the Internet?

2141
01:37:35,521 --> 01:37:38,456
A halfway decent
BurgerTime burger.

2142
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,759
I've been talking them up
to Shank and the crew.

2143
01:37:40,761 --> 01:37:42,493
And honestly, I think
they're starting to think

2144
01:37:42,495 --> 01:37:43,662
I'm making it up.

2145
01:37:43,664 --> 01:37:44,930
All right,
consider it done.

2146
01:37:44,932 --> 01:37:46,600
I'll bring you guys
a truckload.

2147
01:37:48,936 --> 01:37:51,268
Well, sun's coming up already.

2148
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:52,738
Guess I better get to it.

2149
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,238
Yeah, me too.

2150
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,406
Talk next week?

2151
01:37:55,408 --> 01:37:57,274
I shall await your call,
madam.

2152
01:37:57,276 --> 01:38:01,880
Then, adieu, adieu,
farting is such sweet sorrow.

2153
01:38:01,882 --> 01:38:04,183
So long, stinkbrain.

2154
01:38:04,752 --> 01:38:05,752
Bye, kid.

2155
01:38:19,566 --> 01:38:22,567
Hey. You doing
okay there, Ralph?

2156
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:26,805
Yeah, I am, actually.
I'm doing great.

2157
01:38:26,807 --> 01:38:29,543
Come on, Felix.
Let's get to work, buddy.

2158
01:42:00,955 --> 01:42:04,023
Hey, Mo, did you like
the movie, sweetie?

2159
01:42:04,025 --> 01:42:06,626
Well, there was a scene
in the trailer

2160
01:42:06,628 --> 01:42:08,661
that wasn't in the movie

2161
01:42:08,663 --> 01:42:11,097
and that makes me sad.

2162
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:13,199
Aw, that's too bad.

2163
01:42:13,201 --> 01:42:14,800
Maybe playing your game
will cheer you up.

2164
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:15,803
Okay.

2165
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,972
Pancake.

2166
01:42:19,974 --> 01:42:21,075
Milkshake.

2167
01:42:22,143 --> 01:42:24,679
Pancake.
Pancake.

2168
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:26,444
Milkshake.

2169
01:42:26,446 --> 01:42:28,014
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
I wanna try, I wanna try!

2170
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:29,482
My turn, my turn!

2171
01:42:29,484 --> 01:42:31,517
Pancake. Milkshake.

2172
01:42:31,519 --> 01:42:33,886
Milkshake. Milkshake.

2173
01:42:33,888 --> 01:42:35,721
Pancake. Pancake.

2174
01:42:35,723 --> 01:42:38,057
Milkshake.
Milkshake.

2175
01:42:38,059 --> 01:42:39,792
I'm starting to understand
why people like this game.

2176
01:42:39,794 --> 01:42:41,193
Very zen.

2177
01:42:43,131 --> 01:42:45,831
Hey, everybody,
look what I found!

2178
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:47,967
More pancakes!
Sweet!

2179
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:50,202
Let's speed it up.
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2180
01:42:50,204 --> 01:42:55,841
Pancake, pancake, pancake.

2181
01:42:55,843 --> 01:42:58,110
Eat, little bunny.
Eat, eat, eat!

2182
01:42:58,112 --> 01:42:59,745
Uh, Ralph, you might wanna try
feeding the kitty

2183
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:01,247
for a little while.

2184
01:43:01,249 --> 01:43:03,983
No, the kitty gets
the milkshake.

2185
01:43:03,985 --> 01:43:07,822
The bunny gets the pancake.

2186
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:37,732
And now,

2187

Uh-uh!

2195

Why would I? I like you.

2196
01:52:14,304 --> 01:52:16,404
You guys
still sticking around?

2197
01:52:16,406 --> 01:52:19,174
All right. Well,
you're welcome to stay.

2198
01:52:19,176 --> 01:52:22,677
There's not really any more
surprises, but, you know

2199
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:24,546
Good luck getting that song
out of your head.

2200
01:52:24,548 --> 01:52:26,081
It's a real earwig.

2201
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:28,452
Anyway, what else? Uh
