1 
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,157 
I did everything I could, 
but the bank does not understand. 

2 
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:03,120 
If we do not have the 50 thousand U.S. dollars 
payment within 7 days ... 

3 
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,000 
... lose the workshop. 

4 
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,936 
Can I really do that? 

5 
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,600 
There's me, is the bank. 

6 
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,100 
You are the bank, Warner. 

7 
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:16,800 
How am I? The truth is that only 
manage small accounts. 

8 
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,700 
If I give you another extension, 
I said goodbye. 

9 
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,500 
You can find another job ... 

10 
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,800 
... but this workshop is irreplaceable. 

11 
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:27,400 
Do we really expect 
sacrifice my career for you? 

12 
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600 
What you do if you really interested. 

13 
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,400 
You know that if ... 

14 
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,500 
... but I did all I could. 

15 
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:43,100 
Sorry, Katie. 
It's nothing personal. 

16 
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,800 
Everything about this workshop, 
is personal for me. 

17 
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,500 
My father built it, 
my brother died for him ... 

18 
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,600 
... is not only the workshop, Warner. 

19 
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,100 
Perhaps this is a problem. 

20 
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,101 
Then ... 

21 
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,000 
-- How did it go with the bank? 
-- Very good. 

22 
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,800 
It impressed by 
my business plans ... 

23 
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,450 
... and seduced by my charms. 

24 
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,000 
Already established a plan 
Pay with them. 

25 
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040 
I thought we'd done 
So last month. 

26 
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,000 
And I did it again this month. 

27 
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,900 
Listen ... boys 
are hungry. 

28 
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,740 
So I think it would be a good idea ... 

29 
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,440 
... if we do we bring 
a couple of pizzas. 

30 
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,200 
It is an excellent idea, Charlie. 

31 
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,700 
Let's have fun with 
the boy pizzas. 

32 
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:36,327 
I do not understand that 
is so annoying, officer. 

33 
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:37,720 
Detective. 

34 
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,000 
And the sidewalk is where 
people walk ... 

35 
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,750 
... there is where 
van cars. 

36 
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,800 
That's why we call streets. 

37 
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,560 
There were many cars in the middle, 
that's why I decided to use the sidewalk. 

38 
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,500 
Pudo having killed someone. 

39 
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,780 
If. I needed to do 
either something stupid. 

40 
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:57,070 
So I do a big favour, 
making me a fine. 

41 
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,790 
Tómalo how ... natural selection. 

42 
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,060 
Do you want ... I will multe 
a traffic violation? 

43 
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,524 
What we wanted was to see annoying. 

44 
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,500 
Y. .. judging by your appearance, 
I think it worked. 

45 
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,150 
Do not press me, ma'am. 

46 
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:23,670 
Pressure is what makes it fun. 
You should try it sometime. 

47 
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200 
Damn! 

48 
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,345 
She cree the owner of the world. 

49 
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720 
It is. 

50 
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,427 
Look, just because they are young, 
rich and sexy ... 

51 
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,340 
What else can it be? 

52 
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,376 
I need a crane. 
Ah .. and a Expresso. 

53 
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,040 
3 minutes late, 
5 deliveries in the latter. 

54 
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,500 
What kind of imbecile calls for free pizza, 
for a delay of 3 minutes? 

55 
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,035 
The rate of those who want something for free. 
How the whole world on the planet. 

56 
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,500 
It is too, so I 
has claimed this month. 

57 
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,250 
Do not cost anything, Sal. 
What I pay my discounts. 

58 
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:26,251 
One moment, please. 

59 
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:29,100 
If you arrive late again, 
you will not pay. 

60 
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,077 
You have 15 minutes to deliver these. 

61 
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,730 
Think you can accomplish? 

62 
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,300 
I do jumping 
in one foot. 

63 
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,820 
Come on! 

64 
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,730 
<i> Calling all units, 
there is a robbery in progress ...</ i> 

65 
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:12,600 
<i> suspects are ... 
are armed and dangerous. </ i> 

66 
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:16,231 
<i> They were last seen, 
in Lashre and Schurmann. </ i> 

67 
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,400 
Faster! Come on! 

68 
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,750 
Date back! Date back! 

69 
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,751 
Do not move! 

70 
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,740 
Try not to go too fast. 

71 
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,200 
Shit! It is the police! 

72 
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,264 
Do something, man! 

73 
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,750 
What I'm doing. 

74 
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,521 
-- Go more slowly. 
-- I do not want to lose him. 

75 
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,700 
-- It's better than stars. 
-- We will not. 

76 
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,321 
Come on, man! 

77 
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,870 
Apartat of my way! 

78 
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,580 
Take it calmly! 

79 
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,460 
There are 2 of them! 
They are on our ass! Come on! 

80 
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:32,100 
It is too fast. 

81 
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,330 
Oh, hell! 

82 
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,120 
Move back! 
I'm going to be late! 

83 
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,001 
More slowly! 
Be careful with this car! 

84 
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,780 
-- Trying to kill? 
-- Try to grab such. 

85 
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,081 
It's the same thing. 

86 
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,200 
Tómalo calmly! 

87 
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,360 
That's it! For! 

88 
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,361 
Yes, Mr! 

89 
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,260 
What carajo! 

90 
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:41,924 
One minute and 10 seconds late! 
Thank you for free pizzas. 

91 
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,225 
Is not what you do, or do you? 

92 
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,300 
Was your crane which I delayed? 

93 
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,532 
You have a crane outside, you could 
have sought pizzas yourself. 

94 
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,600 
But then had not been free. 

95 
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,040 
Lindo car. 

96 
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,300 
It was my husband, was drunk. 

97 
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,000 
I could not where it was going to take. 

98 
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,960 
She must be conducted savagely. 

99 
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,600 
Who says that this is not the case? 

100 
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,060 
It is a tragedy. 

101 
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,700 
It is a high performance vehicle. 
Must be driven hard and fast. 

102 
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,701 
All the time. 

103 
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,950 
That means that if 
stands much time on it ... 

104 
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:49,070 
... decks lose air, 
transmission is oxidized ... 

105 
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,400 
and fuel expires. 
I know what he means. 

106 
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600 
These cars require 
Pistons well lubricated. 

107 
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,915 
How do you know? 

108 
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,500 
I've seen a couple of engines. 

109 
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,650 
My kids are hungry, 
and the pizza is cooling. 

110 
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,000 
Should not bring food? 

111 
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400 
Stay with the change. 

112 
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,110 
Thanks for the Council, 
Pizza man. 

113 
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,870 
It's all good. You have my number. 

114 
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,900 
In general, is 
how something simple ... 

115 
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,901 
Gasoline old rubbish ... 
stuck in the filter ... 

116 
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:31,000 
... or a weak battery. 
But, whatever, Mrs. Devereaux. 

117 
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,500 
It will be ready to take 
tomorrow afternoon. 

118 
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,500 
You're the mechanic? 

119 
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,501 
Do not carry this clothing 
to be in fashion. 

120 
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:41,700 
Of course not. 
But why did not he carries? 

121 
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,600 
By the way, perhaps you should be set at, 
Samples that if you're a woman. 

122 
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,520 
I do not need anyone be fixed at me. 

123 
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,520 
We call for the cost, 
before doing the job. 

124 
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,801 
Do not worry. Only arreglalo. 

125 
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,415 
Perra! 

126 
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,460 
Do we really believe we 
an opportunity with this woman? 

127 
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,872 
Why not? 
Why is married, and is rich. 

128 
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,620 
The women how she, 
how leeches are social ... 

129 
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,650 
... and only fixing in men, 
they can deal with them. 

130 
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,270 
And you're just a 
pizza deliveryman. 

131 
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,220 
Then I change my life. 
Let me run for you. 

132 
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,630 
You can not lead or 
a pizza on time. 

133 
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,140 
I am the best! 

134 
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,850 
Give me the keys to the Ford, 
and 5 minutes of your time ... 

135 
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:34,000 
... and you take a walk, 
you despeinará hair. 

136 
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,235 
I can not. 

137 
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:39,700 
Customers expect their cars, 
I can not take your time. 

138 
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,190 
Perhaps a bit. 

139 
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:43,560 
Yes, today I met with Warner. 
To that I referred. 

140 
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,140 
Not everything that says a woman, 
is a reflection of his men. 

141 
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,741 
If it is! 

142 
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,060 
Grow! 

143 
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,670 
Well. When Ford is ready ... 

144 
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,714 
... adjust according to what my 
standards, and we are on careers. 

145 
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,425 
And who will be the driver? 

146 
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,970 
When the Ford is ready, 
need a driver ... 

147 
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,601 
... and I'm that type. 

148 
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800 
You what I will try. 

149 
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:06,000 
Are you sure you with something 
not start with a kick? 

150 
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,900 
The motorcycle! Oh, hell! 

151 
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,822 
I need this car in 
running the streets ... 

152 
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:17,500 
... not earn any money, 
while here in the workshop. 

153 
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,960 
Forge can fix it. 
Can I run for you? 

154 
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,226 
First the pizza deliveryman. 
Are you now? 

155 
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:27,700 
You do not have license, you're lucky 
you leave the car park. 

156 
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,500 
Your mother will return soon, 
and I will kill you if I stop doing that. 

157 
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,200 
Mom will return to Germany after 
that was the fourth husband divorced. 

158 
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:38,765 
The fifth is already on its way, I know. 

159 
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,800 
The cars are how women, boy. 

160 
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:47,000 
Give them a lot of drinking, 
not make them go faster. 

161 
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,113 
Only got drunk, 
and you vomit over ... 

162 
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,820 
... before falling asleep, 
after that. 

163 
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,700 
Then ... How do you know 
if the service did you do? 

164 
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:56,701 
You're wrong. 

165 
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,500 
Who says? 

166 
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:00,600 
I said that. 
Measure times ... 

167 
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,876 
... pressure fuel, 
maneuverability, oil pressure ... 

168 
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:05,200 
... everything is here, and it is perfect. 

169 
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,300 
Listen. 

170 
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,300 
Who's the mechanic here? 
Do you ... or the computer? 

171 
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,600 
It's me. 

172 
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,800 
Then how one starts working. 

173 
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000 
A true mechanic. 

174 
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600 
Watch. 

175 
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,400 
Sientelo. 

176 
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,600 
Listen. 

177 
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,926 
What this car tells you, 
how a fuel sensor ... 

178 
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:36,082 
... is that it will be much better, 
if confundirte avoid. 

179 
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900 
Takes. 

180 
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,400 
It deals a little with my program. 

181 
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,300 
When will you begin 
write reports? 

182 
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,620 
And where you'll be? 

183 
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:50,200 
I will be in the library, 
reading a bit. 

184 
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600 
Excuse me, sir. 

185 
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:01,100 
But we need to investigate 
theft this afternoon. 

186 
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,233 
I do not know. Treatment 
investigate this pudding ... 

187 
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,080 
and do not want to be ... 
interrupted. 

188 
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,650 
I was in pursuit. 

189 
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,400 
You are going to be the same novice, 
while I have my plate. 

190 
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:11,830 
Yes, sir. 

191 
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,461 
Can I ask you a question? 

192 
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:19,240 
Why does someone steal a cup of coffee? 
They have very little money. 

193 
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,680 
It's a cover. 

194 
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:23,300 
They must have an operation 
money laundering. 

195 
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,700 
Stan has been dealing 
the business of the game ... 

196 
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:27,360 
... in this territory, 
and is good at that. 

197 
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,150 
But would steal a suicide. 

198 
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,500 
Not if you think you're more 
big as him. 

199 
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,900 
I think it was a banda 
Gregor Gargolov. 

200 
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,480 
The gangster who wears today, 
insurance are forcibly ... 

201 
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,850 
... responsible for conquer 
Stan territory. 

202 
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,630 
Do you think that we can arrest them? 

203 
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,130 
All were working 
in the case of coffee ... 

204 
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,500 
... before we reached us. 

205 
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,800 
Then ... 

206 
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,300 
We have no victims or witnesses ... 

207 
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,000 
It's just a robbery, and there is no 
no evidence useful. 

208 
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,890 
What is the cause for concern? 

209 
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,680 
Because officers were 2 
Wounded persecution. 

210 
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,900 
Sorry for them ... 

211 
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:01,350 
... but my experience tells me 
that this case will be closed soon. 

212 
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,351 
What if this close? 

213 
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:06,000 
Probably those involved 
will be pressing. 

214 
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,322 
Can you say something about who 
is responsible in this case? 

215 
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,000 
I would like to help. 

216 
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500 
I think we need strength 
extra day and night. 

217 
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,970 
If force is the land that 
needed, I am your man. 

218 
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,908 
Do you know anything you can do 
to put pressure on these guys? 

219 
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,500 
Yes, Mr! 

220 
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,200 
Let me finish my damned 
lunch in peace. 

221 
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,266 
The blue devil is going to the front, 
entering the sector. 

222 
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,995 
How much money pusiste 
in this race? 

223 
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:51,600 
Everything that was me. 
500 to go ... 

224 
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,601 
... and another thousand in this. 

225 
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,700 
Is that all? 

226 
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,170 
It is hard to maintain 
cars in good condition. 

227 
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,500 
Everything we do is make them 
points and oil changes. 

228 
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,180 
Then ... Why you did? 

229 
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,542 
Someone has to keep their engines, 
and change their tyres. 

230 
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:06,400 
Doubles only that corner. 
Did you achieve? 

231 
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,510 
There are!. In addition, customers are. 

232 
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:13,366 
If you do not get 50 large in 6 days 
the bank will stay with the workshop. 

233 
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:14,750 
Will 6 days? 

234 
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:16,751 
How you do that? 

235 
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:19,700 
While in all races, 
and betting our drivers. 

236 
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,025 
Only I say this because 
we are family ... 

237 
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:24,200 
... and so you apures 
in repairing the Ford. 

238 
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,964 
But if you say a word of 
this in the workshop ... 

239 
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,410 
... you beaten to death 
with your laptop. 

240 
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,200 
I thought that the workshop 
We were family. 

241 
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880 
That is different. 

242 
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,240 
If it were not, would not have 
anyone that it would be. 

243 
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,722 
How win today? 

244 
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,272 
4, maybe 5 thousand .... 

245 
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,100 
... depends on how much there is at stake. 

246 
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,880 
And if we lose? 

247 
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:49,600 
It's all in Ford 
and the Cyber morning. 

248 
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,480 
This kind if he knows lead. 

249 
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,500 
Anyone can drive. 

250 
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,300 
Encuentrénme someone 
that can compete. 

251 
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,445 
Salame and cheese. 
It's how you like, Dork. 

252 
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,070 
<i> And the winner is ... the devil blue! </ i> 

253 
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,581 
You have ghost driver 
to lose one of these days. 

254 
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,020 
-- Want to bet? 
-- Always. 

255 
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:23,000 
Hey, Wolf ... 

256 
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,300 
Will came to running, 
or take a nap? 

257 
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,950 
Well. Who wants to beat Wolf? 

258 
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,000 
Come on, there must be 
someone with balls! 

259 
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000 
I do not know your pizza. 

260 
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,790 
Perhaps you should ... 

261 
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,900 
... and the cowards have to eat, 
while watching the men running. 

262 
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,901 
$ 500 bet. 
If you have the cash. 

263 
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,900 
No, but forget the money 
and runs with me. 

264 
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,350 
Why would it? 

265 
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,420 
Because if not, look like you're using 
the money as an excuse. 

266 
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600 
All will know that you have 
fear of losing me. 

267 
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200 
If you're smart, you will. 

268 
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,970 
Need an incentive. 

269 
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000 
The car is not mine. 

270 
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,670 
Oh ... Do not tell me boy dealer? 

271 
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:24,440 
If I win, I want your hand ... 

272 
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,700 
Now let's see who is the coward. 

273 
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:33,175 
Do not talk seriously? 

274 
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,562 
I took this bet. 

275 
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,800 
Anyone who can not 
Ukrainian defeat a dog ... 

276 
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,463 
... on American soil, deserves 
losing his dirty hand. 

277 
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,670 
Yes, that's okay. 

278 
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:52,900 
I am inside. 

279 
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,000 
If I win, I want the money, 
and your Ipod. 

280 
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,870 
Cálmense! 

281 
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,280 
<i> guy from the pizza win! </ i> 

282 
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:04,450 
Where to learn 
driving well, man? 

283 
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000 
It's nothing, man. 

284 
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,300 
It was a Test Drive 
very silly to me. 

285 
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100 
I thought we should try. 

286 
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:18,100 
I think I should an Ipod. 

287 
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:32,144 
I hope you have something 
of Neil Diamond. 

288 
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:42,020 
I wish that we had not 
to hide. 

289 
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,900 
Whether you go very wrong, how to 
leave with a man like me. 

290 
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,500 
The street racing is illegal. 

291 
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,824 
I lose my plate, if my 
chief learns what I did. 

292 
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,836 
It could lose their lives, whether 
brokers believe that treason. 

293 
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,500 
Did not. 

294 
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,501 
Not yet. 

295 
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,324 
Some types, robbed the bank 
an operation to launder money. 

296 
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,000 
I think we were street racers. 

297 
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,800 
How do you know? 

298 
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:13,000 
The way to lead is unique, 
is how the way you ... 

299 
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,001 
Do Cojo? 

300 
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,470 
I was going to say, work.

301 
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:22,900 
I saw Wolf, make some 
how shaky yesterday. 

302 
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,940 
You are trying to save the workshop, 
and beat all runners. 

303 
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:30,792 
If I arrest Wolf, 
VIR might against their heads ... 

304 
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:33,170 
... might help me in my career. 

305 
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,370 
What would you stop? 

306 
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,000 
I can not arrest Wolf, 
without an order from my superiors. 

307 
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,900 
And they refuse to dármela. 

308 
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,650 
It is all lies. 

309 
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:44,411 
How can understand that? 

310 
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000 
It is because you are too hard. 

311 
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,081 
It was a few minutes ago. 

312 
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,020 
Want you double? 

313 
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,000 
Until the money knows 
that can be used well. 

314 
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,900 
Okay. It was a way of 
get information. 

315 
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,275 
Are you concerned that the police find out 
you're a runner street? 

316 
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,476 
Why did you do? 

317 
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:18,980 
I never imagined that I stars 
against a wall. It was terrible. 

318 
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,600 
Never knew what happened afterwards. 

319 
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,416 
I had no control at the races. 

320 
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,820 
Nobody has it. 

321 
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,870 
I do not want anything to happen to me 
So how in my life again. 

322 
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,020 
I am good driving a car. 
Do not you think? 

323 
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,820 
I feel that I have control of everything. 

324 
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,850 
Experiment total calm. 
Real Peace. 

325 
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:44,434 
It is how to be here with you. 

326 
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,050 
Why do you think I control? 

327 
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,152 
No. Because I love you. 

328 
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:54,100 
I do not think that is racing 
for much longer. 

329 
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:56,800 
Do not like how I drive? 

330 
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,920 
No. I love a lot. 

331 
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:02,800 
But if you do not get 50 large 
6 days ... 

332 
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:04,800 
the bank ... I will remove the workshop. 

333 
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:08,620 
What's with this workshop? 
Whether you find another. 

334 
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,400 
How can you say that? 

335 
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,632 
Not only is the workshop, Eric. 

336 
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,430 
My mother died when 
I was 3 years ... 

337 
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,000 
... my father when I was 16, 
my brother when he was 19. 

338 
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,154 
This workshop is the only thing 
share. 

339 
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:32,000 
If you lose ... 

340 
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,370 
... I lose them. 

341 
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,000 
Then ... 

342 
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,720 
You win. 

343 
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:47,860 
How can you be sure? 

344 
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,185 
Win the next race. 

345 
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,140 
And another after that. 

346 
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,460 
And after another. 

347 
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:57,331 
Until you have your money. 

348 
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,960 
You can not know that. 

349 
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,100 
I promise. 

350 
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:15,830 
Let me teach you how to drive. 

351 
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780 
Do You Hear that? 

352 
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:25,053 
What? It's just someone driving. 

353 
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:28,400 
It is the BMW of the blonde, 
Got it the radiator. 

354 
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,350 
So what? 

355 
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:32,540 
That car has given me problems, 
since it came into my workshop yesterday. 

356 
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,200 
Suéltame! 

357 
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,390 
-- Did you're going to strike back? 
-- No, I'm going to kill. 

358 
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:42,391 
Calm down! 

359 
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:44,530 
It was that the car looks bad, 
but ... I won the race! 

360 
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,390 
I took a little for rental, 
gambling debts ... 

361 
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,180 
... but the rest is yours. 

362 
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,580 
This is only the beginning of the 
I can win for us. 

363 
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,250 
There are 4 great! 

364 
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:57,800 
That does not cover damage to my 
you did in that car! 

365 
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,100 
This idiot, I am going to cost money 
that I won the race yesterday .... 

366 
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:03,100 
... and much more. 

367 
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:05,190 
-- Really? 
-- Oh, if! 

368 
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,200 
-- No! 
-- Why not? 

369 
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,700 
-- Because you going to hit! 
-- You can try! 

370 
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,800 
Do you know? Strips blows 
how Doblas curves ... 

371 
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:16,100 
... you put too much style. 
-- Who says? 

372 
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:19,386 
My instinct. That's why we kicked the 
Rear here, or on the road. 

373 
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:20,600 
-- You decide. 
-- How about now? 

374 
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,935 
The customer comes in the car tomorrow. 
What would you say? 

375 
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:26,780 
It is only a small! 

376 
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,620 
This is a workshop, you can 
fix it. It's what you do. 

377 
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,580 
It was what he was doing. 

378 
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:37,300 
Katie! 
Come on! 

379 
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,290 
What's your problem? 

380 
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400 
There is enough for both. 

381 
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,800 
I do not think so. 

382 
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,890 
Are you afraid that I see driving? 

383 
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:51,400 
You will become a memory. 

384 
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:54,600 
I am afraid that you do not see what more 
important in their lives. 

385 
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:57,720 
Do you? You can get something better. 

386 
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,200 
This workshop ... 

387 
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:03,100 
If you do not pay in 6 days, disappears. 

388 
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,000 
Just more open hole. 

389 
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,700 
If she loses her business, 
you finish. 

390 
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,255 
Oh, boy! 

391 
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,030 
It should be a great 
Working plate ... 

392 
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:04,200 
... replace the mouth 
fuel. 

393 
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:08,300 
Fix the radiator, 
and welding the clutch. 

394 
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,600 
I hope I have wrong. 

395 
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:16,263 
Is there anything you do not need 
be fixed? 

396 
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,500 
The upholstery might be intact. 

397 
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,400 
Well! 

398 
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,011 
Perhaps were very 
occupied admiration ... 

399 
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,000 
... how to assess 
rest of the damage. 

400 
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,600 
I do not think so. 

401 
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,586 
What happened to my husband indictment? 

402 
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,500 
Yo. 

403 
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,700 
There was a race yesterday. 

404 
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,870 
And I wanted to go, so ... 

405 
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:37,242 
Borrow your car. 

406 
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,700 
And you you left off? 

407 
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:40,700 
No. Cúlpame to me, I took it. 

408 
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:43,000 
-- Why? 
-- I needed the money. 

409 
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,350 
Y. .. 

410 
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,630 
... the truth, I wanted to show 
Katie to what could be done. 

411 
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,700 
So, you can destroy cars? 

412 
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,000 
I am very good conductor. 

413 
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,300 
Just give me the opportunity, 
or I myself. 

414 
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:57,840 
Watch. If you want to call 
the police? Okay ... 

415 
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:59,500 
... I will stay to be arrested. 
Otherwise ... 

416 
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,030 
Pagare damage, giving you everything 
what they earn in the races. 

417 
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,660 
Are you so good? 

418 
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,310 
I won yesterday. 

419 
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,812 
So looks when you win? 

420 
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,450 
Look at me. 

421 
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,700 
So ... how it looks ... 
when you win. 

422 
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:22,700 
A car can be arranged, 
only need money! 

423 
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,330 
You can not buy what I am! 

424 
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,150 
Do these races ... are illegal? 

425 
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,100 
Anything as good, 
usually it is. 

426 
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,600 
Let me mostrártelo. 

427 
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,465 
Well, pizza man, muéstramelo. 

428 
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,230 
Then I will tell you that you. 

429 
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,200 
My husband does not return until 
next week. 

430 
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:57,352 
Until then, make them 
This car runs with yours. 

431 
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,300 
Or not. 

432 
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,320 
Do you see? 
Everything will come out well. 

433 
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,600 
-- If you're lucky that this type! 
-- Go. 

434 
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,012 
Look! 

435 
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,740 
How do? 

436 
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,183 
When he left your car 
training? 

437 
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,184 
Yesterday. 

438 
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,870 
Just before earn. 

439 
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:49,400 
Perhaps you shoot, 
if you have a car like that. 

440 
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,815 
Maybe I should shoot 
face against yours. 

441 
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,550 
Thank God llegaste 
with those pizzas. 

442 
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000 
Start. 

443 
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,060 
Please. 

444 
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:15,386 
You're fast! 

445 
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,741 
What if they'd done 
had been slow? 

446 
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,000 
I would have smoked a Cuban cigar ... 

447 
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,570 
... and enjoyed a drink 
of good white wine. 

448 
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,600 
Waiting for gourmet food. 

449 
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,040 
I do not want to be interfered, but ... 

450 
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,000 
... but you should not do 
This whole week. 

451 
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:31,410 
My wife had an unexpected, 
and left me with the kids ... 

452 
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,500 
... and they wanted to invite 
his friends. 

453 
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:36,600 
Now they are hungry, 
and the only thing I have is caviar. 

454 
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,750 
I hear that many 
Sometimes in my work. 

455 
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,345 
It was pizza. 

456 
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700 
Yes, pizza! 

457 
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,260 
My name is Gregor Gargolov. 

458 
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:46,760 
And you impressed me. 

459 
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,042 
If delayed more than 3 minutes, 
the order is free. 

460 
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:51,043 
It is a model. 

461 
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,320 
I am talking about yesterday. 

462 
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:55,800 
I am something like a 
fanatic careers. 

463 
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,225 
I like how they drive. 

464 
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,060 
-- Do you know that you won your man? 
-- It is not over. 

465 
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840 
You're it. 

466 
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:08,960 
Does it know? 

467 
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,131 
If you're smart, you know 
when your time went. 

468 
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,870 
Perhaps only I was lucky. 

469 
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,800 
I do not think so. 

470 
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,391 
If driving to my .... 

471 
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,600 
... you give the car, 
you cover the races ... 

472 
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,900 
... and I'll give you 10% 
of ganancías. 

473 
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,610 
I ... I appreciate your offer, 
Mr Gargolov, but ... 

474 
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:38,035 
... I just want the $ 30 
pizzas, and a generous tip. 

475 
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,100 
Tired of annoying if you wonder why? 

476 
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,000 
Any other driver, 
seize this opportunity. 

477 
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,140 
I imagine that I am not a 
of those drivers. 

478 
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,800 
There is more that I know ... 

479 
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,600 
Is this familiar? 

480 
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,178 
Do Brat Pitt? 
Maybe Justin Timberlake? 

481 
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,564 
Close. 

482 
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,800 
This is a police sketch, 
of a thief who stole ... 

483 
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,080 
... a shop in Tennessee, 
last year. 

484 
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:14,200 
The thieves made sounded the 
alarm, and captured. 

485 
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,960 
But the driver, escaped to 
a dozen police cars ... 

486 
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,600 
... and a helicopter. 

487 
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:20,200 
A great feat! 

488 
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,460 
What happened with him? 

489 
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:25,700 
Nobody knows. 

490 
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:29,430 
But I have the hunch, 
you that you were a thief. 

491 
00:36:32,864 --> 00:36:33,864 
Dad! 

492 
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,315 
Ernie put in Pizza 
DVD player. 

493 
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:40,300 
Okay. 

494 
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,240 
I already there. 

495 
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,760 
So is being a parent, Mike. 

496 
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,870 
One crisis after another. 

497 
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,000 
Already we are on the fourth 
DVD player. 

498 
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,200 
Can you find out? 

499 
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,300 
If. I have good sense 
of the management. 

500 
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:56,850 
Well. I know that back 
to see us soon. 

501 
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,000 
More will be worth it 
more fun than Bingo ... 

502 
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,300 
... or take a couple of beers, 
or you're going to jail. 

503 
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,200 
-- How often does this happen? 
-- Every day, somewhere. 

504 
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:01,600 
And the police did not learn? 

505 
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:05,000 
No. It kept moving, 
caring for their backs. 

506 
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,600 
One raid, it may happen to a 
mile, and nobody knows. 

507 
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:23,820 
What bet? 

508 
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,661 
The keys to the car, 
cover the bet ... 

509 
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:28,440 
... and 20 thousand to the line. 

510 
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,826 
Do you know something of my opponents? 

511 
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,146 
That, the driver of the white Supra ... 

512 
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:38,060 
... is good in narrow areas, 
so be careful in grubbed. 

513 
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:41,350 
That's not my concern, will be tense. 

514 
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,465 
Do you see that woman in R.S.I? 

515 
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:47,190 
It is a professional 
the tight curves. 

516 
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,960 
So will end in complete shock. 

517 
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,700 
Sueno confident. 

518 
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,300 
I meet my promises. 

519 
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,800 
Do not spill. 

520 
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540 
Tourists! 

521 
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:51,880 
What is the prize? 

522 
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,940 
The bet your opponent, 
anything of value. 

523 
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:59,270 
Most do it for nothing. 
Only play in the car. 

524 
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,810 
So, how to cover 
the bet? 

525 
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:02,716 
Many can not, we must 
find alguin as Katie .... 

526 
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,700 
... drive their cars, and take a 
percent of what they bet. 

527 
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:08,811 
It was my car which lead yesterday. 
How then run? 

528 
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,100 
I want to lead well! 

529 
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,200 
It's best to look, 
is quite dangerous. 

530 
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,330 
But do not feel so 
how well do it! 

531 
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:25,243 
It is not as easy as it sounds. 

532 
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:26,600 
Then, TeachMe! 

533 
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:28,500 
TeachMe your movements, 
Pizza man! 

534 
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,480 
Would you like to leave you? 

535 
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,500 
We seek another. 

536 
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:16,060 
Oh, my god! 

537 
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,200 
<i> This workshop is the only thing that remains 
of what we share ...</ i> 

538 
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,830 
<i> If you lose ... the lose to them. </ i> 

539 
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,175 
Thank you. 

540 
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,830 
Maybe next time. 

541 
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,600 
I hope that is in good condition. 

542 
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,800 
I do not want to spend money on it, 
before selling it. 

543 
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,380 
Perhaps you want to buy it. 

544 
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,975 
She wanted to make the bet. 
We are not against it. 

545 
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,100 
All they earn, 
ever lose. 

546 
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,760 
You need a car. 

547 
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:16,560 
Consigámos one. 

548 
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,900 
Not for this. 

549 
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,300 
It is a waste of time 
repairing this car. 

550 
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,682 
The lady said that the arreglaramos. 

551 
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,120 
If you start a job, terminal. 

552 
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:45,300 
It is going to lose workshop 
anyway. 

553 
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,140 
Well, you do not need to lose 
its integrity with him. 

554 
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:54,000 
How are they? 

555 
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,300 
I do not want angustiarte ... 

556 
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,400 
... but we have no credit, 
Answers to buy. 

557 
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,500 
Cash payments. 

558 
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,390 
And where will? 

559 
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,800 
Venda the Ford. 

560 
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,900 
You can not. 

561 
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,420 
I thought we had a week 
Ms. Devereaux. 

562 
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,560 
My name is Nicole, and save yourself 
the problems by now. 

563 
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:24,520 
I'm going to give a new priority. 

564 
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:26,580 
I want to see me make a 
auto racing. 

565 
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:31,617 
I have just one 
I can sell. 

566 
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,700 
Wait ... Do not you 
Ford talking about, no? 

567 
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,250 
It is a very good car! 

568 
00:44:36,251 --> 00:44:39,300 
If that is so, why 
you can not sell it. 

569 
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,150 
You have work to do, 
ve to do it! 

570 
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:44,250 
You can quedártelo, I am not 
interested in the car of anyone. 

571 
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,700 
I want to buy a new one. 
And you want me manufactures a car. 

572 
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,156 
I'm not toys, for 
shelves of trophies wives. 

573 
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:53,600 
I autos, for 
Serious runners. 

574 
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240 
Wait. 

575 
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:58,436 
Harás sausages to live, 
if you do not get money. 

576 
00:44:58,437 --> 00:44:59,740 
Right now! 

577 
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,420 
Make me the best car 
modified for racing ... 

578 
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:04,645 
... and forget about whatever the cost. 

579 
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:09,000 
I do not care how much cost. 
While the car melted asphalt. 

580 
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,120 
-- I think. 
-- Do this, because this is what I love. 

581 
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,600 
And you do not have another option. 

582 
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,785 
This will serve to begin, 
Call me when you finish. 

583 
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,510 
Were not you supposed to say, 
"Thank you, Mike, to save my rear? 

584 
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,700 
Go here! Not back. 

585 
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:33,835 
That was not the appreciation 
I expected. 

586 
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,490 
I can win races for you. 
I need more than ever. 

587 
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:41,127 
I do not want to see you in 
this workshop again! 

588 
00:45:41,128 --> 00:45:43,323 
Even bringing pizza. 

589 
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:50,262 
Okay. 

590 
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,600 
You were very harsh with him ... 

591 
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,200 
... everything you want 
do is run. 

592 
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,400 
I heard that is good. 

593 
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,227 
It is devastating, irresponsible, 
and dangerous. 

594 
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,008 
How all riders 
you know. 

595 
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,700 
Only those who have died. 

596 
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,360 
I finished with them. 

597 
00:46:28,361 --> 00:46:30,250 
We have a car to repair, 
and another to build ... 

598 
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:33,660 
... in only 3 days 
to save the workshop. 

599 
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,320 
So let us do it! 

600 
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,750 
And the Ford? 

601 
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:40,690 
We stay so, for now. 

602 
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:43,900 
Corrado for you. 

603 
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,600 
I'm so happy! 

604 
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:49,820 
We will make a lot of money together, 
and we also have fun. 

605 
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:51,500 
Wait, I am your driver. 

606 
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:52,300 
And will remain so. 

607 
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:55,830 
Bring the boys to school, 
and my wife shopping. 

608 
00:46:56,853 --> 00:46:58,682 
Dale Supra keys to Mike. 

609 
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,660 
No. Quédatelas. 

610 
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,250 
Do not take the car to anyone. 

611 
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,200 
If I'm going to drive for you 
Mr Gargolov ... 

612 
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,870 
... I need a car built 
according to my specifications. 

613 
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,000 
Well. 

614 
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,500 
Let's go to my workshop, 
and talk with my mechanics. 

615 
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,030 
Ever lead 
a aventi, Mike? 

616 
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:28,000 
Drove a Seat, and was afraid 
to fall asleep at the wheel. 

617 
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,300 
You are driving. 

618 
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,800 
Listens how the engine 
if a symphony. 

619 
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,282 
Each car sounds different. 

620 
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,820 
It's how ... 

621 
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,750 
Leopard Pearl, the BMW, 
the volcanic roar ... 

622 
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:49,270 
... the great Chevy Black ... 
differs from R.S.I. 

623 
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:53,000 
But the car that build parts 
customized, is more than unique. 

624 
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,300 
I remember this. 

625 
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,400 
You do not understand. 

626 
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:01,420 
What's with writing? 

627 
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,421 
What? 

628 
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:06,000 
Who says that it is not stolen, 
and someone will come for him? 

629 
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:09,500 
Not only am rich and beautiful, 
I have an education. 

630 
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,570 
A film is sufficient 
to learn that. 

631 
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,600 
What sounds so hard that? 

632 
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,000 
How the roar of a thunder. 

633 
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,800 
Let me show you to 
Where was your money. 

634 
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,900 
We eliminate the installation 
air conditioning ... 

635 
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:27,400 
... engines windows. Basically, 
everything that makes a car comfortable. 

636 
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:28,500 
That makes it slower. 

637 
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:31,000 
We take about 1000 pounds 
this baby. 

638 
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:35,124 
To curb, has 6 packages, 
in the front and rear wheels. 

639 
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:38,125 
These are custom rims. 
But not for skidding, of course. 

640 
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,537 
Of course. 

641 
00:49:39,538 --> 00:49:42,300 
We increased the monitoring system, 
The cooling system ... 

642 
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:44,640 
... and we did more beautiful. 
-- Great! 

643 
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,300 
We put new watches, 
and pedals. 

644 
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:50,740 
That red button panel, 
punish anything on the route. 

645 
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,200 
Sliding Doors. 
They are useless, but pretty. 

646 
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,600 
I thought you liked. 
If, like me. 

647 
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,550 
I want the car to stay here. 

648 
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,200 
We pay rent. 

649 
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:03,400 
It's your money. 

650 
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,530 
Speaking of desires, your account. 

651 
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,000 
Everything is installed here. 

652 
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,720 
Not spending enough 
to cover the debt. 

653 
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,400 
-- It is a fair price. 
-- We want to save the workshop. 

654 
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,900 
I can write a check now, 
that will solve all your problems. 

655 
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,600 
Only change a debt for another. 

656 
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,400 
I do not want to be indebted to you. 

657 
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:46,400 
That would be enough, 
Life would be easier. 

658 
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,570 
-- There are 5 minutes! 
-- What are you doing here? 

659 
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,880 
-- Costume who ordered pizza. 
-- Do not asked any pizza! 

660 
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:08,000 
I did. I'm hungry. 
And I'm ready for my lesson. 

661 
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,300 
What drive? 

662 
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,720 
My new car racing! 

663 
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,140 
Not bad. 

664 
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,400 
I work with this. 

665 
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600 
First rule of racing. 

666 
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,400 
Never look back, 
because behind you, never mind. 

667 
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,480 
Where do we go? 

668 
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,931 
Where we can accelerate. 

669 
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,185 
Well. 

670 
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,100 
Arranquémos this baby. 

671 
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:46,270 
Enjoy your lunch. 

672 
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:47,930 
It's all in the control 
of speed. 

673 
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,001 
Brakes and driving. 

674 
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,440 
What happens if I press this? 

675 
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:02,176 
Register. 

676 
00:53:12,747 --> 00:53:15,440 
The speed will put you ahead. 
But not win the race. 

677 
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,280 
Driving and psychology. 

678 
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,040 
Care for the drawings, Get inside, 
and pressed to move your opponent. 

679 
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,574 
O. .. bloquéalo, before you go. 

680 
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,700 
Now it's your turn. 

681 
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,900 
He made some 
investigations, sir. 

682 
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,371 
-- I did not know that. 
-- Now we know. 

683 
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:03,330 
This ... is the place where Stan 
moving your money laundering. 

684 
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,390 
How do you know that? 

685 
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:07,685 
Every day arrive 
with heavy bags ... 

686 
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,342 
... when to go, 20 minutes later, 
pockets are empty. 

687 
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,900 
That does not mean that the 
bags have money. 

688 
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,200 
Perhaps they are selling merchandise. 

689 
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,430 
Then ... Why is this 
rate monitor? 

690 
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,800 
It is the driver we are pursuing. 

691 
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,311 
What makes watching this place? 

692 
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:31,110 
Five trucks, which by chance 
I saw parked outside the coffee ... 

693 
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:32,310 
... the day of the robbery. 

694 
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:37,253 
Do we really write down the plates ... 

695 
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,580 
... of the cars we saw in 
the crime scene? 

696 
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,833 
I am a detective. That we do. 

697 
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:48,200 
I saw the same vehicle? 
where are the offices. 

698 
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:51,100 
I think it prepares Gargolov 
to take another blow. 

699 
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,200 
If so, we may be 
wait. 

700 
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:58,720 
Arrest everyone, 
remove this tumor once. 

701 
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,700 
That was thinking, sir. 

702 
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,400 
Let me see this. 

703 
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,200 
If you've got something, get a 
permission to organize everything. 

704 
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,342 
Much earlier. 

705 
00:55:09,462 --> 00:55:11,750 
I would like to be part of 
this team, sir. 

706 
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,650 
See what I can do. 

707 
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,345 
That's not all ... 

708 
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,124 
You visit. 

709 
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,000 
Excuse me, sir. 

710 
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,870 
What are you doing here? 

711 
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,830 
Does not appear, 
not answer your phone ... 

712 
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:38,050 
... so here I am. 

713 
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,125 
What do you want? 

714 
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,660 
Dart this. 

715 
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,323 
Do not blame for losing 
career, Eric. 

716 
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,000 
Then there must be another reason, 
so you can take to another. 

717 
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,400 
Give him the keys. 

718 
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,900 
Warner is not a broker, 
is a banker. 

719 
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:12,170 
I do not give you an extension 
Payment by a fuck. 

720 
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,160 
It seems that we will not give. 

721 
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:25,080 
-- Are you following Mike? 
-- It's my job. 

722 
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:30,185 
I think it's a fugitive. 
If so, what arrests. 

723 
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,550 
You can not! 

724 
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:34,177 
Why would not it? 

725 
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,690 
-- What love? 
-- Whether that what I lost. 

726 
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,290 
-- He spoke of careers. 
-- I know that I speak. 

727 
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,640 
I never said I loved you, Eric. 

728 
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:46,250 
Never said no. 

729 
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:49,261 
I can not get involved 
emotionally with brokers. 

730 
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:52,980 
-- But if another. 
-- Another who die on the expiry. 

731 
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:56,185 
Another, which is worse than me. 

732 
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,032 
I do not want to get you started, Eric. 

733 
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,900 
I want it back. 

734 
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:07,685 
How can bet your car? 
Is Selling your life? 

735 
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,000 
It's the way it always has been. 

736 
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000 
I do not believe that. 

737 
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,000 
Cree that what you want, 
but you need to run ... 

738 
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:23,720 
... and do not have a car. 

739 
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:26,800 
I have one for you. 

740 
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,000 
Evidence ... test again. 
Try again. 

741 
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,400 
Accelerate. 

742 
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,770 
Sharp inside. 

743 
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,180 
Turn right. 

744 
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,870 
That's right! That's right! 

745 
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,100 
Release the accelerator, lessens, 
aprienta and clutch. 

746 
00:59:08,485 --> 00:59:09,982 
Make the turn. 

747 
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:31,620 
What did I do? 

748 
00:59:31,621 --> 00:59:32,920 
Your first skidding. 

749 
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,340 
How do you feel? 

750 
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,400 
You tell me. 

751 
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:44,900 
Tighten the accelerator. Drop them. 
Use the clutch. 

752 
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,330 
-- I love my husband. 
-- I do not care. 

753 
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,450 
Well! 

754 
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,940 
Eric ... We are ready. 

755 
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:44,933 
We started surveillance 24 hours. 
Are you in? 

756 
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:46,600 
Absolutely, sir. 

757 
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,130 
Ready. 

758 
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:06,130 
All statistics 
are perfect. 

759 
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,251 
It's great. 

760 
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:10,620 
Think about how to fix the BMW 
by Mrs Deveraux. 

761 
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,320 
Does Brom? 

762 
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:14,677 
Do not spend with that, 
see this car in action. 

763 
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,900 
There we go, we have no driver.

764 
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,300 
What's Eric? 

765 
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,800 
If it were to come, would already be here. 

766 
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,050 
We can not miss, 
We have only one day. 

767 
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,900 
That's why I will 
selling the car tomorrow. 

768 
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,700 
Can I at least give a 
back to the block? 

769 
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,300 
Da 2 laps, not only as Ray. 

770 
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,800 
Which of these is yours? 
The above. 

771 
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,343 
I imagined that was that. 

772 
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,600 
I would like to see it. 

773 
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:22,244 
Can have, 
but you can not have that. 

774 
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:24,866 
I do not want to move you, 
just see how you live. 

775 
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:28,460 
We know! But that part 
My life belongs to Gustav. 

776 
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:32,040 
You have fear that I see. 

777 
01:02:32,317 --> 01:02:34,840 
-- We are in the car. 
-- He knows my needs. 

778 
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,100 
So why not worry? 

779 
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,900 
Doing so. On his way. 

780 
01:02:38,901 --> 01:02:42,256 
I do leave my life, 
and makes no questions. 

781 
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:43,257 
No? 

782 
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:45,850 
None of the expected 2 
the other is faithful. 

783 
01:02:45,851 --> 01:02:47,840 
As we continue loving. 

784 
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,700 
We are united, but we are free. 

785 
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,190 
What about the money 
Spending in this car? 

786 
01:02:55,191 --> 01:02:58,452 
He is not interested, I can spend 
what they give me in anything. 

787 
01:02:58,453 --> 01:03:00,423 
No question about my bills! 

788 
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:03,540 
What? You can give me 100 thousand U.S. dollars, 
and say that the loss. 

789 
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:08,900 
It was supposed to spend the money, 
on things that make me happy to me. 

790 
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:11,200 
Do not you would give me 100 big happy? 

791 
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,060 
In reality you want to buy? 

792 
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,050 
Would you feel happy 
being my property? 

793 
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:17,080 
-- It would not be so! 
-- How do you know? 

794 
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:19,740 
Because ... Gustav you bought, 
and yet you're happy! 

795 
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:30,040 
Sorry. It was stupid 
what I said. 

796 
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:32,850 
Mike, if you have a problem 
with this, dilo now. 

797 
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,760 
I do not. 
Honestly. 

798 
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,790 
Well. I need you to understand 
something about myself. 

799 
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,365 
My life is ... 
very safe. 

800 
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:47,100 
Very safe. 

801 
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:50,141 
All dangers disappeared, 
and I need that danger back ... 

802 
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:52,647 
... to feel my heart beating, 
how if it were to explode. 

803 
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,770 
To be part of something, 
apart from this marriage. 

804 
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,160 
And I think what I found. 

805 
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,400 
But they never leave, 
by anyone, not for nothing. 

806 
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,290 
I do not want to ask that. 

807 
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,170 
An intelligent man. 

808 
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,420 
Rainer took the Ford, 
and not yet returned. 

809 
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:47,500 
Is not that what you said 
Venda, is not it? 

810 
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:48,845 
If. 

811 
01:04:49,112 --> 01:04:50,112 
Damn! 

812 
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:51,600 
So is running with it! 

813 
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:54,277 
Hey, I can arrive quickly, but 
I only have room for one. 

814 
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,070 
I those achieved! 

815 
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,040 
Oh, God! 

816 
01:05:20,026 --> 01:05:22,490 
Rainer ... 
Oh my God! 

817 
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,554 
Levántenlo! 

818 
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:31,000 
Assortment to bring my car! 

819 
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:34,000 
Everything will be fine. 

820 
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,890 
Be careful with him. 

821 
01:05:41,991 --> 01:05:44,000 
Everything will be fine. 
I will go right behind you. 

822 
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:01,243 
Go. 

823 
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,950 
Will Listen? 
Verifying. 

824 
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,160 
<i> Station 1, Cloudy. </ i> 

825 
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,500 
<i> Station 3, Cloudy. </ i> 

826 
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,150 
Station 4, Cloudy. 

827 
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,770 
Do you know how lucky you have to stop 
come with me to a novice how you? 

828 
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:43,590 
-- I am very grateful. 
-- Learn a lot too. 

829 
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:48,770 
Starting with the introduction, at 2 
most important objects of surveillance. 

830 
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,200 
What is that? 

831 
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:52,800 
A urine bag. 
What goes in, must leave. 

832 
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,240 
It would be great to have a 
movies as well. 

833 
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:02,044 
Hello. 

834 
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,740 
What hospital? 

835 
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:09,540 
Now I go out there. 

836 
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,400 
I have to leave. 

837 
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,950 
In the midst of a vigilance? 

838 
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,900 
It's a family emergency. 
'll Be back at how you can. 

839 
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,341 
I'm here. 
How are you? 

840 
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:35,370 
The magic, and that is what 
mattered. 

841 
01:07:35,371 --> 01:07:36,371 
Watch ... 

842 
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,800 
The doctor said I had to 
tell the police. 

843 
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:41,610 
Which means, that will ask questions, 
we do not want to answer. 

844 
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,080 
I say that I am a doctor police. 
What do you think that? 

845 
01:07:46,287 --> 01:07:47,287 
Thank you. 

846 
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,200 
What else can I do? 

847 
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,830 
It's my fault, if it had appeared .... 

848 
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:54,150 
You and Katie were made 
for each other. 

849 
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:56,724 
I do not want you to take the 
responsibility for everything. 

850 
01:07:56,725 --> 01:08:01,500 
Believe it or not, people do 
stupid things for themselves. 

851 
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,520 
I recall that. 

852 
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:05,840 
I hope so. 

853 
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:08,800 
Why you're tempted, 
to do something stupid now. 

854 
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,160 
-- What makes him here? 
-- Mike who was brought to Rainer. 

855 
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,000 
Would you're couching it as well? 

856 
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:40,026 
What do you think they do? 
Will begin a fight here? 

857 
01:08:40,027 --> 01:08:43,100 
It's just what I need now! 
Grow! 

858 
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,410 
Where are the parents of the boy? 

859 
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,091 
His mother is in Canada. Soy 
her cousin, and I am responsible for it. 

860 
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:55,100 
You can see it, but only for a minute. 

861 
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,500 
We are about to take him to surgery. 

862 
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,447 
What were you thinking? 

863 
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:27,520 
Never drove a car so powerful. 

864 
01:09:30,257 --> 01:09:33,300 
I thought it would be easy ... 

865 
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,436 
I was so wrong! 

866 
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,860 
We do not have to do it. 

867 
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,020 
Someone has to do, 
or it will lose everything. 

868 
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,540 
It's just a workshop. 

869 
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:00,780 
It is so difficult! 

870 
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,100 
We are ready to carry them. 

871 
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,830 
Please stay with me. 

872 
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,570 
I can not. 

873 
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,700 
Only for a while. 

874 
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,800 
I have to go. 

875 
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,400 
I do not go anywhere. 

876 
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,590 
What will. 

877 
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:09,810 
You have wasted half 
your life with me. 

878 
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:43,490 
I want to see what he has. 

879 
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,050 
Leave go, please. 

880 
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,960 
He took a Hand 
a boy tonight. 

881 
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,150 
So tonight boy 
became a man. 

882 
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,600 
A crippled man! 

883 
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,801 
All men have scars. 

884 
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,515 
And your friend learned by himself ... 

885 
01:12:27,516 --> 01:12:30,800 
... who never let an opponent, 
able to buscarte. 

886 
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,850 
In Kiev, there are many men with 
a hand through me. 

887 
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,411 
It is good advice, Mr Gargolov. 

888 
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:41,800 
Why not give me the axe?, And you 
I teach the same lesson this imbecile. 

889 
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,140 
It would, but ... 
is the nephew of my wife. 

890 
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,335 
What luck that you are! 

891 
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,444 
The fate of is him. 

892 
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,445 
I like you. Mike. 

893 
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,300 
Well, I'm not really 
a fan to you now! 

894 
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,712 
Perhaps this will change your way of thinking. 

895 
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,760 
Your car is finished, 
and ready to run. 

896 
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:33,820 
I do not think so. 

897 
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,100 
Do not like the car? 

898 
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:38,000 
I do not like people who 
works for you. 

899 
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,533 
Because you remember who you are. 

900 
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,060 
Has someone how I looked, 
since your mother died. 

901 
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:45,820 
Since you left. 

902 
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,600 
It is the only way to live, 
when you get what you want. 

903 
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,285 
Yes, but I need to change. 

904 
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,300 
You have expensive tastes ... 
in cars, women. 

905 
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,800 
How long do you think that your girlfriend 
rich soon get bored of you? 

906 
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,900 
There are still a lot of women, 
who like things cheap and dirty. 

907 
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,200 
Thank God for that! 

908 
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:10,950 
Then ... 

909 
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:15,240 
Just back to distribute ... 
pizza? 

910 
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:17,650 
In this cute scooter you have? 

911 
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,400 
That's the plan. 

912 
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:22,590 
Who want to deceive, Mike? 
You will not rich in that way. 

913 
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,130 
Do not go to prison either. 

914 
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,350 
This is a breakthrough. 

915 
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,450 
Buy some clothes, and 
get a phone number. 

916 
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:32,900 
Corrado for me. 

917 
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:36,412 
And as payment for the privilege, 
you get some work exhaust. 

918 
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,000 
If you get my pocket money ... 

919 
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,700 
I feel deeply ... 
insulted. 

920 
01:14:51,243 --> 01:14:53,080 
It's the last thing I would do. 

921 
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,475 
So it should be. 

922 
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:02,860 
Tomorrow, you will lead to Markus 
pick up some documents for me. 

923 
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,800 
Need to bring it back fast. 

924 
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,800 
I am confident that you will either. 

925 
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:20,740 
Need to make Mead morning? 

926 
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,460 
No. Thank you. 

927 
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:25,000 
Well, this thing is nearly full. 

928 
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,610 
I'm going to empty it. 

929 
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,280 
Stay vigilant while going. 

930 
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:30,581 
I'll do. 

931 
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,000 
Prepare all, we visit. 

932 
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,600 
Keep the engine running. 

933 
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,400 
This does not take much time. 

934 
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,117 
All units, 
maintain their position. 

935 
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,117 
Nobody moves until 
return to take the car. 

936 
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,050 
Shit! 

937 
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,800 
Shit! Shit! 

938 
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,280 
Shit! The whore shit! 

939 
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:44,834 
Nobody moves, until they leave. 

940 
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,700 
Arms lists. 

941 
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,080 
We are exposed! 

942 
01:17:38,732 --> 01:17:40,353 
All units come into action! 

943 
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,500 
See you, friend! 

944 
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:27,730 
Rainer surgery went very well, 
is now recovering. 

945 
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:30,284 
Does that mean that you can 
use your hand? 

946 
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,390 
It will take months ... 

947 
01:19:33,391 --> 01:19:37,140 
... before we know how much 
sensitivity and mobility won, but ... 

948 
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:40,887 
... do not have that, 
anything can happen. 

949 
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,000 
I appreciate what he did, doctor. 
Thank you. 

950 
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,700 
Go home and rest a bit. 

951 
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,425 
Let the Ford, 
and llevemóslo the workshop. How well? 

952 
01:19:54,865 --> 01:19:57,365 
I stay here, and I hope 
Eric to return. 

953 
01:19:57,366 --> 01:19:58,900 
And then return to the workshop. 

954 
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:01,752 
We need to pack, 
before the bank comes tomorrow. 

955 
01:20:05,454 --> 01:20:07,000 
See you later. 

956 
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:46,343 
You are arrested. 

957 
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,140 
I do not think so. 

958 
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:51,390 
I saw you took part 
in the theft today. 

959 
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:54,000 
And I am sure, that is not the only 
crime he has committed. 

960 
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,680 
Probably not. 

961 
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,270 
But how explanations 
I recognize? 

962 
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:00,310 
I was reading your 
American record. 

963 
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:02,860 
And why Mir that? 

964 
01:21:02,861 --> 01:21:05,265 
I will say that you saw between the 
Gargolov people. 

965 
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,100 
And what of you were to Gargolov, 
because follow Wolf. 

966 
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,800 
Who know, for careers 
those involved in illegal. 

967 
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,040 
Try it. 

968 
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,280 
I do not have to do, 
I am not a policeman. 

969 
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,970 
The only thing I do 
is tell your boss. 

970 
01:21:19,971 --> 01:21:21,171 
And the damage will be done. 

971 
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,400 
Are you threatening me? 

972 
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:27,200 
You are who aims a weapon 
a man disarmed! 

973 
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:30,500 
Takes you inside. 

974 
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:35,100 
That can wait for 
after the race. 

975 
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,200 
What career? 

976 
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,700 
The you are going to win today, 
and Katie does not lose the workshop. 

977 
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,300 
Why did you do? 

978 
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:56,200 
Because you've seen run. 

979 
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,400 
I can not win this race. 

980 
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,600 
You can. 

981 
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,140 
I still will be here tomorrow ... 

982 
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:08,001 
Katie ... but will no longer be the workshop. 

983 
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,800 
This does not change anything between us. 

984 
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:19,001 
In this case you're right. 

985 
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:32,675 
Sweet! 

986 
01:22:33,484 --> 01:22:35,310 
You do not need something sweeter. 

987 
01:22:39,024 --> 01:22:41,000 
Made with customized parts .... 

988 
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:42,920 
... haganme an offer. 

989 
01:22:43,564 --> 01:22:45,000 
This is for today. 

990 
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,520 
Anything! 

991 
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,100 
I hope you brought the axe. 

992 
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:08,700 
If, and cut your balls 
after he wins the race. 

993 
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,100 
You need new balls, 
because they lost yours. 

994 
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:18,125 
Leave it to the race! 

995 
01:23:20,357 --> 01:23:22,540 
Can we be ready in 5 minutes? 

996 
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,835 
Let me give a return 
to block first. 

997 
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,125 
Well. 

998 
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,700 
Try not to scratch the paintings. 

999 
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,600 
-- This is how you run? 
-- This is how I win. 

1000 
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,420 
Yes! 

1001 
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:31,000 
-- Do you want me to lead? 
-- I have everything under control! 

1002 
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,275 
That what I see! 

1003 
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,011 
So how is leading in Tennessee? 

1004 
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:46,900 
It hit me too. 

1005 
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,600 
Te strange, dear. 

1006 
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,443 
I, too, dear. 

1007 
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,220 
Are You were good? 
While Will was away? 

1008 
01:27:51,221 --> 01:27:52,221 
Hell, no! 

1009 
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,500 
This is free today. 

1010 
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,500 
A pizza? 

1011 
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,700 
Have morrones extra. 

1012 
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:43,122 
Those are too many morrones! 

1013 
01:28:46,056 --> 01:28:47,900 
What do you expect in return? 

1014 
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,370 
Keep the workshop open, 
sends to the bank to hell ... 

1015 
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:53,600 
... and build more cars race. 

1016 
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,100 
Is that all? 

1017 
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:01,000 
Perhaps let me drive one, 
ever. 

1018 
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,565 
We'll see. 

1019 
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:57,130 
We were you, and to my left 
men back, Mike. 

1020 
01:29:58,408 --> 01:30:00,000 
That was not very fair. 

1021 
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,750 
My only loyalty is to myself. 

1022 
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,050 
Some call it cowardice. 

1023 
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:07,650 
I call it survival. 

1024 
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,600 
Like my car wreck. 

1025 
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,140 
Wolf and I ran. 

1026 
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,320 
He lost more than his hand. 

1027 
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:38,530 
Are not you going to shoot me why? 

1028 
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:42,000 
What I am thinking. 

1029 
01:30:43,482 --> 01:30:45,000 
The misfortunes occur. 

1030 
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:48,900 
That's good. Moreover, 
Stake for you in the race. 

1031 
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:52,195 
I won enough to buy 
Wolf to a nice coffin ... 

1032 
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:53,722 
... and is a lot of money. 

1033 
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:00,510 
I am pleased, Mr Gargolov, 
because this concludes our treatment. 

1034 
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,940 
We no longer work for you. 

1035 
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,800 
You are an excellent driver. 

1036 
01:31:06,801 --> 01:31:08,880 
Thank you, I can 
no driver. 

1037 
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:10,870 
Do you think you let go? 

1038 
01:31:13,165 --> 01:31:14,870 
We finished in any forms. 

1039 
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:33,215 
What all places 
could have ido, Mike ... 

1040 
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,400 
... because they came to Germany? 

1041 
01:31:37,145 --> 01:31:38,800 
I like beer and sausages. 

1042 
01:31:41,122 --> 01:31:43,000 
See you soon, Mike. 

1043 
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,760 
<i> Someday, you and I'll go to 
a ride in this car again ....</ i> 

1044 
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:13,974 
<i> ... nothing in front of ours, 
other than the route. </ i> 

1045 
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,450 
<i> I can not wait, daddy. </ i> 

1046 
01:32:15,451 --> 01:32:21,124 
<i> do not have to do, everything that 
have to do is close our eyes. </ i> 

1047 
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,420 
Are you going in my direction? 

1048 
01:32:38,635 --> 01:32:40,000 
Probably. 

1049 
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,000 
Sube, and we'll see. 

1050 
01:32:51,001 --> 01:32:52,700 
Thank you for what you did yesterday. 

1051 
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:55,810 
Not to talk about. 

1052 
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,900 
Do not deny, I know what you were 
you who saved my workshop. 

1053 
01:33:00,077 --> 01:33:02,000 
The way that driving is unique. 

1054 
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:04,000 
-- Except as you ... 
-- Cogan. 

1055 
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:06,720 
I was going to say "making love". 

1056 
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,720 
There is a difference. Do you know? 

1057 
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,433 
Really? 

1058 
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,030 
How can I bring? 

1059 
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:22,840 
-- No! 
-- Sure, rises! 

1060 
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,340 
If pizza strips in this car, 
kill you. 

1061 
01:33:34,888 --> 01:33:36,321 
Is there any room for another? 

1062 
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,450 
Not to pick up your kind, but ... 

1063 
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,060 
... in this case, I will make an exception. 

1064 
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:57,100 
Do not go too fast, 
or you put a fine. 

1065 
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,000 
Pressure is what 
makes life fun. 

1066 
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,553 
You should try it sometime. 

1067 
01:34:04,065 --> 01:34:05,160 
Where do we go? 

1068 
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,900 
I do not know. But I am glad 
you come. 

1069 
01:34:08,901 --> 01:34:10,700 
I, too, pizza man. 

1070 
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,200 
Are you sure where to go? 

1071 
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:18,320 
What I am.
