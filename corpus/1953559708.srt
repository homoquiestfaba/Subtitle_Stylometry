1
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:24,712
They came from all over the hill.
- There were millions.

2
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:28,510
We ran for our lives.
- I am not going back.

3
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,179
They will attack us.

4
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,807
Now a call via satellite
with Dr. Dubois of Stanford.

5
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,021
It is an ant expert.
What is wrong?

6
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,946
These ants are
somehow disturbed.

7
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,696
Mining or excavations.

8
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:53,748
If their territory is attacked,
they can be aggressive.

9
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:57,826
They communicate with chemical
signals, pheromones ...

10
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:00,289
from their antennae.

11
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:06,843
They look bad, but every smell
intruder in the colony immediately.

12
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:12,597
So these are smart guys?
- Yes, their chemical language is special.

13
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:15,849
If they go find food ...

14
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:21,487
coordinates that language behavior
of one million individuals.

15
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:26,192
Their brain has the ability
of a small computer.

16
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:32,200
How much would we learn as we
they communicate without technology?

17
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,378
We understand a few
suicide terrorists will not work.

18
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:38,711
What they know that?

19
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,505
These are thousands of ants
who drown ...

20
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:45,507
to the base of a bridge to be built.

21
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,881
Let your hair by chat?

22
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:51,682
This is the man that the situation
is addressing.

23
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:53,722
Thank you, Jo.

24
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:57,059
That was very interesting, Dr. Dubois.

25
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:01,820
But it is a fairy tale
that a swarm of ants fighting ...

26
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:04,949
behaves as a kind of parade.

27
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,280
It's just a great ball instincts.

28
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:12,826
Dr. Horace Lennart,
Director of Thoracic, former ...

29
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,373
Now the biggest killer
insects in the world.

30
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:20,591
You tell people stories.

31
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:26,139
If we communicate with them
without technology, they eat us.

32
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:31,769
If you do not believe me,
come look in Ban Tao.

33
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:36,025
With a spray?
- That you should always have with you.

34
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,522
Thank you, Dr. Lennart. We're out of air.

35
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,452
Have you had fun?
- Dr. Claire Dubois.

36
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,369
How long are you there?
- One day. Tomorrow we start.

37
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,456
How does it look?
- Rainforest, rubber trees ...

38
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,215
and what victims.

39
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:07,724
I can 'world's best entomologist
Always use.

40
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:13,059
I not only in your team.
- It is a family. They love you.

41
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,191
Almost as bad as I now al

42
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,735
Maybe we can once
eating out.

43
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,204
Talk to you soon.

44
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,931
Come on, what ndo we go skeletons
let melt.

45
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,112
Come on, folks.

46
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:06,489
Give the signal ...
- And let loose the dogs of war.

47
00:07:56,424 --> 00:08:01,715
Forward, march.
Back to the front line, fast.

48
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,420
Back to the front line, now.

49
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,597
Okay, guys.

50
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:10,723
We should fix this.
Our whole industry is flat.

51
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:14,062
We can not allow tourists.

52
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,565
There are more
than we had estimated.

53
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,282
More than in 2001?
- More than in 2001.

54
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:27,449
That swarm our economy
for two years ruined.

55
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,965
The ants are different, they say.
- How? Aggressive?

56
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,635
Yes, more aggressive.
- They almost never kill many people.

57
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:45,436
There are now more deaths than
in all previous incidents together.

58
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,515
Yes, more aggressive.

59
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,776
But they also struggle with policy.

60
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,609
I will show you.

61
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,818
Usually they remain the approaching flames rill
until we fire.

62
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:07,874
But today they are continued, as if
they knew that the fire was coming.

63
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,458
You understand what I mean?

64
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:19,053
Our defense was good.

65
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,304
That plantation is plucked bald?
- Everything is gone.

66
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:30,775
We must reduce them
to that barren piece of land.

67
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:35,231
Cortez, you go through the center
with the army.

68
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:39,694
Bill and I take the right side.
We exclude them.

69
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:45,908
You've hired the right people.
We are sure, now.

70
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,154
I hate this deal.

71
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:23,077
Debs, you receive me?
- Good picture. Now your perspective.

72
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:29,960
Picture good perspective.
Cortez, your GPS does not work.

73
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,541
It helps if I start him. Sorry.

74
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:38,220
All systems loaded.
- We go against it.

75
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:46,264
If you and Cortez erection, weaken
we are the center from the air.

76
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,527
Each ant poison kills another.
- Domino effect.

77
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:53,820
All ready? Are there any questions?

78
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:03,104
Team Cortez, the first contact.
Lethal effect is true.

79
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,721
We withdraw to the north.

80
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,747
Cortez, Central here. Spraying it.

81
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:34,670
How does it look like, Debs?
- Good pictures, recording runs.

82
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:39,222
Again.
- Cortez still has his hands full.

83
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:43,480
I would be with him.
- Keep up the plan.

84
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:48,145
We can plan ahead.
One of our advantages.

85
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:59,863
How is your connection to the base?
The mine is worthless.

86
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:04,127
Is there an antenna in the area, or something?

87
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:08,915
A new celtoren,
but that works yet.

88
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,841
Len, did you hear that?
He works yet.

89
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:21,052
What is that?

90
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:26,567
There is something strange in your neighborhood.
The telemetry from falls.

91
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:32,363
Len, have you heard something here?

92
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,825
You can find this strange?
- Why?

93
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:48,788
I do not know.
I find it all a bit ...

94
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,834
too quiet.

95
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,341
I get the kriebels.

96
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,679
Len, come again.

97
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,608
What is this?

98
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:10,573
What is that?

99
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,987
All ants.
- Destruction?

100
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:18,156
Do not move. Debs, you get this?

101
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:22,495
The connection was cut.

102
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:26,079
Look.
- Look where it goes.

103
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,967
I'm sure in.

104
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,008
This is strange, say.

105
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:49,566
This is unbelievable, Lennie.

106
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:53,612
The cables cross each other,
but remain separate.

107
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,331
They carry no food.

108
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:00,956
It seems like a communication.

109
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:08,632
Just whether they build nests.

110
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,840
They do not like them swarming.
- I know.

111
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,893
Watch out.

112
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,517
O God, there are millions.

113
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:24,808
Lennie, help me.

114
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,395
Get that branch off me.

115
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,159
Stay calm, Bill.

116
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:48,089
Lennie, make it open.
Make it stop.

117
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,294
There is one inside.

118
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:31,962
They have not arrived.

119
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,726
They have not arrived.

120
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,281
Cortez, come here.

121
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,575
There is something about Bill.
- What then?

122
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:00,670
Nothing.

123
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,214
It is fine.

124
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,588
Help me to withdraw his suit.

125
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:34,405
What happens?
- Classical withdrawal patterns.

126
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:39,206
You can stop. Good work.

127
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:44,038
Is it okay?
- I do not know.

128
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:49,677
Have you seen
how that branch came down?

129
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,593
No, when everything was already out.

130
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,141
So you have not seen?
- What?

131
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,147
Nothing.

132
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:03,186
Make a statement for documentation.
I see you later.

133
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,531
What is that?

134
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:52,403
Nothing.

135
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:54,786
You should see this as.

136
00:20:58,503 --> 00:21:02,287
Devastated fields,
which I have previously seen.

137
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:05,959
Yes, but now I lay there
a filter over it.

138
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,922
Is this real?

139
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,968
These.

140
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,511
And this one.

141
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,348
This is just a mud flat
to the river.

142
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:24,185
You have to copies of them.
Discreet.

143
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:30,904
What do you think it means?
- No idea, but we need to know.

144
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,924
Attention, please.

145
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:51,213
Minister Zhing would like to address.

146
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:57,013
I am grateful to my speaking ...

147
00:21:57,148 --> 00:22:02,024
to Dr. Horace Lennart
and the team of Thorax.

148
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,903
For their help in fighting
of the scourge.

149
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,619
The cooperation between
our brave armed forces ...

150
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,618
and the American science ...

151
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:21,500
Our vast archipelago
made safer and more productive.

152
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:27,339
One day we will this threat
perhaps completely eradicate.

153
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:34,140
And perhaps explains Dr. Lennart
one day what his secret formula.

154
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,111
I lift the glass to Dr. Lennart
and his team.

155
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,938
What is this for a rottent?

156
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:25,522
How is it, buddy?

157
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:32,161
This chic to be heard. There are everywhere
ants. They fall into my glass.

158
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:40,004
I see no ants, Bill.
- But I see them.

159
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,466
I feel they also have my entire body.

160
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:52,804
That is just a belated sensory
reaction. Perfectly normal.

161
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:58,939
It is not normal,
what we today took place.

162
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:03,566
How she left us on that tree fall,
that was planned.

163
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:10,243
How is it? You have the
not so well done today.

164
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:12,579
No, sir. Look.

165
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:18,290
There is still one left.
You have a overlooked.

166
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:46,074
What a horrible sight.

167
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:50,580
Billy is totally in the war.
- Len dragged him through.

168
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:54,836
Yes, if anyone can.
But I am worried.

169
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,085
What?
- Billy.

170
00:24:57,214 --> 00:25:01,508
Or actually Dr. William Routledge, B. Sc,
etcetera.

171
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:05,634
He was professor Lens
at the university.

172
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,386
When he was heavy on the drink.

173
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:13,975
Len helped him off, gave him
this job, paid his gokschulden.

174
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:16,563
But that was five years ago.

175
00:25:16,693 --> 00:25:20,477
If he has back problems,
Len they lost it.

176
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:23,983
Yes. They do everything together.

177
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:32,704
they are back.

178
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:41,709
Stop the music, please.

179
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:44,336
Attention, everybody.

180
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:50,428
All leaves have been withdrawn. All
log into their military unit.

181
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:53,564
Thoracic team, discussion with me.

182
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,974
What is it?

183
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:58,476
A new swarm.
- It can not.

184
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,448
Never twice a year.
- I am now.

185
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:05,323
And they have already reached the river.

186
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:13,242
This is not true. Three times as large
as the first swarm.

187
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,869
Can not.
- So many are not.

188
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,295
Can I use your phone?

189
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:25,847
We will all have to work again.

190
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:31,220
Claire, with Len. The SMS I
've driven, explains everything.

191
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:36,267
Come to the airport at Ban Tao.
Then I tell you more.

192
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,032
What are the times changed, Doctor.

193
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:08,583
We draw no more Europe.
- No, unfortunately.

194
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,586
That is sweet.

195
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,997
We were sweet.

196
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:24,380
I saw the piece in Forbes.
Multi-millionaire for 35rd.

197
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:27,933
Congratulations.
- It is so bad.

198
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:32,392
Earnings am I in the company.
I live in a caravan.

199
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:36,773
I'm still socially
in the backpack stage.

200
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:41,484
A backpack full of millions.
Frightening picture.

201
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:45,615
And you, professor?
- Associate Professor.

202
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:50,291
After all your scholarly articles,
and your book?

203
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,120
That was great, though.
- Do you know it?

204
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:57,591
Absolutely. And yet
no permanent appointment.

205
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:05,181
Speculating on mass-intelligence
insect is quite daring.

206
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:28,709
Now we have something in common.
- Oh yeah? What then?

207
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:32,454
We are both academic pariahs.

208
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:36,634
I kill insects,
you think they are intelligent.

209
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,212
This is an exaggerated description.

210
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:53,649
Suppose that a guy you showed evidence
that your hypothesis is true.

211
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:58,773
You mean that text and picture?
- What can a guy expect?

212
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:04,200
A kiss? A thick, wet kiss?
- What are you talking about?

213
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:11,793
Made
after the swarm at Ban Tao.

214
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:16,677
These are molecular structures.

215
00:30:19,013 --> 00:30:21,587
His made by ants?

216
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:25,467
Since it seems to, yes.

217
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:30,183
There is need for intelligence.
- That claim you anyway?

218
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:34,362
Not that she chemistry
and understand physics.

219
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:37,774
I have seen other things.
- Like what?

220
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:39,901
Look at this.

221
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:46,910
It is a tentacle, so to speak.
Full consisting of ants.

222
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:51,912
He raised themselves from the swarm
as a cobra.

223
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:58,763
What bulging with top Ecitons
eyes and feelers to the rear.

224
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:02,757
I swear to you, they view me.
Studied me.

225
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,267
She had a tree crash
on my colleagues and me.

226
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,353
They had us in this way can culling.

227
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,490
But when she had our view ...

228
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:24,740
let us go.

229
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,832
What a story.

230
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:30,256
What do you think?

231
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:36,626
That a simple insect colony
self has become.

232
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,800
You know what this is?

233
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:53,480
How do you get this?
- Is it true?

234
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,690
How do you get it?

235
00:31:56,784 --> 00:32:00,568
A student of mine saw something
in local ants.

236
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:03,825
We tested specimens
from around the world.

237
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,826
Africa, the Amazon,
wherever they swarm forms.

238
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:12,541
Seventy percent had these metabolites
in their system.

239
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:16,511
So I traced the origin.

240
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:20,054
How long you spray that stuff yet?
- Eight years.

241
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:23,849
It is now in the global ecosystem.

242
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:31,228
I'm not crazy scientist
which destroys insects for fun.

243
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:35,775
My team and I are requested.
We save lives.

244
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,281
People are very grateful.

245
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,483
This must stop them provisionally.

246
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:35,363
Sanchez, keep this in mind
with Jacobson.

247
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,735
Cortez, you have the lead.

248
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:43,707
Where were you? This is hardly under
control. Did you amused?

249
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:47,881
Hold on, Bill. We have now
bigger problems.

250
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:53,961
I've never seen this kind of behavior.

251
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:59,974
So many ants are not in the world.

252
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,528
We should remember
what we do.

253
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,455
Glad you're here.

254
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:32,795
We have never seen.
There are 200 million.

255
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:35,847
Impossible.
- There are more solid.

256
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:39,557
That can. We have
since twenty man lost.

257
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:42,522
If they pass, what then?

258
00:35:42,648 --> 00:35:47,061
What do you think?
This they did not at Stanford.

259
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:52,355
What is wrong with you anyway?
Just shut up and listen.

260
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:30,397
These are samples from the forefront.

261
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,071
These are different species.

262
00:36:34,203 --> 00:36:38,532
In the beginning they were a swarm.
They worked together.

263
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:42,533
That may not.
A swarm consists of a kind.

264
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,750
The same nest. Outsiders
they will not tolerate.

265
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:52,388
They discern another pheromone,
and killing them. As these guys.

266
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,391
Exactly.

267
00:36:54,474 --> 00:37:01,521
Once they were in the pot, no more
in the swarm, they were again hostile.

268
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:04,685
But when she sat in the swarm ...

269
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:10,156
A swarm pheromone. A pheromone,
and they work together.

270
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:12,821
A common goal.

271
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:17,123
What is that?
- I let it show.

272
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:25,546
Listen, guys.
- This is the village Bounang.

273
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:29,292
There are fifty people,
we saw.

274
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:32,844
The ants have them
not reached. Not yet.

275
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:35,844
We must save those people immediately.

276
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:38,384
Can we get boats?
- Yes.

277
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:42,850
We must ensure that the ants
remain behind the shore.

278
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:47,196
Defensive positions
in the gorges.

279
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:51,569
May I take this?
I want to study them.

280
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,244
Past it a bit?
- It went well.

281
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:06,958
It is made for one man
so much longer.

282
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,838
Where is well ... Oh, there it is.

283
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,800
You okay?

284
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,687
The tank is full.

285
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:21,104
We do this for the team, huh?
- Of course.

286
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,644
Why do you ask whether it is?

287
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:31,779
Test the arms agree.
- I just do not spray.

288
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:36,737
Seems to me you just do not fit.
- Do I not fit?

289
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,078
I have taught you this.

290
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,382
We do this.

291
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:48,343
You can let it swing.

292
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,878
But that's not long.

293
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:54,219
Watch your own business, big guy.

294
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:17,412
The eyes are on. The recorders running.

295
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:57,786
These are lifeboats. We bring you
in safety. Get in the car.

296
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:01,413
Get in the boats.

297
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:19,983
Boarding.

298
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:25,884
Back to the river, as fast as you can.

299
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,497
Test the weapon.
- I just do not spray.

300
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:05,339
Test the weapon. Test the weapon.

301
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,419
Run.

302
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:46,514
We have to go back.

303
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:42,569
Bill, how is the situation?

304
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:46,862
I'm an old plantation.
I see an opening.

305
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,871
I look up.

306
00:43:56,379 --> 00:43:59,381
You've used your weapon, I see.

307
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:02,462
Yes, to save her.

308
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:06,544
I had no choice.
I do not do it again.

309
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:11,015
In the old factory
we can embed them.

310
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:15,439
Len said you had to stay there.
You do not hard.

311
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:19,066
Call him.
Later that road opening.

312
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:23,859
The communication does not work.
Cortez I send to you.

313
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:28,453
Stay there.
- Do what you want, I go out on.

314
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,747
What did you say? Bill, stay there.

315
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:36,373
Her name is Ying. She is an orphan.

316
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:41,084
She lived with her brother,
but that has disappeared in the woods.

317
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:43,096
I'm afraid, Len.

318
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:46,003
Cortez, come in please.

319
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,146
Cortez, sliding in to Bill's position.

320
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,821
You see something you've always admired.

321
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:11,073
And suddenly, in a clear moment,
you see the dangerous side.

322
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,256
The deadly side.

323
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:23,217
Then you grab the gun, not the chair.

324
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,935
That happened to me ten years ago.

325
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:34,604
Cortez, if you can hear me
in this rotding ...

326
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:39,277
I am at twenty meters
of the plant. Come hither.

327
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:49,073
Good to see you.

328
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:28,116
Do not move, Billy.

329
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:33,459
Not look to the top.

330
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:37,065
There are ants to you.
Get out.

331
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:39,076
I have no belongings.

332
00:49:48,794 --> 00:49:51,630
Debs, you have there. Now.

333
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:08,538
C.H.C.H. Bill, Debs, Cortez, anyone.

334
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,927
Hold on.

335
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:19,427
Here I was talking about.

336
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:23,468
What Bill and I have seen.

337
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,171
What do they do?
- It is an invitation.

338
00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:15,507
My god, you know what this is?

339
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,966
A nest.
- No.

340
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:26,601
Yeah, right, but look at that structure out.

341
00:53:26,734 --> 00:53:31,443
See each ant as a switch,
who can say yes or no.

342
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,815
As a binary code?

343
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:40,613
They use electrical signals,
not only chemical.

344
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:44,877
You mean this is a computer?
This is madness.

345
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:12,525
Maybe we should not go.

346
00:54:12,657 --> 00:54:15,658
I believe we have little choice.

347
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:20,791
This way.

348
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:33,357
I believe we are.

349
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:43,462
What do they do?

350
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:48,465
These images we have seen.

351
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:52,008
Is this a language? They ...

352
00:55:53,055 --> 00:55:54,932
and us.

353
00:55:56,392 --> 00:55:58,432
The front line.

354
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:02,890
DNA. That they tried to formulate.

355
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:07,651
They kill us. They kill each other.

356
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:13,194
Will Ban Tao.
- What did you say, Ying?

357
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:16,945
Will Ban Tao.
- Yes, that's Ban Tao.

358
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,955
Boggling.

359
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:33,255
She is right. They want this island.

360
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,540
We leave her behind.
- Reverse.

361
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:04,747
She is the hostage.

362
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:09,591
It is in order. We must
to convey the message.

363
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,555
We come back, Ying.

364
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,847
We come back.

365
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:27,395
What do we do now?

366
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:31,071
I do not know what that was,
Ying but should return.

367
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,692
How have they learned?

368
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,955
They have become confident.
- As soon?

369
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:43,996
Thus, the evolution not.
- Sporadic jumps ...

370
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:48,544
There is something new to the hand.
Cruelty. Deceit.

371
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:51,714
This is not just created.

372
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:55,513
And a foreign substance
in their nervous system?

373
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:59,344
If it is, we know
whose fault it is.

374
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:59,491
Are they for us?
- I do not think so.

375
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:11,009
When I saw ants two routes to choose
I found them intelligent.

376
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:17,013
Never thought I would see ant-TV.
- There is also new for me.

377
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:26,227
Would it be true that they
this island find their refuge?

378
00:59:26,365 --> 00:59:29,568
We take everything on, they mean.

379
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:33,534
Thus, Zhing to see it.
- He may not know.

380
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:40,284
I am still under contract.
- He blows the whole thing up.

381
00:59:40,421 --> 00:59:44,466
I have no choice.
We need to tell.

382
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:48,337
They listen to us.

383
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:53,092
Us?
- Yes, us.

384
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:56,311
We will be doing this together.

385
00:59:57,439 --> 01:00:01,936
Perhaps with Chang,
Ying for retrieval.

386
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:05,403
You okay? The catch?

387
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:11,449
I'm sorry.
- Indicates not.

388
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:33,053
Does this something you think?

389
01:00:37,523 --> 01:00:40,015
It seems little to Venice.

390
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,539
Good to see you, Dr. Dubois.
- Good to see you, Dr. Lennart.

391
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,552
Is everything okay?

392
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:55,522
Here I am. Everything okay?

393
01:01:55,648 --> 01:01:58,982
Everything okay?
- Yes, all right.

394
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:02,027
Stay there, I come out.

395
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,984
Everything is fine.

396
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:17,355
It is Cortez.

397
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,847
You got it.

398
01:03:51,229 --> 01:03:53,471
Good to see you.

399
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:58,185
We thought you were dead.
- That was nearly so.

400
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,941
What happened?

401
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:08,621
This is another intelligent species.

402
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:11,701
No people, but Insectoid.

403
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:17,540
They are not tools,
they use specific sub-species.

404
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:23,130
Millions of individuals form a matrix,
Like a computer.

405
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:29,017
They showed that they not only
ideas can understand ...

406
01:04:29,144 --> 01:04:33,605
but that they also have three-dimensional
can display.

407
01:04:33,732 --> 01:04:38,311
And the main one is, they want
communicate with us.

408
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:45,987
And they have a girl hostage?

409
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:50,622
Len, do you believe this real?

410
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:57,411
This is what we have seen.

411
01:04:57,549 --> 01:05:03,552
And what does it mean? They require
Just another island.

412
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,426
And I tell you now,
that will never happen.

413
01:05:08,561 --> 01:05:12,309
Thousands dead. As far as we know.

414
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,600
Villages destroyed. Plantations closed.
Cattle slain.

415
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:21,023
Country wasted. No more tourists.

416
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:26,239
And we have not stopped.

417
01:05:26,371 --> 01:05:29,871
They have pulled out.
- Why?

418
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,627
You have convinced them.
- No, we kill them anymore.

419
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:39,049
No. We do not negotiate
with ants.

420
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,180
Dr. Lennart, which advises you to us?

421
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,930
I'll tell you what I recommend.

422
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:56,601
Throw a bomb on.
- Please.

423
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:13,455
We must Ying back.
Dr. Dubois and let me negotiate.

424
01:06:18,051 --> 01:06:23,805
At the moment sounds a bomb
pretty good. Right?

425
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:37,689
How do you convince them
we want to stop fighting?

426
01:06:37,822 --> 01:06:41,072
Can we give them a part
of the island indicate?

427
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,198
West of the river.
- Less than half.

428
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:50,537
That is the offer. Otherwise I throw
there is indeed a bomb.

429
01:06:51,962 --> 01:06:53,954
Right? A bomb.

430
01:06:56,884 --> 01:06:59,754
You have until tomorrow morning time.

431
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:53,854
It is exactly as you said.

432
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:58,695
Communicate with them without technology,
and they eat us.

433
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,741
I could not do anything.

434
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,824
He was a good guy. A friend.

435
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:10,584
It is not so much that they killed him.
That you Expects.

436
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:13,499
But the way.

437
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:18,757
Previously, it was instinctively kill.
This was something else.

438
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:22,422
It was a trap.
- You've done your best.

439
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:28,596
After each battle, they are smarter.
It is whether they learn from it.

440
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:36,072
They learn it.

441
01:08:42,746 --> 01:08:45,996
But we can teach them things.

442
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:54,042
Riken smart that we learn a lesson.
That they should not fool us.

443
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:58,338
You're upset about Cortez.
We all.

444
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:07,895
Claire and I are working on a plan.
- We must Ying back.

445
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,900
I participate.

446
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,153
Is it okay?

447
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:23,906
Can I show you something?
- Yes.

448
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:31,918
I am trying to find out why
all these species so well together.

449
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:37,173
I can not. Will you help me?
- Yes, let me see.

450
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:39,510
I have taken this ...

451
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,092
and this done.
- And what is it?

452
01:09:44,228 --> 01:09:47,394
My notes are there.

453
01:09:47,523 --> 01:09:50,144
Okay, then watch us.

454
01:09:53,362 --> 01:09:55,735
I started with this.

455
01:09:57,992 --> 01:10:00,318
And when was this.

456
01:10:00,453 --> 01:10:04,451
Maybe I'm something on the track.

457
01:10:59,224 --> 01:11:02,427
You do this there? I'm back.

458
01:11:10,944 --> 01:11:12,821
Do not move, Billy.

459
01:11:13,864 --> 01:11:16,071
Anyway.

460
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,071
It was the ants.

461
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:22,743
He had no chance.

462
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:29,911
Ants. Ants.
He had no chance.

463
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:32,884
All right, Bill?

464
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:35,844
Yes, it's fine.

465
01:11:51,446 --> 01:11:56,606
I know that we are not good
together can.

466
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:03,664
But I wanted to say
how bad I feel, of Cortez.

467
01:12:06,003 --> 01:12:11,709
It was horrific.
And if I can do something for you ...

468
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,985
When I taught at Caltech,
I was good then?

469
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,073
Did you think of something I could?

470
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:48,666
Lech Zwierzinsky was.
Paul Vertov of the UN.

471
01:12:51,051 --> 01:12:54,669
It seems as if never once someone says ...

472
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:58,807
that you are performing well.

473
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:03,181
You have Len and I learned a lot.
- Take care of Len.

474
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:06,811
Take care of each other.

475
01:13:14,033 --> 01:13:15,910
I have ...

476
01:13:16,953 --> 01:13:19,242
I would not ...

477
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,669
Good night, Bill.

478
01:14:57,977 --> 01:15:00,384
Where is he?

479
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:05,100
Sorry, I had to pick the suit.
- We do not take them.

480
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,523
Not?
- No.

481
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:11,189
We let the suits in the barn.

482
01:15:11,324 --> 01:15:13,815
Are you serious?

483
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:19,907
That cave in without suit? You're crazy.
They eat you, like Cortez.

484
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:24,455
It is a gesture of good will.
- By ants?

485
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:31,134
Claire and I go this time alone.

486
01:15:32,763 --> 01:15:36,382
Well, if you want. You're the boss.

487
01:15:36,517 --> 01:15:39,091
Can I have a word?

488
01:15:41,815 --> 01:15:46,192
You must let me do this.
Let me do this.

489
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,439
I have to do it. Cortez, man ...

490
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,945
And who do you want as cover
if it goes wrong? Me or her?

491
01:16:03,212 --> 01:16:06,297
But no violence. And no deal.

492
01:16:48,177 --> 01:16:51,344
Let me guess. The computer.

493
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:56,560
Yes, we think so.
- Those bastards are smart.

494
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:01,055
You okay?
- Yes, fine.

495
01:17:41,441 --> 01:17:43,318
It is in order.

496
01:17:50,826 --> 01:17:52,736
It is in order.

497
01:18:03,465 --> 01:18:06,134
Take that away.
- He does not.

498
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:08,383
Keep it from my neighborhood.

499
01:18:28,408 --> 01:18:30,864
Four ants, a human being.

500
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:35,947
That is an offer.

501
01:18:59,774 --> 01:19:02,479
We are negotiating.

502
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,706
We talk with them. Unbelievable, huh?

503
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:35,350
Billy, do not move. Not looking up.

504
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:45,153
Are we ready?
- Not yet.

505
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:48,152
We are still negotiating.

506
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:52,449
We gotta get outta here.
- Not now.

507
01:19:57,627 --> 01:20:00,463
Oh, yes, Len. Now.

508
01:20:10,933 --> 01:20:14,931
What are you doing?
- We need those bastards finish.

509
01:20:15,063 --> 01:20:17,186
Take that child and disappearing.

510
01:20:20,694 --> 01:20:23,897
Give the signal.
- A bomb on it.

511
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,652
Yes, a bomb.
- Sounds good, huh?

512
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:29,191
Wait a minute.

513
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:32,827
What they know about suicide terrorists?

514
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:39,375
I can not wait any longer.

515
01:20:43,635 --> 01:20:45,793
Three minutes.

516
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:47,806
From now.

517
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:45,782
What is that?
- Pheromone of another queen.

518
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:47,786
Throw.

519
01:22:12,312 --> 01:22:14,388
Run. Run.

520
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:35,586
Here, here.

521
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,832
I'm going to get Bill.

522
01:22:42,802 --> 01:22:44,879
Be careful.

523
01:23:07,579 --> 01:23:09,571
Things are going well.

524
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:40,687
Give the signal.

525
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:44,357
Give the signal.

526
01:25:48,624 --> 01:25:52,373
We'll pay you millions and millions.

527
01:25:52,503 --> 01:25:55,588
And this is all we get?

528
01:25:55,715 --> 01:26:00,461
Ants? Extraterrestrial beings?
Space Ships?

529
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:02,968
A giant ant?

530
01:26:03,098 --> 01:26:09,302
Because no one can explain what
has happened is nothing happened here.

531
01:26:09,438 --> 01:26:11,561
Do you understand me?

532
01:26:13,734 --> 01:26:17,353
No alien.
No spaceship.

533
01:26:18,364 --> 01:26:20,241
Nothing.

534
01:26:24,204 --> 01:26:30,788
We will protect people
nothing to tell them.

535
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,828
Nothing.

536
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,915
It is so.

537
01:28:38,888 --> 01:28:41,177
I love this place.
