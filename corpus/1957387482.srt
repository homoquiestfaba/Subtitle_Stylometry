No.

Douglas-

7
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,895
- I'm trying, I'm,

8
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:39,564
I'm trying...

9
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't want you to think
this is about you at all.

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,266
Has nothing to do about you.

11
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:47,070
Don't think about it's
about you for a second.

12
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:47,973
It's not about you.

13
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:51,143
It's kinda hard not to when...

14
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:56,111
What can I do about it?

15
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,848
I don't know, maybe that's
one you can figure out.

[soft haunting piano music]

17
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,014
You open up,
I'll grab the bags.

18
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,883
That's way too much.

19
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,084
I got it.

20
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,252
Just give me the
chips at least, come on.

21
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:11,754
You can have the chips,

22
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,687
or just take your purse or I'm
not gonna carry it anymore.

23
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:13,525
Okay.

[soft haunting piano music]

25
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,360
Hey, Vee, where's my suitcase?

26
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,030
[Veronica] I brought
it downstairs, babe.

27
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,600
I had to get ready.

28
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:58,903
Okay.

29
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,071
[Veronica] Dan's
gonna be here soon,

30
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:03,241
I wanted to get changed.

31
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:06,710
Okay.

32
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,115
[Veronica] You want
me to bring it up?

33
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,418
No, I'm good, thank you.

[soft piano music]

35
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,329
- Yay.
- Hi

36
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:01,763
So Donna found
that photo of us.

37
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:04,100
I thought we lost it.

38
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:05,366
Which one?

39
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:06,972
The one from the
trip before last.

40
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,608
I was, I thought it was gone.

41
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,376
Just found it behind the futon.

42
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:16,213
Oh.

43
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,548
If I was gonna
lift, was gonna lift

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,685
and I'm gonna finish
that script on this trip,

45
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:23,655
I can just feel it.

46
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,324
Hope so.

47
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:29,858
Is it too late just to,

48
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,728
just to have Dan go
back to Orange County?

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,230
You wanted him to come.

50
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,697
I didn't say yes.

51
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,666
Yeah, you didn't
say no either.

52
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,801
And no decision is a decision.

53
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,069
You don't want Pia
and Dan to come up,

54
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,003
then you should said something.

55
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,007
I said nothing about Pia.

56
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,877
Oh, let me get that for you.

57
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:50,846
That came off too adamant.

58
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,018
You're the only girl
for me, you know that.

59
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:54,985
Yeah, sure.

00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,226
- Pia, ready?
- Are we doing this again?

63
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,860
- Veronica!
- Veronica!

64
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:07,363

65
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:09,063

Oh my god, you are a dream.
[Veronica softly laughs]

70
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,454
- Look at you.
- Hello, Douglas.

71
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,887
Smell nice.

72
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:33,724
Pia.

73
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:35,627
- Hi!
- Hey!

74
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:38,926
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie, how are you?

75
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,863
[Pia] Good, you?

76
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,735
Come here, you douchebag,
come here, missed you.

77
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,536
Hey, babe, babe,
what I tell you?

78
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,038
Bitch-in-love hug.

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,742
Whoa, whoa, I'm kidding.

80
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,743
So what are you doing,
you gonna invite us in?

81
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:57,279
This guy all of a
sudden gets a hot wife

82
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,546
and he's got no manners.

83
00:05:58,548 --> 00:05:59,781
Was gonna help
you with the bag.

84
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,819
She's fine, look at
her, she's hot, look.

85
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:03,952
This is for you.

86
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:04,954
We know you don't
know shit about wine.

87
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,154
Dan.

88
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,293
He doesn't, so we
picked this out for you.

89
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,327
Who says I don't
know shit about wine?

90
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,596
I know this wine.

91
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:14,762
"Who says I don't
know shit about,"

92
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,231
no one has to say it, Dougie.

93
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,935
This guy, you so cute, come
on, show me the house, come on!

[cicadas softly buzzing]

95
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,272
Stop.

96
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,442
You can look, we know
you need to watch this.

97
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,343
See what's happening here.

98
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:29,945
Give him the neck.

- [softly kissing]
- Hey, baby, we can-

100
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,752
- Okay, okay, you're awesome.

101
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,418
To you, this has been amazing.

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,618
Yeah.

103
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,623
Dougie, you've found
a great one, cheers.

104
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,858
You're beautifully
dressed, as always.

105
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,031
She is, well, I just
got one question though.

106
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,464
Doug, when are you
gonna do something

107
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,132
about that shit
around your mouth?

108
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:52,134
[Pia] Dan.

109
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:54,135
What, babe, what?

110
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:55,870
It's getting out of hand,
you said so in the car.

111
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:58,173
[Pia] No, I didn't.

112
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,276
Well, I happen to like it.

113
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:02,344
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

114
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,611
Doesn't bother you trying to

115
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:06,048
find his lips through
all that shit?

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,817
Nah, she likes the bush.

117
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,817
She does?

118
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,319
Yeah.

119
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,486
Everyone likes a little
bush nowadays, right?

120
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:12,822
It's like a
picnic, you have to

121
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:14,490
go through some
bush to get there.

122
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,824
He should shave the bush-

123
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,360
- No, bad boy.
- It's better to go through.

124
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,493
What's goin' on?

125
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:20,363
Everyone likes a
little bush, huh, babe?

126
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:21,730
- Stop it.
- Actually, there's nothing,

127
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,834
she's clean as a.

128
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,202
I love you.

129
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:28,469
Hey, Dougie, you remember
the Wasserman account

130
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,839
- You remember that-
- Boo!

131
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,639
- What, what, what?
- Yeah, no, we said no.

132
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,740
- We said no-
- Oh, come on, no.

133
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:33,742
- No.
- Are you serious?

134
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,077
We had one rule.

135
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,344
What's the rule?

136
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:37,312
[Douglas] You're
such a dick, dude.

137
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:38,848
You tell me what the rule was.

138
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,552
No talking shop.

139
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:43,853
- Are you serious about this?
- Or just no talking, period.

140
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,320
No talking?

141
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,656
Geez, listen, Dougie, are
you sure you wanna hear this?

142
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:48,890
You're a dick.

143
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,358
Am I gonna tell
the story or not?

144
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,493
- Carry on.
- Yes!

145
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,262
Okay, this one Wasserman
account, right?

146
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,730
I've been trying to
land this account

147
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:56,699
for I don't know how long,
it was Dougie's lead,

148
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:01,536
he couldn't land it, easy
150 grand a month, easy.

149
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,038
Dougie couldn't land it because

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,440
of Tim fucking McNealy, that
prick, remember that guy?

151
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:08,610
He worked at a different
copier place and he's a dick.

152
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:11,079
Yeah, well, yeah, but I
thought I was telling the story.

153
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,281
Veer, I'm telling
the story, right?

154
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,615
- Yes, go, go on.
- Baby, babe,

155
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:14,750
- can I finish the story?
- You have the floor.

156
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:15,918
Oh my gosh, keep going.

157
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,786
Thank you, so,
right, after you left,

158
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:21,288
Rob passed it around people's
desks, didn't happen.

159
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,726
Landed on my desk, like
a turd, what do I do?

160
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:25,793
What do I do, babe?

161
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,230
I know the story, keep going.

162
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,598
Yeah, I go pay
Wasserman a visit, right,

163
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,899
every time I get there,

164
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,901
the jerk-off gatekeeper
says he's got no time.

165
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,469
Every time, no time.

166
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:38,239
So I wait a couple weeks, and
then, I do the unthinkable.

167
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,743
Can I get a drum roll, please?

168
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,112
I pull out the clipboard.

169
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:45,414
[Veronica] What's
with the clipboard?

170
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,983
Dougie, you wanna tell
'em or should I tell 'em?

171
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,251
[Douglas softly mumbling]
Should I tell 'em?

172
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,419
Let me tell 'em, let
me tell, okay, okay.

173
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,088
One day, Doug's in some office,

174
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,656
some schmuck's office,
I don't know who.

175
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:57,291
These people, maintenance
people, walking through,

176
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:01,061
holding a clipboard,
nobody says nothing, nada.

177
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,998
They just let 'em walk right by.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,666
Dougie here gets the smart idea,

179
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,771
he goes into Office Depot,
Office Depot, or was it...

180
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:10,272
Office Max.

181
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,174
Office Max, nobody stops
the guy with the clipboard,

182
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,642
or a Mexican with
the leaf blower.

183
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,611
- Oh, what?
- I can say that joke,

184
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:18,446
because, listen, I can say
that joke, I'm half Mexican.

185
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:19,948
You guys can't, you
will be canceled,

186
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,517
I'm just stating facts.

187
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,489
What about a white
guy with a leaf blower?

188
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,189
Yes, this also works.

189
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,759
Anyways, I got the clipboard,
I go right past that jerk-off.

190
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:31,959
I'm in Wasserman's office

191
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,695
and he walks in five
minutes later, right?

192
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,829
- No way.
- Way.

193
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:36,698
And we're doing the damn thing,

194
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,435
three yeses, I'm in,
this guy won't commit.

195
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,469
Whatever I do, he
will not commit.

196
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:43,305
Had to give him
everything, everything.

197
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,306
Almost had to let
Pia fuck him here.

198
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,142
I was thinking I had to do it,

199
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:49,277
and I almost thought I
was gonna do it, but,

200
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,146
I kid, I kid, baby.

201
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,347
- Aw!
- Yeah.

202
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:52,547
I would never let
him do that, well-

203
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,348
- It's okay, maybe
I wanna do it.

204
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,517
Whoa, pause, babe.

205
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
[soft ominous music building]

206
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:00,158
Dougie knows though,
I don't lose.

207
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,494
Dan Mackie never loses, never.

208
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,665
So, I get this bright idea,

209
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,166
my bulb goes off, I head
down to the corner store,

210
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,401
I grab a deck of cards.

211
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,837
Next meeting, I walk
in with five cards,

212
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,539
Ace, King, Queen,
Jack, 10, all hearts.

213
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,840
You know what that is,
tell 'em what it is.

214
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:20,008
I don't know.

215
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,843
You know, it's a
royal flush, say royal-

216
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:22,310
- A flush.

217
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:25,847
It's a royal flush, whatever,
she's foreign, it's cool.

218
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:28,883
You can call on any of my guys,

219
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:31,820
anytime with this hand,
now make it happen.

220
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:35,991
But each time he calls, I take

221
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:36,761
one card,

222
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:42,066
and when I finally
have five cards,

223
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,168
I get to go all in and ask him

224
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,371
for one favor and
he's gotta do it.

225
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,537
We shook on it.

226
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:50,707
It was a deal,
Dougie, you remember.

227
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,776
So, [softly chuckling]

228
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,945
he used his last
card on Wednesday.

229
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,283
Me, I asked for my
favor yesterday.

230
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,385
I asked for his business.

231
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:03,721
And this morning,

232
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:05,856
well, this morning,

233
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,357
I closed that motherfucker!

234
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,892
[Pia speaking French]
Fuck you,

235
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:10,892
Timmy Fucking McNealy

236
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,060
and that's how you do it.

237
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:12,895
Can I get an amen?
[Pia speaking French]

238
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:13,929
Can I get an amen, amen?

239
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:15,296
[Veronica] Amen.

240
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:16,397
[Pia speaks French]

241
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,065
I'm sorry, right?

242
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,401
Come on, that's a power move.

243
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,469
Was that a Kanye move?

244
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,104
I'm like Kanye.

245
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:25,709
That's, congratulations,
that's huge.

246
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:28,977
Yeah?

247
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,579
You sound so enthused.

248
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:33,084
I, no, I don't mean,
I mean, congrats.

249
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:35,485
Congrats, that's huge?

250
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:39,287
Tell me you miss it, Dougie.

251
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:40,589
You miss it, right?

252
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,489
You, don't flip me
off, you miss it.

253
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:45,893
The rush you get, the
feeling of watching

254
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:47,396
you eat another
cocksucker's lunch, right?

255
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,664
I don't want any
cocksuckers around.

256
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,967
I don't know, maybe this

257
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:53,734
writing thing fills
that need, I don't know.

258
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,774
If I have a need to
be filled, it does.

259
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,445
So is that a yes?

260
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,914
I don't know, man.

261
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,752
Baby, are you seeing this?

262
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:09,819
Who does he look like?

263
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:10,620
[Pia] Stop it.

264
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:13,358
You know else had that look?

265
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,426
Gary did.

266
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,127
Yeah, it's that look,
man, it's that hunger.

267
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,629
If you don't do
something about it,

268
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,131
it's gonna eat
you alive, Dougie.

269
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,632
Dan.

270
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,837
What, I'm just, look, all
I'm saying is Doug and me,

271
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:29,373
we're like vampires.

272
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,677
Eat another man's lunch,

273
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:35,812
it's like blood to us.

274
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,979
Dan.

275
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,315
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

276
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:41,151
All right, just,

277
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,219
I'm done.

278
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,860
Anyways, I need another
drink because I am thirsty.

279
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,497
But seriously though,
can you get me a drink?

280
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,497
Something stiff?

281
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,665
Okay-
I got it,

282
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,166
- I got it.
- Was it too much?

283
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,401
Okay.

284
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,904
I'm gonna get the
vampire's blood.

285
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,137
[Dan] Sorry about that.

286
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,375
That was stupid.

287
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,880
So, how's America's
favorite tart with a heart?

288
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,849
You know I hate
when you call me that.

289
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,017
What do you care for?

290
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:16,853
Dan.

291
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:19,655
She doesn't like that.

292
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,390
Okay, all right, all
right, I'm sorry, but okay,

293
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:24,193
you gotta admit my
favorite character,

294
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:27,195
Kendall James, is a steel-jawed
cunt, let me finish,

295
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,866
hiding behind that so gorgeous

296
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:33,838
and immaculate,
wonderfully deceptive

297
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,573
pretty case of whoever he was.

298
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,877
Isn't it fun being
someone else for a living?

299
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,680
No, it was.

300
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,046
Yeah.

301
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,216
No, it, it was.

302
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,219
I stepped down a few months ago.

303
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,386
Stepped down?

304
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:53,122
Qu'est-ce que
c'est stepped down?

305
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:53,957
You mean,

306
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:55,725
you quit?

307
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,060
[Veronica] Yes.

308
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,297
Oh, Dougie. [softly chuckling]

309
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,066
Your meal ticket here
just got punched, brother.

310
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,368
Looks like you need
to get a real job.

311
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,738
Can always come back with
me, or copier sales, huh?

312
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,242
Why did you step down?

313
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:16,080
15 years on the show
started to get stale.

314
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,916
She's all out of love,
and so lost without you.

315
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:24,953
Besides, Douglas and
I are looking forward

316
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,758
to a normal life,
normal schedule,

317
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:31,059
spending more time together.

318
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:33,264
And Douglas has been
working on his writing.

319
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,665
You hear that, Dougie?

320
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,066
You, you want a normal life?

321
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:41,136
I have a normal life.

322
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,638
That's not what I
asked you, playboy.

323
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,508
I said do you,
[ominous music building]

324
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,447
you want a normal life?

325
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:54,918
I have a normal life, I
like it very much, thank you.

326
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,287
That's cute.

327
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,824
Who the hell wants
a normal life?

328
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,327
Normal people?

329
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,661
[softly chuckling] Okay.

330
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:10,531
Okay, now I get it, I get it.

331
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,300
Yeah, I tried being normal once.

332
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,639
It was the worst 30
seconds of my fucking life.

333
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,644
Normal is for people
without courage.

334
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,146
I don't know, Dan.

335
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,650
My dad used to say,

336
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,152
"You become the price you
paid to get what you want."

337
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:34,989
So, just make sure
you really want it.

338
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:39,230
No matter what it is, even
if it's a normal life.

339
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,535
From the mouth of a babe.

340
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,569
I don't think
that's an expression.

341
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,402
Well, I'm saying-

342
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:49,339
- For Dan, it is.

343
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,645
[ominous music softly building]

344
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:02,316
Oh my god.

345
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:03,153
See?

346
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,991
Was it me, or was it 1000
times more obnoxious than usual?

347
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:10,361
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

348
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:13,730
You weren't like that, right?

349
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,701
I suppose we all were.

350
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,004
Even when we weren't, you know?

351
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah.

352
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,543
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,042
I know you guys

say that he's a hostage too

holding them at gunpoint,

You're holding out on me, huh?

536
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,111
I see, you're trying to keep
all the good shit to yourself.

537
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:48,415
You're amazing. [Veronica
loudly giggling]

538
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,251
Oh my God.

539
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:52,655
Your face right
now, it's like you,

540
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,592
tickled his O-ring mid stroke.

541
00:28:58,461 --> 00:28:59,296
You okay?

542
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,530
Okay, well this has
been a good talk.

543
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:06,602
I will talk to you guys later.

544
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:08,805
See ya.

545
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:14,310
Douglas, what was that?

546
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,317
Is this about last night?

547
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,154
[ominous music softly building]

548
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:29,623
I don't see any eggs, Vee.

549
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,659
She said you're going to
the store to get some eggs.

550
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,663
You guys having too
much fun to get eggs?

551
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:36,330
The store was closed,
the hours must've changed-

552
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,365
- Must've, mm-hm.

553
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,500
You know what, let's go down
there together right now,

554
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,170
me and you, we'll see
if they have eggs.

555
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:44,205
- Okay, maybe you need-
- I want eggs, I really want-

556
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:45,707
- A little space or something-
- Some eggs right now.

557
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:48,545
To do whatever it is you
need to do to normalize but,

558
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,183
I don't know what to say to you.

559
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,671
[car softly honking]

560
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,442
[Douglas] Hey.

561
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:22,876
You startled me.

562
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:24,346
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm going to the general
store, do you want a ride?

564
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:28,018
[Pia] No.

565
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:30,617
Eggs.

566
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,553
They didn't come
back with any eggs.

567
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,057
So I'm gonna go get some eggs.

568
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,793
If you...

569
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:42,265
Open.

570
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:47,267
Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:48,236
- No.
- Shit,

572
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:49,072
I'm sorry, yeah, perfect.

573
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,794
I'm sorry, I'm just really
in my head right now.

574
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,231
[radio softly clicks]
[soft moody guitar music]

575
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,934
[radio softly clicks]

576
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:23,770
Learn to love the quiet.

577
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,107
It has so much to show you.

578
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:35,085
[birds softly chirping]

579
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:51,298
Only keep the important one.

580
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,167
Speak only good?

581
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:54,934
Speak no evil.

582
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:55,704
Sure.

583
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:57,641
They have a,

584
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,311
there's a fair in the
square every fall.

585
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,148
I won that the first time we
came up here, me and Veer.

586
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,653
We used to come up here

587
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:13,456
as a place to escape everything.

588
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:16,960
Now it just seems like
we come up here to hide.

589
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,461
But yeah, I guess I did, I
did keep the important one.

590
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:22,365
Speak no evil.

591
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,199
Only good.

592
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:27,671
Only good, when I can.

593
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:31,541
Let's go.

594
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:37,143
- [women softly chattering]
- There's no way, yeah.

595
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:38,379
[Woman] Yeah, and you
didn't know about it?

596
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:39,212
[2nd Woman] No.

597
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:40,715
[Woman] Oh, yeah.

598
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:45,322
[2nd Woman] My husband
[women softly chattering]

599
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,988
[Woman] Oh, I'm glad
he let you come here.

600
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,591
[Woman 2] Yes, yesterday
was beautiful anyway.

601
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,691
- Aw, thank you.
- So I can't wait

602
00:32:51,693 --> 00:32:52,860
to see you again.

603
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:53,727
- Oh, you too.
- Thank you so much.

604
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:54,995
Nice to see you, bye.

605
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:56,698
Nice to see you too, bye.

606
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,731
Hi. Dee Dee.

607
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:58,567
Douglas.

608
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:01,335
And friend?

609
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,036
This is Pia.

610
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:04,537
Can I call you friend?

611
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,076
I don't know, can you?

612
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,508
Pia.

613
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,044
Dee Dee.

614
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:11,746
Close friend, she and
her husband are her for,

615
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:14,381
I don't know, just to get
away from the city for a bit.

616
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:17,116
Oh, how are you liking it?

617
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:19,553
[speaking French]

618
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:21,055
Great.

619
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,256
That's French.

620
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,190
Oh, well, what can
I do for you two?

621
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:27,061
Just gonna get some supplies.

622
00:33:27,063 --> 00:33:28,895
Hey, Vero was here earlier,

623
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:31,231
she said you guys
were closed, that,

624
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:32,400
you change your store hours?

625
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,801
I was here a
couple minutes late,

626
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,737
but the store has
the same hours.

627
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,607
- [soft ominous music]
- Okay.

628
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,209
Okay.

629
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:43,411
Yeah.

630
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:44,745
We're just gonna
go get the shit

631
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:46,246
that we're supposed to get.

632
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:48,949
All right, you go ahead, hon.

633
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:52,585
[Pia speaks French]

634
00:33:52,587 --> 00:33:54,223
That's a nice shirt, I like it.

635
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:56,423
Thanks.

636
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:59,461
[soft ominous music]

637
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:10,606
Do you mind if I
stop for a second?

638
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,686
[speaking French]

639
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,758
For me, it's wheat
bread, prosciutto,

640
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:31,094
and a two-minute egg.

641
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:35,330
[speaking French]

642
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,637
I can live without
the prosciutto today.

643
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:45,641
[speaking French]

644
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,449
How well do you know Dan?

645
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:58,151
How well should I?

646
00:34:58,153 --> 00:34:59,054
You married him.

647
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:02,188
You should know him the best.

648
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,893
Then that's how
much I know him.

649
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:05,862
Is that enough?

650
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,897
For me it is.

651
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:17,706
The trouble you're feeling,

652
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,009
is about Veronica?

653
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,813
Yeah.

654
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,717
Is it something she's done?

655
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:31,520
Or something you
think she has done?

656
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:37,025
I don't know anymore.

657
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:39,695
When do you?

658
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,201
Two things we should
never get angry with,

659
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:52,375
things we can change, and
the things we cannot change.

660
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,376
That doesn't make any sense.

661
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:59,382
[Pia softly laughs]

662
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:09,893
What if it wasn't us that
needs to know them well?

663
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:18,898
Oh, your egg, um-

664
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,568
- Two-minute egg.

665
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,269
Not a word of this
to Veronica, okay?

666
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:24,239
Ooh, a secret.

667
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:30,380
[ominous music loudly building]

668
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,110
- [music drowns out Dan]
- No.

669
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,313
[Veronica softly giggles]

670
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:07,517
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.

671
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:12,186
Hey, babe.

672
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,019
You good?

673
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,119
Yeah.

674
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:16,456
[Douglas and Dan softly chuckle]

675
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,193
All right, come on.

676
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:31,807
I normalized, so, yay.

677
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,144
Okay.

678
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:39,682
Look, look, but I, look, I'm,

679
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,048
I'm sorry, dammit, okay?

680
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,450
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:45,786
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

682
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:48,488
I'm not the jealous
type, you know that.

683
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,360
"I, I, I."

684
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,659
You really wanna
show me you care?

685
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,497
Think about me first, for once.

686
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,539
[ominous music
softly distorting]

687
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:21,420
All right, so I'm
thinking about brownies,

688
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:22,722
you guys want some brownies?

689
00:38:22,724 --> 00:38:23,891
Yeah.

690
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:24,691
[Dan] All right,
babe, you're gonna cook

691
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:25,525
some brownies for us?

692
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:26,827
[Pia] Yeah, sure.

693
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,028
[Dan] Okay, come
on, get over here.

694
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,329
She's hot, she's gonna
make some brownies.

695
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:30,164
I like this.

696
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:30,998
Oh, thank you.

697
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,200
"I, I, I."

698
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:35,068
You really wanna
show me you care?

699
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,537
Think about me first.

700
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:38,873
- Danish?
- Danish, yeah.

701
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,541
She says danish,
I don't understand.

702
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,876
Yeah, but it's good,
it's a one-day trip,

703
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:47,246
wine-tasting, it's fun,
it's up in Santa Ynez.

704
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:48,248
Babe, Santa Ynez?

705
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,182
I don't know, baby.

706
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:50,450
Spain.

707
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:55,124
[ominous music building
and distorting]

708
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:22,782
[Veronica] "I, I, I."

709
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:24,386
Think about me first.

710
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,726
I swear to god,
listen, listen, listen.

711
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:33,927
So, you remember this?

712
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:35,729
Gary comes and he kicks
open the goddam door,

713
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,130
and he's holding
his cheeks together,

714
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,432
he's like, "Where's the
shitter, where's the shitter?"

715
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:39,331
He's gonna shit
all over himself,

716
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,402
- I promise you.
- No.

717
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,240
Stop the press.

718
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,110
Holy shit.

719
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,516
From a bearded clam to a
Brazilian-waxed beaver, whew!

720
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,684
Your puss just keeps getting
prettier and prettier, baby.

721
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,318
Come on in and sit
down, come on, come on,

722
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,621
sit down, the new man, huh?

723
00:40:01,623 --> 00:40:05,193
I saved ya some, oh my
god, Hollywood, Hollywood!

724
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:08,131
Hey, man, welcome back.

725
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:13,135
You lookin' gorgeous,
Tom Cruise, I like it.

726
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,472
You guys throw a great party.

727
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,143
You must excuse me, I think
I've had too much of this.

728
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:24,814
There he is, there he
is, Hollywood, Hollywood!

729
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:28,951
Did I put it down or
did I put it down?

730
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:31,820
You put it down.

731
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,057
What?

732
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,325
No, man, I love
you, I love ya.

733
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,197
I'm gonna go take a piss.

734
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:43,329
- Dan.
- Thanks.

735
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,831
- What?
- TMI.

736
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,333
Listen, what I coulda said
is I'm gonna take a dump,

737
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:49,003
- but we just ate.
- Oh, wow.

738
00:40:49,005 --> 00:40:50,503
I'm not gonna be weird.

739
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:51,807
I'll be back, you guys.

740
00:40:57,512 --> 00:40:59,682
[Veronica] Sorry, your lips,

741
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:04,353
your lipstick, I'm
loving that shade.

742
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,021
It seems hydrating but not wet,

743
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:10,155
and your lips look so full.

744
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,425
It's not a lipstick,
it's a gloss.

745
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,994
Oh, what brand?
[phone softly vibrating]

746
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:16,496
Oh, I'm sorry, I
have to take this.

747
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:18,034
Hello, this is Veronica.

748
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,039
It is a lipstick, I think.

749
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,507
Really?

750
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:28,244
Now we have two secrets.

751
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:16,923
The owner put that chair there

752
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,592
like six months ago, it's new.

753
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:20,428
Yeah?

754
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:25,101
Yeah, they made it to
look old, but it's new.

755
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:38,478
I like the, um-

756
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,315
- Oh.

757
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:41,583
Thanks.

758
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:44,420
Been a long time.

759
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,121
- Yeah?
- It feels good.

760
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:49,958
Great.

761
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,795
It looks better though, right?

762
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,600
Why'd you shave it?

763
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:13,215
I never told Dan I didn't
like it, by the way.

764
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:16,152
- No?
- No.

765
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:20,855
It looks good.

766
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:23,990
Not better, but good.

767
00:43:23,992 --> 00:43:26,362
[soft music]

768
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,673
I think I should go.

769
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:41,074
But do you though?

770
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:41,911
Yeah.

771
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:53,186
Veronica.

772
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:54,557
[Dan] Veronica!

773
00:43:55,891 --> 00:43:58,858
Veronica, Veronica!

774
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,695
Here's the one I
was telling you about.

775
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:02,896
No, I couldn't.

776
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:04,863
Yes, you could,
and you should.

777
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,735
It's gonna look
much better on you.

778
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:10,704
Yeah?

779
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:15,177
Yeah, your skin tone and
the warmth of it, definitely.

780
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:18,744
Okay.

781
00:44:18,746 --> 00:44:19,714
Oh, may I?

782
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:28,590
It's okay, it's okay.

783
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:34,864
Perfect, come, I have so
much more to show you.

784
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:45,073
Thanks for getting Dan
to come up, by the way.

785
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:47,574
I don't know if I said that

786
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,778
with everything going
on, it's just...

787
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:54,383
He misses you guys,
even if he won't say so.

788
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,286
I miss him too.

789
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,822
And you.

790
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:05,293
How have things been
since the funeral?

791
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:10,833
Hard sometimes, he feels
guilty, like it's his fault.

792
00:45:16,603 --> 00:45:20,240
[Pia speaking foreign language]

793
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:21,807
What?

794
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:24,276
Beautiful, more
beautiful than when,

795
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:27,016
when Lance tried to kill
you at the Hollywood sign.

796
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,585
Oh, on the show.

797
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:34,423
That episode was over 10
years ago, so I doubt that...

798
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:40,995
Oh my god.

799
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:47,102
Hey, I'm making mix.

800
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:53,139
Dougie, hey!

801
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,309
What's that?

802
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:56,709
This is a, it's
called liquid courage.

803
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:57,980
Little potion I'm making.

804
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,050
You want?

805
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:03,849
Yeah.

806
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:04,816
Okay.

807
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:06,820
You, you just go wait for me,

808
00:46:06,822 --> 00:46:08,391
I'll be out in a
second, all right?

809
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,627
Yo, you think I'm
gonna roofie you?

810
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:15,295
Listen, if I wanted to fuck you,

811
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:16,795
I'd want you to
see it coming, man.

812
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:20,499
Every inch, balls deep, leaving
my DNA all over your walls.

813
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:22,670
Yeah, just go out, I'll
be out in a second.

814
00:46:43,724 --> 00:46:46,760
I call this A Goddam Shame.

815
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,596
Why?

816
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,530
I don't know, that's what
it's fucking called, man.

817
00:46:50,532 --> 00:46:54,903
Spiced rum, mezcal, spiced
Clamato, it's genius.

818
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,244
Hey, what's the difference
between a baby and a trampoline?

819
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:07,546
I take off my cleats to
jump on a trampoline.

820
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:11,117
[Dan loudly laughs]
Come on, bro, come on.

821
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,351
There was a time, man,

822
00:47:12,353 --> 00:47:14,022
you woulda pissed
yourself at that joke.

823
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,394
So, what do you think about Rob?

824
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:22,929
Dan, I'm not going back.

825
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:25,568
I know, I know, I know, but
just, come on, just humor me.

826
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,570
Better than you.
[Dan loudly laughs]

827
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:31,405
He's better than me?

828
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:32,905
Fuck you, man.

829
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:34,941
The day I take shit from this
job's the day I walk away.

830
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,879
But seriously, man,
like as a manager.

831
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:40,546
As a manager, he's adequate.

832
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,251
He's a better salesman
than a manager.

833
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:44,816
I don't know,
it's kind of like

834
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,820
that script you
wrote about us, bro.

835
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,822
Dan, I've already told
you, it wasn't about you.

836
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,289
It was fiction.

837
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,257
Fiction my diction, man.

838
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:52,592
That's not even a sentence.

839
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:54,760
Anyways, look, it
doesn't matter, anyways.

840
00:47:54,762 --> 00:47:57,262
So hey, you remember, you
remember the circle, right?

841
00:47:57,264 --> 00:47:58,498
Yeah.

842
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,599
Okay, so we're in the
circle and we're talking

843
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:03,836
about this pipeline and this
guy and Rob starts Jonning on

844
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:05,604
about a fucking
job he's working.

845
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,139
Get the fuck outta here.

846
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:09,641
No, I'm serious, and this
guy doesn't talk about shit

847
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:12,478
unless he's closing a deal
and he knows he closed it.

848
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,483
But there Rob was,
out of character,

849
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:18,820
sweating like a blind bull
dyke in a fish market.

850
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,487
Apparently the office
manager was a chink.

851
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,624
- No, no, no.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

852
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:28,327
And you know what they say,
chink's a jinx, Dougie.

853
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:30,930
Those slanty-eyed,
abacus-loving fucks.

854
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:32,798
They see right through
us, guys like you and me,

855
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,835
see right through us.

856
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:39,171
I'm talking about Rob,
never needed advice

857
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:43,045
in the history of motherfucking
advice, until he did.

858
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:47,316
Kinda like you, man.

859
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:51,619
So I'm gonna tell
you what I told him.

860
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:57,793
Bail.

861
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:01,126
They can see you coming, buddy.

862
00:49:01,128 --> 00:49:03,829
Doesn't matter by
hook or by crook,

863
00:49:03,831 --> 00:49:05,999
you ain't gonna get what you
want, not the way you want it.

864
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:08,166
[soft ominous music]

865
00:49:08,168 --> 00:49:11,670
Hey, what do you do when
I look you in the eyes

866
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:14,807
and I tell you that
I can see you coming?

867
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:18,512
[ominous music loudly building]

868
00:49:18,514 --> 00:49:20,012
[Dan loudly laughs]

869
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:22,182
Your face right now, man.

870
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:24,684
Like someone took
a shit in your hat.

871
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:27,586
Oh anyways, the deal
Rob was working,

872
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:29,224
he lost a shirt, we all did.

873
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:32,360
But...

874
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:37,597
Some fucking guy caught up
with him in the parking lot

875
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,834
and he just beat the fuck out
of him, like fucked him up.

876
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,369
His eyes hanging out
of his fucking head,

877
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:46,274
his nose smashed in, man,
blood everywhere, fuck.

878
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:48,509
Was crazy, man.

879
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:51,510
But I guess, you know,

880
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:54,213
that's the price you pay
for what you want, right?

881
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:57,518
What did that douchebag,
Pakowski, say?

882
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:00,789
"Find what you love
and let it kill you."

883
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:06,425
Doug, whatever it is you're
chasing, I hope you love it.

884
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:07,862
Cheers to you, motherfucker.

885
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,802
It's A Goddam Shame.

886
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:28,916
May I?

887
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,664
Do you like yourself,

888
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,768
who you are today?

889
00:50:49,804 --> 00:50:51,173
Kinda have to, wouldn't I?

890
00:50:53,474 --> 00:50:54,777
I mean there's...

891
00:50:57,612 --> 00:50:59,447
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

892
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:04,983
What if you spent
your entire life

893
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:06,621
running away from who you were

894
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:10,792
only to realize that you
were running towards it?

895
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:23,135
I'm not the same person I was.

896
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:23,971
No?

897
00:51:25,306 --> 00:51:28,376
[soft ominous music]

898
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,347
So the truth is not
that Dan ate your lunch

899
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:35,784
and now you want to eat me?

900
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,358
He shoved his cock so
deep into her, you know?

901
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:46,161
The surprise in her face.

902
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:48,396
He loved it,

903
00:51:50,297 --> 00:51:54,633
watching her
discover every thick,

904
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:57,505
veiny inch until
he exploded in her.

905
00:51:58,672 --> 00:51:59,974
And she came too.

906
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:03,177
So many times.

907
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:06,248
More than with anyone else.

908
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:09,414
More than with you.

909
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,851
[ominous music loudly building]

910
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:12,920
She loved it.

911
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:17,425
In fact, she liked
it so much that...

912
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:23,664
She only thinks of him
when she's with you.

913
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:30,271
And here you are, trying
so hard to make her come.

914
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:35,874
But she only comes when she's
with you thinking of him.

915
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:40,215
[ominous music
loudly intensifying]

916
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,459
What's going on?

917
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:54,429
Dammit, Pia.

918
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,235
Would it matter if I said
it doesn't mean anything?

919
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:05,206
No?

920
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:11,045
I mean, it's just, have you
seen the cock on that guy?

921
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,250
[softly laughs] You
have, haven't you?

922
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,820
Then you know

923
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,422
after him,

924
00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:23,125
you're not enough.

925
00:53:31,432 --> 00:53:33,768
The new you is the old you

926
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:39,271
with a sensitive
stomach and no fangs.

927
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:42,944
He can still bite if
you want to, I know it.

928
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,348
Just fucking do it.

929
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:48,750
Do it.

930
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:51,519
Do it.

931
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,530
[soft tranquil vocal music]

932
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:53,047
[loudly descending
into haunting vocals]

933
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:08,396
Dan!

934
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:10,362
You're so good!

935
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,331
Mwah! Wow.

936
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,365
That's all it takes
to get your wife

937
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,200
to scream my name, Dougie?

938
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,836
I wish Pia were that easy.

939
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:17,673
Babe, what?

940
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,614
All right, well, I know this
is a dangerous proposition but,

941
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:29,885
Dougie, do you wanna
chose the wine?

942
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,519
- Sure.
- Okay, stop.

943
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:34,720
I know what you're thinking.

944
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,755
You're thinking
chicken, white wine,

945
00:55:36,757 --> 00:55:38,559
but that's poor
critical thinking.

946
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:42,431
This is roasted
chicken, it's dark meat.

947
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:47,233
So pairs red with the red.

948
00:55:47,235 --> 00:55:48,637
It pairs good with the red.

949
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,072
Come on, chop, chop,
hurry up, buddy.

950
00:55:54,074 --> 00:55:54,909
Okay.

951
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,909
Why don't you bring them both?

952
00:55:57,911 --> 00:55:59,313
[Douglas] Okay.

953
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:02,414
So, we're going
to the canyons.

954
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:03,583
- Pinot grigio, please.
- I think it'd be cool

955
00:56:03,585 --> 00:56:05,050
if you came with us.

956
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:06,751
I would love to go.

957
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:09,257
Oh, top me off,
buddy, thank you.

958
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:12,090
- Babe.
- Thank you.

959
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:13,659
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Sorry about that.

960
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,597
It's okay, it's okay.

961
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,731
He was a dunce in class.

962
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:23,302
So Dougie, what's this
strip you're writing?

963
00:56:23,304 --> 00:56:24,137
Script.

964
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:25,104
Script?

965
00:56:25,106 --> 00:56:26,671
You said strip, it's script.

966
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:27,907
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

967
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:29,575
Well, you know
what I mean, right?

968
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:33,945
All right, so Vero tells
me that it's about a heist.

969
00:56:33,947 --> 00:56:36,449
[Dan softly laughing]

970
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:38,249
I thought you were supposed
to write what you know, man.

971
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,322
What the fuck do you
know about a robbery?

972
00:56:42,623 --> 00:56:44,259
I guess about the same as you.

973
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,195
There he is.

974
00:56:49,463 --> 00:56:51,097
Okay.

975
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:51,932
All right, well,

976
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:55,870
you know, it's funny 'cause

977
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:00,972
Veronica tells me
that you're in a jam

978
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,641
and you're stuck and
you can't get out of it.

979
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:05,978
I just, you don't wanna flap
your gums about it, it's fine.

980
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,648
I'm just, see what shakes
loose, just say so.

981
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:10,451
[Douglas] So.

982
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:14,121
[Pia] Dan, stop it now.

983
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:16,722
- All right.
- Dan-

984
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,990
- No, no, no, no.
[Pia whispering in French]

985
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:19,958
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, this guy's

986
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,059
- rockin' is granny panties.
- He doesn't wanna

987
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:21,994
- talk about it.
- Listen, Doug knows,

988
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:23,297
Dougie knows me.

989
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:26,699
If he wants to tell
me to fuck off,

990
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:27,969
just tell me to fuck off.

991
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,139
It's okay.

992
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:34,909
I can, let him talk, Pia.

993
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:39,345
So Dan, what is my jam?

994
00:57:39,347 --> 00:57:42,017
And how can I fix it?

995
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:45,753
- Should I?
- Yeah.

996
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:52,023
Look, I'm just
here to help, buddy.

997
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:53,691
If you don't wanna
talk, you don't talk,

998
00:57:53,693 --> 00:57:55,860
I just wanna help, right, Vero?

999
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:57,364
Yeah, he really does.

1000
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:03,034
Dan wants to help me?

1001
00:58:03,036 --> 00:58:04,772
Dan wants to help me?

1002
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:08,441
Dan wants to help me?

1003
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,675
- [Douglas softly laughing]
- Yeah, I'm just,

1004
00:58:09,677 --> 00:58:11,711
I'm just here to
help you out, buddy.

1005
00:58:11,713 --> 00:58:15,046
[Douglas loudly cackling]

1006
00:58:15,048 --> 00:58:16,782
Dan wants to help me!

1007
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,950
That's so awesome.

1008
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,223
I love it, I love it, I love it.

1009
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:26,027
[Douglas loudly cackling]

1010
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:34,032
I'm so lucky. [softly mumbling]

1011
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:37,538
[Douglas loudly cackling]

1012
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,418
Dan wants to help me.

1013
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:55,454
Dan can't even help himself.

1014
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:57,456
[Dan] Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

1015
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,157
No, finish, Dan can't do what?

1016
00:58:59,159 --> 00:58:59,992
Help yourself.

1017
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:00,996
[Dan] What can't I do?

1018
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:13,139
The first thing they
teach you in Sales 101-

1019
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:14,106
- Yes, it's three yeses-

1020
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:15,744
- I'm fucking talking to you!

1021
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:17,945
[Veronica] Douglas.

1022
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:20,748
Sorry, yes, it's
the three yeses.

1023
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:25,419
The last thing they
teach to a fucking retard

1024
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:31,192
who doesn't grasp the basic
rudimentary, fundamental

1025
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:34,126
nuances of sales is, guess what,

1026
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:37,028
those same three goddam
yeses, and you know why?

1027
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,463
Because it doesn't
take intelligence.

1028
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:39,632
It doesn't take skills.

1029
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:42,802
It doesn't take creativity.

1030
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:45,941
It doesn't take a
fucking functional brain.

1031
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:51,510
All you have to do is
think of three things.

1032
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:53,512
Three, three little things

1033
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:57,782
that can make someone say yes.

1034
00:59:57,784 --> 00:59:59,952
And you get them in the
habit of saying yes.

1035
00:59:59,954 --> 01:00:03,389
Like for example, is
Dan a fucking idiot?

1036
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,657
Yes.

1037
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:08,494
Is Dan a
piece-of-shit-motherfucking-lowe

1038
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,195
fucking-cocksucker liar?

1039
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:11,463
Yes.

1040
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:13,199
Is Dan the worst salesman

1041
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:16,168
in the history of
motherfucking history?

1042
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,369
Well, you guys probably
don't know the answer

1043
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:18,336
to this question but
I'm gonna lead you

1044
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:20,238
in the right direction, okay?

1045
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,008
Follow me, the
Wasserman account.

1046
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,376
I had that lead first, right?

1047
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:25,577
We can agree on that.

1048
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:26,845
- That's right.
- I took a run at it

1049
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:29,014
and nothing clicked, so
then I left the company

1050
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:32,851
and did Rob give it to you, Dan?

1051
01:00:32,853 --> 01:00:33,722
Fuck no.

1052
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:37,356
Rob wouldn't give you a fucking
lead with fucking shit, man.

1053
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,492
You fucking choke on fucking
water, you fucking simp!

1054
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:44,695
[ominous music softly building]

1055
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:46,701
No, Rob gave it
to, remember Rubin?

1056
01:00:47,902 --> 01:00:51,269
And then he gave it to,
I think it was Scott.

1057
01:00:51,271 --> 01:00:53,371
And then every
motherfucking hand

1058
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:56,541
in that motherfucking company
touched that motherfucker.

1059
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:58,879
So then, Rob give it to Dan.

1060
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:02,414
What could go wrong?

1061
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,950
I mean, I've already, I don't
have any expectations here.

1062
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,552
So you got your

my tools to get in

1065

and you're luckier than a
fucking dog with two dicks.

1066

You're lucky because
Wasserman came in when he did.

- Yeah,

01:01:35,748 --> 01:01:37,249

fucking salesman

1077
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:39,751
in the history of fucking
salesman salesman sales,

1078
01:01:39,753 --> 01:01:41,586
are you a bad fucking salesman?

1079
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:43,289
Yes, you are.

1080
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:46,124
I stomach you
because I like Pia.

1081
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:47,159
And for the life of
me, I can't figure out

1082
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,994

1083
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:50,829
Are you a hostage?

1084
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,430
Tell me right now.

1085
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:54,733
Blink twice for yes and once
for no, just fucking blink.

1086
01:01:54,735 --> 01:01:58,940
I mean, literally, what do
you fucking see in this guy?

1088

I'm so sorry.

1089

Well, you said it yourself.

1090
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:40,547
He's 1000 times more obnoxious.

1091
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,784
So he had it coming?

1092

You think what he
did makes you even?

1093

1095
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:54,559
I know he can
be a lot sometimes

1096

1099

He drove all the
way out here for you

1100

can't you see that?

No.

You wanna talk about it?

1109
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:32,332
I don't.

Normally, I'm an open
book, but I just,

1111
01:03:38,072 --> 01:03:39,572
I can't do this right now.

1112
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:40,407
Obviously not.

Or do I look like someone
who's life is about to be over?

Do you know what kind of jobs
aging soap actresses get?

Trick question,
they don't get any.

1124

In that weekend,

1125
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,220
the network randomly decided
to make me the mother

1126

of a 16-year-old.

1127
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:34,996

I don't want to
be anyone's mother.

You're not.

I am.

1132
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:48,907
And overnight I'm 16 years older

1133

with a life I never wanted.

1134
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:54,181
And you made me celebrate it.

1135
01:05:02,322 --> 01:05:06,994
When I look at that picture
I see the beginning of us.

1136

I don't see this.

1137

You didn't like what I did for
a living and I quit my job.

1141
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:40,191
You didn't like who
I was as a person.

1142

you wrote the other one.

01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:14,447
Is that good or bad?

1166
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:19,453
It's honest.

May I?

01:08:22,323 --> 01:08:23,391
Oh, please.

Hmm, it's good.

What, the script or the?

1171
01:08:38,005 --> 01:08:40,975
Okay, so, what
does Jacques want?

1172
01:08:43,176 --> 01:08:46,146
The money, the girl,
or to get away?

1173
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,348
Well, one doesn't work
without the other, so.

1174
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,217
That's not true.

1175
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:54,852
If that's really what he wants,

1176
01:08:54,854 --> 01:08:56,156
he's in a pickle.

1177
01:08:57,257 --> 01:08:59,090
What, it's not
the way to say it?

1178

No, it is, it's, go on.

1179
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:04,865
Okay, so the
police surrounds him

1180
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,067
and he's got the money.

1181
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:10,369
But if he takes it,
he loses the girl

1182
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:12,871
because she doesn't
like stealing.

1183
01:09:12,873 --> 01:09:16,208
But in your setup he needs
the money, always has.

1184

Yes.

And there, the
girl comes along

and he really wants
her bad, infatuation?

1187

It's more than
infatuation, I think.

Okay, so for me, it's clear.

01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,238

01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,303
You are who you were today.

1238
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,736
The same little guy with a,

1239
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:08,772
with a sensitive
stomach and dull fangs?

1240
01:13:08,774 --> 01:13:10,577
You said it, not me.

1241
01:13:23,657 --> 01:13:27,328
[soft haunting piano music]

1242
01:13:49,615 --> 01:13:53,653

[birds softly chirping]

1245
01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:10,564
You guys up?

1246
01:15:11,797 --> 01:15:12,966
He's still sleeping.

1247
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:16,268
I'm gonna go for a run.

1248
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,535
You wanna join?

1249
01:15:17,537 --> 01:15:19,740
God no, I don't run
unless I'm being chased.

1250
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:24,409
I don't think he will
be up for breakfast.

1251
01:15:24,411 --> 01:15:25,246
Copy that.

1252
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:00,114
Surprised you're up.

1253
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:03,080
Yeah, me too.

1254
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:04,581
Did you make coffee?

1255
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,416
I did.

1256
01:16:05,418 --> 01:16:06,784
Oh, oh, you got it?

1257
01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:08,255
- Yep.
- Thank you.

1258
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:11,958
Hey, you seen Pia?

1259
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:13,961
She went for a run.

1260
01:16:17,497 --> 01:16:18,331
Dougie?

1261
01:16:19,298 --> 01:16:20,134
No.

1262
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,009
He came to bed last
night though, right?

1263
01:16:35,314 --> 01:16:36,149
Hey,

1264
01:16:37,783 --> 01:16:39,286
Are you guys okay?

1265
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:42,389
Not sure.

1266
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,167
[soft ominous music]

1267
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,271
Hey. [Douglas
loudly breathing]

1268
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:34,707
I've been coming up
here for all these years

1269
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,344
and I've never seen this
before, it's crazy, huh?

1270
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:45,415
I think I know how it
ends now, my story.

1271
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:46,518
Yeah?

1272
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,384
- Yeah.
- You've written it?

1273
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:48,786
No.

1274
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:50,722
So how do you know?

1275
01:17:50,724 --> 01:17:53,092
Things don't always go
the way we want, Douglas.

1276
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,027
Yeah, I'm picking
up this subtexty vibe

1277
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:57,428
that I'm hoping is
just that, a vibe.

1278
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,396
[Pia softly mumbles in French]

1279
01:17:58,398 --> 01:17:59,597
Hey wait, wait, wait, wait!

1280
01:17:59,599 --> 01:18:01,031
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait wait.

1281
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,700
I mean, can we both agree

1282
01:18:02,702 --> 01:18:04,201
that I'm walking
off a cliff here?

1283
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:06,470
Like Wile E. Coyote and I'm
looking down at the same time?

1284
01:18:06,472 --> 01:18:08,240
No one asked you
to do that, Douglas.

1285
01:18:08,242 --> 01:18:09,641
He's, that advice!

1286
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,110
I mean, you came on...

1287
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:14,446
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm scared, Pia.

1288
01:18:14,448 --> 01:18:16,982
Like I don't, I'm afraid
to do anything about this.

1289
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:19,416
About, about
anything in general.

1290
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:21,419
So I do nothing, I
don't do anything.

1291
01:18:21,421 --> 01:18:23,554
I just, that's probably
why I don't do anything.

1292
01:18:23,556 --> 01:18:26,157
I just, I just
don't do anything.

1293
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,326
You know, life has a way of
kicking your fucking teeth

1294
01:18:29,328 --> 01:18:30,829
down your throat,
you know what I mean?

1295
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,563
You don't know which way
is up or down or sideways.

1296
01:18:32,565 --> 01:18:33,763
So you don't do nothing.

1297
01:18:33,765 --> 01:18:35,266
You just sit there,
you don't do nothing.

1298
01:18:35,268 --> 01:18:37,101
You get to feel okay though,
that whatever life gives you,

1299
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:38,402
you just, you just accept it.

1300
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:40,737
I mean, I haven't been doing,

1301
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:41,938
haven't been doing,
I've been doing nothing

1302
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,776
since I left Barossa
since I met Veronica.

1303
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:45,809
But then you, you showed me.

1304
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:46,644
I didn't.

1305
01:18:46,646 --> 01:18:47,911
You showed me.

1306
01:18:47,913 --> 01:18:49,781
It was about the
story, Douglas.

1307
01:18:49,783 --> 01:18:50,918
It was about me.

1308
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:54,852
The first time in a very,
very, very long time,

1309
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:57,021
I am going to take
control of my life

1310
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,025
and I'm gonna let,

1311
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:00,758
I'm gonna hold the reigns

1312
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,326
and I'm choosing
what happens to me.

1313
01:19:03,328 --> 01:19:04,195
What happens next.

1314
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,295
Yeah?

1315
01:19:05,297 --> 01:19:08,266
So tell me, what happened next?

1316
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:11,001
You, I don't care
about stability.

1317
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:12,603
I don't care if we
get away with it.

1318
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:15,639
Fuck Dan, fuck Veronica.

1319
01:19:15,641 --> 01:19:17,107
Whatever happens happens.

1320
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:19,643
As long as you're
with me, I just,

1321
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:22,879
I don't care what happens next.

1322
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:23,716
I don't.

1323
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:25,853
You're my wanton want.

1324
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,455
[Dan] Dougie!

1325
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:32,192
[Veronica] Douglas!

1326

[soft ominous music]

1327
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,733
Stop pursuing, Douglas.

1328
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:44,335
Us, or this, or you?

1329
01:19:44,337 --> 01:19:45,639
Don't you want this?

1330
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:48,207
Don't you want this?

1331
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:54,012
You know you want this.

[Pia softly screams]

1334
01:20:00,052 --> 01:20:00,887
Shut up.

[Pia loudly screaming]

1336

What the fuck?

1337
01:20:11,864 --> 01:20:13,831
What the fuck?

1338
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:16,500
[Veronica loudly screams]

1339
01:20:16,502 --> 01:20:18,871
Fucker, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

1340
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:24,175
You said you haven't
been coming, brother.

1341
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:25,343
And don't you dare fucking
look at me like that.

1342
01:20:25,345 --> 01:20:26,678
You let that
fucking shit in you!

1343
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,545
Let him stick his shitty
fucking dick in you!

1344
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:30,848
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1345
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,083
He told me, he told me.

1346
01:20:32,085 --> 01:20:35,352
He told me that when he
was on the couch, drunk.

1347
01:20:35,354 --> 01:20:37,120
"I'm such a good
friend, Douglas.

1348
01:20:37,122 --> 01:20:38,388
"I'm sorry for
fucking your wife,"

1349
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,257
like you're still
fucking Pauline.

1350
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:40,224
What do you want, man?

1351
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:41,893
I'm not fucking your wife!

1352
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:43,897
[Pia] But you're
still fucking Gary's?

1353
01:20:45,564 --> 01:20:46,897
Pia, Pia, Pia, wait-

1354
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:48,402
- Sorry.
- Pia, Pia?

1355
01:20:51,537 --> 01:20:52,305
It's true.

1356
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:08,387
You are right, I
am not Kendall James,

1357
01:21:10,122 --> 01:21:14,560
because this, all of this would
have never happened to her.

1358
01:21:16,762 --> 01:21:17,997
I mean, if it did...

1359
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:25,936
But Dan said that-

1360
01:21:25,938 --> 01:21:28,609
- I don't give a
fuck what Dan said!

1361
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:33,113
I didn't deserve this!

1362
01:21:34,113 --> 01:21:35,781
You are a fucking child!

1363
01:21:45,524 --> 01:21:46,859
Was it worth it?

1364
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:48,961
All this?

1365
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:51,797
Look at me.

1366
01:21:59,139 --> 01:22:00,537
Say it.

1367
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:04,776
- Say, "Yes, she was worth it."
- Absolutely.

1368
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:06,012
Every goddam second.

1369
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:11,885
Thank you.

1370
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,389
I wish you the worst.

1371
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,025

How about to Grapevine?

1376
01:22:54,694 --> 01:22:56,494
What if I make it
to Bakersfield?

1377
01:22:56,496 --> 01:22:59,429
So if I get to Bakersfield,
you can get me?

1378
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:00,266
No?

1379
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:03,366
You know, there's a
bus in a couple days.

1380

Just forget about it and I
cannot thank you for this.

Hey, it's me again.

I'll just take the loan
ride, yeah, I'll pay for it.

1385
01:23:27,894 --> 01:23:29,229
Okay, great, thanks.

1387
01:23:34,065 --> 01:23:35,568
I'll be downstairs, okay, bye.

And yet, here we are.

Belt did I have that last?

[lightly knocking at door]

1413
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:07,980
Pia.

1414
01:27:16,822 --> 01:27:18,254
Pia, I'm so sorry-

1415
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:20,426
- Finish that sentence
and I'm out of here.

1416
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:40,844
Did you like what I-

1417
01:27:40,846 --> 01:27:41,680
- Did you care?

1418
01:27:43,283 --> 01:27:45,449
Of course I, yeah.

1419
01:27:45,451 --> 01:27:46,286
No, I...

1420
01:27:47,953 --> 01:27:50,657
Dan has the same pitiful
look when he looks at me.

1421
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:54,895
The shame of knowing
that I know who you are.

1422
01:27:56,328 --> 01:27:58,631
That makes my pussy
dry, Douglas.

1423
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:07,340
I just wanna see
if you're real.

1424
01:28:08,341 --> 01:28:09,476
- Am I?
- Yeah

1425
01:28:13,813 --> 01:28:16,650
[speaking French]

1426
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:34,900
A sensitive stomach
and dull fangs?

1427
01:28:36,902 --> 01:28:39,739
[speaking French]

1428
01:29:01,293 --> 01:29:03,863
I can't fix the man
you've become, Douglas.

1429
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:06,899
Only you can.

1430
01:29:09,902 --> 01:29:12,639
[speaking French]

1431
01:29:15,373 --> 01:29:16,576
"I'm sorry, Pia."

1432
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:20,313
Yeah, you're sorry?

1433
01:29:22,247 --> 01:29:25,085
[speaking French]

1434
01:29:28,253 --> 01:29:30,590
You didn't happen
to me, Douglas.

1435
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:34,590
I happened to you.

1436
01:29:34,592 --> 01:29:37,430
[speaking French]

1437
01:29:46,072 --> 01:29:46,905
Yeah.

1438
01:29:48,173 --> 01:29:50,643
Sensitive stomach
and dull fangs.

1439
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:59,119
[speaking in French]

1440
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:21,373
I don't understand
a word you just said.

1441
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,942
If you stop the story here,

1442
01:30:24,944 --> 01:30:28,148
you have your happy
Hollywood ending, Douglas.
