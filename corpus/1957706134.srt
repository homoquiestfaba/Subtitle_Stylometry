- You must be tired after
that trip from New York.

17
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:31,067
Go on and shower, set
yourself up in Michael's room.

18
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,900
Then, maybe you could take
a look around town, okay?

It's getting hot out there,

22
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,067
- Well now Mr. Sequan,
what grade you say you in?

23
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,400
- My old school

same team with Michael.

28
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,967
- Everybody round here is so
proud of Michael. (chuckles)

29
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,367
He is star forward on the

00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,867
Get a lot of scholarship

31

35
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,767
Ahmed can get through some
defense though, I tell you that.

36
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,700
You wanna make an
impression around here,

37

* Never thought

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,800
- My crib, my rules, understand?

49
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Look at me when I'm

Which is why it pains
me when you fail.

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Is there anything missing?

182
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,633
- I kept a .45 in the car.

183
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,800
- You had a gun in here?

184
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,867
- [Mr. Lemmings] Yes.

185
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,933
- Was it loaded?

186
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,867
- Well there's no
point keeping an

187
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,233
unloaded gun in
the car is there?

188
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,333
- So is that gun registered?

189
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,467
- [Mr. Lemmings] Yes of course.

190
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,733
- To you.

191
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,067
- Yes, now what kind
of question is that?

192
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,433
- I'm just trying to get
everything out of the way.

193
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,733
- Look I had lead work.

194
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,533
The damn car wouldn't start
when I was ready to leave.

195
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,433
- You were working alone?

196
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,367
- No, Ms. Stewart my
secretary was with me too.

197
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,867
- Where is she, can
I talk to her?

198
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,833
* To live for *

199
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,900
* You've got to be holy *

200
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,867
* To live for *

201
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,100
* If you want to see God *

202
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
* If you want to see God *

203
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,133
(loud smacking)

204
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,833
* Take me to the water *

205
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,167
* Take me to the water *

206
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,133
- What field nigga!

207
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,400
* Take mem to the water *

208
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
- That's what I thought.

209
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,933
* My sin go down in the water *

210
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:22,500
* Take me to the water *

211
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,833
- [Celeste] Thank you LuEllen.

212
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,500
- You're welcome Ms. Celeste.

213
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,333
You done Ms. Lori?

214
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,300
- [Lori] Yeah.

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,500
- [LuEllen] Thank you.

216
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,400
- [Celeste] Sit up Lori.

217
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,333
I don't understand
why you always

218
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,300
look so haggard in the mornings.

219
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,833
Why don't you just try
and be a young lady?

220
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,633
(laughing)

221
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:54,967
- [LuEllen] Should
I prepare supper

222
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,633
for three this evening ma'am?

223
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,333
- Don't count on me, I
got stuff I got to do.

224
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,300
- [Celeste] Jake?

225
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,833
- Yes ma'am.

226
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,367
- [Lori] I gotta go.

227
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,267
- I guess it'd be for two then.

228
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,467
- [LuEllen] Thank you.

229
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,333
- [Sheriff] So what
time did you leave?

230
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,133
I'm asking you Mrs. Stewart.

231
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:27,600
- 11.

232
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,733
- Did you see anything?

233
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,400
- 11:30, no it was all quiet.

234
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,967
Mr. Lemmings just needed
a ride to the station.

235
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,800
- Right.

236
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,100
- [Mr. Lemmings] Do y'all
want to get to class please,

237
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,467
this doesn't concern you.

238
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:49,433
- Mrs. Stewart, you sure
you didn't hear anything?

239
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,467
- Sheriff King I, I just
drove Mr. Lemmings home.

240
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,733
(students chattering)

241
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:02,533
- Thank you.

242
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,900
- Who can give me
the title of a book

243
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
by Mr. William Faulkner?

244
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,067
Mr. Robins.

245
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,167
- [Ahmed] Excuse me?

246
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:22,967
- Ms. Anderson.

247
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,067
Mr. Greene, school
seems to think you ought

248
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,933
to be in 12th grade
English, how 'bout you?

249
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,733
- Absalom, Absalom!

250
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,867
- [Teacher] Very good.

251
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:35,800
- As I Lay Dying.

252
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,333
- Very good.

253
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,367
- Light In August.

254
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,667
- Very good.

255
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,600
- But Mr. Faulkner, he
once told this reporter

256
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,567
that if there was ever a race
war, you know hypothetically,

257
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,733
that he wouldn't hesitate
going out into the street

258
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:52,933
and shooting Negroes
if he had to.

259
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,567
But James Baldwin, a
writer like Mr. Faulkner,

260
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,400
only he was black, he
said that Faulkner

261
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,767
represented the problem
with all liberal whites

262
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:04,300
and basically most white people.

263
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,833
Mr. Baldwin said that
they were so quick to talk

264
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,367
about honor and dignity, but
at the same time didn't see

265
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,967
the inherent dishonor and
indignity of legalized
oppression.

266
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,767
- A little history
lesson from Dr. Greene.

267
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,733
Thank you very much.

268
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,100
(knocking on door)

269
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,800
Mr. Greene you have a visitor.

270
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,167
- Mmm, uh you doing all right?

271
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I mean everything
okay at LuEllen's?

272
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,800
- It's all right.

273
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:54,967
- That's good.

274
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,667
So nobody here giving
you any trouble are they?

275
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,667
You've got big, I mean you
look just like your father.

276
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,800
Damn near scared me
to death. (laughs)

277
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,067
Yeah, I'm gonna give
you one of my cards.

278
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
And that is my office and
cell on the front there.

279
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,433
And I'm gonna put my
home number on the back.

280
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,167
Uncle Charles. (laughs)

281
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,667
If you can read that, it's
kind of chicken scratch

282
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,067
but my wife always makes it so.

283
00:18:43,067 --> 00:18:43,933
So I'm gonna go.

284
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,533
You should get back in there.

285
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,200
Sequan, I was really
sorry to hear about-

286
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,133
- It's all right.

287
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
(loud snorting)
(students chattering)

288
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,533
- [Students] Ooh!

289
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
- Charity mind yo

290
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,400
You want to tell me
what happened to you?

291
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
- Nothing.

292
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,467
- Mm-hmm(affirmative), and you

293
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,767
couldn't do nothing to help him.

294
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,600
- I wasn't there.

295
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,000
- Michael I barely

296
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,267

- [LuEllen] Y'all be good.

301
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,167
(door slamming)

302
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,433
* Two, fours get

00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,100
- You like that shit huh?

314
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,433
You like falling in

315
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,233

- Sequan, Sequan!

350
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,267
Mama and Michael left already.

351
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,467
You want to take me to school?

352
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:28,833
(ominous music)
(water running)

353
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,567
- [Teacher] Now all of the
books that you have read

354
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,733
this semester, or was
supposed to read,

355
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,100
discussed themes of
the abusive power.

356
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,200
And how that is destructive
over those who--

357
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,067
- Hey Sequan, hey.

358
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,167
- Oh shit yo, yo money
is peeing his pants.

359
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:17,067
- Oh, Malcolm X got
a bladder problem.

360
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:20,333
(students laughing and joking)

361
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,067
- You better get the ark
man, the flood is coming.

362
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:25,267
(ominous music)
(students laughing)

363
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
(dryer roaring)

364
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,833
(knocking on door)

365
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,233
- Are you okay in there?

366
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,133
Your pants is dry.

367
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,067
It's no big deal you know.

368
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,633
Nothing I ain't seen before.

369
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,900
Hey.

370
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm Ahmed's girlfriend Lori.

371
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,867
Well you look okay now.

372
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,433
I'm gonna go back to class.

373
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,433
- [Sheriff] Sequan,

374
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,533
what happened to you?

375
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:15,600
- I fell down.

376
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,667
- Off of what, Mount
Jefferson. (chuckles)

377
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:24,867
What you got there?

378
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,567
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

379
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,933
You should come by the
house for dinner.

380
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:37,567
- Okay.

381
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:48,300
- Did you need a ride somewhere?

382
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,967
- No I'm good.

383
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,833
(ball bouncing)

384
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,433
- [Kid] What's up.

385
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,933
(ball bouncing)

386
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:19,367
- [Kid] Oh.

387
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,400
(ball bouncing)

388
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:28,233
(boy groaning)

389
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,333
- [Michael] Yeah, it's not mine.

390
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,267
It's over.

391
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:33,367
- [Ahmed] All right,
all right, all right.

392
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,100
- [Michael] Hey good game man.

393
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:42,067
- Robins, Willis,
get in my office.

394
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,433
- [Ahmed] All right coach.

395
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:03,967
- So you boys have any
answers for me or what?

396
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:08,867
- I ain't gone do it.

397
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,700
- [Coach] Why not?

398
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,967
- What I need to go
to college for Coach?

399
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,667
I ain't getting in no
NBA, I ain't no Ray Allen.

400
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,667
- [Coach] Ray Allen
ain't nothing but a name.

401
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,300
You don't have to be as good.

402
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,933
- I got everything
I need right here.

403
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,233
- Look, you're good enough to
get a scholarship into school.

404
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,233
Why turn that down?

405
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:33,700
And what about you?

406
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,767
- I don't know yet, my mom
wants me to go to Temple-

407
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,767
- Well you need to make
a decision soon boy.

408
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,367
Those people ain't gone
wait on you forever.

409
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,567
(Michael sighing heavily)

410
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:49,533
Now get outta here.

411
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,433
(knocking loudly on door)

412
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,600
- Charles.

413
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
You've been here over a year
and you're finally stopping in.

414
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,833
- I need to talk to Michael.

415
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,267
- For what?

416
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,067
- It's about what
happened at the school.

417
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:27,933
You know a gun was stolen.

418
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,467
- I know you bought
that big 'ol house

419
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,367
and now you and your
wife think that you-

420
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,967
- LuEllen, LuEllen, LuEllen.

421
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,433
What happened with you and
Martin, it wasn't right.

422
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,433
But I'm not him all right.

423
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,067
I have my own family,
I have my own worries.

424
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,867
- Yeah I know, everybody got
their own separate business.

425
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:49,500
- Is he in there?

426
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,567
Don't lie to me.

427
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,633
- You think I'm scared of you?

428
00:29:57,633 --> 00:29:58,900
I ain't got to lie
about shit nigga!

429
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,300
- Are you.

430
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,667
Do you know where the gun is?

431
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,500
Do you know where the gun is?

432
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,800
- I don't know nothing.

433
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,533
- Why is your cousin
all busted up?

434
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:41,667
- He fell.

435
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,333
- Yeah, that's what I heard.

436
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:50,700
He got some new
lumps, what is he

437
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,567
falling every day or something?

438
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,600
You okay Michael?

439
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,933
- Don't nobody care
about that faggot.

440
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,233
- [Charles] You need to
keep an eye on your boy.

441
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,167
- Ain't nothing
wrong with my boy.

442
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,467
He gone get a scholarship,
then we get to see

443
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:33,133
who's really doing
good in this family.

444
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,533
- The boy is hurt.

445
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:36,067
- We don't need your help.

446
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,800
- Look, it's not
your fault okay,

447
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,967
Martin had a lot of problems.

448
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,233
- Ain't yo wife waiting on you?

449
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,067
* Great love, white crowd *

450
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,633

451
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,067

462
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:27,167
(loud knocking on door)

463
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,267
* It's down from your A-frame *

464
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:28,733
- Hey.

465
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:32,900
Just thought I would
see how you were doing?

466
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
* Hit 'em like a freight train *

467
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,533
* You got to be
ready to maintain *

468
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,500
- You ain't in there partying?

469
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,633
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

470
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:44,400
What you reading?

471
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,633
Oh that's by that guy.

472
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,767
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

473
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,567
So this is Michael's room.

474
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,600
Which one of you is the perv?

475
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,733
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

476
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,267
About that whole peeing
thing, I just want you

477
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,133
to know it ain't no big deal.

478
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,933
In case you're embarrassed
or something.

479
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,467
* Hit 'em like a freight train *

480
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,833
* Hit 'em like a freight train *

481
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:13,833
* Hit 'em like a freight train *

482
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,067
- You remind me of my brother.

483
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:18,167
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

484
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,067
* Hit 'em like a freight train *

485
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,067
* Hit 'em like freight train *

486
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,367
- You miss New York?

487
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,967
- Yeah.

488
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:26,833
- I can see that.

489
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:29,433
Jefferson is so ...

490
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,433
You ever go to SoHo?

491
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,833
- Yeah.

492
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,700
- Really, you ever
see Tyra Banks?

493
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,167
- No.

494
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:43,933
- After America's
Next Top Model,

495
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,867
all the big models live in SoHo.

496
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,133
After they go out dancing
or whatever it is they do,

497
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:54,600
they all go on back there.

498
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,300
So next time you're there,
you should look for Tyra.

499
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,567
- [Sequan] I'll do that.

500
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:00,767
(Lori chuckles)

501
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,400
- You know, you kind of look
like one of those new top

502
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,367
models, all audi and
skinny and shit. (chuckles)

503
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:14,900
Wow, you do smile.

504
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,067
Why don't you come out and hang?

505
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:23,167
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

506
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:30,733
You're pretty cute you know.

507
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,967
- I bet you say that to
every black dude you meet.

508
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:34,500
- What?

509
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,633
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

510
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,067
Okay.

511
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:48,567
(loud hip hop music
from another room)

512
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,633
See you around,
school or something.

513
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,967
Bye.

514
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,533
* It ain't no use *

515
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,200
* The only thing you getting
from me here is abuse *

516
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,667
* Get the crowd *

517
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,300
- What the fuck you
doing in there?

518
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,967
- [Lori] Saying hi.

519
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:12,733
- You ain't got shit to
say to him, understand.

520
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,133
* Freight train *

521
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:16,567
* Crushed around great love *

522
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,433
(loud moaning)

523
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,200
* Come and take a walk with me *

524
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,267
* Feel the need to come
and talk with me *

525
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,500
* It's my time *

526
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
* I just want to get you *

527
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,833
* It's my time *

528
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,833
(both breathing heavy)

529
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:31,967
* Come and take a walk with me *

530
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,667
* You need to come
and talk to me *

531
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,267
* It's my time *

532
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,900
* And I just want
to talk to you *

533
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,067
* It's my time *

534
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,067

You can have it

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,067

577
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,700
- Okay.

578
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:53,367
- That's Stella Buchanan,
she's here about her boy.

579
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,300
- Is he in trouble or something?

580
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,367
- The boy's missing.

581
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,067
- [Teacher] Don't

582
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:06,533
- Hey.

583
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,400

Yeah, okay bye.

587
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:52,167
- Was he on drugs?

588
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,267
Was he ever in any trouble?

589
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,433
Lewis, see if we ever
brought Tim Buchanan-

590
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:05,233
- Yeah he used.

591
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:08,100
It was really bad the last
few months and he sold too.

592
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,067
- Where did he get it from?

593
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:12,867
- I don't know.

594
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:19,400
- Racine do you want
to find your brother?

595
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
- I said I don't know.

596
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:24,867
- Ms. Stella.

person's report.

00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,333
Did you ever catch Tim
Buchanan using drugs.

599
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,067
- (scoffs) No.

600
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:40,933
Thank you Alice.

601
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:49,067
- Did you ever have an
argument with the boy?

602
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,867
- Sheriff, I think I
been as respectful

603
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,467
and cooperative as I can be.

604
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,433
- I told you before I'm
just doing my job.

605
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,433
- Me too, my job is
to be here from eight

606
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,333
to three every day,
watch over these kids.

607
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,167
What they do after
that is really

608
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,800
none of my goddamn business.

609
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,500
Now won't you find out
who the delinquent

610
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,900
was that stole my pistol.

611
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,433
- I'm going to talk
to some students.

612
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,633
- Not here you're not.

613
00:40:21,967 --> 00:40:23,567
You have a nice day Sheriff.

614
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:33,867
(knocking on door)

615
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:34,733
- Just a minute.

616
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,000
Hello Sequan.

617
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,833
- [Sequan] Hello.

618
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,433
- Come on in.

619
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,533
(jazz music)

620
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:06,233
- So hey, you like it?

621
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,433
- Yes, it's very good.

622
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,433
- Don't, do me a
favor, do me a favor.

623
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,067
Don't lie to me boy, okay.

624
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,800
Don't nobody like it okay.

625
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
- I like it.

626
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,067
- No you don't like
it neither all right.

627
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,967
This Shawna is trying to
make us go vegetarian.

628
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:30,633
- I wanna detox before
we start a family.

629
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,067
- She is trying to
detox my swimmers.

630
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:35,133
(people laughing)

631
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay, you know what I'm
saying, my swimmers boy.

632
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,667
(people laughing)

633
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,133
You know.

634
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,633
- It is not all that funny,

635
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,567
- It's funny enough but
I love you anyway.

636
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,767
- Aww, I love you too.

637
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,267
- So my man Quannie.

638
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,833
I hear that you won a
writing contest last year.

639
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,433
- Yeah.

640
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,600
- You what you should do, you
should show Shawna your work.

641
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,667
- [Sequan] Oh really.

642
00:41:58,667 --> 00:41:59,900
- Mm-hmm(affirmative).
- Why?

643
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,833
- She's a big time
published writer boy.

644
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,767
- For real?

645
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,467
- I don't know about big time,

646
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:08,233
but I write children's books.

647
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:11,067
You ever heard of Little
Latisha Langston.

648
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,333
- You write the Little
Latisha Langston books?

649
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:13,900
- [Shawna] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

650
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,067
- You BJ Putnam?

651
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,633
- [Charles] Mm-hmm(affirmative).

652
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,867
He has heard of you,
you are big time.

653
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:19,267
- Oh hush.

654
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,967
- I used to babysit for
my next door neighbor,

655
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,167
he daughter had all your books.

656
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,300
- Oh you must mean
literally, I haven't

657
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,800
sold that many. (chuckles)

658
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,267
- Oh now you hush.

659
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,867
She's modest about her work,

660
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,967
but proud of this
food go figure.

661
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,667
(everyone laughing)

662
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,400
Calling her mother, telling
her how much weight I lost.

663
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,100
Look at me man, I'ma
buck 10 with silk

664
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,400
and wet with bricks
in my pocket.

665
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,667
(Shawna laughing)

666
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,867
- So is it true, did you
really beat up my father?

667
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,133
- Yeah I did.

668
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,933
I'm sorry 'bout that.

669
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:10,367
- I don't even remember
him that much.

670
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,100
- Well you know what, that's
probably for the best.

671
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,367
Your mother and I used
to be real tight.

672
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:20,267
She moved to New York
because I was up there.

673
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:24,267
I bet you didn't
know I named you.

674
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:27,100
Yeah, that's what gives me
the right to call you Quannie.

675
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,067
- Yeah, about that.

676
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,400
- [Charles] What
you don't like it.

677
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,333
- Yeah, it's dope.

678
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,667
- You damn right it is.

679
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:48,233
- Uncle Charles.

680
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,400
Can I live with you and Shawna?

681
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,833
- Sequan that's
kind of tough okay.

682
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:11,967
I'm kind of new here myself.

683
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,900
I got all this town business
and you know Shawna's

684
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,767
always on a deadline
or something.

685
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:20,767
LuEllen's good people.

686
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,400
Your mom wanted it that way.

687
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
So we'll do it for
your mother, hmm.

688
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,100
Happy to have you here though.

689
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,100
(somber music)

690
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,833
- So what type of name
is Sequan anyway?

691
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:28,900
- Muslim.

692
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:33,900
- You're not Al-Qaeda are you?

693
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,267
- No.

694
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:37,133
- Are you Muslim?

695
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,233
- No, nothing really.

696
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:45,267
Went to Catholic school,
ain't Catholic though.

697
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:48,267
- Don't know any Muslims,
don't know any Catholics,

698
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:50,967
just regular old every
day Christians.

699
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:53,067
(somber music)

700
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:26,667
It was built a long time ago,

701
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,900
supposedly so they could
spot runaway slaves

702
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,600
trying to get out
across the river.

703
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,933
- That's handy to know.

704
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,500
- Oh and just so you know,
it's also a big makeout spot.

705
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,400
- A makeout spot for
runaway slaves.

706
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,333
(both chuckle)

707
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:41,800
- No.

708
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,067
Sometimes I think if I
jumped hard enough,

709
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:53,400
I could make it out
clear across that river.

710
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,400
- Mm-hmm(affirmative).

711
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,467
(somber music)

712
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,767
- Me and Med are
thinking 'bout eloping.

713
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:10,567
But we haven't told our
parents or anything yet.

714
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:12,900
- Isn't that what eloping is.

715
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
- All right, so
don't say anything.

716
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:17,867
- I won't.

717
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,500
(Sequan coughing)
(Lori laughing)

718
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,533
Oh my God, what is this stuff?

719
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:33,433
- It's what you call your
white lightening. (laughs)

720
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,067
Go Sequan, go Sequan. (laughs)

721
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,300
- You like black dudes.

722
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
(Lori laughing)

723
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,633
- I don't know, I guess.

724
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,567
Do you like black dudes?

725
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:07,500
- Yeah, hells yes.

726
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:10,367
I love black dudes.

727
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:17,800
- You're gay.

728
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:23,667
- Yeah, I am.

729
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:31,233
What?

730
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,567
- It's just, to hear
you admit that.

731
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:39,167
Even after they beat you up.

732
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,367
We don't get much of
that around here.

733
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:47,100
Nobody wants to stand
out for being different.

734
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,100
Oh my god, how'd she die?

735
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:00,067
- It was a fire in the
building we lived in.

736
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,467
They used oil paint
in the hallways.

737
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,700
Smokes up and burns,
you can't breathe.

738
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,067
And she got caught.

739
00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:10,533
- Oh Jesus.

740
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,333
- It was nothing I could do.

741
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:18,067
Even if I was there.

742
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,633
- Shit, check and see if I have
any cancer sticks in there.

743
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:39,367
- Thanks.

744
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:47,833
What'd you get?

745
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,600
Well nice, funny or scary?

746
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:54,733
- Both.

747
00:49:57,867 --> 00:50:02,000
- Thanks, no one ever gave
me a book like this before.

748
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,300
I don't got nothing for you.

749
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,233
- Hello, the tour.

750
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,667
- See you around.

751
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:09,133
- Bye.

752
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:26,533
- Whoa, damn you boy.

753
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh it figures.

754
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:35,733
Took me 35 years, 35
to get a membership

755
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,600
in this club and some kid
comes along and whips my ass.

756
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,700
- [Charles] Sorry sir.

757
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,833
- Hey no formalities needed
during morning tee time.

758
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:48,300
When are you gonna use the
name that my mama gave me?

759
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,433
- Now you know just 'cause
they still doing the grass

760
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:51,867
don't mean that you
ain't still the mayor.

761
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,733
- That's true, but call me Sam.

762
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,667
Yeah.

763
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:08,733
I told you campaign signs
were a waste of money.

764
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,700
You're running unopposed.

765
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:15,200
- [Charles] I'm just
trying to do it right.

766
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:15,967
- Nonsense son.

767
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:22,467
Sheriff Thompson
died, county council

768
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:24,867
named you interim sheriff.

769
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:28,133
That means that you're
sheriff until you die or quit.

770
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:30,067
Don't nobody want
to run for that.

771
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,067
Besides, they named
you for a reason.

772
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,733
They coulda gone with Lewis.

773
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,667
But Jefferson's a
black county now.

774
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,267
- [Charles] Right.

775
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:54,367
About the school, I need
to talk to some students.

776
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,533
- What, Lemmings giving
you a hard time.

777
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,067
- Yeah.

778
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:02,600
- I'll talk to him.

779
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:05,100
He owes me a few.

780
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:07,367
- Thank you.

781
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,467
- [Mayor] To Jefferson.

782
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,567
- That is not a
book in your hands.

783
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,767
- A boy gave it to me.

784
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,267
- You know a boy who reads?

785
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:53,500
- [Teacher] As we
look at these books,

786
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,333
we will explore mood,
tone, theme, and character.

787
00:53:01,267 --> 00:53:04,133
And you will compare
and contrast

788
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:07,133
each of these
elements in an essay,

789
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:09,867
which will be used as
part of your final exam.

790
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:13,400
- Let me see.

791
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,200
There's a grim secret
hidden in the fact

792
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,733
that so many people
won't halt the rescue.

793
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,900
Could not be rescued, but yet

794
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,767
a prisoner of their color
had become a hiding place.

795
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:31,200
(laughs) Hiding place. (laughs)

796
00:53:34,267 --> 00:53:35,833
What kind of faggot
nigga wrote this shit?

797
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,600
What, you want it?

798
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,800
- Ahmed.

799
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,533
(laughs)

800
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:44,200
What the fuck, I'm getting
tired of your shit.

801
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,700
- Bitch you want to die?

802
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:54,200
Don't you ever talk
to me like that.

803
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,467
(students in cafeteria talking)

804
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,800
(knocking on door)

805
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,667
- Hi Lori, is everything
all right, is your mom okay?

806
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:19,700
- Yeah Lu she's fine.

807
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,467
Is Sequan home?

808
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:29,200
- [LuEllen] Sequan,
you have a visitor.

809
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,533
(somber music)
(loud sniffing)

810
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:47,067
* Riding folks around
just to find *

811
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:49,667
* They going just to con *

812
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:53,833
- [Lori] You know
what time it is?

813
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,733
- 8:30.

814
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,333
- Fuck it, come on let's go.

815
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,533
(fireworks exploding)

816
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,367
(people talking at carnival)

817
00:55:07,367 --> 00:55:10,567
(bell ringing)

818
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:11,200
- Winner number
four, the bear goes

819
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
to the big one right there.

820
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,233
(Sequan and Lori yelling)

821
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,633
(upbeat rock music)

822
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,933
(Sequan coughing)
(Lori laughing)

823
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:52,333
- Hold it.

824
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:00,067
Okay, now let it go.

825
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,867
Yeah, good.

826
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,333
- I think I'm feeling it.

827
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,533
(Lori laughing)

828
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:16,100
You think I'm pretty?

829
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,600
- Yeah.

830
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:30,133
- That's for you.

831
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,767
You're way too cool to be
one of my boyfriends anyway.

832
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,567
- When was the first time you.

833
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,567
- Please I've been
fucking since I was 13.

834
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:54,267
- There's girls at home
pregnant at that age.

835
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:58,433
- Not me, no way, I don't
never want to have no kids.

836
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,700
I mean, if I had me,
I wouldn't want me.

837
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:06,333
- What's that?

838
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
- This is for the
big girls sweetie.

839
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,367
- Where the fuck were you?

840
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:42,333
You don't know how to
use the fucking phone?

841
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:42,800
Idiot.

842
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:47,967
- Who are you?

843
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,300
- Sequan, who are you?

844
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,267
- Jake, I'm her brother.

845
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:54,633
What the hell were
you guys doing?

846
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:57,067
- I wasn't doing anything.

847
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:59,633
That girl doesn't know
when enough is enough.

848
00:58:02,633 --> 00:58:04,700
- [Lori] Come on
couple of assholes.

849
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:10,467
- [Jake] So you're the new guy?

850
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:11,633
- [Sequan] No I'm
not the new guy,

851
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:12,700
we're just friends.

852
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,367
- He's not any of that.

853
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,600
Why ask a stupid questions.

854
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,367
I need to lay down for a minute.

855
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,567
(body thudding)

856
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,667
- [Jake] Why did you
let her do so much?

857
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,100
- [Sequan] You're the
one who showed up late.

858
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:28,067
- I hate it when
she's like this.

859
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:35,100
- [Sequan] Can you drive?

860
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,200
- [Jake] Not legally.

861
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:40,967
(loud crashing)

862
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,900
- Come on give me a break
with that shit already.

863
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:48,967
- So, you give Lori that book?

864
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:49,467
- Yeah.

865
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:52,467
- I like Baldwin too.

866
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:59,067
I do, I've been trying to get
her to read him for years.

867
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,633
Hell I've been trying to
get her to read anything.

868
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:01,433
What'd you say?

869
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:07,567
- I didn't say anything,
I just gave her the book.

870
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:09,200
- Damn it.

871
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,600
- I'm sorry man.

872
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,667
- Naw, I just never
thought of that.

873
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,733
(camera beeping)

874
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,200
So.

875
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:39,667
- Well yeah, uh-huh.

876
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:40,833
- I've been.

877
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,267
- Right.

878
00:59:42,267 --> 00:59:43,200
- I love you baby.

879
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,500
Next time I'll let
you stick it in.

880
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,700
(boys laughing)

881
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,800
(boys groaning)

882
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,967
- [Sequan] Get the
fuck off of me.

883
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:24,333
- [Michael] Shut the fuck up.

884
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,700
(Michael groaning)

885
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,033
Fucker. (groaning)

886
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:36,367
Shut the fuck up bitch.

887
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:39,767
(Michael groaning)

888
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,400
Quit moving nigga.

889
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,500
Yeah, yeah boy.

890
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,433
(Sequan whimpering)

891
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:45,600
- [Sequan] Get off of me!

892
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,733
- Shut the fuck up,
get the fuck down.

893
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:12,700
- [Shawna] When are
you coming to bed?

894
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,867
- Soon.

895
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:19,500
- Nothing huh?

896
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:26,667
- Even if I had anything,
they wouldn't tell me.

897
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:33,567
- You'll get it done.

898
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,500
They still have to
follow the law Charles.

899
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,267
You're the law.

900
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:54,933
And don't stay out
here all night

901
01:01:54,933 --> 01:01:56,667
and let all this get cold now.

902
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:22,467
(phone ringing)

903
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:23,067
- Aw Shawna.

904
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:26,133
- Hello.

905
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,167
What?

906
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:31,467
Yes, where?

907
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:37,500
- Who is this?

908
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:41,700
(leaves crunching)

909
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:02,300
- Jesus.

910
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,367
- [Charles] Go back
and get the kit.

911
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,433
- [Lori] You got that
bum for me baby?

912
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:36,833
- (laughs) Hell no.

913
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:40,100
You come back later.

914
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,700
- But I just.

915
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,933
- Hey, what the fuck I just say.

916
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:50,200
Come back later huh, I can't be

917
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,233
raising my voice
when my mama home.

918
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,867
- But baby, I really need it.

919
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:02,833
- I know you do.

920
01:04:05,233 --> 01:04:07,500
Get that tricked ass
pussy out my house.

921
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,667
- I don't understand.

922
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,067
- Look Charles, son
you don't want

923
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:29,633
to go making these folks mad.

924
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:35,633
Now if they say it ain't their
kids, it ain't their kids.

925
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,900
- Yeah but Sam.

926
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,100
- And besides look,
you think that

927
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,200
they kids did something wrong?

928
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,100
You wouldn't do the right thing.

929
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,633
Come on now.

930
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:07,633
- You're in my favorite spot.

931
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,067
Come on let's go.

932
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,233
(water splashing)

933
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:39,800
- So, how come I ain't
seen you in school?

934
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,133
- Oh I go to Saint John's
Christian Academy over in
Dillon.

935
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:43,833
- And Lori goes to school here.

936
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,967
- Yep, she's been kicked
out of every school,

937
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:49,600
public or private for 40 miles.

938
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,900
A few years ago she tried
to jump off that bridge

939
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,100
but it's not too high.

940
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,867
Everyone knows anyway.

941
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,600
See, in Jefferson,
people they like

942
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,667
to pretend they don't
know but they do.

943
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:06,100
It's called being proper.

944
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,700
- Fuck proper.

945
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,367
- Fuck proper.

946
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,067
(water splashing)

947
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:14,567
You swim?

948
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:15,067
- No.

949
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,433
- You Float?

950
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,600
* Take me to the water *

951
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,300
- Oh I'm gonna drown.

952
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:38,233
* Take me to the water *

953
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:45,600
* Take me to the water *

954
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:52,067
* To be baptized *

955
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,767
* None but the righteous *

956
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,833
* None but the righteous *

957
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,500
* None but righteous *

958
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:24,367
* Shall see God yeah *

959
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:32,767
* So take me to the water *

960
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:41,867
* Take me to the water *

961
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,767
* Take me to the water *

962
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:56,400
* To be baptized *

963
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,700
* I'm going back home *

964
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:21,433
- [Sequan] Michael's
been fucking me.

965
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:25,433
- I don't get it.

966
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:31,133
- He's been beating
me up and fucking me.

967
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:34,833
- Why haven't you
told anyone Sequan?

968
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:35,767
- I'm telling you.

969
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:40,367
- Why didn't you say
anything to your uncle.

970
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:41,300
- I can't do that.

971
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,533
He already hates me 'cause
I'm a faggot anyway.

972
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:47,733
- You don't know that.

973
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,367
- Goddamn, I miss my mom.

974
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,633
- [Lori] We have got to get
the fuck out of this hell hole.

975
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:21,533
- (doorbell ringing)

976
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,933
- Sheriff King.

977
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,533
- Mrs. Stewart, Mrs.
Stewart I need your help.

978
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:37,433
- Listen I've told you
everything I know.

979
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:40,167
- I know you did.

980
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:43,233
See the thing is, in
my experience sometimes

981
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:47,067
people who say the least
have the most to offer.

982
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:49,367
- I really, I wish I could
help you, but I can't.

983
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:51,933
- Sure you can and this
isn't about Lemmings,

984
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:54,733
this is about you.

985
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,933
And yet no one is gonna
care what you two are up to.

986
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,367
But I got a dead boy now.

987
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,333
- [Mrs. Stewart] Oh I know.

988
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,800
I know Tim and I
know his parents.

989
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,200
- You know his family.

990
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,067
You know that they're hurting.

991
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:12,867
And Mrs. Stewart they
just want the truth.

992
01:10:12,867 --> 01:10:14,400
I think you know the truth.

993
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,733
- I can't be no faggot.

994
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:58,633
Look,

995
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:11,800
you think I'd make it to
college ball if I was a faggot?

996
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,467
You think the NBA wants
faggots motherfucker?

997
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:23,567
You're the faggot.

998
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,200
You're my faggot.

999
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,067
Stay away from that white boy.

1000
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:43,200
(knocking on door)

1001
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,433
- [LuEllen] What's
going on in here.

1002
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:48,067
- [Michael] Nothing Ma, what?

1003
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:55,267
- [LuEllen] Come out here
and wash these dishes.

1004
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,800
- [Michael] All right Ma.

1005
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,200
- [LuEllen] You boys
get ready for supper.

1006
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:09,533
(somber music)

1007
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,300
- [Jake] Hey.

1008
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,067
- [Sequan] Hey.

1009
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:51,867
How long you been waiting?

1010
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,467
- I don't know, didn't
really think about it.

1011
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:58,900
I come up here all the time.

1012
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,100
It's the one view of this town

1013
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,967
that makes it seem
halfway decent.

1014
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:08,500
- Where do you think
we should go?

1015
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,233
- Anywhere's better than here.

1016
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,433
- My mom took me
to Florida once.

1017
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:16,600
- Disney World?

1018
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,133
- No, Miami.

1019
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:21,067
We could go there.

1020
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,100
- Yeah, Miami could work.

1021
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:17,367
(sirens wailing)

1022
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:29,133
- Sheriff King, it's much
too early for your nonsense.

1023
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:30,467
- Look, we're here to
search the lockers

1024
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,700
of Ahmed Robins, Billy Wells,

1025
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,100
Dwayne Cornelius, Lori
Anderson, and Michael Willis.

1026
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,800
- What, what, this is ... you
are not coming in my school.

1027
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,967
- You step aside or you're
going in for obstruction, Lewis.

1028
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:42,600
- [Lewis] I'm sorry
about this sir.

1029
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,533
- [Mr Lemmings]
Would you stop it.

1030
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:57,367
- Hey Ahmed, Ahmed,
Sheriff, Sheriff.

1031
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,367
- Damn-

1032
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:03,367
- Sheriff's looking
through our lockers Med.

1033
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:04,333
- [Ahmed] Let's go.

1034
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,400
- Shit, I, I.

1035
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,500
(somber music)

1036
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:13,733
Oh i came to you first,
you did nothing.

1037
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:15,567
All of this is on you.

1038
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,067
- Sheriff King, the town
council was very clear on this.

1039
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,167
You are not to invade
our children's privacy.

1040
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,633
My daughter.

1041
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,067
- Your daughter is already
been here Mrs. Anderson.

1042
01:15:23,067 --> 01:15:24,767
This is her locker.

1043
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,567
- Well you would do
well to leave right now.

1044
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,800
- Excuse me, but you would
do well to leave right now.

1045
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,733
- Principal Lemmings, are you

1046
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:32,567
gonna let him get
away with this.

1047
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:33,267
(Mrs. Stewart yelling)

1048
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:34,767
(men yelling)

1049
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,067
- I got it Lewis.

1050
01:15:36,067 --> 01:15:37,600
You saw Tim break into your car,

1051
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,700
you saw him arguing with Ahmed.

1052
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,833
You stood there and you watched
them shoot at each other.

1053
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,667
You watched them shoot at each
other and you did nothing.

1054
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,300
You stay outta my way.

1055
01:15:54,933 --> 01:15:56,900
- [Lori] Get in, hurry up.

1056
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,833
Come on, hurry up.

1057
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:02,267
Come on.

1058
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:10,567
- This next one belongs
to Michael Willis.

1059
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,467
- You better take a
look at this one.

1060
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,133
- All right, it's 3. 5, 6, 7.

1061
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:28,300
- Go 'head.

1062
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,500
(ominous music)

1063
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:34,700
(camera beeping)

1064
01:16:39,067 --> 01:16:39,733
- Oh Cokerson.

1065
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:43,967
