1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,030
Pencil!

2
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,098
Pencil!

3
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,584
Bye, Pencil.

4
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,478
Bye.

5
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,480
Good morning.

6
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,417
So much for my amazing self-control.

7
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,420
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hey.

8
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,557
- Is this a jelly?
- Yes, it is.

9
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,862
They're really good.

10
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,072
Three million in sales.
Almost three million. Around.

11
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,078
Let's round up.
Let's just say three million.

12
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,916
Seven percent. Ten percent is 300.

13
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:39,390
Five percent is 150.
Seven percent should be...

14
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,052
225, little under that.

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,996
About 215, around there.

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,829
This is definitely under...

17
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,166
It should be 7%. What is this?

18
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,137
But what a bonus. I mean, still...

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,674
Still nothing.

20
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,041
I mean, I know it's a lot of money to you,
but, I mean...

21
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,706
But you don't have my degrees.

22
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,012
- This isn't the only place I can work.
- Right.

23
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,485
It's not about whether
it's a lot of money or not,

24
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,249
it's about what's fair.

25
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,350
Jeff, he's always pushing
to get as much as he can.

26
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,954
Hey, Jerry. Hi, Jerry.

27
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,088
Hey.

28
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,906
Well, it's gotta be some kind of mistake.

29
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,344
I mean, everyone knows
how important you are to this company.

30
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,315
And you're here, like,
12 hours a day, at least.

31
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,545
You've been their number one seller.

32
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,281
Well, maybe not this year,
but not that long ago.

33
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,382
The last thing they would want
is to offend you, I am positive.

34
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,759
Then they need to start
prioritizing people over money,

35
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,833
because otherwise
you got a guy like me,

36
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,097
who is the bones of this place,

37
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:02,504
walking around feeling very gypped.

38
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,600
Very, very gypped.

39
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,245
May I ask who's calling?

40
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,484
Oh, yes, that's extension 3250.
I can transfer you.

41
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,363
Sit down.

42
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,840
Oh, babe, I can't.

43
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,740
We're meeting some vendors
over at Scarantino's.

44
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,312
Oh, lucky!

45
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,778
Well, bye.

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,973
Bye.

47
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,586
Don and I had a huge fight last night.

48
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,416
He started complaining about my nails.

49
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,514
Said it looks like I've been trying
to crawl my way out of a well.

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,252
Drives me crazy.

51
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,362
And then I wanted
to get a glass of wine,

52
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,589
you know, to calm my nerves,

53
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,689
so I went to the fridge, got a bottle out,

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,495
and I don't know what I was thinking,

55
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,297
but I pulled the cork out with my teeth

56
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,804
and chipped my freaking front tooth.

57
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,066
It looks fine.

58
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,337
That's because I ran to the bathroom
and stuck it back on with Krazy Glue.

59
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,538
Can you imagine the insults
if he saw me with a chipped tooth?

60
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,138
I gotta go to a dentist.

61
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,016
Every time I do that,
I can feel wind up my tooth.

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,610
And I'm scared to touch it
with my tongue,

63
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,885
so I'm talking like I got
a speech impediment.

64
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,256
I don't know,
I think he makes me insecure.

65
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,454
Layla, come on, you're so beautiful.

66
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,963
And you're sweet and funny.
You're a catch.

67
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,364
You shouldn't feel insecure.
That's crazy talk.

68
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,993
I just think if we were engaged,
I'd mellow out.

69
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,696
It's just, how many times

70
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,799
can you keep pointing out rings
in magazines and crap like that?

71
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,343
Smoked tri-tip
or the chicken quesadilla?

72
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,641
I feel the wind again.

73
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,027
Hey, sexy lady. What's your name?

74
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,946
Come here. Let me check that out.

75
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,222
Hey, sexy lady.
Come here. Get you over here.

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,771
What is this?

77
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,639
Oh, just a little something
that I got for Benjy.

78
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,509
You didn't have to do that!

79
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,479
- Auntie got you a present.
- Benjy got a little present.

80
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,641
He loves presents. Can I open it?

81
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,775
- Yeah.
- Well, we're hoping

82
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,218
that the allergies are under control.

83
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,322
He loves it!

84
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,291
I just wanna...
It seems neurotic, but I just...

85
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,451
Its fine, honey.

86
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,654
I just do a little sniff test now,

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,823
because we've got to check
for artificial fibers

88
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,367
because some of them
will set those allergies right off.

89
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,596
Here, here.
I want to get a picture with it.

90
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,399
God, this thing drives me crazy.

91
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,996
- I want it.
- Okay.

92
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,666
Lissie, share that with your brother.

93
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,710
Share that with Benjy. Lissie?

94
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,508
She just does not share.

95
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,548
As if the whole Halloween thing
wasn't nightmare enough

96
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,018
- with Benjy's asthma attack...
- It was crazy.

97
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,421
Last week we found out that Norali...

98
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:44,485
Norali has been doping Benjy
with Benadryl.

99
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,292
- What? That's awful.
- Yes.

100
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,423
We don't have proof.

101
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,661
You know, it's so obvious.
Every time I would come home,

102
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,262
she would say, "He slept all afternoon,"
or what have you,

103
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,366
which is weird, 'cause with me
he's practically spastic.

104
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,106
Energetic, very energetic boy.

105
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,613
I mean it in a sweet way.

106
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,879
But, one time we came back,
it was at night and he was...

107
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,146
He was, like, comatose.

108
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,688
Yeah. I mean, he would not wake up.
You know, it was...

109
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,189
It was terrifying.

110
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,625
And she had all these, like,
red stains on her shirt.

111
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,663
So I went upstairs
and I looked in the cabinet,

112
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,700
and the Benadryl was out,
and it was, like, almost gone.

113
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,894
Gone!

114
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,036
I just went, "Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"

115
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,438
"This woman has been
drugging my son!"

116
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,569
I can't believe it.
That's horrible. I mean, jeez.

117
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,510
We were really gonna do something.

118
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,776
But, I mean, this woman
has two young children of her own.

119
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,112
- So what are you gonna do?
- We need to do something!

120
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,378
What, throw her in jail? I mean...

121
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,148
Well... Hello.

122
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,692
I mean, maybe in some universe,
or third-world country, sorry,

123
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,692
that's what you do for a crying baby.

124
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,126
But I gotta tell you what. Not here.

125
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,312
Do you have to go tee-tee, Pencil?

126
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:13,971
Pencil!

127
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,608
Pencil!

128
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,512
Pencil!

129
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,994
Pencil!

130
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,290
Pencil!

131
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,195
Come on now, I mean it! Mommy's mad!

132
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,127
Pencil!

133
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,898
Oh, just stay out there.

134
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,286
Pencil!

135
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,162
Pencil!

136
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,964
- Yeah.
- Hi.

137
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,563
Listen, I am so sorry to bother you,
but my dog is missing,

138
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,839
and I hear him crying,
and I think he might be in your yard.

139
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,345
- Would you mind if...
- Yeah. Come in.

140
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,882
- Thank you.
- Just go through the patio door.

141
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,281
Pencil!

142
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,614
Pencil!

143
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,584
I think I hear him over there, yeah.

144
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,854
Pencil!

145
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,756
Pencil!

146
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,806
Pencil.

147
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,380
What happened?

148
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:35,176
It's okay, Pencil. It's okay.
Just hold on. We're almost there.

149
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
- Ma'am, I'll take him.
- Okay.

150
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,808
Somebody come look at this dog now!

151
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,690
Was he sick at all?

152
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,817
No.

153
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,396
What happened?

154
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,990
They said it was toxic poisoning.

155
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,393
He got into something. Ate something.

156
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,102
Boy...

157
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,915
This might be a good time for me to...

158
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,086
I was gonna wait
till closer to Christmas,

159
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,556
but I think you deserve a little boost.

160
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,921
I would've liked to give you more,

161
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,019
but since it's a percentage
of what they give me...

162
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,098
You deserve more,

163
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,133
but I'm still debating
what to do about that.

164
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,205
I'm just so sad.

165
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,004
Oh, no, don't cry.

166
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,840
Oh, I have just the thing for this.

167
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,145
It's nothing. Just a Xanax.

168
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,379
You won't even notice,
but it'll help calm you down.

169
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,956
No, I don't want that.

170
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,787
I know! Let's go see a crappy movie.

171
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,794
Let's go find
the stupidest movie we can find.

172
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,989
A stupid funny movie, yeah?

173
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,900
I know. Let's go out tonight
and get drunk.

174
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,804
Let's just get plastered.

175
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,969
You need to get laid.
When was the last time you got laid?

176
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,078
Oh, it's been a long time, huh?

177
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,628
I think we may have a dirty diaper.

178
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,895
Could you change that, Maria,
before dinner? Thank you.

179
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,335
Why is Aunt Peggy here again?

180
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,272
Because she needs some cheering up.

181
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,106
Oh, honey, could you get me
one of those serving dishes up top?

182
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,179
Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,942
So, two girls from Lissie's class

184
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,950
were sent home today with lice.

185
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,519
I had to spend an hour fastidiously

186
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,487
combing through poor Lissie's hair.

187
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,785
Thank God, she's clean.

188
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,587
Yay, Lissie!

189
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,331
Why does Aunt Peggy need
cheering up?

190
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,267
- You know what, sweetie?
- Because she's sad, honey. Okay?

191
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,802
- She's sad.
- Yeah.

192
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,564
Why is she sad?

193
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,135
Because Pencil died today.

194
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,944
Wow, that's a lot to process.

195
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,314
D- E-A-T-H.

196
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,343
It's natural, honey.

197
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,514
Oh, doesn't know
what that means. I'd rather...

198
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,649
- Just skip that one.
- Okay, okay.

199
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,921
We are gonna get ready for dinner!

200
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,395
Wash our hands. We'll be back.

201
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,556
Okay.

202
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,396
Peggy...

203
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,398
You know what?
Maybe we should go to San Francisco.

204
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,409
See my sister and do some shopping.

205
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,277
- That sounds like fun.
- Well, little girls' weekend.

206
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,548
<i>My husband was concerned</i>

207
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,748
<i>because it was $59.95,
and that wasn't in the budget.</i>

208
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,519
<i>But when I told him
I could save $20, twice...</i>

209
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

210
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,067
So, what happened with your dog?

211
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,262
He died.

212
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,737
Oh, nuts! Really?

213
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,409
I'm so sorry.

214
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,069
You know, I had a dog
when I was younger

215
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,671
and when she died, I was devastated.

216
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,216
I was just destroyed by it, so...

217
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,711
I'm really sorry.

218
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,012
It's so weird.

219
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,285
I feel like I should do something for you.
Bring you some food...

220
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,862
I'll be okay.

221
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,655
Can I take you out to dinner?

222
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,496
I mean, not tonight,
but another night when you're up for it?

223
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,092
Maybe Thursday?

224
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,365
Oh, okay. Sure.

225
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,965
He seemed like a real sweet little dog.

226
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,373
Thank you.

227
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,742
Take care.

228
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,576
Peggy, that is great!

229
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,951
That is exactly
what you should be doing.

230
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,423
You little vixen! Is he hot?

231
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,515
Um, no.

232
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,925
Do not let him take you
to some place gross.

233
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,326
Because if you guys get married,

234
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,955
then you'll always remember
your first date,

235
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,558
and you do not want it to be
in some stank, beefy BO burger place.

236
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,194
Go Italian. Go to Scarantino's.

237
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,535
Oh, I am so excited!

238
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,108
It might not even be a date, Layla.

239
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,074
I mean, he might just be being nice.

240
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,840
No, no! I believe in fate. Don't you?

241
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,916
I believe that there is somebody
on this planet for us all.

242
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,110
Even retarded cripple people
get married.

243
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,743
You just have to be open.

244
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,187
So, hey, maybe your dog died
so that your love life can live,

245
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,226
and you could find... What's-his-name.

246
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,591
- Al. Al.
- You could find Al.

247
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,655
Yes. Maybe this is all fate.
This is all for the best.

248
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,394
I really think so.

249
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,187
So I thought we'd go to Scarantino's.
You ever been there?

250
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,449
That's so...

251
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,220
No, I've never been there,
but it sounds great.

252
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,329
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- How do I go?

253
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,397
Oh.

254
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,332
Let me get your door.

255
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,171
Buckle up.

256
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,708
His name was Pencil.

257
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,579
'Cause when I got him,
he was thin as a pencil

258
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,812
and, you know, he was brown.

259
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,581
Sounds really cute.

260
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,250
Also, he did the sweetest little thing
with his paw.

261
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,156
He would wipe it
on the floor back and forth,

262
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,822
like he was trying to write
something to me.

263
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,263
He had a really unique personality.

264
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,164
Was he a water dog?

265
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,600
Not really.

266
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,234
So, you were saying you had a dog
who died when you were young?

267
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,572
Tessie. I loved that dog.

268
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,510
I had her since she was a puppy.
We did everything together.

269
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,707
She was my right-hand bitch.

270
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,452
Sorry. I mean in the dog way
of being a bitch.

271
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,047
Yeah, she died way too young.
She was only six.

272
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,193
Yeah.

273
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,360
How did she die?

274
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,500
I shot her in Wyoming.

275
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,695
You want some more wine?

276
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,738
Wait. What do you mean?

277
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,298
It was an accident. A hunting accident.

278
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,399
Oh.

279
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,570
I still feel terrible.

280
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,981
And what were you hunting?

281
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,019
Hunting moose. Mooses.

282
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,484
They got a lot of moose up there.
Don't worry about it.

283
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,992
- You ever been hunting?
- No.

284
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,120
It can be a rush.

285
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,723
But, you know, accidents do happen,

286
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,928
and, you know,
a gun is a very powerful weapon.

287
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,869
I learned that the hard way.

288
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,567
That's why I never
keep guns in my house.

289
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,901
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

290
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,344
Just knives. That's it.

291
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,226
Thank you. I had a nice time.

292
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,597
So, you ever been married?

293
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,226
No. No.

294
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,933
I mean, I was...

295
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,769
I had boyfriends, but I never, you know.

296
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,104
I guess I never...

297
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,044
That never happened, but...

298
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,345
You know, I think some people
just aren't as, you know...

299
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,677
I don't even know what I'm saying.

300
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,051
Just, you know, whatever, you know.
What are you gonna do?

301
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:43,594
And the whole dating thing is just
kind of... Yuck, no thank you, so...

302
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:48,223
Yeah, so that's basically
how I feel. Just, you know...

303
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,493
I don't know.

304
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,934
Just like that, I guess. But...

305
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,101
So you wanna get the tour?

306
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,877
It can be a real addiction.

307
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,952
You know, some people spend
all kinds of money traveling the world

308
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,418
just to find something to shoot

309
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,752
that's new and hard to find, you know?

310
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,225
Like leopards, rare birds and...

311
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,196
And they have tours in Africa
and Asia and India.

312
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,289
Even endangered species.

313
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,266
You know, so you can get one
before they're all gone.

314
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,712
This was a lucky shot.

315
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,440
Isn't it a beauty?

316
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,313
And those are my knives.

317
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,517
Can I see your garage?

318
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,925
My garage?

319
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,495
Sure. Yeah, right through here.

320
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,502
Was this open the other night?

321
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,665
What?

322
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,265
This garage door was open, wasn't it,

323
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,140
the night that Pencil got sick?

324
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,735
Yeah. Could be.

325
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,951
What are you looking for?

326
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,084
- Do you keep antifreeze in here?
- Yeah, I have.

327
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,160
I don't know if I have any now, but...

328
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,285
What about rat poison?

329
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,523
No.

330
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,361
No?

331
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,868
Why? You got a rat problem?

332
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,652
Are you looking for something?
Can I help you?

333
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,797
I like you.

334
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,365
What are you doing? Don't do that.

335
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,096
- What? I was just...
- Stay away from me.

336
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,694
- Don't do that.
- No, I was just...

337
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,331
Come on. I gotta go.

338
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,269
So, how was your date?

339
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,011
He's not my type.

340
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,242
Well, what is your type?
Do you have a type?

341
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,912
I kind of have
a lot of work to do right now.

342
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,100
Hello.

343
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,943
<i>- Is this Miss Spade?
- Yes.</i>

344
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,378
Hi, Miss Spade.
I'm Newt Erdrich at the SPCA L.A.

345
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,474
I'm a Client Services Manager.

346
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,213
<i>I work in the adoption program
to place animals</i>

347
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,152
<i>to prevent them
from being euthanized by the city,</i>

348
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,487
<i>and I noticed that you were very upset
about losing your dog.</i>

349
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:39,326
And my instinct is that you're
a very sensitive, caring pet owner,

350
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,889
and that is exactly
the kind of people that we're looking for.

351
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:47,461
And, well, we have a dog here
who needs a home.

352
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:52,942
<i>And this dog, Valentine is his name,</i>

353
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,842
<i>has some behavioral issues,</i>

354
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,711
and I just thought that maybe you might
fall in love with him.

355
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,148
It's a shot in the dark here,

356
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,152
but I'm just desperate
because I don't want to see him die.

357
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,915
But no pressure.

358
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,192
This is King.
He's diabetic, unfortunately.

359
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,959
Aren't you? Big goof.

360
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,331
- And this is Myrtle.
- Myrtle!

361
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,701
She came in
when I was first starting at the Center.

362
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,433
And who's this?

363
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,906
That's Buttons.

364
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,307
Oh, my God.

365
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,242
And of course, this is Valentine.

366
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,438
Now, I've kept him in the pen

367
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,880
because he still isn't
playing well with others.

368
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,042
Easy.

369
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,552
I brought him home because,
you know, he spoke to me.

370
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,593
And that happens sometimes.

371
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,922
But I can't keep him

372
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,829
because legally
you're only allowed three pets.

373
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,595
Animals are like us, they live for love.

374
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,103
And if you have too many of them,

375
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,732
then there's not enough love
to go around, right?

376
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,443
Valentine, say hello
to your new mommy.

377
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,641
Listen, he's been abused,

378
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,015
so you're really gonna
have to work with him.

379
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,281
But look at his eyes.

380
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,823
There's an old soul in there, I think.

381
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,361
I just love him so much already.

382
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,226
Well, if you need help training him,

383
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,391
I do that part-time on the weekends.

384
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,265
- And my methods are very positive.
- Okay.

385
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,067
It's about reward,
it's not about punishment.

386
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,684
Good boy. You like that...

387
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,293
Down, Valentine! Down, Valentine!

388
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,328
Down! Down!

389
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,465
Peggy.

390
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,040
Layla!

391
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,310
Oh, Layla!

392
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,243
I guess all my whining paid off.

393
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,281
Oh, my gosh!

394
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,077
I totally was not prepared.

395
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,119
<i>We went to go see
the new Spider-Man... Superman...</i>

396
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,849
<i>No, no, no! Spider-Man.
Anyway, it was cute.</i>

397
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,154
So then we went
to Greenstein's Deli. Not romantic.

398
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,490
And he's acting all weird and nervous,

399
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,325
and I'm like, "What is going on?"

400
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,923
And then, bam! He just pulls it out!

401
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,865
And I'm not even pregnant!

402
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,597
It's kind of a mellow engagement.

403
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,865
That's what Don's calling it.

404
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,838
But we'll see.

405
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,806
Guess what?
I have some good news, too.

406
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,401
Oh. What, what, what?

407
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,140
I got another dog.

408
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,910
It's a shelter dog,
and his name's Valentine.

409
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,351
Peggy, how are you ever
gonna find a boyfriend,

410
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,151
if you keep shacking up with dogs?

411
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,864
Do you have any soy milk?

412
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,062
- I'm sorry, I don't.
- That's okay. It's okay.

413
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,436
It's very political.

414
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,030
Because on the one hand
you have the city,

415
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,871
and they want to terminate every animal
they get their hands on.

416
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,968
- Yeah, they just have a killing routine.
- Wow.

417
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,138
And I know for a fact

418
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,706
that they have paper products
stored in those cages.

419
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,982
I could write an exposé.
It would explode like a bomb.

420
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,818
And on the other hand,
you have the animal activists,

421
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,018
who don't wanna see
even one animal die.

422
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,789
And we come under criticism
because we work with the city,

423
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,093
but there are 5,000 kittens that come
through the system each year.

424
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,758
You can't save them all, right?

425
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,234
Wow. That must be
so much pressure for you.

426
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,272
And I have nightmares, you know?

427
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,807
I had a nightmare last night

428
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,400
that I was being attacked

429
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,847
and raped by two bull mastiffs.

430
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,750
And... But what am
I supposed to do? Stop caring?

431
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,417
Oh, no. I mean, you can't stop caring.

432
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,426
This is your passion.

433
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,257
- Right.
- You know.

434
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,796
Makes sense to me.

435
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,331
You're right.

436
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,868
Good boy. Eyes to me.

437
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,133
Eyes to me. He knows.

438
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,937
And big ups. Big ups.

439
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,778
Okay.

440
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,110
No, no, no.

441
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,651
He needs to know
he can't play that part.

442
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,721
When I was little, we had a Lhasa Apso.

443
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,590
Valentine.

444
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,102
That's good. That's good.

445
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,668
You can just sign your name there.

446
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,513
You know,
I've always had better relationships

447
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,418
with animals than people.

448
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,252
I can relate.

449
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,851
Animals aren't petty, for one.

450
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,293
They don't backstab you.

451
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,966
So what about girlfriends
and that sort of thing?

452
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,798
Oh, I don't know.
That's very complicated.

453
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:25,340
I was raised in a very...

454
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,205
Culty...

455
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,006
Adults being...

456
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,584
Very... No boundaries.

457
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,780
I just used to go off by myself...

458
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,157
And I always had
this connection with animals.

459
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,695
And that's why I'm a vegan.

460
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,664
People say, "If you couldn't kill it,
you shouldn't eat it. "

461
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,667
And I could never kill an animal.

462
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,202
I understand.

463
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm so excited to be eating here.

464
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,532
There's a couple of things
that are really amazing.

465
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,543
The seitan Sloppy Joe.
The tempeh BLT is good.

466
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,408
Tofu chop.

467
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,209
One of everything.

468
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,806
No, not really.

469
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,587
I think a veggie pizza.

470
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,919
What?

471
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,890
Nothing.

472
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,663
Do you sleep with your dogs?

473
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:28,857
Guilty.

474
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,594
- Three dogs?
- Yeah, it gets crowded.

475
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,762
King hogs the covers. Don't you, King?

476
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:38,765
Wipe that grin off your face.

477
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:47,746
You know, it's really nice
to finally meet someone who just...

478
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:52,152
I don't know,
I think we have a lot in common.

479
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,622
And you've really
opened my eyes to so many different...

480
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,716
- Oh, I think you're great.
- Yeah?

481
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,693
Yeah. Definitely.

482
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,862
Well, thanks.

483
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,632
- And you know what?
- What?

484
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,172
I'm gonna be a vegan.

485
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,502
Really?

486
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,540
Yeah?

487
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,373
I mean, after reading all those books,
how can I not? Absolutely.

488
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,607
Well, I think that's great.

489
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,807
Yeah.

490
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,304
It's been a while since I...

491
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,948
I'm just...

492
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,220
Well, we don't have to do anything.

493
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,122
Oh. Okay.

494
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,562
Cupcakes!

495
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,071
These look diabolical.

496
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,074
I just had a Croissan'Wich.

497
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,302
They're vegan.

498
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,399
They're what?

499
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,742
There's no milk, butter,
or any animal product in them.

500
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,909
No animal was harmed
in the making of those cupcakes.

501
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,986
Different.

502
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,680
No butter. That's weird.

503
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,498
Hey, Susan.
You gotta try this. It's a vegan cupcake.

504
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,728
Thank you, but I'm fine.

505
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,829
Oh, come on,
you gotta try it. It's delicious. There.

506
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,479
You know what happened, don't you?

507
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,423
They put me on the green team
with Greg and Paul.

508
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,585
Two of the oldest guys in this division.

509
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,529
I feel like
I've been put in with the dinosaurs.

510
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,961
What are you so happy about?

511
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,400
You know what
I was just thinking, Robin?

512
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,731
And you're probably gonna hate this.

513
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,102
But you should adopt a dog.

514
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,196
What?

515
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,368
You need something to come home to.
A little life in your house.

516
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,675
Something to love.
And I have the perfect dog for you.

517
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,442
It's a Maltese-poodle mix.

518
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,211
And I have a picture right here.
It's such a...

519
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,980
Peggy, no. Absolutely not.

520
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,921
I don't want a dog.
Get your head in the game here.

521
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,992
I don't want a dog.

522
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,526
What are you doing?

523
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,690
Don't ever bring that up again.

524
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,495
Listen, I can't really talk right now

525
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,466
'cause my boss is getting
a little aggravated.

526
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,437
But guess what?
I got another one for you.

527
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,736
Yes, the receptionist
wants the dachshund.

528
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,401
Isn't that great?

529
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,412
No, it's fun. I feel great about it.

530
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,141
I know, making a difference.

531
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,912
Yeah. But listen, I really should go.
Yeah. I'll call you later.

532
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,011
Okay. Bye.

533
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,260
Peggy. What's going on?

534
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,591
Well,

535
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,833
I'm volunteering for this animal shelter

536
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,632
and I'm trying to get
all these dogs adopted.

537
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,707
But Robin doesn't want me
to be doing it during work,

538
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,605
so I'm just trying to keep it quiet.

539
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,735
Hey, but you know, now that you
and Don have moved in together,

540
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:35,903
you two should get a dog!

541
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,413
- I have the sweetest Maltese...
- No, Peggy.

542
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,778
You have been running around here

543
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,376
like Mary Pippin Poppins
Sunshine or something.

544
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,079
Have you met somebody?

545
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,213
What do you mean?

546
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,690
Come on,
don't bat your eyelashes at me!

547
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,761
Have you met someone?

548
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,128
Come here! Come here!

549
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,501
Tell me everything!
Have you slept together?

550
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,698
No.

551
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,366
Well, have you kissed?

552
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,502
You made out?

553
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,443
Well, kind of.

554
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,312
Peggy, you really like him, don't you?

555
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,851
He's a really nice person.

556
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,478
This is so exciting! Look at you!

557
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,683
I am liking this a lot.

558
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:26,092
Peggy's got a man. Peggy's got a man.

559
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,160
<i>Babe! We don't have this one.</i>

560
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,831
No, we don't.

561
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,138
There's pretty dramatic stuff in that one.

562
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,974
She's so sensitive. But you know what?

563
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,208
Maybe. Why not, huh? I think so.

564
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,114
Do you wanna say thank you
to Aunt Peggy?

565
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,447
Thank you, Aunt Peggy.

566
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,918
You're welcome, sweetie.

567
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,420
I'm gonna go watch it!

568
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,581
Okay.

569
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,222
I feel so sorry for her.

570
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,786
She has missed so much school
because of the lice.

571
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,456
She keeps getting re-exposed

572
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,557
because they can't coordinate
with the parents.

573
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,831
The kids need to get deloused
on the same one day.

574
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,667
We've been saying this
from the beginning...

575
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,105
There's no leadership.

576
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,803
It's kind of tearing
the first grade class apart.

577
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,574
The class? The community!
There's a No Nit Policy!

578
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,808
It's a total meltdown.

579
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,077
But enough about that.

580
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,174
You're so sweet.

581
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,550
You always bring
presents for the kids, Peggy.

582
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,815
Yeah. You really do.

583
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,256
You know, I was thinking,
for Christmas, maybe a dog.

584
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,561
- Yeah...
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

585
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,290
Benjy's still a little too young.

586
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,026
Well, we had a dog
when we were little, Pier. Little Tippy.

587
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,226
Yeah...

588
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,997
You know, even a small dog,
'cause I thought,

589
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,233
you know, a hypoallergenic dog,
maybe a toy poodle,

590
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,742
but, one bite for Benjy
and that's his entire finger.

591
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,507
We just have enough
going on over here as it is.

592
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,945
Oh, hey, stay for dinner!

593
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,109
You know, Maria made pasta
with spicy sausage.

594
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,416
You know what, that's okay.
I'm a vegan now, so...

595
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,821
Actually, there are so many things
that I can't eat.

596
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,223
Is that healthy, Peggy?

597
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,851
Oh, yeah, it's very healthy.

598
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,793
Actually, most people do it
for health reasons,

599
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,387
but I'm doing it for animal reasons.

600
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,230
The corporate farming in America
is awful. I read a book about it.

601
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:16,432
Oh, Peggy, you can buy free range,
did you not know that?

602
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,064
And organic.

603
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,201
Yeah, but it's still, you know, murder.

604
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,605
Well, it'll be interesting
to see how long that lasts.

605
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,877
Yep. Vegan.

606
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,250
It's nice to have a word
that can describe you.

607
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,414
I've never had that before.

608
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,160
Come on, Valentine!

609
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,627
- He knows. Up!
- Valentine.

610
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,992
Good boy.

611
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,295
Hey, how's it going?

612
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,268
Hi.

613
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,203
So, that dog can sure bark, huh?

614
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,399
Yeah.

615
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,076
It's good to get him accustomed
to being in the park

616
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,742
and seeing other dogs
before we take him off the leash.

617
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,318
But you have to watch,

618
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,819
because sometimes
they get more aggressive

619
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,913
when they're on the leash.

620
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,286
Hey, Newt.

621
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,450
What?

622
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,294
I like you.

623
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,492
I like you, too.

624
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,968
Yeah, but...

625
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,103
Do you know what I mean? Like in...

626
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,512
Peggy,

627
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,910
I'm not able to be in a relationship.

628
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:39,581
I mean, with a woman. Or a man.

629
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,180
Either, really.

630
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:46,026
I don't understand. You like men?

631
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,964
I'm celibate, basically,
anyway, so that's beside the point.

632
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,432
But...

633
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,542
I hope I haven't misled you.

634
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,506
Cody! Come here!

635
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:06,980
- Valentine!
- Get down!

636
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,551
- Valentine!
- No!

637
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,949
Valentine!

638
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,354
- No! Get down!
- Valentine!

639
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,555
- I'm sorry.
- Get him away!

640
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,119
Valentine. I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm so sorry.

641
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,290
- Crazy.
- Valentine, no! No!

642
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,961
Come on! What are you doing?

643
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,419
You know, I really do like you.

644
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,285
If you wanna find someone else
to train Valentine,

645
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,585
I totally understand.

646
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:53,425
But he really needs
someone that will build on my approach.

647
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,408
I've always been disappointed
by people.

648
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:06,806
So...

649
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,879
I've really only been able
to count on my pets.

650
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,743
I know it's pathetic, but...

651
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,317
Hey, it's not pathetic.

652
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,011
But it's enough.

653
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,089
It was enough last month and last week,

654
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,659
and it'll be enough next week.

655
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,357
Because of you,
I've really been able to

656
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,991
acknowledge that part of my life
in a deeper way, so...

657
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,099
So thank you.

658
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,474
And this just,

659
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,480
you know, confirms
what I already know, so...

660
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,542
Hey.

661
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,481
- Peggy.
- Valentine.

662
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,850
Come on.

663
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,267
Christmas is gonna be nuts.

664
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,569
Oh and I know
you're gonna be bummed,

665
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,339
but Don didn't go for the dog idea.

666
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,744
He said it just didn't fit into our lifestyle.

667
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,477
Sorry. So how's the guy you're seeing?

668
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,248
I don't wanna talk about it.

669
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,084
Why? What happened?

670
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,322
Okay.

671
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,742
That was a good meeting.

672
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:27,214
I mean, I know it's the meeting
that you wanted to have,

673
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,682
and everything's clear now.

674
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,186
Greg, would you get Vince
and Bob in here?

675
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,984
I wanna do a post-mortem
to make sure we're on the same page.

676
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,820
Okay. Vince and Bob.

677
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,733
Robin, hi.

678
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,740
First of all, I'm on my lunch break,
so this is my time.

679
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,106
I am not on the clock.

680
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,008
I've been doing some research,

681
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,741
and I've discovered
this science lab in Maryland

682
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,079
that's doing animal testing. It's evil.

683
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:05,349
So I am collecting signatures
for PETA to protest.

684
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,218
You gotta be kidding.

685
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,121
Would you sign it, please?

686
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:10,215
No.

687
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,528
How do you think we've made all
the medical breakthroughs

688
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,155
that we've made?

689
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,700
That's how you figure stuff out, Peggy.

690
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:22,203
You test it on animals
so people can live.

691
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,638
Well, what they're doing is torture.

692
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,507
People don't test stuff
on animals for fun.

693
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,274
They do it for a reason, for science,

694
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,246
and to help save lives.

695
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,719
And this isn't the forum
for political signature gathering, okay?

696
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,651
This is a business.

697
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,386
Not in the office!

698
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,486
Sorry.

699
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,155
I mean, come on.

700
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:34,069
Well, what are we talking,
like spring, summer, fall?

701
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,303
Don!

702
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,812
What? We're not thinking
anything, babe.

703
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,577
Look, we just got engaged. Relax.

704
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,584
I mean, we're young. What's the rush?

705
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,154
It's not like we're 40, right?

706
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,449
Anyway, I gotta go pee.

707
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,708
So, Layla says
you don't want to get a dog.

708
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:10,712
Doesn't fit into your lifestyle.

709
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:11,974
I'm never home.

710
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,243
Well. I think you should get a dog.

711
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,784
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

712
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,581
It teaches responsibility.

713
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,485
Well, maybe
I don't want to be responsible.

714
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,113
Might keep you out of trouble.

715
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,316
Yeah? How's that?

716
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,452
I don't know. You're getting married.
You could...

717
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,656
You know, like go home
and walk the dog instead of,

718
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,757
I don't know, going to the mall
and meeting other women,

719
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,268
at Victoria's Secret, say?

720
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,441
That line was too long. I'll just go later.

721
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,709
Peggy, get a sorbet or something.
It's Christmas.

722
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,046
And Don and I are paying.

723
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,379
I'm okay.

724
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,159
Peggy.

725
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,499
Oh, my God, you scared me.

726
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,268
Guess what?
Don and I got to talking after lunch,

727
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,468
and we've come around
on the whole dog thing.

728
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,807
So when we get back from our trip,
we're gonna take one.

729
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,278
A small one.

730
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,983
Are you happy?

731
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very much so.

732
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,156
See, we're nesting already.

733
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,818
Oh, it's great.

734
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,120
Okay.

735
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,151
Valentine!

736
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,024
Get out! Out!

737
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,669
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh.

738
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,337
Look, I have a friend over,

739
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,644
and we're trying to watch a DVD
and your dog is...

740
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,981
Do you think you could
get him to quiet down?

741
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,180
You know what? I don't know.

742
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,852
Well, do you think
you could at least bring him inside?

743
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,052
He's right under my window.

744
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,688
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have poisoned Pencil.

745
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,629
- Who?
- My other dog.

746
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,200
The one that died in your yard

747
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,168
after you left out whatever it was
he got into that killed him.

748
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,172
- Look, I did not poison your dog!
- Well, he was poisoned.

749
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,265
Toxic poisoning,
that's what the vet said.

750
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,276
Well, that's not my problem.

751
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,869
Well, now it is.

752
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,676
What is your deal?

753
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,790
It's a shawl.

754
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,596
I like it. Thank you, Bret.

755
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,569
- It's from me, too.
- Oh, thank you, Pier.

756
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,435
It's so pretty.

757
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,707
And I got something
really neat for all of you.

758
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,772
- Oh, thank you.
- There's one for everybody.

759
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:08,942
That's for you.
Pier, you can open Benjy's.

760
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,144
Benjy!

761
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,652
I found this really great place online.

762
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,191
It's an animal sanctuary
for discarded farm animals.

763
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,817
So I sponsored
different animals for each of you.

764
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,692
And they actually name
the animals after you.

765
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,595
They named a chicken Lissie
after you, Lissie.

766
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,635
- They did?
- Yeah. Isn't that neat?

767
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,905
She was rescued
from a slaughterhouse.

768
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,702
And now she's a very happy chicken
because you're sponsoring her.

769
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,777
- When do I get her?
- Well, you don't.

770
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,608
But she's living a very nice life
thanks to you.

771
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,113
But I want her here.

772
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,945
Well, you could go visit her.

773
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,109
She's only an hour away.

774
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,711
That would be fun, wouldn't it?
To go visit your chicken?

775
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,484
- That'll be fun.
- You named chickens after us?

776
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,992
Well, there's actually
a pig named after you.

777
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,167
A pig. That's good. That's good.

778
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:03,137
I know it seems funny,
but it's a really amazing organization.

779
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,401
I'm sure it is.

780
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:06,941
But it's not a joke.

781
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,034
It's really sweet, Peggy.

782
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,413
Pier, stop it!

783
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,410
- And what kind of animal is Bret?
- Oh, yeah.

784
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,883
A cow.

785
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,383
Stop it!

786
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,561
Robin Heaton's office.

787
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,657
Yes, may I tell him who's calling?

788
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,465
Mr. Heaton is in a meeting
in another city, actually.

789
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,771
But I know he really admires
your organization,

790
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,938
which is why
he made the donation, obviously.

791
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,482
Right. Yes.

792
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,108
But he is a very private person,

793
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,519
and I don't think he wants to be
on any mailing lists.

794
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,490
Yes, anything you wanna send,
you can send to me, okay?

795
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,858
I'm his assistant, Peggy. Right.

796
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,396
- Peggy.
- Peggy.

797
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,363
Who was that?

798
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,569
That was just someone, you know,

799
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,198
asking about...

800
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,107
How was your Christmas?

801
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,269
Fine.

802
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,515
Asking about what?

803
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,350
What did you do?

804
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,049
Caught up on some stuff.

805
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,214
Please tell me you took the day off.

806
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,325
Well...

807
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:32,884
You know, I should've brought you
with me to my brother's.

808
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,634
I can't find the number
for Long, Green & Tessler.

809
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,969
Can you bring me their file, too?

810
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:59,379
Oh, look at the puppy! I just love you!

811
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,252
I just love you!

812
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,822
So cute!

813
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,061
Christmas was great.
Don's family loves me.

814
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,995
At least that's what he said.

815
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,160
They kept talking about
all the girlfriends he had in high school,

816
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,203
which really started to piss me off.

817
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,500
It's like, "Do you have to go there?"

818
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,440
And, evidently, he's still in touch
with some of these girlfriends.

819
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,376
And I am not down with that at all.

820
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,314
I just don't wanna come off
like a paranoid nag too soon.

821
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,449
Oh!

822
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:35,216
Peggy! He just peed on me!

823
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,816
This is my favorite sweat suit! Dang it!

824
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,086
Go on.

825
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:49,632
Thank you so much for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

826
00:56:49,735 --> 00:56:50,724
I hate leaving him,

827
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:53,396
but my brother doesn't allow
dogs in his house, so...

828
00:56:53,505 --> 00:56:54,904
He's one of those, huh?

829
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:58,272
Well, I think I need to alter
my approach with Valentine.

830
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,004
Maybe more firmer.

831
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:02,706
Okay. But you won't keep him in the pen
the whole time though, right?

832
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:04,908
No. No, no. It's just till he acclimates.

833
00:57:05,017 --> 00:57:05,984
Good. Okay.

834
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:09,178
And maybe I can take you out for dinner
after as a thank you?

835
00:57:09,288 --> 00:57:10,550
Oh, please, it's not necessary.

836
00:57:10,656 --> 00:57:13,591
No, I know, but I would really like to.

837
00:57:13,692 --> 00:57:16,923
- Okay. Good. That'd be great.
- Okay. Good.

838
00:57:17,029 --> 00:57:19,395
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you. Happy New Year.

839
00:57:19,498 --> 00:57:20,692
I'm gonna say bye to Valentine.

840
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,791
Bye, Valentine. Bye, Valentine.

841
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:25,096
Be good.

842
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:35,979
Thanks again.

843
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:39,415
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

844
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,346
- Okay.
- We're gonna be late.

845
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:43,387
- Come on, we gotta go.
- I'm ready, I'm ready! I heard you.

846
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:44,717
We're good. We're good.
We've got everything.

847
00:57:44,823 --> 00:57:45,915
Is that mink?

848
00:57:46,024 --> 00:57:48,584
Oh, no, it's rabbit.

849
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:51,093
You know, Peggy,

850
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:53,289
when I first bought it,
the woman told me that it was faux,

851
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:55,423
because it kind of looks faux.

852
00:57:55,534 --> 00:57:57,229
Do you think I'm horrible?

853
00:57:57,336 --> 00:57:58,633
It's nice.

854
00:57:59,872 --> 00:58:00,839
Okay.

855
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,668
If she likes it, we should go.
We have to go.

856
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,935
- Okay, let's go. Bye, guys.
- Bye, sweet boy. I love you.

857
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:06,135
I love you, honey.

858
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:08,509
I'm gonna keep my kiss
right here. See you later. Bye.

859
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:10,047
- Bye, Mommy. Bye, Daddy.
- I love you, honey.

860
00:58:10,148 --> 00:58:12,013
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, sweetie.

861
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,449
Oh, listen. You know,
I'm gonna call you every hour.

862
00:58:14,553 --> 00:58:15,918
Don't worry!

863
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:19,585
- Thank you. I love you! Bye, babies!
- Bye, guys.

864
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:20,749
Okay.

865
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,420
<i>Where are we going?</i>

866
00:58:25,764 --> 00:58:27,595
I thought we could go visit your chicken.

867
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,132
Do you wanna go see Chicken Lissie?

868
00:58:29,234 --> 00:58:30,633
Yeah!

869
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:31,998
<i>Did you see Babe, Lissie?</i>

870
00:58:32,104 --> 00:58:33,332
Yeah.

871
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:35,235
- Well, did you like it?
- Yeah.

872
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,832
Well, we might see Babe today.
A real Babe.

873
00:58:38,944 --> 00:58:40,241
Can I pet it?

874
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:41,903
I think you can.

875
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:52,784
At the place we're going,

876
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:56,657
they rescue pigs like Babe
and chickens like yours,

877
00:58:56,762 --> 00:58:58,559
and they rescue goats and cows

878
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:00,222
so they don't have to be killed
and eaten.

879
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,560
Isn't that nice?

880
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:05,296
If the animals didn't get eaten,
what would they do?

881
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:08,128
Well...

882
00:59:14,146 --> 00:59:15,773
Come on in.

883
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,386
Lissie is over there. Yeah, that one.

884
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,685
She and a few of the others here
fell off a truck

885
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:31,388
on the way to a chicken farm
about a mile up the road.

886
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:33,123
They fell out of a truck?

887
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:34,994
Yeah, and it's a good thing, too,

888
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,864
because they would've been
somebody's lunch.

889
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:38,994
Before she came here,

890
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:42,301
Lissie had never
touched the ground with her feet,

891
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,672
or felt the sun,
or even spread her wings.

892
00:59:45,777 --> 00:59:47,267
Isn't that sad?

893
00:59:49,815 --> 00:59:51,180
It's just...

894
01:01:23,108 --> 01:01:25,576
Goodbye! Bye!

895
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:30,113
Wow.

896
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:33,743
That woman is a saint.

897
01:01:33,852 --> 01:01:38,084
And this place, this place is heaven!
This is heaven.

898
01:01:39,257 --> 01:01:42,488
And there is a hell
just one mile up the road, Lissie,

899
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:44,721
and we need to see it.

900
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,422
We need to see it.

901
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,500
Because there's a holocaust
going on there right now.

902
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:52,331
They're slaughtering chickens
up there right this second.

903
01:01:52,437 --> 01:01:54,029
That's a reality, Lissie.

904
01:01:54,139 --> 01:01:57,939
That's a reality, and we can't ignore it.

905
01:01:58,043 --> 01:02:00,238
<i>Life isn't like Babe.</i>

906
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,180
<i>You know,
they show movies like Babe to kids,</i>

907
01:02:04,282 --> 01:02:07,308
<i>but then they don't tell you
what happens to Babe in real life.</i>

908
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:09,216
But you need to know.

909
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,230
I don't wanna go.

910
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,941
I don't wanna see them
hurt the chickens.

911
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:35,308
I know, and I don't either
and we're not going to.

912
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:38,678
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

913
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:43,221
It's okay. It's okay. Okay.

914
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,551
Let's go home. We're going home now.

915
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:47,687
<i>And since
everybody's looking up at that ball,</i>

916
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:50,057
<i>let's take a look at this year's addition.</i>

917
01:02:50,162 --> 01:02:52,130
<i>It's made of Waterford crystal.</i>

918
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,495
<i>It weighs in at about 1,070 pounds</i>

919
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:58,329
<i>and is six feet in diameter.</i>

920
01:02:58,436 --> 01:03:00,768
<i>It contains 696 lights</i>

921
01:03:00,872 --> 01:03:04,672
<i>and 90 rotating pyramid mirrors,
all computer-controlled,</i>

922
01:03:04,776 --> 01:03:08,109
<i>which enables the ball
to produce a state-of-the-art light show.</i>

923
01:03:08,213 --> 01:03:11,210
<i>It's designed to dazzle the eyes
with all kinds of colorful patterns.</i>

924
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:13,580
<i>Kind of like a spectacular
kaleidoscope effect</i>

925
01:03:13,685 --> 01:03:15,744
<i>on the top of One Times Square.</i>

926
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:18,880
<i>The theme of this year's design is
"Forward with Harmony. "</i>

927
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,324
<i>And everybody is waiting
for that ball to drop.</i>

928
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:24,861
<i>Think about it.</i>

929
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:29,263
<i>Very, very soon
it's gonna be a brand new year.</i>

930
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:33,064
<i>It's so exciting.
You can hear the energy, the voices...</i>

931
01:04:09,774 --> 01:04:11,207
Unbelievable.

932
01:04:18,683 --> 01:04:20,150
Lissie.

933
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,020
Lissie? Are you awake?

934
01:04:24,756 --> 01:04:26,155
Hi.

935
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:29,853
Do you wanna go see
the ball drop with Aunt Peggy?

936
01:04:29,961 --> 01:04:33,260
You want to? Just the big girls, right?
Come on, let's go.

937
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:35,595
It's almost New Year's.

938
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,531
Don't wake Benjy.

939
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:43,165
<i>It really is exciting.</i>

940
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:45,243
<i>And now we're down to 12 seconds...</i>

941
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:48,244
Ten, nine, eight,

942
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:51,509
seven, six, five,

943
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:55,347
four, three, two, one.

944
01:04:55,453 --> 01:04:57,944
Happy New Year!

945
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:06,327
Happy New Year!

946
01:05:06,431 --> 01:05:09,298
<i>There's our big celebration party
out in Hollywood,</i>

947
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:12,666
<i>and there's the sidewalks of New York,
teeming with people.</i>

948
01:05:12,771 --> 01:05:17,231
<i>One million people,
all of them happy, smiling, laughing.</i>

949
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:20,768
What do you think of these?

950
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:25,878
I think they're mean.

951
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:30,110
I think they're mean, too.

952
01:05:35,093 --> 01:05:36,526
You're sweet.

953
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:46,358
- Thank you, sis. You're the best.
- I hope it wasn't too boring.

954
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:50,025
- We so appreciated a night away.
- Really appreciate it.

955
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:54,435
- What a hot night. Amazing night.
- We needed it.

956
01:06:57,108 --> 01:06:59,941
I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Drive safe.

957
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:02,172
Bye.

958
01:07:18,863 --> 01:07:20,023
Newt?

959
01:07:25,937 --> 01:07:27,302
Newt.

960
01:07:32,944 --> 01:07:35,811
Valentine killed Buttons.

961
01:07:35,914 --> 01:07:36,972
What?

962
01:07:38,049 --> 01:07:41,849
It happened so fast.
We were in the back,

963
01:07:41,953 --> 01:07:43,181
and he...

964
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,690
Newt, I'm so sorry.

965
01:07:51,796 --> 01:07:53,661
It's not your fault.

966
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:56,097
It's not your fault!

967
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,101
Oh, my God.

968
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:04,832
It's a mess back there!
Don't go back there!

969
01:08:04,943 --> 01:08:06,604
I tried to call you, but I...

970
01:08:08,146 --> 01:08:09,579
I don't know.

971
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,647
Poor Buttons.

972
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:18,317
I'm so sorry.

973
01:08:31,769 --> 01:08:33,634
Newt, where's Valentine?

974
01:08:39,878 --> 01:08:42,369
The city came and picked him up.

975
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:44,706
What?

976
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:51,753
I told them to put him down.

977
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:52,857
You...

978
01:08:54,025 --> 01:08:55,083
You what?

979
01:08:55,193 --> 01:08:59,129
It was the only thing to do,
and I knew you couldn't do it,

980
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,527
so I took it out of your hands,

981
01:09:00,632 --> 01:09:03,157
so you wouldn't have to carry the burden
of making that decision.

982
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:09,405
- What?
- You have to put a dog like that down.

983
01:09:09,507 --> 01:09:10,496
You...

984
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:13,702
I thought we could save him,
but we couldn't!

985
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:15,705
You...

986
01:09:20,018 --> 01:09:22,350
It was a mistake.
He's not even supposed to be here.

987
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:23,852
It's okay. We'll find him.

988
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:25,786
While I'm looking him up,
you can walk back.

989
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,084
All the animals
that were brought in today

990
01:09:27,192 --> 01:09:28,557
are in this first hall.

991
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,423
- Down there?
- Yeah.

992
01:09:44,909 --> 01:09:46,035
Ma'am,

993
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:50,440
my records indicate
the dog was involved in a mauling.

994
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:54,977
He was euthanized a few hours ago.

995
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:10,832
This is terrible.

996
01:10:12,103 --> 01:10:14,367
He shouldn't have died.

997
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,508
He shouldn't have died.

998
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:35,990
Come on! Come on, boy.

999
01:10:36,094 --> 01:10:37,527
Come on.

1000
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:41,291
Come on, boy!

1001
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:44,000
Come on!

1002
01:10:44,102 --> 01:10:45,535
Take it easy.

1003
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:50,532
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you taking that dog?

1004
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:55,837
I want that dog.

1005
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:57,175
What?

1006
01:10:57,282 --> 01:10:59,910
I want to adopt this dog right now,
so just give me the dog.

1007
01:11:00,018 --> 01:11:02,350
You want this dog? Right now?

1008
01:11:02,453 --> 01:11:04,478
I want this dog. Give me the dog.

1009
01:11:04,589 --> 01:11:06,147
Hold on.

1010
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:11,652
Stay, boy.

1011
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:53,262
Ma'am, you're gonna have to fill out
some paperwork.

1012
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:55,202
Yeah, fine. I want this dog,

1013
01:11:55,306 --> 01:12:00,039
and I want every single dog
you're gonna euthanize tonight.

1014
01:12:00,144 --> 01:12:02,476
That's 15 dogs.

1015
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:06,748
Fifteen. That's great.

1016
01:12:06,851 --> 01:12:07,818
Yes.

1017
01:12:07,919 --> 01:12:11,047
Ma'am, you can't adopt 15 dogs.
The limit is three.

1018
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:14,215
Well, I work for the ASPCA L.A.

1019
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:17,385
I work for Newt Erdrich.
He's a client services manager.

1020
01:12:17,495 --> 01:12:19,224
I happen to be in the adoption program,

1021
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,422
and I will be taking all these dogs

1022
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:22,897
and placing them in adoption situations,

1023
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,969
so I think that should be fine, then,
thank you.

1024
01:12:28,673 --> 01:12:30,834
Get me the dogs. Great.

1025
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:55,063
Come on, you two with me.
You two with me. In the house.

1026
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:01,799
Quiet! I will be right back!

1027
01:13:09,347 --> 01:13:13,477
Big dogs out. Come on.
No, no, big dogs out.

1028
01:13:13,584 --> 01:13:15,984
Out, out, out, out, out.

1029
01:13:18,656 --> 01:13:20,385
No! Oh, no!

1030
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:23,016
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1031
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:53,649
Here's some water for you.

1032
01:13:53,758 --> 01:13:55,385
Oh, good boys.

1033
01:13:55,493 --> 01:13:56,619
No fighting!

1034
01:13:56,727 --> 01:14:00,219
Mommy's gotta go to work.
Mommy's gotta go to work.

1035
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:03,027
Okay. Be good.

1036
01:14:03,134 --> 01:14:04,863
Oh, no. Mommy's late. Mommy's late.

1037
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:07,062
You be good. Be good. Be good.

1038
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:09,002
Mommy's late for work.

1039
01:14:09,907 --> 01:14:12,637
Peggy! Robin's been
looking for you for an hour.

1040
01:14:12,743 --> 01:14:14,438
He seems pretty agitated.

1041
01:14:14,545 --> 01:14:16,513
- Where is he?
- He's in a meeting now with Jeff.

1042
01:14:22,687 --> 01:14:24,245
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Peg?</i>

1043
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:25,413
<i>Why didn't you tell us</i>

1044
01:14:25,523 --> 01:14:28,321
<i>you took Lissie to some animal farm
and indoctrinated her?</i>

1045
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:29,757
Well, she wanted to see
her chicken, Pier.

1046
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:30,828
I thought it would be nice.

1047
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:33,726
<i>No, it's not nice. She's traumatized.</i>

1048
01:14:33,831 --> 01:14:35,230
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

1049
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:38,359
<i>- Traumatized, Peggy!
- No, I don't think she's traumatized.</i>

1050
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:40,198
<i>She will not even eat
a ham sandwich now.</i>

1051
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:42,636
Well, what's so important
about eating a ham sandwich, anyway?

1052
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,207
If she doesn't want to eat it...

1053
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:46,276
You know, Peggy,
you've completely betrayed our trust!

1054
01:14:46,377 --> 01:14:47,708
<i>- The furs.
- Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

1055
01:14:47,812 --> 01:14:50,440
<i>- Yeah. And Bret can't find her furs.
- What?</i>

1056
01:14:50,548 --> 01:14:52,209
What, you think I stole her furs?

1057
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:55,149
<i>- Peggy, where are they?
- I have no idea!</i>

1058
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:58,347
Look, I have to go right now. I'm at work.

1059
01:14:58,456 --> 01:14:59,821
She hung up.

1060
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:06,723
Hey, Peggy, Robin's looking for you.

1061
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:09,800
What happened to you? You okay?

1062
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:14,229
Peggy, I know you're
gonna be disappointed,

1063
01:15:14,338 --> 01:15:15,999
but it's not working out with Snowball.

1064
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:23,071
He keeps peeing all over the place
and chewing up all the furniture.

1065
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,478
- And Don, he thinks that...
- Don?

1066
01:15:29,086 --> 01:15:33,216
Layla, do you understand that that dog
will be loyal to you his whole life?

1067
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:35,417
Don's not even loyal to you now.

1068
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,854
Don wants to keep it.

1069
01:15:38,963 --> 01:15:40,157
It's me.

1070
01:15:41,732 --> 01:15:43,757
What do you mean,
he's not loyal to me?

1071
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:49,764
What, Peggy? Say it.

1072
01:15:51,342 --> 01:15:53,333
I didn't mean anything.

1073
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:56,345
I gotta... I gotta go.
Robin's looking for me.

1074
01:16:03,187 --> 01:16:05,212
So, I just got a call this morning

1075
01:16:05,323 --> 01:16:08,451
from a woman named
Jocelyn Kleinhoffer.

1076
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,352
She works for
the Animal Action something.

1077
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:17,560
She wanted to thank me
for my generous contribution of $200

1078
01:16:17,668 --> 01:16:21,729
to help prevent
the clubbing of baby seals in Canada.

1079
01:16:25,676 --> 01:16:28,668
I trusted you
with the most valuable thing I have,

1080
01:16:28,779 --> 01:16:31,577
and you stole from me.

1081
01:16:35,252 --> 01:16:38,653
I thought we were
on the same team, but...

1082
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:42,420
I trusted you.

1083
01:16:45,162 --> 01:16:47,153
So what were you thinking?

1084
01:17:02,613 --> 01:17:04,046
You're fired.

1085
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:09,185
Effective immediately.

1086
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:42,743
I have not slept 10 minutes in a week!

1087
01:17:42,853 --> 01:17:44,445
How many dogs do you have in there?

1088
01:17:44,555 --> 01:17:46,182
They need a home.

1089
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,952
Well, get them one,
so I don't have to put up with this racket.

1090
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,254
Not now!

1091
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:52,522
And do you know
how much this house stinks?

1092
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:55,098
You know what? You're a jerk.

1093
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,566
I'm telling you,
you deal with this or I will.

1094
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:36,297
<i>- Hello.
- Peggy, it's Newt.</i>

1095
01:18:36,907 --> 01:18:38,932
I haven't heard from you.
Are you still mad at me?

1096
01:18:39,043 --> 01:18:40,772
No, I'm not mad.

1097
01:18:42,613 --> 01:18:44,171
What's all that noise?

1098
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:46,710
My dogs.

1099
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:49,112
Oh, you got new dogs? That's great.

1100
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:52,982
- Where did you get them?
- From the pound.

1101
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:57,454
You sound weird, Peggy.
Is everything all right?

1102
01:18:58,229 --> 01:19:02,928
I was just thinking, you know, just now,
my house is full of love.

1103
01:19:04,535 --> 01:19:09,336
I have too much love in my life.
I've never had that before.

1104
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,066
- Come here.
- Peggy? Peggy?

1105
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:48,063
Well, I want them back! I don't care!

1106
01:20:49,206 --> 01:20:52,107
Well, what are you gonna do with them?

1107
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:54,177
Well, you know what, ma'am?
That is not good enough!

1108
01:20:54,278 --> 01:20:56,405
I want a record
of every one of those dogs,

1109
01:20:56,513 --> 01:21:00,449
and if even one of those dogs is hurt,
I am hiring a lawyer!

1110
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:02,246
Who called you?

1111
01:21:02,353 --> 01:21:03,342
Well, you know what?

1112
01:21:03,454 --> 01:21:05,445
You don't have to tell me who called
because my neighbor called!

1113
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,217
Can I have your name please, ma'am?

1114
01:21:07,324 --> 01:21:08,348
Can I...

1115
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:10,051
Don't hang up on me!

1116
01:21:16,533 --> 01:21:17,659
Hello!

1117
01:21:21,272 --> 01:21:22,637
Hello!

1118
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:36,302
<i>You ever been hunting?</i>

1119
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:38,973
<i>It can be a rush.</i>

1120
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,482
<i>You gotta be real quiet,
so you can hear a twig snap.</i>

1121
01:22:44,588 --> 01:22:48,422
<i>After hours of waiting, sometimes,</i>

1122
01:22:48,525 --> 01:22:50,823
<i>up comes a moose</i>

1123
01:22:50,928 --> 01:22:53,863
<i>or a Rocky Mountain elk.</i>

1124
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:59,963
<i>And there's nothing like the feeling like</i>

1125
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,300
<i>something's gonna happen.</i>

1126
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,603
<i>You know, but it don't know.</i>

1127
01:23:07,478 --> 01:23:10,504
<i>It's just another moment in its life,</i>

1128
01:23:10,614 --> 01:23:13,947
<i>but you know it's its last,
its last moment.</i>

1129
01:23:14,952 --> 01:23:17,147
<i>And you're gonna take it.</i>

1130
01:23:28,332 --> 01:23:33,031
Yeah, so then she started to hang out
with that girl Linda and Kimmy.

1131
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:34,570
You know,
the one with that thing in her lip.

1132
01:23:34,671 --> 01:23:35,797
Oh, yeah, that piercing.

1133
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:38,932
And they just had her
partying like crazy.

1134
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:40,601
Bad news.

1135
01:23:40,711 --> 01:23:43,737
So she left Jamie after that

1136
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:45,542
and decided
she wanted to be with Dale.

1137
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:49,216
But Dale was in the military.

1138
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:51,310
That's why she divorced him.

1139
01:23:51,422 --> 01:23:54,858
Then she got with Darryl.
Half-Japanese, by the way.

1140
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,619
And then they had a kid.

1141
01:24:03,767 --> 01:24:04,927
Al.

1142
01:24:07,204 --> 01:24:09,104
I think we've been robbed.

1143
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:10,571
What? What do you mean?

1144
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:12,539
I think you've been robbed!

1145
01:24:18,715 --> 01:24:20,307
Are you crazy!

1146
01:24:21,985 --> 01:24:24,545
- Call 911!
- Let go of me!

1147
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:34,388
...can stay downstairs.

1148
01:24:34,498 --> 01:24:36,591
This bedroom needs to be
painted for her.

1149
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,861
Kind of something soothing...

1150
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:47,605
Hey, Lissie, sweetie,
it's night-night time.

1151
01:24:57,287 --> 01:25:00,017
The lawyer thinks because
she didn't actually hurt anybody,

1152
01:25:00,124 --> 01:25:01,785
it's gonna be all right.

1153
01:25:01,892 --> 01:25:04,190
And I talked to her boss for a long time.

1154
01:25:04,294 --> 01:25:06,091
He says,
because of their years together,

1155
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:09,529
that if she gets help
and pays what she stole,

1156
01:25:09,633 --> 01:25:12,568
he's willing to give her job back.

1157
01:25:18,642 --> 01:25:22,305
Peggy, what were you thinking?

1158
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:32,913
I just wanted him to know
what it felt like to...

1159
01:25:37,294 --> 01:25:39,854
What it felt like to what?

1160
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,568
To be hunted.

1161
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,231
Oh, Peggy.

1162
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:51,697
We love you.

1163
01:25:52,609 --> 01:25:55,169
And we're so worried about you.

1164
01:25:57,147 --> 01:26:01,015
We're gonna get you the help you need.
We're here for you.

1165
01:26:37,988 --> 01:26:39,148
Lissie.

1166
01:26:40,857 --> 01:26:42,586
I'm so sorry.

1167
01:26:44,494 --> 01:26:45,654
Why?

1168
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:52,362
You love animals,
don't you, Aunt Peggy?

1169
01:26:55,706 --> 01:26:57,196
So do I.

1170
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:03,942
This one's mean and this one's nice.

1171
01:27:23,834 --> 01:27:26,667
Oh, welcome back, Peggy.

1172
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:32,772
There she is.

1173
01:27:38,749 --> 01:27:41,980
Here, Peggy. Welcome back.

1174
01:27:42,085 --> 01:27:44,178
You look so pretty.

1175
01:27:46,757 --> 01:27:49,055
I had a talk with Jeff.

1176
01:27:49,159 --> 01:27:53,357
He moved us to the orange team
with Brad and Denise.

1177
01:27:54,498 --> 01:27:57,228
I just think that's a better fit.

1178
01:27:57,334 --> 01:28:00,735
Denise is great with people,
Brad's good with strategy,

1179
01:28:00,837 --> 01:28:02,771
and I'm the numbers guy.

1180
01:28:04,374 --> 01:28:06,433
Snowball! No!

1181
01:28:07,978 --> 01:28:09,070
You'll find this amusing.

1182
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:12,012
Your friend Layla couldn't find anyone
to take her dog, so I took it.

1183
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:15,846
I don't know what came over me.
Momentary lapse of reason.

1184
01:28:19,056 --> 01:28:23,425
I hate leaving him home all day,
so I sneak him in sometimes.

1185
01:28:23,527 --> 01:28:26,291
I don't really like the name,
but he answers to it.

1186
01:28:26,396 --> 01:28:30,196
Okay, Snowball. Down. There you go.

1187
01:28:32,169 --> 01:28:33,864
Stay over there.

1188
01:28:38,141 --> 01:28:39,540
Anyway.

1189
01:28:40,811 --> 01:28:43,371
So where were we? Oh, yeah.

1190
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,311
The orange team.

1191
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:16,501
Hey. Guess what?

1192
01:29:16,613 --> 01:29:19,878
We finally have a date. June 21st.

1193
01:29:20,784 --> 01:29:22,149
That's great, Layla.

1194
01:29:22,252 --> 01:29:25,221
Yeah, it took a lot of work,
that's for sure.

1195
01:29:25,322 --> 01:29:28,257
And I want you to be a bridesmaid.

1196
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:31,384
You wanna go to lunch? Don has plans.

1197
01:29:31,495 --> 01:29:34,658
You know what? I can't.
I have a lot to catch up on.

1198
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:38,257
I understand. I'll talk to you later, okay?

1199
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:24,205
<i>If you all didn't think I was crazy,
I'm sure you will now.</i>

1200
01:30:24,314 --> 01:30:27,340
<i>How do I explain the things
I've said and done?</i>

1201
01:30:28,685 --> 01:30:31,848
<i>How do I explain
the person I've become?</i>

1202
01:30:35,759 --> 01:30:39,593
<i>I know I've disappointed everyone,
and I'm sorry for that.</i>

1203
01:30:41,264 --> 01:30:44,097
<i>I wish I was a more articulate person.</i>

1204
01:30:54,444 --> 01:30:57,607
<i>I believe life is magical.</i>

1205
01:30:57,714 --> 01:30:59,978
<i>It is so precious.</i>

1206
01:31:01,485 --> 01:31:05,319
<i>And there are
so many kinds of life in this life.</i>

1207
01:31:05,422 --> 01:31:07,847
<i>So many things to love.</i>

1208
01:31:16,733 --> 01:31:19,964
<i>The love for a husband or a wife,</i>

1209
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:22,436
<i>a boyfriend or girlfriend.</i>

1210
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:28,641
<i>The love for children.</i>

1211
01:31:28,745 --> 01:31:31,213
<i>The love for yourself.</i>

1212
01:31:32,482 --> 01:31:33,972
<i>And even material things.</i>

1213
01:31:39,189 --> 01:31:42,454
<i>This is my love. It is mine.</i>

1214
01:31:44,995 --> 01:31:48,487
