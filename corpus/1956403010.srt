Being homeless doesn't mean
you wake up on the street every day.

my three little brothers.

45
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:48,400
My mom stayed awake and watched
that nobody came near us.

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,467
I don't think children should
have to wake up in a park...

47

48
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
That's not a childhood.
