If you look at pictures of him,

353
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,125
he had to wear
that -- that thong,

354
00:14:56,125 --> 00:15:00,625

Some people say you should
live like Jesus.

Who can live --
He was insane.

00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:19,000
You can't live like that.

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
He had a weird life.
I'm reading about Jesus.

364
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,792
I have this book about Jesus.

Okay.

369
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,583
This is a book about Jesus.

370
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,292
Actually, only this much
is about Jesus.

371
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,000
Only that -- just that part.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,417
The rest of it is just the Jews
going like, "And then we

373
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:51,417
walked for 50 years
in the desert.

And we only had
a little bit of oil.

It was difficult."
It's just...

It's fucking verbose.

Just Jews.

The Jews in the early chapters
are all, like, 800 years old.

385
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,083
And then God was like,

386
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:32,458
"I can't with these fucking Jews
for 800 years.

And that's Jesus.

391

This little part's Jesus.

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,458

is, it's not all --

Like, it's all the same story
over and over again.

394

They tell the same story
about Jesus' life over.

395
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:55,375
First Matthew tells it,
and then Mark is like,

"Dude, that's not what --

And I started reading it
because I never read it.

I was raised Catholic.

403

But they don't encourage you
to read, the church.

00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,958
They don't. They don't
want you to read this.

405
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,417
You know? Jews read this shit
in Hebrew, and Baptists

sit down,
and they read together.

407

But the Catholics, they want you
to come in the building.

"Can I read it?"

413
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,458
But it's interesting because
when you read the stories,

414
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,125
you know, you think of them
as lofty, kind of, like,

415
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:43,000
but some of them are just
basic life in Jesus' life.

Okay, here's one.

417
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:48,042
This is when he turned
water into wine.

This is John Chapter 2.

and the mother of Jesus
was there.

his disciples to the wedding.

of the story is that Jesus,

he's at the wedding.
They had no wine. The guy --

441

the wedding, and he was like,

the water barrel,

He had turned all their water
into wine. Everybody rejoiced.

running the wedding was

we should do.
Let's make this law.

00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,833
You can get an abortion anytime,
anywhere.

But if you get an abortion,

879
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,417
you have to eat it.
I think that's fair.

880
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:37,042

That'll make you, "Hmm.

Some -- Some Catholics believe

889
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,500
that contraception
is murder.

890
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,042
They think if you wear a condom,

891
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:11,292
if you stop a sperm
from getting to an egg,

892

you killed a possible baby.

I could say that any woman

of murdering bitches
out there.

898
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,958
But...

899
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,333
...murder
is a weird law structure.

900
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:34,667
Also, that is not a sentence.
Didn't make any sense, but...

901
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,833
murder should be simple
because it's a binary crime.

902
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,958
You kill somebody, or you don't.
They're alive, or they're dead.

903
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,583
It's one or the other.
But --

904
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,333
But the laws around murder
are a little murky.

905
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,583
One person could kill somebody,
get 100 years.

906
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,083
Somebody else gets 20.
Why? What's the difference?

907
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,417
Here's what they base
your sentence on with murder.

908
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:54,667
They base it on how you felt
when you murdered them.

909
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,750
That's weirdly important.

910
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,417
They say, "Okay,
you shot him in the face.

913
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,708
I think if you murder somebody,

914
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,708
your sentence should be based
on how old the person

915
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,708
was that you murdered.

916
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,583
That should matter. How much
of their life did you take away?

917
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,708
Like, if you see
a 3-year-old girl in the park,

You stop.

He believes that. He just went,
"Yeah, that sounds right."
