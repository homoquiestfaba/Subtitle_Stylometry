00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,700
Hi, I'm Robert Lawrence with the
Advantage Corporation in San Diego,

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,777
and we have a Colby 5 here,

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,244
which is highly optimised
for playing chess.

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,580
And we have designed it around
a recursive assembler routine

5
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,746
that uses a brute strength approach

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,517
to finding the optimal route.

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,421
I don't want to give away exact numbers,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,791
but we've got the fastest depth-first
search to get the most number...

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,229
We can predict more turns in advance
than any other computer,

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,663
so we've got a good chance.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,031
My field is experimental psychology,

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,638
but I've spent the last three years
studying chess skill

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,537
in both humans and machines.

14
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,835
And this is TSAR.

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:50,007
This is the latest iteration of Caltech's
computer chess programme.

16
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,553
This is 3.0. Last year, 2.0 won
this very same tournament.

17
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,815
Computers are getting smaller, they're
getting better, they're getting faster.

18
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,586
It's a matter of time before
we beat people with these things.

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,185
(INTERVIEWER) Do you guys have a programme
in the competition here today?

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,026
No. Don't know anything about it.

21
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:10,159
We're just watching 'em get ready
for the end of the world here.

22
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,103
- World War III.
- That's what we're here for.

23
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,673
Getting in on the ground floor.

24
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,902
(INTERVIEWER) Do you think a human being
will ever beat a person at chess?

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,479
Oh... Between a "human being"
and a "person"?

26
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,809
My money's on the computer.

27
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,416
(INTERVIEWER) Er, I mean a computer...

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,579
If you ask Captain Apocalypse there...
Have you talked to this guy?

29
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:35,126
I feel like I'm writing intercontinental
ballistic missile routines here!

30
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,058
I just wanna win at chess.

31
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,836

Do not ever shoot at the sun,
you're gonna burn out the tube!

You're gonna shoot the rest

42
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,069
We want to be only inside.
That's it!

43
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,572
But computer chess goes back
even further,

44
00:02:54,741 --> 00:03:00,111
to the mechanical Turk, 1770,
the original chess-playing machine.

45
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,205
It played against and defeated
Benjamin Franklin

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,910
and Napoleon Bonaparte.

47
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,412
Well, he had a secret.

48
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,787
There was a human being
inside the machine.

49
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,622
Though the first was a fraud,
we're working to get back

50
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:20,096
to that level of chess play
when machine beats man.

51
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,101
I greet you for our annual North
American Computer Chess Tournament

52
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,503
and present you with a panel
of the best and the brightest.

53
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,771
From my left, there is Les Carbray
from Allied Laboratories.

54
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,106
Hi there.

55
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,809
Martin Beuscher,
sitting in for Tom Schoesser.

56
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,979
And that's last year's winner,
TSAR 2.0 from Caltech.

57
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:47,651
Roland McVey from MIT,
the programmers of STASIA.

58
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,196
And finally Mike Papageorge,
who is an independent programmer.

59
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,867
Is there a computer programme
in the house

60
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,030
which can stand up
to a human chess master?

61
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,439
That's me!
When will a machine beat me?

62
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,276
Many years ago
I made a public wager

63
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,475
that no computer would beat me
until the year 1984,

64
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,678
and that date is quickly coming up.

65
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,588
So what do you think, gentlemen?
Will I win my bet?

66
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,184
I... I think you're cutting it close,

67
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,255
but I think you will win that bet.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,269
Erm... If I was in your shoes,
I wouldn't extend it any.

69
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:37,638
I think within two years of that, 1986,

70
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,712
you won't stand a chance,

71
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,181
and I think that,
say another ten years after that,

72
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,378
there isn't a man or woman alive
who will stand a chance.

73
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,392
Well, there may be some disagreement,

74
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:58,486
but look at the speed with which
the technology, the software,

75
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,192
but particularly the hardware,
is progressing right now.

76
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,863
And just based on that speed,

77
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,274
barring a calamitous event
like World War III to set us back,

78
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,812
I truly believe it to be inevitable.

79
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,551
How about any of the other gentlemen,
do you have a thought on this?

80
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,619
Want to chime in?

81
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,083
This articulate panel?

82
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,715
We've experimented some
with parallel processing

83
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,884
and then we're doing selective search,

84
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,759
and all the algorithmic and software things
that we're doing

85
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,493
makes a difference,
it does make an improvement,

86
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,629
but it's dwarfed by the improvement
we get just with better hardware.

87
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,939
More memory and faster processor.

88
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,048
We're blessed at Allied
in that we have the equipment,

89
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,743
we have the resources
at our disposal, so...

90
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,789
The person I'm really excited to talk to
about real gains in software

91
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,689
is perhaps Tom Schoesser,

92
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,490
who I thought was going to be here
on this panel?

93
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,462
Yes, Professor Schoesser
will be here shortly,

94
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,999
he is delayed,
but he will be here.

95
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,262
OK, could you perhaps
talk about some of that?

96
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,669
Talk about advances?
Well, I...

97
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,738
I think it's safe to say that we're operating
in some of the same avenues as Allied,

98
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,972
but maybe Professor Schoesser
could speak more to that,

99
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,314
but I'm not necessarily certain
he would speak about it.

100
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,944
Well, anyway,
whatever you did last year was working

101
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,183
because TSAR 2.0 was the winner,

102
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,090
and they were especially good
about endgames,

103
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,630
and that's a place
where computer programmes often falter.

104
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:44,567
So I think what I'd like to show is an
example of what happened last year.

105
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,299
And I'm sorry
to do this to my friend right here, but...

106
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,402
So, STASIA versus DAWN.

107
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,515
Well, this should have been
an easy win for STASIA.

108
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:02,451
Any human being can see
that there's a forced queen-takes-queen,

109
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,921
and it's a very easy victory for White.

110
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:10,392
But instead... Queen checks.

111
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,826
Queen checks.

112
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,798
Check, check, check, check,
back and forth,

113
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,167
over and over again,
lost in a loop.

114
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,569
Very, very embarrassing,
wouldn't you say?

115
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:26,410
Er, yes.
It was not our finest moment.

116
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,946
But you bring up a good point.

117
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,481
I think we've seen a lot of increase
in hardware speed,

118
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,279
it's definitely led to stronger game play.

119
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,989
In fact I think we're searching the tree
deeply enough now

120
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,686
that we're catching
pretty much all of the tactical issues.

121
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,591
But STASIA's greatest weakness,

122
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:48,656
which I think is the same weakness
all our programmes share,

123
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:54,068
is that it really has a very poor
understanding of the positional issues.

124
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,507
So this year at MIT
we've hired a grandmaster to help us out.

125
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,704
He's helped us come up with a couple rules
on the endgame specifically

126
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,477
that will hopefully help us
avoid the comedy that we saw last year.

127
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,182
Mr Papageorge,
we haven't heard from you yet.

128
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,191
You usually have
a very unique opinion, so...

129
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,057
(CLEARS THROAT) Frankly Pat,

130
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,927
I have to tell you I find the programming
of my fellow competitors here

131
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,499
to be almost as boring as this discussion.

132
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,895
(LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING)

133
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,536
Why, because the machine can't compete
against the human soul?

134
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,798
(HENDERSON) Very interesting!

135
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,137
Sure, sooner or later
somebody's gonna write a programme

136
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,335
that's gonna beat you in '83, in '85,
who cares?

137
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,871
Listen, you guys
are just trying to eke out

138
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,109
one little victory
versus each other, you know?

139
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,650
You get here this year,
you get here next year.

140
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,880
My programme is seeking harmonies,
seeking innovations...

141
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,321
- I'm not entirely sure...
- That's what I'm doing!

142
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,255
...from the perspective of programming
that it actually means anything.

143
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,488
(PAPAGEORGE) Well, we'll see
when we get to the competition.

144
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,096
(WOMAN) Could you please
spell your name for me, sir?

145
00:08:55,268 --> 00:09:00,035
Sure, it's P-A-P-A-G-E-O-R-G-E.

146
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,968
I don't see anything here.

147
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,374
- I'm sorry.
- P-A-P-A-G-E-O-R-G-E?

148
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,878
- No.
- M-l-C-H-A-E-L?

149
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,448
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,714
I could call to one of the neighbouring
hotels and see if there's an available room.

151
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,050
No, I need to stay at this hotel
where the competition's being held!

152
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:30,360
(HENDERSON) Um, I am Pat Henderson,
I am very excited.

153
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,370
We have players from all over America,
Canada, Quebec...

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,065
Just great,
and we have something new this year,

155
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,304
we have a lady who is competing,
way in the back corner.

156
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm happy about that too,
she's welcome.

157
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,882
So, the way
this tournament works is this,

158
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,385
we play Swiss system -
that's five rounds.

159
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,720
That means everybody keeps playing.
If you lose, you play to the end.

160
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,692
However there is one big winner,

161
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,890
and that winner gets a $7,500 prize.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,366
And the other thing you get to do,
you get to play me.

163
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,003
Stick around for the last day

164
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:09,096
because I challenge
that winning chess programme.

165
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,736
This will be a gruelling couple of days,
so let's keep it light,

166
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,314
let's keep it collegial, be respectful,
and of course have fun.

167
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,906
Let's begin round 1.

168
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,913
(BEEPING)

169
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:33,054
So, er, Tom Schoesser -
is he showing up?

170
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,258
He's a good guy.
Way ahead of his time.

171
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,028
He's like Tesla, he's so far ahead.

172
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,671
I wanna talk to him about
the "Eureka moment".

173
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:45,675
And frankly, we're on the way to a kind
of timid strategy on the side of White.

174
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:52,409
I think the reason is, they are playing the
very, very strong Caltech TSAR 3.0 team.

175
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,348
In this case, maybe the programme
is trying for a draw?

176
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,187
In fact I defy anybody
to tell me any theory of Tesla's

177
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,591
that's been disproven today.

178
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,257
I mean,
wireless energy transfer,

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,868
radio before Marconi,

180
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,401
the spark plug,

181
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,562
alternating current engine...

182
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,297
Rook to D8.

183
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,067
- Maybe the Industrial Revolution.
- No, it says E8...

184
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,477
TSAR takes pawn.

185
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,107
Queen takes queen.

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,085
And rather than capture queen,
the rook just approaches it.

187
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,685
Is there any possibility
that this is, er...

188
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,264
some kind of, er, very advanced...

189
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,060
I mean, er...

190
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,466
we just gave up a queen to, er...

191
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,437
to get his queen there
and now we're basically just...

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,132
Well...

193
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,432
Um...

194
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,739
- Don't move that rook.
- All right?

195
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,314
- Be right back.
- Excuse me! Excuse me...

196
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,050
There seems to be a little glitch here,

197
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,088
maybe we should just
follow with the camera

198
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,248
and I'll look over here
at the STASIA SHORTSLEEV game.

199
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,054
We're having
serious technical problems,

200
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,891
- I need to run a very, very brief diagnostic.
- I'm sorry, once the clock has started...

201
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,557
There's a tiny...
I'm almost certain I know what it is,

202
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,429
it's just going to take
a moment of our time.

203
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,763
I appreciate that,

204
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,462
but unfortunately once the clock has
started we cannot halt the game.

205
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,269
OK, er...
That's understandable.

206
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,845
We can go ahead
and leave the clock running.

207
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,743
It's gonna be a very brief diagnostic.

208
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,575
I'm almost certain
I know what the issue is.

209
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,152
- I'm sorry, there's no adjusting the code.
- We're at a point now... this game is not...

210
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,188
And MIT just won.

211
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,989
Great playing everyone, great round.

212
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,966
I've got your new table assignments
up here on the projector.

213
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,694
Eight of you will be moving.

214
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,301
Er, let's be careful and,
of course, watch for cables.

215
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,705
Good luck.

216
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,879
Oh, God...

217
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,315
Peter, can you tell me
what's going on here?

218
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,527
I mean, chess is the game where you're
supposed to protect the king, right?

219
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,662
Yes.

220
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,288
Rather than sending him out to die
at the earliest opportunity.

221
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,798
- Is that right?
- Yes.

222
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,424
- Yeah?
- OK.

223
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:29,508
Do you have any idea what game it is
that TSAR is trying to play right now?

224
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,109
Can you enter the move?

225
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,843
(♪ BLUES TUNE ON ELECTRIC KEYBOARD)

226
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,672
Scotch, man?

227
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,668
God, yes.

228
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,078
Another of these
for the Rules Committee here?

229
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,976
(CHUCKLES) Thank you so much.

230
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,482
A lot of late night coding sessions
fuelled by this stuff.

231
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,445
You don't find it blurs your judgment?

232
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,882
I've got it down to a science, you see.

233
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,685
There's a sweet spot.

234
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,296
And the sweet spot is
three scotches.

235
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,265
Four?

236
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,496
You start to get a little bit drunk,
a little bit fuzzy.

237
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,266
One or two, it just doesn't work.

238
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,066
But on three scotches?

239
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:41,440
A man on three scotches could programme
his way out of any problem in the world.

240
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,547
(CHUCKLES)

241
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,487
Excuse me,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

242
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,092
OK.

243
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,797
Shelly, hi. Mike Papageorge.
I was one of the panellists.

244
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,303
- Hi.
- How you doing?

245
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,472
Fine.

246
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,108
I see you're with the MIT team.

247
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,404
That's wonderful, I think that we need
more women here at this conference.

248
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,275
I mean seriously,
you get all these guys together

249
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,815
to come up with a solution for this
problem, what do they come up with?

250
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,148
"Brute force." Brute force.
It's pathetic, really.

251
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,288
I'd be willing to bet
that you and I are the only ones here

252
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,256
who even understand
that programming has a feminine side.

253
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,125
Anyway, I would love to stay in your room
if you have an extra bed.

254
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,565
I... I'm so sorry
that you lost your room.

255
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,966
I... I don't have an extra bed.

256
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,471
Could I just crash on your floor
or something?

257
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,940
I just need, you know,
a blanket and a pillow really.

258
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,271
Just somewhere where I can crash
till tomorrow morning.

259
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,042
The thing is,
the computer's in my room, so...

260
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,881
I would probably need to check
with the team to make sure...

261
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,682
What, McVey?
He's fine, he loves me!

262
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,485
Excuse me.
Sorry to eavesdrop, but I don't think...

263
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,752
Can I help you guys with something?

264
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,691
Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to...
with the computer equipment in her room.

265
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,695
I... I just don't think
that's a good idea.

266
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:12,101
Sir, sir... we, unlike Shelly,
we have a double, we have plenty of space.

267
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,398
We'd be happy to have you stay with us.

268
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,303
- You can stay in our room.
- Yes, no problem.

269
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,761
What?

270
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,622
(MAN) So the thing, er...
the thing you got to remember is...

271
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,768
When I'm talking,
I'm not really talking, he's talking.

272
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,067
When I'm asking questions,
he's the one who's actually asking them.

273
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,435
He's just asking them through me.

274
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,276
You can answer me...

275
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,347
- But, but...
- It's all going back to him.

276
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,539
He's pulling the strings.

277
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,447
- How do you feel about that?
- I... I'm, er...

278
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,814
No, no, no!
You've got to answer me.

279
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,888
So...

280
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,790
explain this to me, because...

281
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,263
guys like you are, like,
from Mars, to me.

282
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,861
How does somebody
end up being you?

283
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,436
I mean, how do you get to be you?

284
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,201
- How do I get to be me?
- Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

285
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,072
- How do you have to be you?
- How do I <i>have</i> to be me?

286
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,269
Yeah.
How do you get to be you?

287
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,709
Well, it's hard to sum up.

288
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,283
For the most part
I'm doing what I love to do.

289
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,080
Um... but I've got
the resources that I need.

290
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,319
You know, I... if I need...

291
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:21,023
if I need hardware,
if I need computational cycles or whatever,

292
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,124
I mean, I've got that all on my...

293
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,099
No, but tell me, like, like, like...

294
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,067
Like, you get up and you... what?

295
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,869
You take a shower, you eat breakfast, you
get in your car, you get on the highway?

296
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,005
- I'm, er...
- What are you doing with your life?

297
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:41,410
I'm... developing
a computer chess programme!

298
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,253
Imagine a world where
children can hone their skills

299
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,689
playing against machines,

300
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,021
where you've almost got
an electronic chess coach...

301
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,532
But what if it's the computer honing
its skills playing against children?

302
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,691
Well, I think that's part of a...

303
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,837
I think that's part of a bigger question.

304
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,830
From a technical point of view.

305
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,931
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me that you have not...

306
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:08,739
had any interaction
with the Defence Department,

307
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:13,351
the Pentagon, DARPA,
the intelligence community, the entire...

308
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,543
- John invited me.
- Fine.

309
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,688
They don't call it the
"military-industrial complex" for nothing.

310
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,289
(VISITOR) Hey, how's it going?

311
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,957
Hey.

312
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,992
Welcome to our little
"after hours" joint here.

313
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,789
You want a beer, or you want some weed?
There's pills in the back.

314
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,524
Nah, I usually abstain.

315
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,132
(JOHN) Usually?

316
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,735
- Have a peanut, at least.
- All right.

317
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,998
- Let me... Let me...
- Actually I want one of those too.

318
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,768
...accept some assumptions
that I may not believe.

319
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,342
Let's say that, er...

320
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,479
Let's overstate my importance.

321
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,071
Let's say that,
yes, this work that I'm doing,

322
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,981
they're very interested

323
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,887
and they're looking at every theory
that I come up with

324
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:59,191
and applying this to their great
military machine, or intelligence machine.

325
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,299
- I mean, let's...
- (JOHN) It's not even a metaphor!

326
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,333
I mean, there are two sides,
different colours,

327
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,732
one of 'em's got to win,
one of 'em's got to lose.

328
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,839
It's gonna be ugly for the ones that lose.

329
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,498
There are "knights,"
there are "kings," there are "queens."

330
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,238
This is obviously a militaristic problem
that you're trying to solve.

331
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,938
(CAMERA CLICKING)

332
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,810
(CARBRAY) Are you...
are you trying to recruit me here?

333
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,182
Are you from the Pentagon?

334
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,723
Is there something
you're not telling me?

335
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,848
Er, I get around,
but that's not...

336
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,857
Oh, you get around?

337
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:35,056
If I'm all that you seem to be suggesting
that I am to the Pentagon,

338
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,794
then if I wasn't
performing this work

339
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,340
doesn't that mean that the Russians
are getting ahead of us? I don't think...

340
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:46,535
You can use that excuse for any atrocity
that's ever been committed.

341
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,374
"If I didn't do it somebody else would."

342
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,483
But on the other hand,
you seem to be making the argument

343
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,554
that if any form of research
has military potential

344
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:01,091
then it is something which
morally should not be researched.

345
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,888
- I asked if it would bother you...
- I think you halt human progress.

346
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,825
You halt human progress!

347
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,592
Chess is black and white.

348
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,667
(CARBRAY) Let's...
again, let's take this example,

349
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,166
I'm not in the world,
I'm not in the world...

350
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,771
It's not war, chess is not war.

351
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,232
It's like my uncle said,

352
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:25,581
"War is death, hell is pain,
chess is victory," and um...

353
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,478
I would rather play a game of chess

354
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:35,389
than go fight, get killed,
get a fuckin' bullet in the eye.

355
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,052
I enjoy it.

356
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,061
- I enjoy playing.
- Here you go. Enjoy that.

357
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,235
Thanks.

358
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,870
But what about...

359
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,208
What about the progress of A.I.?

360
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,839
You talk of its applications in war,

361
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,077
but how far has A.I. Really come?

362
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,485
Things evolve, this is true,
I'm not refuting that at all.

363
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,491
But if all computers can do is calculate,

364
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,823
then what about our basic
fundamental premise of intelligence?

365
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,696
What is artificial intelligence?

366
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,029
Let me stop you there for one second.

367
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,900
Why are you here?

368
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,237
To participate in a tournament,
to do the best you can,

369
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,472
in a field that you basically believe
is stagnant and you don't believe in?

370
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,138
I don't believe
in the dominant approach.

371
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,512
You guys figure this out.
You ever seen the knight's tour?

372
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,516
You've got to look at the real research.

373
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,780
- You do the knight's tour?
- Yeah.

374
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,083
You wanna see it?

375
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,556
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but, but...

376
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,288
(VISITOR) So many of my colleagues, I feel,
have a very narrow view.

377
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:51,302
There's a fundamental assumption that
all knowledge can be formally represented.

378
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,098
That all knowledge
can be reduced to numbers.

379
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,538
It needs to be an embodied sense...

380
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,767
(CARBRAY) But for God's sake,
you're in the academic world!

381
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,174
If anybody -
if <i>anybody</i> could get a grant,

382
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,077
if <i>anybody</i> could get this signed off

383
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,582
to do this kind of research,
it's you.

384
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,414
You're in an ideal position for that.
I'm not.

385
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,684
My employer probably doesn't see
any money in what you're talking about,

386
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:18,627
But you? You can go forth,
you can put these theories into practice.

387
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,493
You can write research papers on it.

388
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:24,693
(VISITOR) You would think
academia would be more promising,

389
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,895
er... but the dominant paradigm...

00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,495

this whole time?

391
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,699
- (VISITOR)... is very hard
to fight against. - No.

392
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,505
(VISITOR) I mean, I...
(JOHN) Why not?

393
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,603
(VISITOR) I've gone to
grad school for years,

394
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,581
because I was seeking
real artificial intelligence.

395
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,652
And real artificial intelligence, it's...

396
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,118
(CARBRAY) Let me ask you...

397
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,588
(JOHN) Real artificial intelligence?

398
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,159
Is that different
than artificial real intelligence?

399
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,852
(CARBRAY)
How significant is the research?

400
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,454
(VISITOR) In the last decade
the research hasn't been that significant,

401
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,861
even in the calculable world.

402
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,332

00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,555
You resigned?
Why?

503
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,717
Peter, you want to update Tom?

504
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,218
It, um...

505
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,795
I was just up all night debugging it
and I haven't come across anything.

506
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,990
- You were up all night?
- Yes.

507
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,864
OK, um...

508
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,061
How about you get a breath of fresh air
and we'll work on this?

509
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,469
Oh. OK.

510
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,603
- Roland, good to see you.
- Hey, Tom.

511
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,942
Good to see you.

512
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,448
So, er, I know
this is a little unorthodox,

513
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,952
but between gentlemen,

514
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,487
do you mind if we "unresign"?

515
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,623
Sure. Yeah.

516
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,487
- I just want to watch her play.
- It's OK with us.

517
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,659
OK.

518
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,870
Hey!

519
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,770
Hey, are you with the computer convention
over there?

520
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,106
Yeah, I think we met briefly
in the conference room, I'm Dave.

521
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,279
- You're...?
- Peter.

522
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,042
- Peter, nice meeting you. Yeah.
- Yes.

523
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,241
Hey, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

524
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,683
What are you guys doing in there?
(CHUCKLES)

525
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,687
Are those all the new computer models,
or what?

526
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,620
No, not really.

527
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,660
- They're new chess programmes.
- Oh, yeah?

528
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:41,425
Various... various people have written
their own chess programmes this year

529
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,693
- and it's a tournament for that.
- OK.

530
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:48,999
So the computers will face each other off
to see who's written the best programme.

531
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:54,477
OK, so... the computers play chess
versus other computers?

532
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,877
Yes.

533
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,276
Wow.

534
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,844
(CHUCKLES) Wow!

535
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,889
Well, I've got
a little convention here, too.

536
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,685
I mean, it's a couples group.

537
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,953
I don't know if you've ever done
any encounter stuff or anything like that.

538
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,618
You're probably a little young for that.

539
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,855
It's, um...

540
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,260
I don't know if you're into
any of the therapy at all...

541
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,891
Anyhow...

542
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,435
the guy, I don't know if you've
seen this guy - Keneiloe in there?

543
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,335
Big black guy.
I mean, he's from Africa!

544
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,442
So his perspective is really...
really heavy, you know?

545
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,669
I mean, his...

546
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,372
It's not like the western therapy trip
at all. It's like, er, it's really...

547
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,977
Oh, man.
Are you married?

548
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,086
- No.
- OK, well...

549
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,678
I mean,
all truths contain their opposite.

550
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,087
Without black you can't have white,
that sort of thing.

551
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,225
You understand, right?

552
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,661
It's like in order to know something you
have to forget it - that's why we seek it!

553
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,263
OK, OK...

554
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,564
I know what you're thinking,
"Who's this crazy guy?"

555
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,899
- No, it's nothing like that. - Yeah,
no, it's OK, it's OK, it's all right!

556
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,701
Well, I'm Dave.
Tell me your name again?

557
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,502
- Peter.
- Peter, right.

558
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,470
- Peter Bishton.
- Peter Bishton.

559
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,611

- Yes.

561
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,411
All right.
Hey, I'll see you.

562
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,959
(HENDERSON) There is an interesting tie
for second place

563
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,027
between STASIA and ADVANTAGE.

564
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,629
Three and a half points each.

565
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:24,963
Their only hope is that the top two teams
are going to draw,

566
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,900
but I think that's very unlikely
with CHECKERS and ALLIANCE,

567
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,170
two teams that are absolutely
going to go for the kill.

568
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,640
CHECKERS and ALLIANCE!

569
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,508
ALLIANCE,
a kind of traditional programme,

570
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,946
we like what they do,
but we can kind of figure it out.

571
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,418
But CHECKERS... I've talked about
this several times today -

572
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:47,786
very strange,
very idiosyncratic, very odd.

573
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:51,225
I talked to Mr Papageorge himself
and I said,

574
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,330
"What language is your programme in?"

575
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,432
And of course, he wouldn't tell me.

576
00:33:55,566 --> 00:34:00,469
So I talked to a couple of other programmers
and they said, "We have no idea.

577
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,574
"It could be Sanskrit,
it could be Pig Latin!"

00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,124

why it's committing suicide.

596
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,313
(CHUCKLES) It's not killing itself -
it's a computer.

597
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,882
It doesn't have will.

598
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,010
It's running software -
we wrote the software.

599
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:28,354
So there, it's going down the tree

600
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,360
and then it's calling
the evaluation function.

601
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,021
OK, so... keeping that in mind,

602
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,695
when you are compiling
with F77, this code...

603
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,969
The F77 that you're running
is not the standard one.

604
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:49,068
I wrote a new compiler, specific to
this hardware and this software.

605
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,714
- Say that again?
- So...

606
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,186
The compiler is adding instructions

607
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,346
to implement the machinery
of the optimisations

608
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,652
as it's compiling the lines that you see.

609
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,687
OK.

610
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,162
So you can see those lines of code,
but there's actually more being generated.

611
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,961
The system can improve itself
during the game - in the hash -

612
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,570
to run the evaluation and then
to store that evaluation in the hash.

613
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,604
With adjusted parameter settings...

614
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,140
To implement, say,
the transposition table...

615
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,503
Additional functionality...

616
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,407
That's right - everything
is not everything!

617
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,908
- What?
- There's more.

618
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,916
- OK... That's kind of new.
- Yeah.

619
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,793

00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,362

- OK.

00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,607
- I'm fine, thank you.
- OK.

627
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,205
Um, you know, when I was in grad school
I used to do some push-ups sometimes.

628
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,616
Keep my blood flowing.
Yeah.

629
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,619
No, I think I'm fine,
I don't need to do anything.

630
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,848
OK, no push-ups. So...

631
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,016

that's all.

in a tournament setting,

before the world championship in Lisbon,

637
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,446
and no one can catch up to us!

638
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,540
Because they haven't seen
the technology in action,

639
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,085
- because of this problem.
- Neither have we.

640
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,883
Yeah, well,
but we can go back to California

641

in the testing hardware

Um...

739
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,827
I had a theory that...

740
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,992
I don't think that TSAR
wants to play against computers.

741
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,036
And why do you say that?

742
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:53,209
Well, because last night
after we were working on it,

743
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,642
I took it to an MIT student's room

744
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,218
and I had their programme STASIA
play against ours.

745
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,412
Wait, you wheeled it over there?

746
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,389
I had a student help me, yes.

747
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,789
OK.

748
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,623
And what did you do
with the MIT team?

749
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:18,065
I just had one student play their programme
against ours, that's all.

750
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,532
OK.

751
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,969
I just wanted to see another game, and...

752
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,039
The idea I had is, I just had...

753
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,471
at first the two programmes
playing against each other,

754
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,678
and then I had that same student
start generating their own moves, and...

755
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,491
TSAR at first was doing very poor,
just like it had,

756
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,629
and when it started playing
against the student,

757
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,394
it was much more aggressive

758
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,366
and it played...
it performed better.

759
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,070
I... OK, er...

760
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:00,233
But this was just
part of a game last night, right?

761
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,777
How many moves?

762
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,472
Er... twelve or so.

763
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,048
OK, I...

764
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,412
We just didn't have enough time.

765
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:12,978
I appreciate your desire
to figure this stuff out,

766
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,683
but I just don't think
that that's enough data

767
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:20,991
to support this theory
about computers versus human opponents.

768
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,862

to run some more tests as well.

00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:39,916
No...

774
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,483
It's... It's still...

775
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,554
There's still
some significant evidence for it...

776
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:50,284
I know it's a bit unconventional,

777
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,052
but, um...

778
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,498

like Nikola Tesla...

779
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,897
Who has been talking to you
about Tesla?

780
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,730
Just some person who mentioned him.

781
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:05,273
I do not think that Tesla is a good
role model for your academic career.

782
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,071
That is the path to madness.

783
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,143
Do you know about confirmation bias?

784
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,479
Where you're blind to all the things
that will refute your theory

785
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,746
and you're fixating
on the things that support it?

786
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,248
This is a human trait,

787
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,488
and it's an issue that I've dealt with
in my own work in the past.

788
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,861
TSAR is a very complicated machine,

789
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,995
it has many components,
many connections between them.

790
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,301
And right now, some of those connections
are going a little wrong.

791
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,610

even more complex.

792
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:48,548
And I think that
with this theory of yours,

793
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,620
you're making
a few wrong connections.

794
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:57,159
And I'm worried that
if you're fixating on this

795
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,490
the balance of wrong connections
to right connections could shift,

796
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,691
and at that point
we've lost our sanity.

00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,690
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

849
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,827
You got one of those?

850
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,693
Yeah - they ran out of rooms so they had
to give me the honeymoon suite.

851
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,026
Mmm, nice.

852
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,498
Yeah, it is nice.

853
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,502
Just a matter of luck, I suppose.

854
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,338
Deeply, deeply in trouble.

855
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,251
Let's see what CHECKERS
comes up with.

856
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,452
So, Les...

857
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,821
When did the tables turn?

858
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,933
According to my evaluation,
ten moves ago I was up plus five.

859
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,628
But now it looks like I'm busted.

860
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:05,129
Do you have an evaluation transcript
over there?

861
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,005
I just get the moves on my print-out.

862
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,379
Well, there's got to be a record
of that evaluation somewhere.

863
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,345
Could I possibly get a transcript
of that after the game?

864
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,384
I can talk to the powers that be.

865
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,010
That would be great
if you could talk to the "powers that be" -

866
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,953
whoever they may be.

867
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,992
Put in a word for me, I could really use
a copy of that evaluation transcript.

868
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,823
I'll ask.
I'll ask for sure.

869
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,794
Thanks, Les.
Lester.

870
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,058
- Put in a word for me.
- I will. Will do.

871
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,791
You're welcome.

872
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,459
That's it.

873
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,662
- Thanks. Good game.
- Good game.

876
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,673
Les, I really would appreciate
a copy of that transcript.

877
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,678
- I'll ask for you...
- Yeah, please do.

878
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,374
I must say
that was a very intense game

879
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,817
played between
two wonderful computer chess players

880
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,321
- and we've seen some of the...
- What just happened?

881
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:58,086
I'm talking on camera.
Could you please move?

882
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,058
- I'm talking to my camera.
- I understand that, but...

883
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,788
Please talk to my Rules Committee
over here.

884
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,332
- This, the... Your Rules Committee?
- Thank you, John. Thank you.

is your Rules Committee?

886
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:09,667
That was an amazing game,
an extremely good computer programme.

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,672
What do you think the problem is?
You just saw...

888
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,336
Yes, I just saw
Allied win the tournament.

889
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,879
You just saw...
You just saw Goliath beat David.

890

You're rewarding 'em for it.

Is it OK?
I'm gonna bring him in.

00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,325
Hey, come on in.

00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,176
Yeah, our guy, Keneiloe,
he just says, "No...

919
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,405
"No alcohol, no dope."

920
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,175
Keneiloe is very strict
about that sort of thing.

921
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:04,652
Right, right. He says it's a
spiritual shortcut - unearned grace.

just a temporary hallucination

929
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,071

on their... on their consciousness,
just chemically.

He just wants to run away.

936
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,003
(DAVE) It's true,
I want to run away.

Hey, let me get you something -
a soda...

938
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,467
water from the tap,
something like that?

939
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:09,379
I know that you've told Dave all about
your computers and your technology,

940
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,888
but has Dave taken a moment
to tell you what we're doing here?

941
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:15,724
A little bit.

942
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:19,419
Don't you think it's strange
that we're all here at the same time?

943

Pauline and I don't actually believe
there's such a thing as...

944
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,226
Coincidence.

945
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,825
...coincidence.
- Yeah.

946
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,929
We're all kind of like seekers here.

947
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,275
You know what I think
is so neat about you guys

948
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:44,046
is you're kind of like mental explorers.

949
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,245
Hmm.

950
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,481
You know,
I mean, with the computers

951
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,954
you're kind of like way out there
like Columbus,

952
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,218
sailing the ocean blue,
uncharted new territory.

953
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,954
You don't know
what you're going to find.

954
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:56,223
There may be something really beautiful
on the other side.

955
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,495
But Peter, did you ever ask yourself,

956
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,935
"How many squares
are there on a chessboard?"

957
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,463
64.

958
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,303
It's an eight-by-eight grid.

959
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,674
Well, but don't you see
how limited that is?

960
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,940
No...

961
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:17,583
It's actually very complex when you start
to think about it as a programming problem.

962
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,350
Just the number of possible games
explode exponentially with each move.

963
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,894
It's close to 10 to 120th power,

964
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:30,898
and to try and compute all those games

965
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,094
might take even longer
than humanity would be around to do so.

966
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,262
Oh, wow.

967
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,708
Oh, man.

968
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:44,069
But look at the whole world -

969
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,011
you want to be the best chess player,

970
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,913
and that's beautiful, it is,

971
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,748
and I honour the beauty of that,

972
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,288
and the passion
you have to do a thing like that.

973
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:59,384
But I have to be truthful and tell you that
it also breaks my heart just a little bit,

974
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:05,161
because you could be
the greatest chess master who ever lived

975
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:09,567
and still not begin
to tap into your full potential!

976
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,367
I don't want to be a chess player,
it's programming...

977
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,305
(DAVE) Right, right,
but if you're a programmer,

978
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,912
you know, the best programmer,
I mean, you could be the greatest...

979
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,310
I mean, he could be the president of IBM...

980
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:21,906
Well, Dave, he could be the President
of the United States and...

981
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,145
(BOTH) Right, and still not live up
to his potential.

to be your parents, and...

sit down on the bed next to us?

01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,997
(GIGGLES, SNORTS)

1017
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,109
What do you like, Peter?

1018
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,913
Peter, you know,

1019
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:08,881
giving pleasure
and receiving pleasure...

1020
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,387
they're the same thing.

1021
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,753
(WHISPERS) Two wants to be three.

1022
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,127
Papageorge.

1023
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,564
Freddy.

1024
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,902
I was talking to John.

1025
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,100
He said that you were gonna pay us.

1026
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:40,648
He thought that you were
gonna win that prize, the money...

1027
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,185
I was planning on winning that prize.

1028
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,055
But you...

1029
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,783
You guys worried about the money
that I owe you?

1030
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,950
Well, we got bills.
You took pills from us.

1031
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,755
Yeah, I got bills to pay.

1032
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,259
All right, well...

1033
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,368
I haven't had a chance to leave
the hotel yet to get any money.

1034
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,732
I don't have a car.

1035
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,739
I don't know when you guys would have
expected me to go get the money -

1036
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,933
I've been here the whole time.

1037
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,338
- I have a car.
- You have a car?

1038
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,741
They got this guy there
- this African guru.

1039
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,541
I mean, I don't even know
if he really <i>is</i> African.

1040
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,479
The guy's probably from Detroit
or something.

1041
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,209
They're just chanting and ranting...

1042
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,185
Uh, I tell you.
It's all over for the white man.

1043
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,661
I wonder how much those people paid
for that conference anyway?

1044
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:28,195
At least I got my catharsis for free.

1045
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,388
(CLEARS THROAT) Blllaah!

1046
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,228
Freddy!

1047
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,195
It's marketing.

1048
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,432
Right.

1049
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,168
- Tom Schoesser.
- Tom?

1050
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,642
He sold his programme to Allied Labs,
that's what happened.

1051
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,270
TSAR threw the competition.

1052
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,177
He sold his programme to Allied,

1053
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,285
and they plugged it into their machine,
and that's the machine that beat me.

1054
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,250
I mean, come on,
it's just the Turk all over again!

1055
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,186
Instead of a man
hiding inside of a machine,

1056
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,814
it's a programme
hiding inside of another programme.

1057
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,494
Mediocrity triumphs again.

1058
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,654
Always.

1059
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,524
Just take... just take...

1060
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,135
Just take a mediocre...
Just take a mediocre programme

1061
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,602
and turbo-charge it.

1062
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,732
Just take something mediocre
and turbo-charge it.

1063
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,952
OK.

1064
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,551
We've made some strides this year,

1065
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,054
we've had a couple of issues
on the other hand.

1066
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:34,892
I apologise to anybody here
who has had cat allergies.

1067
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,429
Miaow!

1068
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,090
It's not gonna happen next time,

1069
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,168
we're gonna be in a different hotel,
don't worry about it.

1070
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:45,699
So now we go onto the awards -
the real reason we're here today.

1071
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,469
So we're gonna start with the third prize,

1072
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,842
and the winner of course
is the STASIA team,

1073
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,941
and that is led
by our dear friend Mr McVey.

1074
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,143
(APPLAUSE)

1075
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,881
You guys come up.

1076
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,990
(HENDERSON) He's very generously
bringing his team up.

1077
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,294
Congratulations to a great team.

1078
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,167
Really beautiful programming...

1079
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,735
This is the team that's got a lady on it -
there she is.

1080
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:27,576
That's the first time for our conference
and we welcome her.

1081
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,582
Thanks for being here.

1082
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,084
Thank you.

1083
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,388
The STASIA team!

1084
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,516
(APPLAUSE)

1085
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,928
Before we present the second prize,
we have a little surprise -

1086
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,899
an amusement from the NOOG team.

1087
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,904
I'm gonna get this right,
this is what the NOOG team has set up.

1088
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:55,170
They wrote up a little programme, it's
up here, to run a predictive algorithm.

1089
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,244
They charted every room

1090
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,214
that Mr Papageorge has attempted
to stay in over the weekend.

1091
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,947
They spit out a prediction
of what room he would end up in -

1092
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,819
and that is Room 217.

1093
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,654
That's the big winner.
217!

1094
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,125
(WHISPERS) That's just a math joke...
a math joke.

1095
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:17,858
OK. (CLEARS THROAT)
Is Mike in the room?

1096
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,626
Is Mike here?

1097
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:32,278
All right, boys or gentlemen -

1098
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:35,009
or young men,
or whatever you want to call yourselves -

1099
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,550
it's time for your refreshment.

1100
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,153
- Thanks, Mom.
- Well, you're quite welcome.

1101
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,415
And by the way, Freddy,
do you know Luke?

1102
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,424
No, I don't know Luke.

1103
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,552
Well, it's time you got acquainted.
Do you know Luke?

1104
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:48,253
No, I don't know Luke.

1105
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,462
Luke 15:11 through 32.

1106
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,700
Try and decode this one.

1107
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,965
So, Luke tells... these are parables,
these little stories.

1108
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:00,302
Like "The Prodigal Son",
that's a parable.

1109
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,034
There's one about the lost coin,

1110
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,112
a woman who was
preparing for a wedding

1111
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,771
and she had to have so many coins,
and she lost one.

1112
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,010
And she just tore the house up
looking for that coin.

1113
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,883
All right?
Now it's called the Holy Bible.

1114
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,288
Well, Bible means book.

1115
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,824
- And what does "holy" mean?
- Blessed.

1116
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,385
(PAPAGEORGE) Mom, where is the box?
I left a little box here.

1117
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,896
It's a small wooden box, Mom!

1118
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,932
I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen any kind of box.

1119
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,070
(PAPAGEORGE)
You must have moved it somewhere!

1120
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,694
I left it right here.

1121
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,272
Well, if I moved it,
I was unconscious.

1122
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:36,538
Look... you know that shelf
your daddy built above the tub?

1123
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:39,272
(PAPAGEORGE) It's a small wooden box.
It has money in it.

1124
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,381
(MOM) Wow.

1125
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:44,213
You know, there was an old man
called Uncle Otto.

1126
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,948
And he was nobody's uncle
but everybody's uncle.

1127
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,024
And he hid his money
in a fruit jar, sealed it...

1128
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,117
- I don't have time for this story
right now! - ...and buried it...

1129
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,060
- I need to find this box! It has money in it!
- ..in a horse's stall out in the big barn.

1130
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,657
- Well, the barn caught on fire, and...
- It's a small wooden box. It has money in it!

1131
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:03,329
...the whole thing collapsed.
Tin was covering up his fruit jar.

1132
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:07,067
And he finally had confessed the story
to his neighbours,

1133
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:10,701
they came in and dug and looked
and never found it.

1134
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:14,473
- Two years later, in some muck...
- It's a small wooden box.

1135
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,177
...and some brush and some moss...
- It has money in it.

1136
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,550
...in a creek, the jar was discovered.

1137
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,247
It was perfectly sealed.

1138
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,053
The money was there,
but Uncle Otto was gone.

1139
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,595
(HENDERSON) Lost in a loop...

1140
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,299
Thank you.

1141
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,370
(HENDERSON)
And he's taking the cheque.

1142
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,268
I would too.

1143
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:42,805
Very inventive programme,
very bold this year.

1144
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,907
Another round of applause for this guy.
He really is a winner.

1145
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,922
Smile for the camera.

1146
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,427
- And thank you. All right.
- Thank you.

1147
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,961
OK, this marks the official end
to our tournament this year.

1148
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,105
For those of you who are not getting
immediately on an airplane,

1149
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,369
I advise you come around tomorrow
for a spectacular game

1150
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,309
between the winning ALLIANCE team,
computers,

1151
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,972
and me, a human person.

1152
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:24,246
- That's it. Man versus
machine. Right, Les? - Right.

1153
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,445
OK.
The adventure continues,

1154
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:28,614
and we're gonna see
all you folks next year.

1155
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,247
(APPLAUSE)

1156
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,963
Thank you.
Thank you all so much for coming.

1157
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,228
We really look forward to seeing
what you bring next year.

1158
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,838
The adventure continues.

1159
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,245
Are you sure I can't get you something?

1160
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,049
- No.
- Shirley Temple?

1161
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:05,851
Can you just leave me alone?

1162
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,298
Hi, Peter.

1163
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:14,098
- May I have a glass of house red, please.
- Sure.

1164
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,065
Thank you.

1165
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,867
Talk about complex systems.

1166
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,274
I heard a new phrase the other day:
"Garbage in, garbage out."

1167
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:27,313
You input garbage into the computer,
or the data, you're gonna get it out.

1168
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,508
But the programme is perfect!

1169
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,916
The programme calculated exactly
what you wanted. You know?

1170
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,680
You want to know the real future
of computers?

1171
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,381
Tell me.

1172
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,890
Dating.

1173
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,063
You mean computers are going
to start dating each other?

1174
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,097
- No.
- Science of attraction?

1175
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:46,996
We'll use 'em for dating.

1176
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,269
You know,
we got a couple young people here.

1177
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:53,067
- I want to hear this.
- What attracts them to each other?

1178
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:56,440
I'm wondering
if you could programme a computer,

1179
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:59,139
you know, with the inputs
on these signs of attraction?

1180
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,146
- It's all about strategy.
- Right.

1181

I don't have one.

1187
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:17,320
I'll tell you. When I met my wife,
years ago in college,

1188
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,435
I knew her one day
before we had that magical moment.

1189
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,630
So what happens with that?

1190
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,072
When people see each other
and get that reaction? I mean...

1191
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,508
I mean... You're a video guy.

1192
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,239
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what do you see, man?

1193
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,646
What do I see?

1194
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,115
What do you see?
Yeah.

1195
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,985
I don't know - you want to look
through the camera and see what I see?

1196
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,690
You want to look through the camera?

1197
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,056
Yeah.

Go pick it up.

1199
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,493

- No.

- Check it out.
- OK.

1201
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,995
Wow!
Wow, wow, wow.

1202
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,121
Have you, in your dealings
with the other teams,

1203
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:20,024
heard any rumours or speculation

1204
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,996
that the Allied Labs team

1205
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:27,330
paid Professor Schoesser
to throw the tournament?

1206
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:28,469
No.

1207
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,570
Good.

1208
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,163
I can tell you
that that is completely false.

1209
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:37,710
Have you heard another rumour

1210
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,249
that there's been interest
from the Pentagon in our project?

1211
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,651
No.

1212
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,254
That one's true.

1213
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,257
And, in fact, they've been
following the project for some time.

1214
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,659
They're aware of the failures
we've been having

1215
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:59,063
and they don't understand them either.

1216
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,136
And the reason the Professor was late
to the tournament

1217
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:07,675
was because they had detained him
for some sort of questioning.

1218
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,679
I want to tell you something
that I haven't told anyone else.

1219
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,982

with this information.

You know that my own work
is primarily experimental psychology -

broader applications or implications

1222
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,766

that we're doing?

I was doing this,

1225
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:47,571
I used some of the TSAR software
in a personal project.

1226
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,880
I was up very late one night -

1227
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,114
in the lab running experiments -
I saw something anomalous...

1228
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,815
something that I told myself
for a long time didn't happen,

1229
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,724
that it was some kind of a practical joke,
or RF interference -

1230
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,457
something deeper and stranger,
possibly more exciting!

1231
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:07,467
I saw something that night
that I can only describe as chilling.

Peter, your strange ideas from last night -
they really got to me.

1242
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,417
This morning I woke up
and everything was weird.

1243
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,887
I walked out into the lobby
of the conference

1244
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:53,859
and I looked down and everybody
looked like they were chess pieces.

1245
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:58,262
I saw Professor Schoesser standing there -
he was the king,

1246
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:03,668
and Henderson was zig-zagging,
going diagonals like a bishop.

1247
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:08,367
And there was a student
who was stepping forward,

1248
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,510
just like a pawn.

1249
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,670
And just as he was about
to hit Professor Schoesser,

1250
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:16,376
his wife swooped in to defend him,
just like a queen.

1251
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:21,046
And I kept thinking
that a knight was gonna teleport...

1252
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,920
Did you see any teleportation?

1253
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,484
No.

1257
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,696

No.

01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,343
