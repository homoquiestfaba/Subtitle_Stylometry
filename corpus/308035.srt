1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,958
- That's not the Girl Scout salute.
- Oh.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,349
- Wrong hand, Peterson.
- Oh, well, okay.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,193
So I was never a Girl Scout,
but I'm telling you the truth, Brackett.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,715
I swear.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,519
Okay, so tell me.
What's LDF?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,878
"LDF is a genetically engineered hormone
for dairy cows. It could be the fir..."

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,157
Somebody's trying to kill us
over a cow hormone?

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,959
"Could be the first commercial success
of genetic engineering...

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,349
that directly affects food
for humans."

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,195
"Milk Hormone Stirs Fear."
Okay, now we're talkin'.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,989
"LDF milk tests will be reviewed
by State's Agricultural
Committee Chairwoman...

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,435
Gayle Robbins."
Bingo!

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,317
- You wanna know about LDF?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,799
You've come to
the right place.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,791
- In English, Sam, please.
- Okay, here's the deal.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,997
Normally it takes a calf two years to
mature into a milk-producing cow, right?

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,231
So, Chess figured, why wait
that long taking care of a calf?
It's not making you any money.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,915
So they invent this hormone LDF. They
shoot that stuff into a newborn calf.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,675
Nine months later, you got
yourself a full-grown,
milk-producing, moneymaking...

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,797
- Franken-cow.
- That's exactly what I thought at first.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,348
But then from what we hear the cows
are healthy, and the tests show...

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,431
I hates these tours!

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,159
And the tests show that the milk's,
uh, pure. So, there you go.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,708
Say, what kind of profits can
Chess make on a thing like this?

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,076
Thing?
This thing, my boy, could revolutionize
the entire worldwide dairy industry.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,799
Potentially the biggest moneymaker
that a chemical company has seen...

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,757
- since NutraSweet.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,796
- Yeah.
- So, how much can they make?

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,440
Oh, somewhere in the neighbourhood
of a billion dollars a year.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,399
- Oh, nice neighbourhood.
- Yeah. I wouldn't mind
living there myself.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,391
Oh, hi.
You got out early.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,519
One of the advantages
of being chairperson.
You get to adjourn the meetings.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,636
- How'd that school board thing work out?
- Oh, nothing to worry about.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,473
- Uh, these are friends
of mine from Chicago.
- Oh, hi. Gayle Robbins.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,959
- Peter Brackett from the <i>Chronicle.</i>
- Yes.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,109
- And this is Sabrina, uh...
- Peterson.

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,156
Of the <i>Globe.</i>
Sorry.

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,708
Yes. It's nice to meet you.
Sam, are we having a press conference?

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,950
No, no, no. They're just doing
some research on LDF, that's all.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,632
- Really?
- Yep.
- What do you think?

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,631
We were just gonna ask you
that same question,
being the head of the committee.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,915
Uh, it really doesn't behove
the Senator to render an opinion
on that matter...

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,230
- Sam!
- All right, go ahead and render.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,437
Give me a buzz after the FD A completes
its review. We'll talk then.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,795
- Ready, Senator?
- Sam.

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,394
I know, Pete. You got like a thousand
questions, right? Okay, okay.

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,349
Look, I got a, an hour here.
Okay? What do you say I take
both of you to dinner, huh?

48
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,271
On the house?

49
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,589
Two New Yorks, rare.

50
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,434
And one steamed vegetable plate,
no salt, no oil, no butter.

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,431
Thank you.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,478
So, you started to say that during
Vietnam, Chess manufactured...

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,314
Oh, you know, just things like
napalm, Agent Orange, you know?

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,799
All that wonderful stuff.

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,155
And then the war ended and
their profits really dried up.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,879
For a while, it looked like the
company was on its last legs.

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,076
And then, along comes
the genetic revolution.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,675
And boy,
things really heated up for them.
LDF could put them right back on top.

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,194
- What's the Chess family like?
- Oh, boy.

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,353
Well, the old man's
a real zealot, you know?
He's kinda like a Ross Perot wannabe.

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,079
His kid, Willy, kind of runs things now.
I don't know too much about him.

62
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,230
I think he went to Yale,
and then straight to work for Daddy.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,153
- Did you know him at Yale?
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,595
No, I think he's younger than me. How
did you remember that I went to Yale?

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,116
That is incredible.
You've got such an amazing memory.
I can't remember my own name.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,273
It's possible that I met him
at school, but I doubt it.
I don't even think he graduated.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,352
What year would he have been
if he had graduated?

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,476
I don't know.
Let me think. Uh...

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,950
- What year did you graduate?
- Me? '73. No, '74.

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,349
So that would make him class of
'76, '77, something like that.

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,795
You know, Gayle's met him a few times.
He's supposed to be a nice guy.

72
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,714
Not exactly a rocket scientist,
but he...

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,873
What's going on here exactly, guys?
I mean, why are you
so interested in LDF, huh?

74
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,033
Oh, Peterson here is
a big milk drinker. That's all.

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,951
Oh, well, it d...
It does a body good.

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,198
Sorry. C'mon, you're not
gonna tell me?

77
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,158
It's gotta be somethin' big if
both the <i>Globe</i> and the <i>Chronicle</i>
are in bed together on it.

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,789
I wouldn't say we're exactly
in bed together.

79
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,718
Cheque, please.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,949
Oh. Okay, now.
In case you have any more questions...

81
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,350
or if you finally decide
to tell me what you've
actually got up your sleeve...

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,351
- here's my card, Pete.
It's got my direct dial on it.
- Oh, thanks, Sam.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,589
- Where are you parked?
- In the lot over there.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,069
Oh, perfect.
We're gonna pass by...

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,914
- the best frozen yogurt joint
in the entire state.
- Yeah?

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,991
It's on Peterson.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,319
- Look out!
- Sam!

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,960
Move!

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,477
Sam, are you okay?

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,791
What the hell
was that all about?

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,591
Medwick, it's me.
Just checking in.

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,671
Listen, I've put together a
"just the facts, ma'am" kind of thing...

93
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,079
and wanted to
run it by you, okay?

94
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,230
<i>- They know you're there?</i>
- Uh, no.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,117
- I guess so far
they don't know we're here.
<i>- You're lucky.</i>

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,158
Yeah, real lucky.
So, here's what we know:

97
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,356
Beekman was the head researcher
on LDF.

98
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,908
He retires mysteriously,
then dies a week later.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,959
His son boards a train with something
in his briefcase that his dad sent him.

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,431
The train crashes, the son dies,
and the briefcase is stolen.

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,956
The kid who stole it is murdered,
but before he dies he writes
the initials "LD" on his palm.

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,316
LD means LDF, and LDF means
a billion dollars a year.

103
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,597
So you tell me.
All this adds up to...

104
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,558
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to Chess Chemical.

105
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,758
Our first stop on today's tour
will be the Chess Family
Science Discovery Centre.

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,469
Now, as we walk in pairs
down the Biology of Tomorrow corridor...

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,951
I'd like to point out some of the
everyday products created here at Chess.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,952
For example, the cold medicine
that I forgot to take this morning...

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,157
as well as the disposable diapers
I used for my little one last night.

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,878
Now, as we continue on...

111
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,078
Extension 307 is a 72-year-old
cafeteria worker named Sadie.

112
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,991
Hair net,
orthopaedic shoes.

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,638
Are you sure?
Maybe it was 3-0-something else.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,917
No, no, no. I'm positive.
Here, look.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,232
Well, do you wanna get out of here,
or take a stroll down
the Biology of Tomorrow corridor?

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,869
Rule number one of
investigative reporting, Peterson,
is find out what you're up against.

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,556
- Let's stroll.
- What's rule number two?

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,270
Stay clear of all surveillance cameras
when visiting the lair of the enemy.

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,354
Thanks.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,359
- Thank you.
- No problem.

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,716
- Wilson Chess.
- Sabrina Peterson.

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,032
- And Mr Peterson?
- Actually, the name's Brackett.

123
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,588
Peter Brackett,
the writer.

124
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,593
Of course. Well, what brings you
to this neck of the woods?

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,989
I'm doin' a little research
on a new novel, Wilson.

126
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,911
You're kidding?
What, here at Chess?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,231
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the new one about?

128
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,676
It's a murder mystery set against
the backdrop of a chemical company.

129
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,550
Sounds intriguing, but I'm always
a sucker for a good murder yarn.

130
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,033
- Aren't you, Miss Peterson?
- As long as the bad guy gets
it in the end, I'm happy.

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,638
W-Well, have fun.
And don't forget to change
the names to protect the innocent.

132
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,280
So much for rule number three:
Avoid insulting...

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,316
the men who may be trying
to kill you.

134
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,675
- Oh, uh, I was just looking for
you, sir. Here, look at this.
- Hello.

135
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,432
- It's fine.
- You look very nice today.
- Thank you.

136
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,080
- Check this one out.
- We missed you for lunch. It was...

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,116
...right through to
the research farm behind me...

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,272
where scientists are fine-tuning
Mother Nature with such innovative...

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,797
products for the future as the
Livestock Development Factor, LDF.

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,757
Now, if you'll come with me,
I'd like to show you a film...

141
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,752
that highlights some of the exciting
things we're doing here at Chess.

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,513
Don't worry, parents.
It's G-rated.

143
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,750
- Hey, where'd you guys go on your break?
- We looked for you.

144
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,796
- We did.
- Oh, I had to go to the lab.

145
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,759
Rule number four: Get close to someone
who's close to the enemy.

146
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,149
How am I supposed
to calm down?

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,231
You promised me this was going
to be taken care of...

148
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,073
and now they are here
in my building.

149
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,277
Ernesto, I can't
handle this any more.

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,397
Just make it happen.

151
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,869
- You want us to pick you up
at Ruby's tonight?
- Oh, I'll meet you there.

152
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,316
It's better if we take our own cars,
in case one of us gets lucky.

153
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,198
You mean, in case
there's a miracle, right?

154
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,952
You never know.

155
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,872
Well, what do you know?
Huh.

156
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,952
Evans, this is great. This is good.
You got any leads on 'im?

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,871
<i>- Pete, I'm looking for</i>
<i>some more information on...</i>
- Come in.

158
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,078
<i>- Hello? Mr Brackett?</i>
- Hi.

159
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,832
<i>Mr Brackett, we haven't come up</i>
<i>with anything yet, but when we do...</i>

160
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,310
Yeah, okay. Well, stay on it
and I'll check with you later.

161
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,799
Yeah.

162
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,757
Interesting news.

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,956
It seems Willy Chess
did go to Yale.

164
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,873
- Who's Ernesto Vargas?
- Well, that's the interesting news.

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,236
The reason Sam was confused about
whether or not Chess graduated...

166
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,470
- is because he was expelled.
- For?

167
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,879
Burning down
the English Department.

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,030
Somethin' about a problem
with one of his professors.

169
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,908
Young Willy and his cohort,
this South American kid Vargas...

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,630
they decided to torch the place
for revenge, and they were
caught and properly booted out.

171
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,995
A fire back then,
a fire at Beekman's.

172
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,117
A South American friend,
a South American assassin.

173
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,668
- Where's Vargas now?
- Evans can't seem to get a line on him.

174
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,116
- Maybe Sam could help.
- Yeah. Good idea.

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,031
Good idea.

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,870
You don't know
what I did with his, uh...

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,197
Thank you.

178
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,273
By the way, I dressed like this
because I figured this is the way...

179
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,430
you're supposed to dress
at these pickup places...

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,398
and I didn't want
to stand out or anything.

181
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,916
Yeah. No chance of anyone
noticing you, Peterson.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,116
- That's good thinking.
<i>- Sam Smotherman's office.</i>

183
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,713
- Hi. Is he in?
<i>- Who's calling, please?</i>

184
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,631
- Peter Brackett.
<i>- Just a minute.</i>

185
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,156
By the way, Peterson, that reminds me.
We never did finish
that other discussion.

186
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,719
- What other discussion?
<i>- Pete, hello.</i>

187
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,552
Sam, how ya doin'?

188
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,596
Well, I'm all right,
believe it or not.

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,672
Well, I knew you'd recover. Listen,
can you check on an old Yalie for me?

190
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,876
A name came up. We can't seem
to get a lead on the guy.

191
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,632
I'm sorry. Just one second.
Sure. Who is he?

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,870
<i>Well, he was at Yale</i>
<i>the same time as Willy Chess.</i>

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,077
- His name is, uh, Ernesto Vargas.
- Bargas?

194
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,355
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Vargas with a "V" like Victor.</i>

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,352
Oh, Vargas. That doesn't sound familiar,
but I'll check him out.

196
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,113
All right.
Well, look, I'm gonna be in and out,
so if you come up with anything...

197
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,431
<i>like where he is or how we can reach</i>
<i>him, call my office, ask for Evans.</i>

198
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,511
Yeah, I'll make a deal with you,
though. I find this Vargas guy...

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,875
then you're gonna clue me in
on what you're workin' on?

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,633
If he finds Vargas, will we clue
him in on what we're working on?

201
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,119
No.

202
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,031
You got it, buddy! Thanks a lot.
I'll see ya later.

203
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,476
Rule number five, Peterson:
Always humour those who can help you.

204
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,199
Now, what other conversation
did you want to finish?

205
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,748
Oh, the one about me
wanting to get you in the sack.

206
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,195
Oh, that. Well, forget it.
I didn't really think...

207
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,033
No, no, no, Peterson.
This is important.

208
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,511
I want you to know that I see you
strictly as a fellow newspaperman.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,272
I mean that sincerely.

210
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,273
I see you as nothing else,
and I never will.

211
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,555
You have my word on it.

212
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,835
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,310
Well, thanks.
That makes me feel really good.

214
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,470
I appreciate it.
I, I, I, I do. Thanks.

215
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,391
You're welcome, kid.

216
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,592
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>a heartache tonight</i>

217
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,194
<i>A heartache tonight</i>
<i>I know</i>

218
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,437
<i>Gonna be a heartache tonight</i>
<i>The moon shinin' bright</i>

219
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,717
Kim, introduce me.

220
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,429
Michael, this is Robin.
Robin, this is Michael.

221
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,397
- Hi.
- Robin's thinking of moving here.

222
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,358
Do it. We need more cute babes
in this town.

223
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,671
Yeah, right. Like there aren't
already four babes to every man.

224
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,957
- Kim, look who's here.
- Dixon, what are you doing here?

225
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,430
- Didn't your wife just have a baby?
- I'm celebrating!

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,351
- Yeah, right.
- Dance?
- Sure.

227
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,113
That's the other problem.
Small town, big chemical company.

228
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,395
Everybody knows
everything about...

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,273
Whoa, daddy!
Look what just walked in.

230
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,919
<i>Somebody's gonna hurt someone</i>

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,479
<i>Before the night is through</i>

232
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,391
Who? The guy
with the black suit?

233
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,951
<i>Somebody's gonna come undone</i>

234
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,270
<i>There's nothin' we can do</i>

235
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,229
You don't think he's like
off-the-charts hot?

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,394
I don't know that I'd go right to
off-the-charts. You think so?

237
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,358
I know so.

238
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,671
I also know I haven't been laid
in more months than I care to admit.

239
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,236
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,675
- How ya doin'?
- Ooh, great now.

241
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,988
Good.

242
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,513
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Absolutely.

243
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,751
- I'll have what the lady's having.
- Comin' right up.

244
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,558
I'm fine, thank you.

245
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,198
<i>I don't like you</i>

246
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,273
- I'm David.
- I'm horny.

247
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,239
<i>Seems that I'm always</i>

248
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,959
<i>- Thinkin' of you</i>
- Oh!

249
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,679
<i>Ohh-ohh-ohh</i>

250
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,354
<i>You treat me badly</i>

251
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,954
<i>I love you madly</i>

252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,635
<i>You've really got a hold on me</i>

253
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,678
<i>Really got a hold on me</i>

254
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,230
<i>You really got a hold on me</i>

255
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,710
<i>You really got a hold on me</i>

256
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,554
<i>Baby, I love you</i>

257
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,633
<i>And all I want you to do</i>

258
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,597
<i>Is just hold me</i>

259
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,513
<i>Hold me</i>
<i>Hold me</i>

260
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,752
<i>- Hold</i>
- Do you wanna dance?

261
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,513
<i>- Hold</i>
- I'd love to.
- Wh...

262
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,510
<i>Tighter, honey</i>

263
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,629
<i>Tighter</i>

264
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,079
<i>Tighter</i>

265
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,631
<i>Ohhh</i>

266
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,508
<i>I don't wanna leave you</i>

267
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,319
<i>Don't wanna stay here</i>

268
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,393
<i>Don't wanna spend</i>

269
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,517
<i>Another day here</i>

270
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,355
<i>Ooh, I wanna split now</i>

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,352
<i>But I just can't quit now</i>

272
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,750
<i>You've really got a hold on me</i>

273
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,196
<i>- Really got a hold on me</i>
<i>- You got me</i>

274
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,913
<i>- You really got a hold on me</i>
<i>- You really got a hold on me</i>

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,076
<i>- You really got a hold on me</i>
<i>- You really got a hold on me</i>

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,311
Hey, Peterson.

277
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,517
I'm sorry.
I lost track of time.

278
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,639
No problem.
I'm sure you were...

279
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,156
I mean,
I imagine you were...

280
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,516
Not that I was sitting here imagining
anything, because I wasn't.

281
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,479
- What time is it?
- It's a little after 4:00.

282
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,312
I see. Fine.

283
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,154
So, um, it's late, so let's
just go, okay, Brackett?

284
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,233
And, by the way, do you mind
if I drive, because...

285
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,039
Just because I'm the woman
doesn't always mean I wanna be
the passenger, okay?

286
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,714
Peterson,
I didn't sleep with her.

287
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,917
Excuse me. Did I ask you
if you slept with anybody?

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,959
No, no, no, no, no.
I just wanted you to know.

289
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,238
Look, Brackett, however you choose to
get your information is your business.

290
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,515
Did you lift her security pass
is all I wanna know.

291
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,397
- Well, I couldn't. She was all over me.
- Oh.

292
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,153
By the way, for the record,
not sleeping with her...

293
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,231
was maybe some of
the hardest work I've ever done.

294
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,154
- Do I look like your roommate?
I don't wanna hear this.
- You're right. I apologize.

295
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,076
Now, please, sit down.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

296
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,639
I'm tired of sitting,
and I'm not thirsty.

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,712
Peterson,
I've got us a lead.

298
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,439
This is Kim's surprise party
last year.

299
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,476
The man with the grey hair
is Beekman.

300
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,997
There's our friend Willy. And next to
him in the glasses is Alexander Hervey.

301
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,911
Uh, who's Alexander Hervey?

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,754
He's a research scientist at Chess.
He and Beekman created LDF together.

303
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,752
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So where has he been during all this?

304
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,956
- Boulder City, Nevada.
- Nevada?

305
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,393
Mm-hmm.

306
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,040
- You want some coffee?
- Not really. No.

307
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,874
Well, okay, yeah. No.
Uh, yes. Half a cup.

308
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,073
Doughnut?

309
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,628
Oh, no, thanks.
I try not to eat after 11:00.

310
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,188
It's bad for your metabolism
to eat when your body's inactive.

311
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,716
Plus I try to avoid saturated fats,
but you go ahead.

312
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,792
So, what's in Nevada?

313
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,918
Hervey and Beekman worked on LDF
for ten years.

314
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,956
At the end of the day,
LDF was a big hit and they were heroes.

315
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,874
Hervey was promoted and made the head
of a research facility outside of Vegas.

316
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,428
- So he's sitting pretty.
- He was, but a couple of months ago...

317
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,954
he had a stroke, so he's pretty
much out of commission now.

318
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,589
But the interesting thing is, Kim heard
Beekman was also offered a promotion...

319
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,591
but he turned it down.

320
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,910
So he turns down a promotion,
quits his job...

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,992
and suddenly dies?

322
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,277
Look, I realize that we're only
investigating together...

323
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,830
and we're trying to avoid coming
to any actual conclusions out loud.

324
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,117
- However?
- However, it seems to me...

325
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,794
- that something wasn't kosher with LDF.
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,032
And Willy must've gone to
Beekman and Hervey and offered
them promotions if they'd...

327
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,634
- Fake the test results?
- Is that what you think, Brackett?

328
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,598
- Is that what you think, Peterson?
- I asked you first.

329
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,954
- Yes.
- Me, too.

330
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,349
I think Hervey went along
with the plan, but Beekman refused.

331
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,193
So he leaves Chess and takes
the real test results with him.

332
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,511
- And just in case,
sends a copy to his son.
- Exactly.

333
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,990
Willy finds out, panics,
and calls in his old friend Vargas.

334
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,992
You've turned into
a hell of a Hardy Boy, Peterson.

335
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,957
Besides the fact that these people
are trying to kill us...

336
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,077
how about the fact that they're
contaminating the country's milk supply?

337
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,390
Milk! Is nothing sacred?

338
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,552
Let's go!

339
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,119
Gimme the keys, Peterson.
You can drive next time.

340
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,438
What was that all about?
That guy was what? Tell me.

341
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,638
I don't know. Like, he was there then he
was gone. I don't know. I got spooked.

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,594
Well, it's okay.
I'm dead anyway.

343
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,360
Yes, you are.

344
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,591
You two have somethin'
that doesn't belong to you,
and I've been asked to take it back.

345
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,194
Peterson, do you have somethin'
that doesn't belong to you?

346
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,989
- No. Do you?
- Mmm. Sorry, we don't have it.

347
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,517
Stay in this lane, boyfriend,
and keep it at 60.

348
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,232
So what's the plan?
Take us to some remote place, kill us
and make it look like an accident?

349
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,392
- Sounds good to me.
- Well, guess what?

350
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,074
Since I'm the designated driver,
screw your plan.

351
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,791
What are you doing?

352
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,869
Slow the car down,
or I'll smoke you right now!

353
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,279
Go ahead!

354
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,792
That's it!
Pull over!

355
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,791
Brackett!

356
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,598
Put your seat belt on,
Peterson.

357
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,038
What are you, crazy?

358
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,396
- You're welcome.
- Should I search him?

359
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,072
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

360
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,549
Then I wouldn't.

361
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,196
I think we took
the wrong turn.

362
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,871
Jeez! Oh!

363
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,711
Perhaps this is
a blessing in disguise.

364
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,792
- At least nobody knows where we are.
- Including us.

365
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,397
So, are we gonna go see
this Hervey character or what?

366
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,438
Yeah. Sure.
Which way's Nevada?

367
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,752
What do you think that guy meant
when he asked...

368
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,910
if we had something
that didn't belong to us?

369
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,673
I don't know. Maybe Beekman's
test results weren't in the briefcase.

370
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,752
But if we had them, why would we
still be on the story?

371
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,719
Better question is, if they weren't
in the briefcase, where are they?

372
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,793
You aren't suggesting
I have them.

373
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,270
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
Do you?

374
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,432
- Wanna frisk me?
- No, not tonight, dear.
I have a headache.

375
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,673
Oops. I'm sorry.

376
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,675
You sure you don't want
some sunscreen, Brackett?

377
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,877
- It's paba-free.
- I'm fine, thank you.

378
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,316
One out of every six Americans
gets skin cancer before the age of 65.

379
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,516
You blonds have to be
especially careful.

380
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,114
Peterson, do me a favour.
Quit givin' me advice.

381
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,509
First, I shouldn't eat bacon,
then saturated fat.

382
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,275
If I'd eaten that saturated fat, I
wouldn't be starving to death right now.

383
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,955
Fine.
Don't wear sunscreen.

384
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,873
You know, I was just thinking.
You know where I'd be today
if it weren't for you?

385
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,679
- No, tell me.
- At the Beverly Hills Hotel...

386
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,072
on my book tour, lounging around
the pool, giving interviews,
gazing at starlets.

387
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,991
You're not even embarrassed
to say that, are you?

388
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,435
Embarrassed?
What do you think? I'd rather
be traipsing through poison ivy...

389
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,193
wearing a shirt on my head,
looking for hidden test results?

390
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,271
You think they're hidden?

391
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,591
You're actually having fun
on this story, aren't you?

392
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,116
You're not? I mean, I understand
your saying you're not,

393
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,509
but you're really not?

394
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,558
Peterson, do I look like a man
having fun?

395
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,712
A man lounging around
the Beverly Hills Hotel
ogling starlets...

396
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,631
looks to me like a man
not having fun.

397
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,676
And furthermore, I think
you owe me an apology.

398
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,910
In my opinion, meeting me was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,275
You could've quit this story
anytime you wanted, and you didn't...

400
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,920
because you and I both know
this is the story of our lives.

401
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,833
No matter what you say, I know
you'd rather be an ace reporter...

402
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,878
than a second-rate
novelist.

403
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,836
What is that?

404
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,751
What is what?

405
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,190
- Don't turn around. I'm getting out.
- Yeah?

406
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,432
I didn't think you'd be back so fast.
Don't turn.

407
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,348
I won't.

408
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,998
- What's that?
- What?

409
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,633
- Uh-oh.
- She's naked.

410
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,153
- What?
- She's butt naked!

411
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,470
Honey,
we've been rescued.

412
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,028
What are you doing?
Don't do this to me, please.

413
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,430
Was I hearing things, or did you
call me a second-rate novelist?

414
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,875
I was, I was kidding.
I, I never even read your book.

415
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,474
- I, I'm sure it's quite brilliant.
- Uh-huh.

416
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,074
- Oh! What are you doing? Walk backwards.
- You never read it, huh?

417
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,118
Boys! Hi, boys! Look!
A double-spotted platypus.

418
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,236
They're very rare.
You're missing it.

419
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,551
When they said be prepared, I bet you
boys didn't expect anything like this.

420
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,234
Only in our dreams.

421
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,515
Are you sure you never
read my book, Peterson?

422
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,637
- Okay, stop. I, I read it.
I'm, I'm reading it.
- And?

423
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,233
It's cute.
Very cute.

424
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,153
I, I expected more,
to tell you the truth, but...

425
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,357
These nature walks are really
educational, huh, guys?

426
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,989
Hey, I got a great idea!
Does anybody have a camera?

427
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,755
- Come on, you look great!
- I can't believe I let you
talk me into this shirt!

428
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,593
I mean, we look like
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans!

429
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,796
I mean, look at us.

430
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,676
Brackett, they found us.

431
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,273
Let's get outta here.

432
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,828
- Stop!
- Get out of the way.
- Stop! Stop!

433
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,275
Go!
Move 'em out!

434
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,358
Come on, Peterson!

435
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,675
This way! This way!

436
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,239
Brackett, through here.

437
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,431
Ooh!

438
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,080
We don't see
many of those any more.

439
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,515
Congratulations.
Right this way.

440
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,909
- You kids next?
- Us?

441
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,198
- Yes! Yes! Yes, we are. We're next.
- Isn't this rather sudden?

442
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,952
Come, come, come.
Don't be shy.

443
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,679
My name is Ray. I'll be conducting
the service this evening.

444
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,637
Please take a position
in front of the podium...

445
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,599
and I'll acquaint you with the
<i>accoutrement</i> we have at our disposal.

446
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,638
We have flowers,
fresh or silk.

447
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,794
We have rings, veil, tux,
yarmulke, if you so desire.

448
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,713
- Music, prerecorded or live...
- We'll take the works.

449
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,439
Yes. The works, Sandra.

450
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,196
Spare no expense on such
a marvellous and holy occasion.

451
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,397
That's a 42,
and it looks like a winner.

452
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,756
Please place this
on the apex of the skull.

453
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,910
Very good.
Would you folks prefer the...

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,560
long or the abridged service
this evening?

455
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,835
Uh, just do us a favour.
Just go through the motions. Uh...

456
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,036
- Just start.
- Just start? Why don't we just start?

457
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,918
Sandra, if you will.
I'll need your names.

458
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,672
- Peterson.
- Brackett.

459
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,436
Peterson, you and Brackett
have decided to unite your love.

460
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,036
May you cherish
this sacred moment...

461
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,552
forever.
Rings.

462
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,869
As I ask Brackett...

463
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,793
do you take Peterson
to be your wedded wife...

464
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
promising to cherish
and protect her...

465
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,988
be it in good fortune
and adversity?

466
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,672
- Is he here?
- Yes!

467
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,594
Yes? And do you take Brackett
to be your wedded husband...

468
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,433
promising to cherish
and protect him...

469
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,034
be it in good fortune
and adversity?

470
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,350
- If he comes any closer,
we're out the rear exit.
- Okay.

471
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,716
Okay. And so,
by the powers vested in me...

472
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,995
by the great state
of Nevada...

473
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,799
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

474
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,798
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

475
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,475
I'm coming up empty
on this guy Vargas.

476
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,676
And your friend Sam
called twice.

477
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,399
He said that he can't find
anybody who knew him at Yale.

478
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,268
<i>Oh, how's Peterson?</i>
<i>Is she still driving you crazy?</i>

479
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,238
More than you can imagine.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

480
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,629
- Anything?
- Not yet.

481
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,280
- You hungry?
- Yeah, a little.

482
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,438
Thanks.

483
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,469
To the bravest girl
I ever met.

484
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,790
Why? Because I've managed
to stay alive?

485
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,758
Oh, no, no!
Because you married me.

486
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,793
Am I really looking
at a heart-shaped turkey burger?

487
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,629
You know, if anyone told me two weeks
ago I'd be married to Peter Brackett...

488
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,836
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.
I already checked.

489
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,593
We can have it annulled
in the morning.

490
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,070
Oh, you did?
Good.

491
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,312
Well, a 12-hour marriage.
Even shorter than my first one.

492
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,238
Peterson,
you were married before?

493
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,515
You find that so hard
to imagine?

494
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,355
No, no. I'm just sort of particular
about who my wives have been married to.

495
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,716
- Who was he?
- Name's O'Connor.

496
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,315
Of Peterson, Peterson
and O'Connor.

497
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,312
He's extremely close
with my parents.

498
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,109
- Well, you've been married
before, right?
- I tried it briefly.

499
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,351
- Didn't like it?
- No, actually it was my wife
who had the complaint.

500
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,115
She said I was never home. She said
I loved newspapering more than her...

501
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,875
She said she'd never mean as much to you
as the story you were working on.

502
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,713
- She said she was jealous of the boys...
- In the city room.

503
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,031
- Yeah!
- Funny.
- Yeah.

504
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,510
She's now married to a brilliant CPA
with an amazing sweater collection.

505
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,353
- Bet he's home every night.
- Like clockwork.

506
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,715
- That's what they like.
- Regularity.

507
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,394
Yeah.

508
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,434
You know, Brackett...

509
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,274
some guys...

510
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,273
might try to take advantage of
a situation like this, but not you.

511
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,316
No, no.

512
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,676
I know this is
the one area...

513
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,558
- where I can completely trust you.
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,797
So, which side of the heart
do you want?

515
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,838
- We're sleeping in shifts. Remember?
- Yeah, right. I forgot.

516
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,912
- Um, you want to take the first shift?
- No, no, you go ahead.

517
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,718
Mmm.

518
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,112
Tell me something,
Brackett.

519
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,039
What is it about me
you don't like?

520
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,156
I'm not pretty enough?

521
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,118
Not tall enough?
Too tall?

522
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,875
Too smart?
Not smart enough?

523
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,918
Wrong colour hair?

524
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,434
Talk too much?

525
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,909
Really, what is it?

526
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,039
I've never had this effect
on a man before.

527
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,236
You would be surprised,
but...

528
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,474
most men are actually
somewhat attracted to me.

529
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,758
I know you think I'm trouble,
and you curse the day you met me...

530
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,799
but off the record, I don't feel
that way about you...

531
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,030
at all.

532
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,352
Off the record, Peterson...

533
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,079
I don't feel that way
about you, either...

534
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,230
at all.

535
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,116
You don't?

536
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,433
First time I ever kissed
a newspaperman.

537
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,875
I like it.

538
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,238
This doesn't change anything.
I'm still the <i>Globe,</i> and you're still...

539
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,995
The <i>Chronicle.</i>
I know, Sabrina, I know.

540
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,675
- We're still...
- Competitors.

541
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,873
Thank you
for calling me Sabrina.

542
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,913
- Hello?
- <i>This is Mrs Hervey.</i>

543
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,151
<i>If you want to see my husband,</i>
<i>please come now.</i>

544
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,153
This is exactly the sort of thing that
would've driven my ex-husband crazy.

545
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,869
Your current husband's not
too thrilled about it, either.

546
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,159
- Well...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

547
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,194
Oh, hey, don't forget
your wallet.

548
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,752
Shall we?

549
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,113
Sure.

550
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,035
My husband's home now because
there's nothing more they
can do for him at the hospital.

551
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,430
But some days
he's not all that bad.

552
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,389
Alex, the reporters from Chicago
are here to see you.

553
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,118
Alex?

554
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,119
Alex.

555
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,273
Alex, they've come
such a long way to see you.

556
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,473
You wanted to talk to my husband
about, um, Darryl Beekman, didn't you?

557
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,314
Mm-hmm. Yes, we were wondering why,
a-after the success of LDF...

558
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,994
that your husband
was given a promotion...

559
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,196
but Dr Beekman chose
to leave the company?

560
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,115
Were you wondering, Mr Brackett,
or do you think you know?

561
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,953
We think we know. We just need
someone to tell us if we're right.

562
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,952
Did your husband ever say
anything about Dr Beekman...

563
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,553
about disagreements
between them?

564
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,392
Never.

565
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,439
I-I'm sorry. I w... I was hoping
Alex could talk to you.

566
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,193
I sensed
that he wanted to.

567
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,912
Uh, uh, excuse me. Can I use
your restroom for a second?

568
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,514
- Down the hall.
- Oh, thank you.

569
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,394
I'm sorry you had to come
such a long way.

570
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,598
I really appreciate you calling us,
Mrs Hervey. Thank you.

571
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,639
<i>Maybe we should wait</i>
<i>until Mr Brackett gets back.</i>

572
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,358
<i>No, no, that's okay.</i>

573
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,590
<i>Uh, I really don't know</i>
<i>what it is, but...</i>

574
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,036
I thought it was strange,
because in 30 years...

575
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,908
I've never seen Alex bring
anything home from work.

576
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,153
You can take it, but I'm afraid it's
not much use to anyone outside of Chess.

577
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,397
Thank you.

578
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,349
<i>This is Captain Riley. Just to let</i>
<i>you know that we're ahead of schedule...</i>

579
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,989
<i>and we'll be arriving in Chicago</i>
<i>in just a little under an hour.</i>

580
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,153
<i>The temperature is a breezy</i>
<i>34 degrees with clear skies.</i>

581
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,433
- Sorry.
- No problem.

582
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,512
Complimentary champagne
for the bride and groom?

583
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,319
I can always spot the newlyweds
on our Vegas flights.

584
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,630
Of course with you two,
who couldn't?

585
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,873
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

586
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,672
So, what should
we drink to?

587
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,759
- Our annulment?
- Perfect!

588
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,071
Because, truthfully, Brackett,
there's not a man in the world
I'd rather annul than you.

589
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,678
Truthfully, Peterson, I wouldn't
believe anything you ever said...

590
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,433
that started with
the word "truthfully."

591
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,668
Well, I guess it's time
to put an end to the charade.

592
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,799
Yeah. Gimbel's marries Macy's.
We wouldn't want that to get around.

593
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,195
- May I?
- Mmm.

594
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,918
Will you do something for me,
Peterson, for old times' sake?

595
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,150
What?

596
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,275
Kiss me goodbye.

597
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,634
<i>Back now, 7:30 on this, uh,</i>
<i>Monday morning, October the 14th.</i>

598
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,712
<i>I'm Bryant Gumbel here in Studio 3B.</i>
<i>Katie Couric's up on Capitol...</i>

599
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,234
What happened
to October 13th?

600
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,277
Let's go.

601
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,996
Uh, I'm here
for the 4:00 tour.

602
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,548
...in beautiful
Spring Creek, Wisconsin.

603
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,596
Our first stop
on today's tour...

604
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,831
is going to be the Chess Family
Science Discovery Centre.

605
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,357
Now, as we walk in pairs down
the Biology of Tomorrow corridor...

606
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,238
Right this way, sir.
How are you folks today?

607
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,519
I'd like to point out a few of the
everyday products created here at Chess.

608
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,831
For example, the cold medicine
which I forgot to take this morning.

609
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,109
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Milk, a staple for the entire family.</i>

610
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,875
<i>And just one of the products</i>
<i>Chess Chemical is working to improve...</i>

611
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,713
- <i>for the 21st century.</i>
- You know, you look very familiar.
Have we met before?

612
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,429
No. Actually this is my first
visit to the Twilight Zone.

613
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,956
- Why'd you double-cross me, Peterson?
- Just following the Golden Rule.

614
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,508
But I thought we were partners,
five-oh, five-oh.

615
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,353
That must explain why you took
Kim's security pass.

616
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,998
- Oh, Peterson, I was gonna...
- "I was gonna tell you."

617
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,196
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

618
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,033
I was gonna tell you, Peterson.
I took it as a backup.

619
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,192
- I never thought we'd be here again.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

620
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,840
- Look, I gotta go.
- Peterson, listen.

621
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,831
It's not safe for you
to be here alone.

622
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,115
Now, you probably don't wanna be
reminded of this...

623
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,510
but I did take an oath to protect you
till death do us part.

624
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,318
Game's over, Brackett,
and you lose.

625
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,356
I've got the disk.
I've got the security pass.

626
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,590
Actually, I have the disk.

627
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,989
Actually, that's blank.

628
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,355
I've got the disk.
I've got my own security pass.

629
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,715
And I've got the authority
to have you thrown out of here.

630
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,758
Sabrina. Honey, come on.

631
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,400
After all
we've been through!

632
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,234
Just do in your heart what you know
I would do if I was in your position.

633
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,036
Okay.

634
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,479
Sam, stop!
I don't want to hear.

635
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,233
I'm not interested in Vargas any more.
I'm off the story.

636
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,756
- <i>Peterson, too?</i>
- No, no, no. She's still on it.
You know, the girl is nuts!

637
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,037
- She went undercover
as a Chess tour guide.
- <i>You're kidding!</i>

638
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,633
I'm serious.
She got a job there.

639
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,597
<i>Pete, look, look, there's more</i>
<i>I wanna tell you, okay?</i>

640
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,309
No, Sam, don't tempt me!
I'm not gonna get killed on a story
where I don't even get the girl.

641
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,198
I'm goin' back on my book tour.
I'll be in Seattle by dinner.

642
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,555
<i>In a few hours, this whole thing</i>
<i>will be a distant memory.</i>

643
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,631
Okay, don't worry about it, buddy.
And good luck on the tour.

644
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,109
<i>Thanks for everything, man.</i>

645
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,271
You need to have a little chat
with your personnel director.

646
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,238
Sabrina Peterson's
working at Chess.

647
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,356
Oh, Jesus.

648
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,710
He ain't gonna help us.

649
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,871
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

650
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,956
We hope you have enjoyed
your tour, and remember,
no matter where you may live...

651
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,079
Chess Chemical is your neighbour,
striving for a better tomorrow today.

652
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,037
Thank you very much.

653
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,871
Excuse me.
Does this plane have a phone?

654
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,918
Straight ahead on the
cabin wall, but you really need
to stay in your seat, sir.

655
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,753
- We're about to take off.
- Okay, thanks.

656
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,719
- <i>What city, please?</i>
- Uh, Madison. The number
of the capitol building.

657
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,270
- <i>That's 555-4331.</i>
- Thank you.

658
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,399
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we'll be taking off momentarily.</i>

659
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,631
<i>Flight attendants,</i>
<i>please prepare for departure.</i>

660
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,075
- <i>Good evening. State Capitol.</i>
- Yeah, Sam Smotherman.

661
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,038
<i>Mr Smotherman.</i>
<i>That's extension 307.</i>

662
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,235
Keep it movin'.
Keep comin'.

663
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,790
Fine. Hold it right there.
Okay.

664
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,474
- How you doin', Jack?
- Okay, Bob. How are you?

665
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,191
Jesus! God!

666
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,475
What are these...
Oh, Jesus!

667
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,392
Too bad. But a definite "A"
for effort, Peterson.

668
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,429
Or should I call you Brackett,
Mrs Brackett? Hmm?

669
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,351
I don't really care what
you call me, Smotherman.

670
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,035
Or should I call you
Ernesto, Mr Vargas?

671
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,793
Oh, darn!

672
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,075
I wanted to be the one
to tell you.

673
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,230
You did!
A cop once told me...

674
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,629
"Always look for the lie; that's when
the story begins to unravel."

675
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,190
When I asked you
what year you graduated,
you gave me two different years.

676
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,033
I wondered why, so I looked
you up in your yearbook.

677
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,716
Funny thing was, you weren't in it,
not under the name Smotherman, anyway.

678
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,875
We were hoping you had what
we were looking for, but...

679
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,110
since you don't have it,
and we don't have it...

680
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,668
we can assume
it didn't survive the crash.

681
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,151
So now the only evidence
to destroy is you.

682
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,038
Oh, and your husband,
of course.

683
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,795
Fortunately,
we know exactly where he is.

684
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,470
- What's going on, Ted?
- Oh, Mr Chess, I didn't know
anyone was in here.

685
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,596
We've got an alert
down at the loading dock.

686
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,150
- Go back to your station.
I'll deal with it.
- Yes, sir.

687
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,120
Get out there.
See what's going on.

688
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,715
How'd you get involved
in this, Sam?

689
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,598
Willy wanted to get rid of Beekman, and
he thought you could get the job done?

690
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,797
- Something like that.
- But you botched the fire in college.

691
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,759
- What made him think
you'd get it right this time?
- I was the only bad guy he knew.

692
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,477
Did he pay you to hook up
with Senator Robbins?

693
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,120
Think I could afford
steak dinners if he didn't?

694
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,111
Do me a favour, Peterson.

695
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,760
Sit down.

696
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,358
Stay with her,
and watch her.

697
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,234
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
It seems...

698
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,311
It seems we've got a traffic jam
in the parking lot.

699
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,836
I'm in no rush. As long as
we've got a couple of minutes...

700
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,797
What?
You want an interview?

701
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,589
Why not? Give a dying girl
her last wish.

702
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,515
Why'd you do it, Willy? Why not just
admit LDF was a flop and move on?

703
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,878
For ten years, Beekman and Hervey
promised me they'd iron out the kinks.

704
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,873
A hundred million dollars later,
they apologized, said they were wrong.

705
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,270
By then it was too late.
I mortgaged our company's future
in this thing. It had to fly!

706
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,477
What were these kinks,
exactly?

707
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,632
Well, let's put it this way. You can't
put a label on a carton of milk:

708
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,110
"This product has been known
to cause cancer in laboratory animals."

709
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,670
- And Beekman was gonna blow the whistle.
- Can you imagine?

710
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,992
The guy screws up and then
he tries to bite the hand that
feeds him? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

711
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,235
All right, that's it. I've had it.
Just get her out. Now!

712
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,993
- Willy, let's go.
- Where's he gonna take me, Sam?

713
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,436
- At least tell me how
he's gonna do it, huh?
- No comment.

714
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,919
Another train crash?
Another fire?

715
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,275
Hey, maybe I'll get it the
old-fashioned way like Danny Brown.

716
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,591
Come on, Sam,
you're the organ grinder here!
Tell me how this ape's gonna do it.

717
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,078
- Why not just show her, Mando?
- Brackett!

718
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,752
Brackett.

719
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,990
You got her? Just get her.
Stop shooting!

720
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,913
Lock the gates.
Don't let anyone in.

721
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,909
Peterson, I thought
you were one of them!

722
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,754
It's okay.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

723
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,038
What'd you come back for,
Brackett, me or the story?

724
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,557
- Mostly you, Peterson.
- Mostly me?

725
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,515
He's on the third tier!

726
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,674
Nice try, Mando.
Drop the gun.

727
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,036
Why? Are you going to shoot me
with your finger, Brackett?

728
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,190
There's only one way
to find out.

729
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,909
Any time you want to jump in,
Peterson.

730
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,231
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

731
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,513
Oh, Jesus.

732
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,914
Oh, Jesus!

733
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,873
My mother always said, you want
the job done right, do it yourself.

734
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,510
Whoa. Whoa.

735
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,989
- Peterson!
- Self-defense classes.
A must for a woman in the '90s.

736
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,832
Uh-huh.

737
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,436
- Stay there or I'll shoot.
- I don't think so.

738
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,555
Think again.

739
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,917
Mrs Brackett,
you had it all the time.

740
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,470
Uh-uh-uh.
Don't touch.

741
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,352
Hey, Pete, do you mind
if I kill your wife?

742
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,477
As a matter of fact, I do.
Hang on, Peterson!

743
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,631
Grab on!

744
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,914
I got it! I got it.

745
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,912
Atta girl.

746
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,436
"As Vargas shouted
his final command...

747
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,637
the Thin Man's eyes
measured Peterson for a coffin.

748
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,235
She turned, a breath away from
the barrel of his.22 automatic."

749
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,630
Poetry, sweetheart.
Absolute poetry!

750
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,111
Look who's talking. "The cold metal tip
of the pistol brushed against my hair.

751
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,954
I looked up at the assassin. His eyes
were empty as two holes in a mask."

752
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,279
Honey, I got goose bumps!

753
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,079
You ever think
of writing a novel?

754
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,151
And give up the newspaper game?
Never.

755
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,952
Okay!

756
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,389
Well, I might give it a try again.
Here's my idea.

757
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,393
- Mmm.
- Male, female reporters
solve mystery...

758
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,916
- fight,
- Mm-hmm.
- make up, fall in love...

759
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,275
save the day,
go on a honeymoon.

760
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,999
Sounds like a best-seller
to me.

761
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,869
- Darling.
- Yes, my love?

762
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,511
You didn't really mean it when
you said our scoundrel days
were behind us, did you?

763
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,756
They are for me
if they are for you.

764
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,912
All right. I promise
to go straight if you do.

765
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,280
I do.

766
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,269
Then I do too.

767
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,151
Brackett, get this!

768
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,913
- Two guys with.38s coming right
out of that, uh, that bank.
- Peterson.

769
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,709
Peterson, sweetheart.
We're on our honeymoon.

770
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,234
Sorry, baby.
It slipped my mind.

771
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,959
Let me refresh
your memory.

772
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,792
Uh-uh.
