While you're here,
you're gonna pay rent.

We'll figure out something

Hmm?
You want a fucking parade?

It's been like five years. What don't
you give it a little bit of time?

64
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:10,711
Thought I did.

00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,846
Oh, you're funny.

00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,715
Wait. Can we go somewhere for
a little, me and you?

00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,084
I can't.
I can't, I gotta put the...

I let you put your cock in me.

You're paying for that.

00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,878
[Bobby] I don't know. Look, it's not
like it's a fucking crazy question.

169
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,146
I mean, you, you know,
you come back...

251
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,453
You're just a loser

00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:16,103
[ominous music]

727
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:24,445
Dicky!

728
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,247
- [Dicky] What?
- You got a visitor.

729
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:28,616
[Dicky] Who is it?

730
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,385
The Queen of England.

731
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:41,462
- [Dicky grunts, laughs]
- [Beth] What the fuck! Shit.

732
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:43,030
[Anne] What's going on in there?

733
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:44,331
[Dicky] It's nothing, Ma.

734
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:45,533
Oh, man, you smell like fish.

735
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,001
- Yeah, you sure it's me?
- Just stop it. What are you doing?

736
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:49,937
- Stop. Fucking stop.
- Come on, let's get a shower.

737
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:52,574
- [Anne] Dicky?
- Come on. Relax, Ma, we're fine.

738
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,609
Jesus.
Fuck, man.

739
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:56,110
Just chill out.

740
00:47:56,644 --> 00:47:57,978
Just goofing around.

741
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,279
[shower curtain rustles]

742
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:01,281
[water runs]

743
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,016
[Dicky] Uh-oh.

744
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:05,886
You know, I've been...

745
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:07,421
I've been thinking.

746
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,658
[water running]

747
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,927
Just be patient.

748
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:18,165
What if we stuck around
for a bit?

749
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,000
[Dicky] What the fuck are you
talking about?

750
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:25,105
Just... give it a few more weeks.

751
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,273
See how things go.

752
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:28,409
[shower curtain rustles]

753
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:30,310
What, you don't think
this is gonna work?

754
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:37,317
[water stops running]

755
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,322
What happened?

756
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,024
Huh?

757
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:45,426
What did I do?

758
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,362
- It's nothing. I just...
- I'm gonna take care of you.

759
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:49,697
Both of you.

760
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:51,932
Be realistic. Okay?

761
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,434
[Dicky] What for?

762
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,505
[scoffs]

763
00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:00,007
So what, that's it?

764
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,343
We have fun.
We always did, but maybe...

765
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:05,446
This is real.
We can do this.

766
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,114
No, we can't.

767
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,482
What, did you get
a better offer?

768
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,625
Well, I'm not the one with some
random guy's baby inside me.

769
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,026
What's that supposed to mean?

770
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,260
[Dicky]
You up for mother of the year?

771
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:24,198
You're so full of shit.

772
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,367
Yeah, it looks like
I'm making a big mistake.

773
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:29,470
Yeah, go home.
Go run home to daddy.

774
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:31,238
But don't come crying
to me again.

775
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:33,073
You're an asshole.

776
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,143
Yeah, well I'm not the guy
that was fucking a nurse

777
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:37,645
down the hall while
your mother died.

778
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:43,518
Go on.

779
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,320
Get the fuck out of here!

780
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:55,128
- [engine rumbling]
- [man] Tom.

781
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:57,264
Got a second?

782
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,334
Finish up.

783
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:02,369
- [seagulls squawking]
- [indistinct chattering]

784
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,271
[officer] <i>I got a call
from North-End PD.</i>

785
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,107
Did you fire a shot at one of
Eddie Nance's boats?

786
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,743
Must be some kind of mistake.

787
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:10,745
Nance says you threatened him
in his office yesterday.

788
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:12,547
He's poaching my gear.

789
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,414
If you wanna file
an official complaint...

790
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,149
What'll that do?

791
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,318
Well, if you've got proof,
then we can do something.

792
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,788
Well, he got no right
bein' there, you know that.

793
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,223
You know the deal, Tom.

794
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:24,626
There's nothing
I can do about that.

795
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,660
Right.

796
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:27,795
So what are you gonna do?

797
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:31,799
Are you gonna arrest me or can
I go back to earning a living?

798
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:35,603
I'm here as a friend, Tom.

799
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,405
You gotta back off.

800
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:40,173
[Tom] Hm.

801
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:45,112
[car engine roars]

802
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:50,718
- [woman] <i>Hey, Tommy.</i>
- [door closes]

803
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,555
- How are you?
- Oh, staying above water.

804
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:58,058
- I'll get some coffee.
- All right.

805
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,193
Artie?

806
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:01,829
How's your back?

807
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:05,432
[chuckles] Can't feel much of
anything right now.

808
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,201
- [Tom] They got you on the good stuff, huh?
- [bottles clink]

809
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,305
It ain't bad.

810
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:12,607
Well, look...

811
00:51:13,575 --> 00:51:16,176
I was hoping to talk to you
about something.

812
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:18,613
- Nance?
- [Tom] Yeah.

813
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,150
Heard you guys got into it.

814
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:24,217
Not really.

815
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,219
These new guys.

816
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:27,822
They got lawyers.

817
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:28,856
Cops.

818
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,593
Don't do it the way we used to.

819
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:35,630
You renting them your slip?

820
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,299
[woman] You know Artie hasn't
been able to go out

821
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,602
since the surgery.

822
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:41,836
He knows.

823
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,571
[Tom] Well, that can't be easy.

824
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,372
[woman]
We gotta make a living too.

825
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:48,375
- I understand.
- People might not like it.

826
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,845
- Sweetheart.
- What?

827
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,346
It's the truth.

828
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:53,648
[Artie]
Can you give us a second?

829
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:56,350
You know, I like you Tommy.

830
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:01,288
But you can't come around here
telling us what we can and cannot do.

831
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:02,356
You're right.

832
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,362
You heard the boss.
Just business.

833
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,732
Nance has been
poaching my lines.

834
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:12,634
Someone catch him?

835
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:13,668
I will.

836
00:52:17,337 --> 00:52:18,305
Okay.

837
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:23,811
If you're right...

838
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,282
you know I'll cut him off.

839
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:37,125
[Tom] We all gotta stick
together on this.

840
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,428
You know he's buying
the old market by the harbor.

841
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:43,397
I heard that.

842
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,265
You know which way
this is going.

843
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:46,100
[Tom] Maybe.

844
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,970
But I don't gotta make
it any easier.

845
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:52,372
[foreboding music]

846
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,711
[door opens]

847
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:58,946
[Lily] How's work?

848
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:02,282
Yeah. Fine.

849
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,352
I ran into Dicky's mom today.

850
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,856
She said it's been
nice seeing you.

851
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,291
Why'd you lie to your father?

852
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,727
He doesn't like Dicky.

853
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,394
[Lily] You shouldn't lie to him.

854
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,564
[paper rustling]

855
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:20,434
How far along are you?

856
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,368
12, 13 weeks?

857
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:25,707
When was the last time
you saw the doctor?

858
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,841
Don't worry about it.

859
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:28,375
This is a big deal.

860
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,376
I know.

861
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:31,012
I'll figure it out.

862
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,747
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

863
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,749
[cabinet door creaks]

864
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,954
It's okay to be scared.

865
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,356
I got pregnant early on.

866
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:47,695
Your father thought it'd be too
hard on you and your brother.

867
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:57,370
He loves you.

868
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:00,908
He's just...

869
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:03,376
he's not very good at it.

870
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,618
[crickets chirping]

871
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,286
[Bobby] Hey.

872
00:54:16,057 --> 00:54:17,225
What's that?

873
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,662
What are we gonna do, Pop?

874
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:23,731
[Tom] Go home.

875
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,433
- Put your daughter to bed.
- No, no, no.

876
00:54:26,466 --> 00:54:27,635
We can't keep ignoring it.

877
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:29,336
We're gonna lose the business.

878
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,672
Well the first prick
who's tried to come in here

879
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:32,940
won't be the last.

880
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:34,776
We gotta do something.

881
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:35,743
You already did.

882
00:54:36,844 --> 00:54:38,546
Now I'm the one
who's gotta take care of it.

883
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:47,655
[whispers] Fucking ridiculous.

884
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:51,491
You know you're not the only one
getting fucked here.

885
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:52,827
Okay?

886
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:54,427
I got a family.

887
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:55,797
I got a fucking mortgage.

888
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,964
Watch your language.

889
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:23,825
[soft guitar music]

890
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:40,842
Put one of these in
when you bait them.

891
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:42,610
Tie it to the door.

892
00:55:44,045 --> 00:55:45,980
- What for?
- Just do it.

893
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:48,716
[seagulls squawking]

894
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,989
[hums]

895
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:03,531
[Tom] Millie.

896
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:06,466
- [Millie] Grandpa!
- [Tom speaks indistinctly] Oh!

897
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:07,902
[laughs]
Tell me about your day.

898
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,570
- What'd you do?
- [Millie] I saw butterflies.

899
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:10,738
[Tom] You did?

900
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:12,472
- How was work?
- Fine.

901
00:56:15,977 --> 00:56:17,144
Go wash up, I got her.

902
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:19,914
Did you see any bu... did you see
any butterflies today?

903
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:22,049
- [Millie] Yeah.
- [Tom] I see one right over there.

904
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,284
I saw an airplane.

905
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,553
- [Tom] You saw an airplane?
- [Millie] And a rocket ship.

906
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,755
Really? Wait, you got
something in your ear.

907
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:29,489
Something...
wait, let me get it.

908
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:32,693
Oh. Oh yeah, it's got
a lot of ear wax on it.

909
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:34,896
- [Millie] No, it doesn't.
- [Tom] It's because it was in your ear.

910
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,697
- [Millie] No, it wasn't.
- [Tom] Where was it?

911
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:39,166
[water runs]

912
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,869

[tools clicking]

914
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:57,518
[Beth] Is this a good time?

915
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,552
[Tom] For what?

916
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:00,621
[tools clicking]

917
00:57:02,123 --> 00:57:03,557
- I'm pregnant.
- [clicking stops]

918
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,668
So... okay.

919
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,435

920
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,110
[clicking stops]

921
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:27,848
[Tom] Dicky?

922
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:31,519
- No.
- [sighs]

923
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:44,732
Do you know who's the father?

924
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,467
Well, I'm...

925
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:48,769
just asking.

926
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:49,770
Right.

927
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:51,605
Well, what are you...

928
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,710
- What are you gonna do?
- What the fuck do you care?

929
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:57,044
Oh no, don't do that.

930
00:57:57,712 --> 00:57:59,246
Don't do that.
Don't make me the bad guy.

931
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,982
- I'm not.
- You should have told me.

932
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,727
Okay.

933
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,894
[chair creaks]

934
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:24,638
All right,
so you'll stay here and...

935
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:26,173
I'm not asking you for anything.

936
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:33,514
Why is it so hard
for you to tell the truth?

937
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:40,721
- Yeah.
- Hey.

938
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:45,192
You're gonna have to start
acting like a grown up now.

939
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:48,662
All right?

940
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,703
[foreboding music]

941
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:07,615
[crickets chirping]

942
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,722
Oh, I got you an appointment
with an OB-GYN

943
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:15,723
I know at the hospital.

944
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:17,758
Great.

945
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:19,693
I can go with you if you want.

946
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:22,129
Can I borrow your car?

947
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,698
Just wanna go over to
Bobby's real quick.

948
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:26,667
[car engine hums]

949
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,637

[water rippling]

956
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,025
- [door opens]
- There you go.

957
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,128
What's good today?

958
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,132
- I'm sorry.
- I don't give a shit.

959
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:32,900
I don't know
what I was thinking.

960
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,238
- Can I help you?
- [whispers] I wanna do it.

961
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:38,873
You can't keep
jerking me around.

962
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:40,174
Are these fresh?

963
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:43,077
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Just give me another chance.

964
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,311
You're a liar.

965
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:47,915
I know.

966
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,820
I'm the one taking a risk.
You get that?

967
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:53,954
I gotta know that
you're serious.

968
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:55,356
[laughs]
You want me to take an oath?

969
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,891
This isn't a joke.

970
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:58,893
I need to know that
you're not gonna fuck me.

971
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,061
Right, you were right. I... I...

972
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:03,731
There's nothing for me here.
I don't gotta do this.

973
01:01:03,764 --> 01:01:04,899
- I know.
- Not with you.

974
01:01:04,932 --> 01:01:05,933
I know.

975
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:07,902
I got scared, okay?

976
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,904
I don't know what I'm doing.
I just...

977
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:11,939
I'm sorry.

978
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,012
Okay.

979
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:23,751
I know it's scary,
but nothing's gonna happen.

980
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:27,054
- You promise?
- Yeah.

981
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,324
Yeah, I promise.

982
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,061
All right.

983
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:37,398
This is the coordinates.

984
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,968
The drop is at two AM.

985
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:43,337
My boat gets in at 2:05.

986
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,838
2:10 at the latest.

987
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,840
So you gotta be gone by then.

988
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,109
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it got moved up.

989
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,779
- But I don't...
- You meet me back at the bar

990
01:01:51,812 --> 01:01:53,214
after and we're gone.

991
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,250
This is it, all right?

992
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:58,986
This is it.

993
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,088
We can go anywhere
you want after.

994
01:02:02,256 --> 01:02:03,424
Just me and you.

995
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:04,992
Yeah.

996
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:09,763
[dark brooding music]

997

[cage rattles]

1000
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:31,151
You see it's empty, right?

1001
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:32,219
Yeah.

1002
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:35,456
Maybe.

1003
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,764
Mrs. McManus.
I'm sorry, I... I...

1004
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:45,299
I didn't mean to startle you.

1005
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:47,034
Uh, I just needed one moment.

1006
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:49,504
Um, I don't know if you heard,

1007
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:53,040
but I am opening
a processing plant right here

1008
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:54,108
in the next six months.

1009
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:55,476
Good luck with that.

1010
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:57,945
Well...

1011
01:02:57,978 --> 01:03:00,014
that's just the thing
right there.

1012
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:03,317
Uh, there's no point in opening
a processing plant

1013
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,119
if no one will sell to me.

1014
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:08,922
You got it.

1015
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:13,394
What if you and your husband
own part of the business?

1016
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:16,030
He won't listen to me.

1017
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:18,465
But this is a deal that could be
good for everyone

1018
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,467
for a long time to come.

1019
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:23,270
In three seconds, I'm gonna kick
you somewhere you don't want.

1020
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:24,506
Think about it.

1021
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,474
Okay?
Talk it over with your husband.

1022
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:30,344
If he doesn't take the deal,
somebody else will.

1023
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:41,388
[soft music]

1024
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,998
Fucking multiplying.

1025
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:52,333
Be patient.

1026
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:55,969
I need you to do
something for me.

1027
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:00,908
You're gonna like this one.

1028
01:04:04,978 --> 01:04:07,582
[water rippling]

1029
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:12,052
How's work?

1030
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,521
[Beth] Fine.

1031
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:15,856
Busy?

1032
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:20,127
I guess.

1033
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:25,533
[door opens, closes]

1034
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:32,306
Hi.

1035
01:04:35,677 --> 01:04:36,977
I'll be out back.

1036
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,920
[Hilde laughs over phone]
<i>There's no way.</i>

1037
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:49,022
[Beth whispers]
Look, it's gotta be tonight.

1038
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:51,024
[Hilde sighs]

1039
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,660
<i>I'll try to get something
together, honey,</i>

1040
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:54,995
<i>but it's not gonna be
full price.</i>

1041
01:04:55,563 --> 01:04:56,564
All right.

1042
01:04:57,297 --> 01:05:00,300
[dark broody music]

1043
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:13,914
[Bobby whispers] Now go to bed
and close your eyes.

1044
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:16,684
Hey.

1045
01:05:20,688 --> 01:05:22,055
Go to the other room.

1046
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:24,893
What's up?

1047
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:37,705
Is this the one I used to
steal from you?

1048
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:39,306
Yeah, I don't need it.

1049
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:41,041
Yeah? What's the matter?
You dyin'?

1050
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:43,243
- Huh? [chuckles]
- Just give it to her.

1051
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:46,413
Yeah?

1052
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,551
Look, um...

1053
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,687
I'm gonna take the kid
out on the boat.

1054
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,623
We're gonna go fishing
this weekend.

1055
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:57,157
You should... you should come.

1056
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,127
Okay.

1057
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:04,498
You gotta... you gotta try
to act excited.

1058
01:06:04,532 --> 01:06:07,334
You gotta try. We talked about it.
You gotta try to act excited.

1059
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:09,470
- I can't wait.
- Good, that's better.

[crickets chirping]

1061
01:06:31,626 --> 01:06:33,260

1067
01:08:06,654 --> 01:08:07,655
Hold up.

1068
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,764
[Dicky] What the fuck?

1069
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:18,198
[man] Don't worry about it.

[bells chiming]

1111
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:47,561

What happened?
Are you all right?

1117
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:38,612
[Beth] I have it.

1118
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:40,881
For Pete's sake. Come inside.

1119
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:43,584
[door closes]

1120
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:44,852
Wanna wake the whole
fucking neighborhood?

1121
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,520
[George]
What's going on out there?

1122
01:14:46,554 --> 01:14:48,122
Nothing, just go back to bed.

1123
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:50,024
- [George] Do you know what time it is?
- Yeah.

1124
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:54,228
I don't wanna know where
you got this, do I?

1125
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:57,131
- You have the money?
- I'll get it tomorrow.

1126
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:58,699
[Beth]
You said you'd have it tonight.

1127
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,501
I'm not a miracle worker.

1128
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:03,270
- [whispers] Fuck.
- [paper tears]

1129
01:15:04,138 --> 01:15:05,973

- What?

1132
01:15:15,983 --> 01:15:17,518
Did you tell anyone
else about this?

1133
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:19,887
No one else knows.

1134
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:23,324
- Get rid of it.
- Um...

1135
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,992
No, I can't touch this.

1136
01:15:25,026 --> 01:15:26,260
People are gonna come
looking for this.

1137
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,129
- They're not people...
- You gotta know someone.

1138
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:30,765
Even if I did, what the fuck
am I supposed to say, huh?

1139
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:32,967
"Oh hey, I found two kilos
of fucking heroine..."

1140
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,901
I need the fucking money.

1141
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:35,770
- No, you don't!
- You gotta know someone.

1142
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:37,038
[whispers] No, you don't.

1143
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:38,672
Not like this.

1144
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:41,075
Not like this.
You don't.

1145
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,945
You know I'm not gonna
say anything.

1146
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,282
You need to take this
and get rid of it.

1147
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:50,217
Now.

1148
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:52,686
[whispers] I can't.

1149
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:53,988
[Hilde] Yes, you can.

1150
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:56,323
Just go home.

1151
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:58,092
I can't go home.

1152
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:00,194
I... I can't.

1153
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,295
[Hilde] Why?

1154
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:04,198
I can't go home.

1155
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,767
[cries]

1156
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:07,968
[Hilde] What did you do?

1157
01:16:10,971 --> 01:16:13,574
I can't go fucking home.

1158
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,977
[sobbing]

1159
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,781
[Hilde]
Oh, what did you do?

1160
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:22,116
[knocking on door]

1161
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:25,920
[whispers] You tell anyone
you were coming here?

1162
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:27,054
No.

1163
01:16:27,088 --> 01:16:30,591

1165
01:16:36,697 --> 01:16:38,666
[George]
Come on, are you gonna get that?

1166
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,168
[clock ticking]

1167
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:52,313
[sighs]

1168
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:54,248
- Jesus Christ, Bobby.
- [Bobby] Where is he?

1169
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:56,016
- Who?
- Your fucking husband.

1170
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,719
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you, you fuck?

1171
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:01,288
What the fuck is going on?

1172
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,292
- [grunts]
- [Hilde] Whoa, stop it!

1173
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,661
- [grunts]
- [Hilde] Bobby!

1174
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:10,131

What'd you think,
we wouldn't find out?

1178
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:19,840
Huh? You're done.

1179
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:22,943
This whole fucking town's
gonna know what you are.

1180
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:26,113
- [Bobby pants]
- [Hilde] Get off.

1181
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:32,653
- She know?
- [Hilde] Know what?

1182
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:34,355
He's been poaching our traps.

1183
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:37,925
He's been stealing from
his own fucking family!

1184
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,760
[Hilde] All right.
Enough, get up.

1185
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:42,863
[Bobby panting]

1186
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,168
You're not working here anymore.

1187
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:48,235
[Hilde] Just calm down.

1188
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:49,970
We'll sit down,
we'll talk about it, all right?

1189
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:51,872
- We got nothing to talk about.
- Bobby, come on.

1190
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:54,341
We're family, Bobby.

1191
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:56,877
[door closes]

1192
01:17:58,045 --> 01:17:59,713

1200
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:32,246
[Lily whispers] Tom?

1201
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:35,216
Can't you at least ask him
what he's willing to pay?

1202
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:36,850
[whispering] No. No, I can't.

1203
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,120
It's okay.
It'll be all right.

1204
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:45,025
[Lily whispers] Okay.

1205
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:50,998

[water rippling]

1210
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:35,776
So?

1211
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,881
What?

1212
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:43,851
What?

1213
01:19:45,052 --> 01:19:46,053
It was Uncle George.

1214
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,424
It's over now,
I took care of it.

1215
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:55,296
[water rippling]

1216

[line ringing]

1219
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,840
Your clothes were wet,
so I put them in the dryer.

1220
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,409
What, is that okay?

1221
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,178
Yeah. Thanks.

1222
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:49,850
[Anne]
He didn't come home last night.

1223
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:53,053
- Thought he was with you.
- He's probably just sleeping it off somewhere.

1224
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:54,388
He doesn't do that anymore.

1225
01:20:54,656 --> 01:20:55,623
Yeah, I know.

1226
01:20:55,657 --> 01:20:58,593
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Look, if you see him,

1227
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:00,528
tell him to call. Just...

1228
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:02,530
let me know he's okay.

1229
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:05,232
Yeah.

1230
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:21,281
[low dark music]

1231
01:21:32,259 --> 01:21:33,260
[door closes]

1232
01:21:44,304 --> 01:21:45,573
I tried to tell you.

1233
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,441
Don't.

1234
01:21:48,676 --> 01:21:49,677
I'm sorry.

1235
01:21:51,311 --> 01:21:52,514
I didn't come here for that.

1236
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:55,416
We're gonna lose the house and...

1237
01:21:55,449 --> 01:21:57,184
My own goddamn brother.

1238
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:01,689
I asked you for help.

1239
01:22:01,723 --> 01:22:03,157
[Tom] That gives you the right?

1240
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,700
You're gonna sell your boat,
or move out of this town.

1241
01:22:12,734 --> 01:22:14,636
Come on.
I'll make it up.

1242
01:22:15,737 --> 01:22:17,104
I see you again...

1243
01:22:17,739 --> 01:22:19,239
I'm gonna kill you.

1244
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:26,413
You're not the good guy here.

1245
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,981
You never were.

1246
01:22:28,348 --> 01:22:30,083

1248
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:40,360
Hey, what's going on?

1249
01:22:42,429 --> 01:22:44,965
Whatever it is,
running's not gonna fix it.

1250
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:47,635
Don't worry about it.

1251
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,706
I can't watch him go
through this again.

1252
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,073
He could give a shit.

1253
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:54,609
- That's not true.
- Right.

1254
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:56,977
[Lily] Come downstairs.

1255
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:58,613
Let's talk about this.

1256
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:00,314
You're not my fucking mother.

1257
01:23:00,347 --> 01:23:02,249
Yeah.
What would she say?

1258
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:08,455
At some point you gotta take

[Dicky] I didn't tell them.

1289

But they know.

1290
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:15,610
You gotta go.

1291
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:22,583

- Go to the police.
- What about Dicky?

You're in a lot of trouble.

You gotta stop fighting

Good, good, good.

1304
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:20,708
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine, just give us a second, okay?

Okay.

No, you don't understand, okay?

He just... he just wanted to
take care of me.

01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:30,852
Nothing to be done about
that right now.

We have to go get him.
