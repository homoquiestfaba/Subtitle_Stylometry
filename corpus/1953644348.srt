1
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,683
Hey!

2
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:40,785
Man.
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,026
Yaah!

4
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:55,602
God!

5
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,141
Damn it!

6
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,918
# Evil women and whiskey

7
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,822
# Surely drive me
to my grave #

8
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,860
# Evil women and whiskey

9
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:22,362
# Will surely drive me
to my grave #

10
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,369
# Wherever I go

11
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,873
# Trouble seem to follow

12
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,911
# Wherever I go

13
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:41,017
# Trouble seem to follow

14
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,936
Shit.

15
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,579
What's going on?

16
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,114
I don't know, man.

17
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:12,517
Think it just died.

18
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:16,389
Holy shit.

19
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,997
Come on.

20
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,535
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:29,904
What is it?

22
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,840
It's like angel-hair pasta
in here, brother.

23
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,346
Um...

24
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:40,814
here. Try it now.

25
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,531
Anything?

26
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,999
Nothing.

27
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,247
Okay.

28
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,682
Oh, this is terrible.

29
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,750
All right.

30
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,321
So...

31
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,891
Um...

32
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,631
Why do we even bother
to pop the hood?

33
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,099
I thought
I heard something.

34
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,968
Yeah, well, unless there's
a flashing neon sign

35
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,369
that says,
"Here's your problem,"

36
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,770
what the hell
do we know?

37
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,239
Fuck, that's hot.

38
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,440
Careful.

39
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,145
What you got?

40
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,681
I got no service.
What about you?

41
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:44,451
I hardly get
service in the city,

42
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,885
let alone the desert.

43
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,855
Yeah,
I got nothing, man.

44
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:51,592
Where the hell
are we, anyway?

45
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,627
Uh...

46
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,395
let me see.

47
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,333
Okay.

48
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:05,607
We, um...
We passed this dot...

49
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,309
about an hour ago.

50
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,878
I think we're
in here someplace.

51
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,380
That's like
60 miles back.

52
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:12,815
Wow. It's like a hundred
miles to the next dot.

53
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,518
What the hell are you doing driving
us through the middle of nowhere?

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,587
We're taking the scenic route,
remember?

55
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,389
Yeah, by scenic,
I was thinking...

56
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,091
I don't know, more trees,
mountains, people,

57
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:23,893
dots a lot closer
together.

58
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:26,864
By scenic,
I meant rarely seen.

59
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:30,534
I'm gonna get you a dictionary
when we get back.

60
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:31,702
Okay.

61
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:35,273
Holy shit,
it's hot out here, man.

62
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,575
It's gotta be,
like, 115 degrees.

63
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:40,545
I know.

64
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:41,547
Not even noon!

65
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,782
No wonder
the truck died.

66
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,517
Something
probably melted.

67
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:48,154
Have we even
seen any cars?

68
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,088
Ow. No,

69
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,856
but, uh,
it's a road, right?

70
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,858
I mean, someone'll
be along soon.

71
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,628
Well, we got about
20 jelly beans

72
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,996
and 6 ounces
of melted ice.

73
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,598
That should last us
10 minutes.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,599
Oh, good.

75
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:01,935
It's pretty.

76
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:03,337
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

77
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,338
Ohh!

78
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,308
Ohh!

79
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,745
What flavor is this?

80
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:11,746
Bacon and margarita.

81
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:12,814
Oh, my God!

82
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,850
I saved those two
just for you.

83
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:19,455
Tastes like that cake
you made with the onions.

84
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,856
Remember that shit?

85
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:23,625
Yeah, I remember.

86
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,427
I think that
brings your total

87
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,163
of veiled references to
things I did with Karen

88
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,167
up to three, so feel free
to stop, please.

89
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,903
You never think about her,
man? Ever?

90
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:36,406
I probably
think about her

91
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,475
about as much
as she thinks about me.

92
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,910
Well, she thinks
about you a lot, dude.

93
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,980
I ran into her
last week, and, uh,

94
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,782
you were all
she can talk about.

95
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:48,086
She said she was floored
to hear you had a wife and kid.

96
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:49,755
Yeah, well, it floors me
sometimes, too.

97
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,758
You all right?

98
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,792
Yeah.

99
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,160
Don't overexert
yourself.

100
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:57,229
I can't believe you got us
out of roaming.

101
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,330
Huh?

102
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,298
Never been out of roaming.
That even possible?

103
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,234
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

104
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:04,937
I'm gonna go up here and
see if I can get a signal.

105
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,572
No! Let's sit,
and let's wait

106
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:07,774
a few minutes, man.

107
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:08,775
Well, why?

108
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,209
I don't know.

109
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,545
We'll hang, and we'll wait
for a car.

110
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,646
No, you sit and wait.

111
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,014
I'm gonna go up and check.

112
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,454
Ah, shit.

113
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:29,230
You remember last time
we drove cross-country

114
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:32,200
and we went, like,
200 miles out of the way

115
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,769
because we were so into
whatever we were talking about?

116
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:38,107
Yeah, and now neither one of us can
remember what it was.

117
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,675
Might have been when, uh...

118
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:43,546
Might have been when you claimed
that art can reach a point

119
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,148
where its quality became fact
rather than opinion.

120
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,717
That sounds like a couple hours
of my life

121
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,885
I'd like to have back.

122
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,089
Or it might have been
better defense,

123
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,825
'85 Bears
or Steel Curtain?

124
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,393
Ah, that's
hardly debatable.

125
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,028
Bears.
Yeah.

126
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,031
Well, there hasn't been
much of that this time.

127
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,132
What?
Pointless conversation?

128
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,600
Any conversation.

129
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,703
How are things
in high finance?

130
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,505
Ah, put it this way...

131
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,709
there's this motivational poster
in my office

132
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,011
with, like,
this eagle

133
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,613
soaring out
of the sky and shit.

134
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:15,681
Yeah.

135
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,449
I'll spend some days
just staring at it,

136
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,051
trying to decide
whether or not

137
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,819
I'm more suicidal or
homicidal that day.

138
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,954
Nice!

139
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,522
So quit.

140
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:26,460
Quit? And do what?

141
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:30,297
You ever do that thing when you
were in second grade,

142
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,999
where you,
like, drew a picture

143
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,736
of... of what you wanted to be when
you were adult, you know?

144
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:41,409
Like, I heard that that's the truest
reflection of what you really want.

145
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,412
Like, if you're doing
what you drew back then,

146
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,081
then you're probably
really happy.

147
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,782
Yeah? And what'd
you draw?

148
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:48,984
Me?

149
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,052
I think I drew
a fat, unemployed writer,

150
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,087
so I'm killing it.

151
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,102
Come on.

152
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:08,405
Nothing.

153
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,088
So Joanne didn't like
your music, huh?

154
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,724
We just have
different tastes.

155
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,661
More likely,
she has taste.

156
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:31,997
Well, I liked it.

157
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,998
Karen liked it.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,266
Would you stop that?

159
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,368
What, man?
I mean...

160
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,570
Joanne didn't
like your music,

161
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,438
and she made you
get rid of your guitars.

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,307
I'm just trying
to get up to speed here.

163
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,841
No, she didn't
make me do anything.

164
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,009
It became clear
that I wasn't

165
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,511
gonna have a lot
of chances to play,

166
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:46,046
so I got rid
of the stuff.

167
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,815
You know, she's not
a music critic.

168
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:48,916
She's a receptionist.

169
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,851
She's my wife,
Carter, my wife.

170
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,019
I'm just saying.

171
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,588
I know exactly
what you're saying,

172
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,222
and I'm telling you
to stop.

173
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,998
Davey said he saw
you guys at the store,

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,867
but you just kind of
walked right on by.

175
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,436
Yeah? Well,
tell him I say hello.

176
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,937
Why don't
you tell him?

177
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,374
You live less than, like,
10 miles away from the guy.

178
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,575
Yeah, we're pretty busy.

179
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,478
Well, he thinks that
your wife hates him.

180
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,713
No.
No?

181
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,915
She's just not much
on gatherings, that's all.

182
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,317
What about
your parents' house?

183
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,219
There's never less than
a hundred people there.

184
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,021
Ah, we don't
visit very often.

185
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,155
Okay.

186
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,625
Uh, so no Davey,
no family.

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,460
Sounds like the list
of people she does like

188
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,428
is kind of short.
I hope you're on it, buddy.

189
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,763
Seriously,
would you knock it off?

190
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,199
You don't even know her.

191
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,735
You're right, man.
I don't know her.

192
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,204
Every time I come to visit you guys,
you're too busy.

193
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,107
I'm surprised she let you get away
to do this thing with me.

194
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,642
Here we go! Here we go!

195
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,212
Oh, thank God.
Come on. Here we go.

196
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,680
Whoa. Wait a minute.

197
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:48,948
Oh, shit. Wait. Wait.

198
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,216
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

199
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:51,817
God damn it!

200
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,787
Agh! Ow!

201
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,056
God damn it!

202
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,157
Dude, are you okay?

203
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,159
Hold up!

204
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,028
Hold on!

205
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,163
Shit!
Hold on!

206
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,565
Wait. Wait!

207
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,634
Hey! Wait!

208
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:08,636
Hey!

209
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:09,971
Hold on!

210
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:10,972
Hey!

211
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,173
Yo.

212
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:15,743
Whoa. Whoa.

213
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,049
Hey.
Car trouble?

214
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,216
Yeah. We, uh...

215
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:23,318
We broke down
a few minutes ago.

216
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,321
Well, I-I'm not
much good on cars.

217
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:26,790
I'll give you
a lift into town.

218
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,491
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

219
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,093
Just let me grab my bag.

220
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,661
Hey! Look, a ride.
Wait! Wait!

221
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:32,595
Sorry.

222
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,763
Hold on.
We don't need it.

223
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,632
What do you mean
we don't need it?

224
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,433
Sorry, sir.

225
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,634
Nothing
to worry about, son.

226
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,069
I- I'm harmless.
No, it's not...

227
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,739
No.
I, uh...

228
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:42,840
No, it's all right.

229
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,942
It's not that.
It's just that the...

230
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,812
The truck,
it's not broken.

231
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:50,047
What do you mean
it's not broken?

232
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,248
It's...
I took a wire out.

233
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,383
It's not a big deal.

234
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:53,719
What are you talk...
Um...

235
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:55,854
One second.

236
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:57,189
What are you
talking about?

237
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,392
I thought that we were gonna have
some good conversations

238
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:00,760
like the last time,
you know?

239
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,229
But instead I got
cellphones and freeways

240
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:04,731
and motels and
fucking sports radio.

241
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,134
And, uh, I mean,
I tried to get off the beaten path.

242
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,602
You just decided
to go to sleep,

243
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,338
so I thought this would give us
a chance to catch up.

244
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,339
Thank you, sir.

245
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,808
Are you out
of your f...

246
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,510
You sure everything's all right?
Yes. Oh, yeah.

247
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:19,780
I... I am definitely sure.

248
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,014
Okay.

249
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,549
Ta-da.
All right, thank you.

250
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,318
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

251
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,319
Put it in.

252
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,553
It's no big deal,
man.

253
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,890
Put it in!
I want to see it start.

254
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:31,127
It's just a wire.

255
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,361
Sorry about this.

256
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:34,396
Just give us a second.

257
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:38,667
It's just a wire, man.

258
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,902
Look.
Okay.

259
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,305
Here.

260
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,230
Happy?

261
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,231
You boys good?

262
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,232
Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,067
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

264
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,170
I appreciate it.
Have a good day.

265
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:14,640
Sorry.
Thank you for stopping.

266
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:20,747
Are you insane?!

267
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:22,615
Huh?

268
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:23,983
You stage
a breakdown

269
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:25,151
in the middle
of the desert

270
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,853
so that
we can talk?

271
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,222
Yeah, and we've had our longest
conversation in the whole trip.

272
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,790
I guess that's
a coincidence.

273
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,826
I could have broken my neck falling
down that goddamn hill.

274
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,961
I told you not go up there.
We could have had

275
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,630
a perfectly good talk sitting
right here... Talk?!

276
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,000
but you had to go up and
climb a fricking mountain.

277
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,468
That was not a talk.

278
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,504
That was you stopping us
a hundred miles from nowhere

279
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,372
so that you could spend a few
uninterrupted minutes

280
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,975
bashing my wife and job!

281
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,651
What kind
of a ring was it?

282
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:56,752
What?

283
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,222
The engagement ring.
What kind was it?

284
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:01,057
What do you mean,
what kind?

285
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,258
Was it a diamond?

286
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,526
Why does that matter?

287
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:04,760
Why won't you answer?

288
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,163
Fine. I got her a diamond.
So what?

289
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,665
"So what?"
So you just forgot

290
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,167
all about
the gumball doctrine?

291
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,301
The gumball doc...

292
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:13,605
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding me.

293
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:16,541
Has nothing happened to you
in the last 10 years?

294
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,775
So you do remember?

295
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,544
Yeah, I remember it
as something cooked up

296
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:22,747
by a couple of losers who had
nothing better to do on a Friday night.

297
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,249
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I didn't cook it up.

298
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,919
You did. You're the one.
You're the one that said

299
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,888
that you would never
buy an engagement ring

300
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,689
that didn't come
from a gumball machine.

301
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,259
You're the one that said
the poorest people on the planet

302
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:34,793
are hacking off
each others' limbs

303
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,196
to give you something to
spend two months' salary on.

304
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,365
Look, just because you took
some conversation we had

305
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,102
over beer and macaroni and
decided to make it your religion

306
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:44,671
doesn't mean the rest
of the world gives a shit.

307
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:46,841
Okay, fine. So you
gave up on diamonds.

308
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,843
Okay. Who gives
a shit, man?

309
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,847
You give up on your music,
your friends and your family,

310
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,782
and for what,
the rebound girl?

311
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,317
Come on.
The rebound girl?

312
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,318
Yes.
Really?

313
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,321
Yes, the rebound girl.

314
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,355
I was there.

315
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,857
I saw you
and Karen together.

316
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,625
You were insane
for the girl.

317
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,594
And... And when
she left, you know...

318
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,397
You were messed up.
Okay? People get that.

319
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,600
But four months later,
and you're engaged to the secretary?

320
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,168
Listen,
take a step back,

321
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,771
and see that
for what it is.

322
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:16,739
I fell in love.
You panicked.

323
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,041
Why do you insist
on listening

324
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,742
to the words you're
putting into my mouth

325
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,946
rather than the ones
I'm actually saying?

326
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,414
You got a goddamn dog.

327
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,848
So what?
You're allergic!

328
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,350
Take a pill.

329
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:27,484
What's the dog's name?

330
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,086
Sun...
Fuck you.

331
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:30,087
No.

332
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:31,189
No, "Fuck You"...

333
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,657
No, "Fuck You,"
I would believe.

334
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,559
"Fuck You" is exactly
the kind of name

335
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:35,894
that you
would name a dog.

336
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:39,831
No, but your dog's name
is Sunshine.

337
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,200
Fucking Sunshine.

338
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,703
Are you gonna look at me with
a straight face

339
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,905
and tell me that your opinion was
actually considered

340
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,175
in the decision that resulted
in an animal

341
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:51,844
you're allergic to being named after
a Care Bear?

342
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,080
Oh, my God, you're right.
I didn't get to name the dog.

343
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,147
My life is a sham.

344
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,217
No, no, let me just get
this straight, okay?

345
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,352
J- Just for me.

346
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,420
So the love
of your life leaves.

347
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:02,990
Okay? And, um,
less than a year later,

348
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:05,093
you're married
to a secretary

349
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:08,329
who loves dogs and hates
your fucking music.

350
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,132
I think it's reasonable at that
point to have some doubts, right?

351
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,669
I think it's reasonable to
email your good friend Carter.

352
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,670
You remember that?

353
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:16,971
"Hey, what the fuck, man?

354
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,942
What am I getting into?
Did I make a mistake?"

355
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,945
And before I can hit reply,
you buy a fucking house!

356
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,214
That's great!
I understand.

357
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,482
Right. Okay, fine.
You're...

358
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,750
Focus on...

359
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,284
You want to focus on
fucking square footage,

360
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:31,521
rather than the fact that
you have nothing in common.

361
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,689
That's okay.
You...

362
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,424
It's marriage counseling
by HGTV.

363
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,694
I get it, man.
I get it.

364
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,330
And now, you know, after all this
home improvement,

365
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,531
you realize, you know,

366
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,500
you haven't improved
a goddamn thing.

367
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,335
And now you got
no distractions.

368
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,003
"What am I gonna do?"

369
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,338
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

370
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,541
It's the next chapter
in the off-the-shelf life plan

371
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,009
you got
from Home Depot!

372
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,079
Right. Procreate!

373
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,548
That's the job
that's never finished.

374
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,849
"Keep my face down.

375
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,718
Keep my nose
to the grindstone. "

376
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,086
Just focused
on the kid,

377
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,722
and maybe you can go
the rest of your life

378
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,426
ignoring the fact
that you fucked up, man.

379
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,327
You made
a colossal mistake,

380
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,430
and you married,
literally,

381
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,065
the first chick
to come along.

382
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,200
What... Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Fucking...

383
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:15,569
I'm not saying anything
you don't know already.

384
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,705
Just swallow your pride,
and you'll see how true it is.

385
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,307
You ever talk about my family
like that again,

386
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,643
I will kick the shit out of you.
You hear me?

387
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,844
Okay. All right.

388
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,848
Listen, I'm sure
that Cole is great.

389
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,918
I'm sure he's the best thing
to ever happen to you,

390
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,121
but he's not a substitute
for loving your wife.

391
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:35,523
Joanne was right.

392
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,992
You're nothing
but a piece of shit.

393
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:42,399
Okay.

394
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,467
That's okay.
Get in!

395
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,901
I'll get in when I'm...

396
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,770
I'll get in when I'm
good and fucking ready.

397
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,238
That's when
I'll get in.

398
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,710
So it's you and Joanne
against the whole world.

399
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:55,045
That's all right.
That's okay.

400
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,446
You know,
you're so scared

401
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,082
to admit that you
made a mistake,

402
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,785
that you just keep on making it
over and over and over again.

403
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,286
But that's fine.
That's fine.

404
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:05,490
You want to keep on believing
your own bullshit,

405
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,757
we'll get you home,

406
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,494
get you back to your
perfect little life

407
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:10,962
and your
"motivational posters,"

408
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,064
and you
can tune back out and...

409
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,201
and try to forget
all about the fact

410
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:17,337
that your life is
a complete shit hole.

411
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,140
Then maybe, maybe you can
call me in 20 years

412
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,908
when you've
fucking lost your hair

413
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,277
and you've come
to your senses.

414
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,413
I don't think we'll be
talking much anymore.

415
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,715
Whatever.

416
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,526
Stupid motherfucker.

417
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:40,361
It probably just
came loose, man.

418
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,362
Are you insane!

419
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:42,363
Calm down!

420
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,397
Why are you...
Calm down?

421
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,832
You want me
to calm down?!

422
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,767
You go fucking around with
the electrical system

423
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:48,303
in a 30-year-old
piece-of-shit truck

424
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,073
in the middle of the desert
with no food and no water,

425
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,642
and I'm supposed
to calm down!

426
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,677
I didn't fuck around with it.
I disabled it, briefly.

427
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,046
You should be thankful
that I'm willing to go to these...

428
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,047
Thankful!
I should be thankful?!

429
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,415
lengths to try
to help you.

430
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,816
Who the fuck are you

431
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:03,887
to be giving me some sort
of life intervention, huh?

432
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,189
You're unemployed!

433
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:05,989
You're homeless!

434
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,691
Yes, and you
hate your job,

435
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,961
and you have a house that's
apparently too small for a guitar!

436
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,397
This is so typical.
This is so typical.

437
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,399
You're constantly
doing something for you

438
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,701
and then saying that
it's for everybody else.

439
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,036
You don't like my wife,

440
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,572
we don't get
to hang out anymore,

441
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:21,906
so you want me
to get divorced,

442
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,007
right,
for my own good...

443
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,376
Yeah.
Because I can do better,

444
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:25,711
but it's all bullshit.

445
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:27,580
You want me to find somebody
you like better.

446
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:29,048
It's for your own good.

447
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,182
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

448
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,051
I got a good job.
I make good money.

449
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:34,053
I have a house, a family,
and it kills you,

450
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,055
because you're a 30-year-old
failure who lives in his car.

451
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,824
Right. So you turn your
anger on everybody else

452
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:40,727
and try to make us feel like our
achievements aren't worth a shit

453
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:41,995
because we
didn't draw a picture

454
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:44,064
of ourselves doing them
in the second grade.

455
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,732
You actually
think that if I quit,

456
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,067
took up music
and actually made it,

457
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,435
that you'd be
happy for me?

458
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,769
Mm.
Fuck that. You would be

459
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,905
just as blind with jealousy
then as you are now.

460
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,107
You'd probably...
I don't know...

461
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,875
run me over with
your car-slash-house...

462
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,143
Probably.
and then tell me

463
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,313
that it was for
my own good, right?

464
00:19:58,315 --> 00:19:59,314
Yeah.

465
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:00,849
This is not about me.

466
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,384
You don't give a shit
about me.

467
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:03,652
This is all about you

468
00:20:03,654 --> 00:20:05,554
and how everybody else
can accommodate your failure.

469
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:08,156
Hey, I'm not
a failure, okay?

470
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,660
I could have everything
you have and more,

471
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:14,264
but I decided long ago that it
would be better to follow my dream

472
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:17,367
rather than try to buy enough shit
from fucking Pottery Barn

473
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,902
to be comfortable
with the idea of being

474
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:23,873
a meaningless, lever-pulling,
button-pushing cog!

475
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,876
I was a day away from...

476
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:27,344
From law school.
No, no.

477
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:28,579
We all know
the story.

478
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:30,080
Fuck!

479
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:32,784
You took a test.
You blew it away.

480
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,252
You had your choice
of schools,

481
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:36,855
but walked away for the
sake of art, right? Right?

482
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,990
I followed my dream
instead of a paycheck.

483
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,892
Yeah. No, no, no,
no, no. Enh! wrong.

484
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,762
You're a scared and
insecure little freak

485
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,363
who couldn't get
anywhere with writing

486
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:46,999
and so desperately needed somebody
to approve of you,

487
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,968
to say that you were
still intelligent,

488
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,002
still capable...
Come on.

489
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,537
that you took
a fricking test.

490
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,005
You know
what you should do?

491
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:54,740
You should tattoo that test score
on your forehead.

492
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:57,643
That way, when somebody says,
"Wait a second. You live in your car?"

493
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:58,945
You can say,
"Yeah, but look.

494
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,987
I chose to be a loser,
so its okay. "

495
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,019
You think you've got the rest of us
pegged, right?

496
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,555
You got the rest
of us pegged,

497
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,924
and it's your job to make sure
we all face reality?

498
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,592
The reality is
your writing sucks.

499
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,961
You're not gonna be famous.
You're not gonna sell a book.

500
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,364
You are wasting
your time.

501
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,232
You're the one that needs
to face facts, pal.

502
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,934
But every time those facts
get too close,

503
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,936
you just hop in your car,
and you run off.

504
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:22,104
Well,
here are the facts.

505
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,672
A 30-year-old loser
living in his car

506
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:26,041
is about the last person that I'm
gonna be looking to

507
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:27,543
for advice
on how to fix my life.

508
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,912
So unless you want to put out
a book of don'ts

509
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,481
based on all the ways
you screwed up,

510
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,483
which is the only thing
you're ever likely to publish,

511
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,418
you should probably
just shut the fuck up.

512
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,523
Are you done?

513
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:51,536
Fuck!

514
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:04,484
Shit. Shit.

515
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,507
Shit. Sh...

516
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,525
Someone'll come along.

517
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,195
You make me sick.

518
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,413
Hot enough for ya?

519
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:12,555
They say the nights kill
more people than the days.

520
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:16,759
Okay.

521
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:20,631
I'm so thirsty.

522
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,566
My tongue feels
like a two-by-four.

523
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:24,868
Here.

524
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,146
Eh...

525
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:50,863
Man, finish it.

526
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:57,638
How long can you go
without water?

527
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,139
Two days?

528
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,540
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

529
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,009
I'm going for help
in the morning.

530
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:05,178
Oh, 60 miles is
a pretty long walk.

531
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,348
That's only if
I don't see a car.

532
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,152
I think I saw some cones
on the way in, man.

533
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,587
I don't know.

534
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,092
Hey, I know it...

535
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:22,164
I know it doesn't really change
anything, but, uh...

536
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,632
I'm sorry.

537
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:29,205
It was definitely
not your brightest idea.

538
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,708
I mean I'm sorry
about what I said.

539
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:34,844
Are you sure you
don't want to apologize

540
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:36,379
for getting us stuck?

541
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:39,215
I'm not freezing to death
because you insulted my wife.

542
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,820
I'm sorry about
the whole goddamn thing.

543
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,093
You really think
my writing sucks?

544
00:26:49,095 --> 00:26:50,928
It's... It's not bad.

545
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,396
It's just...

546
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:57,302
all... all your characters
get, like, cancer and die.

547
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:58,805
Don't all get cancer
and die.

548
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,306
In that one thing,
I'm pretty sure

549
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:01,474
about 75%
of the people die...

550
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:04,110
That was about
an oncologist.

551
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:05,611
Yeah, and that other one
with the woman

552
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:07,613
who was high and her baby
crawled out the window.

553
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:09,582
I mean, it was
good writing, but...

554
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,417
kind made me
want to kill myself.

555
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,287
Look, that shit really
happens, all right?

556
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:19,226
It's just hard to get the message
out if nobody reads the book.

557
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,962
The idea that
"I might not have it,"

558
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:24,598
it's... it's not news.

559
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,234
It's just that...

560
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:29,938
you go your whole life
with everyone

561
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,709
yelling at you to follow your dream
and then to never give up.

562
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:36,545
But to be honest, if everyone
followed their dreams,

563
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:39,281
we'd just be a planet
of pro athletes and...

564
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,616
and astronauts.

565
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:44,086
You know, there's gotta
be someone there

566
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:46,288
to clean the toilets,
am I right?

567
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,924
It's like you said,
you know.

568
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:50,794
Sometimes it's better to go after
something you care about

569
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,563
than to be handed something
that you don't, right?

570
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:54,498
Really?

571
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,233
What if
my lifelong dream

572
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,235
was to be point guard
for the Lakers?

573
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:00,504
Would you tell me
to keep chasing that?

574
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,772
No.

575
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:03,341
Exactly.

576
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:04,543
Because "Never give up"

577
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,545
looks a hell
of a lot better

578
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,881
on a coffee mug than
it does in real life.

579
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,916
Because failing...

580
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,455
daily failing, it's...
it's just...

581
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:19,224
it's a lonely...

582
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,127
miserable business.

583
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:26,900
Look man, if I thought you should quit,
I would say so.

584
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:33,239
But sometimes, you know,
inside all that other stuff,

585
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,641
sometimes...

586
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:37,344
you'll say something
in just a few words

587
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:39,514
that I realize I've
been thinking for years.

588
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,683
And that's not just
you reading my mind.

589
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:43,585
That's you
reading a part of it

590
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:46,021
that I never would have
known how to express.

591
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:49,324
Now, that's not just some fat kid
with no jump shot.

592
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:50,325
That's...

593
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,561
There's something there.

594
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,865
Some of the things
you put out there, man...

595
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:00,570
I think a lot more of them
stick than you realize.

596
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,714
I cheated on Joanne.

597
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,285
Are you kidding me?

598
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:15,887
No.

599
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,356
Six months ago
at this conference.

600
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:20,992
Just...

601
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:22,694
just sort of happened.

602
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,498
We're freezing our asses
off in the middle of the desert.

603
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,033
You think you're
gonna get away with,

604
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:29,034
"It just
sort of happened?"

605
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,937
It was just...

606
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,505
It was this woman...

607
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,341
Girl, really, 21, 22,

608
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,942
somebody's intern.

609
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,179
Long brown hair,
these long, skinny legs,

610
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:42,816
and she had
this huge smile.

611
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:44,985
And she walks up to me,
and she introduces herself,

612
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:48,155
asks what firm I'm with, blah, blah, blah.
And I said, like,

613
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:51,659
"Listen, if... if you're looking for a job,
I'm the wrong guy,"

614
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:55,096
and she goes, "No, I just
think you look interesting. "

615
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:57,398
And she says, "Would you
like to have dinner?"

616
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,969
And I realize that I've had my hands
in my pockets this whole time,

617
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:03,372
so she has no idea
that I'm even married.

618
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:04,606
Mm-hmm.

619
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,108
And suddenly I get
this feeling, you know,

620
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,443
like I told you I get
with books and movies,

621
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:10,379
like I... I finally had
a chance to escape,

622
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:12,214
to be somebody else
for a while.

623
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:14,650
So I go back up to my room,

624
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:17,587
and suddenly I feel
this wave of guilt,

625
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,489
like the spell breaks,

626
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:21,291
and I start thinking
this is crazy.

627
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:22,726
Then all of a sudden,

628
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:25,496
my phone rings,
and it's Joanne.

629
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:27,898
And I answer, and I say,

630
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,801
"I'm so glad you called,"
because I was.

631
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:33,638
"I miss you, and I wish
you were here right now. "

632
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,041
And she says, "Well, I wish
I were there right now, too,

633
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,375
"because the disposal's
broken again.

634
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,643
"Do you want me
to call a repairman,

635
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,045
"or do you want
to try and fix it?

636
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,080
"Oh, and did you ever
talk to our neighbor

637
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:44,249
"about whether or not
they stole our recycling bin?

638
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,818
Because it's getting a little
awkward walking with... "

639
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,155
And she goes on like this
for, like, five minutes.

640
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:55,761
So when I hung up,

641
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,831
I practically ran
to the elevator.

642
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,067
And Annie...
her name was Annie...

643
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:01,735
we have this whole dinner,

644
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,204
and you know
what we talked about?

645
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,306
College football.

646
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,241
Mm.
College football.

647
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,043
No car insurance,
no day care,

648
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:12,046
no gossip about other parents
I don't even know.

649
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,749
Just simple, effortless conversation.
I've never...

650
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:20,421
The first one that
I've had in a long time.

651
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,458
Scale of 1 to 10?

652
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,492
10.

653
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:25,027
Plus the fact
that she was 21,

654
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,395
makes her, like,
an eleventy-zillion.

655
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:28,163
Hello.

656
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,498
Don't get me wrong.

657
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,469
Joanne is
very attractive.

658
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,071
And this is gonna
sound shallow, but...

659
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,811
pregnancy is bad
for a body.

660
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,881
You know, sometimes
I'll catch myself

661
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:47,284
staring at her thighs
or belly,

662
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:48,719
and I'll be like...

663
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,922
whatever happened to the
woman I married, you know?

664
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:56,328
You do realize you're the
one who made her like that.

665
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,931
I know. That's why I feel like an
asshole even saying this.

666
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:02,334
I feel like an asshole
even thinking it.

667
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,769
And don't get me wrong.

668
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:05,805
Cole is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

669
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,340
It's just
he's the worst thing

670
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,042
that ever happened
to our sex life.

671
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:12,179
I used to look at Joanne
and just want to jump her,

672
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,449
but now I look at her,
and sometimes...

673
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:18,018
And this is embarrassing,
but sometimes

674
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,587
I have trouble...

675
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:23,557
getting ready for her.

676
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:26,795
And Annie?

677
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,963
I could be ready
just thinking about her.

678
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:30,799
I was ready
when she asked my name.

679
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,568
I guess
when you get married,

680
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,237
you're supposed to say
that the relationship

681
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:39,941
goes beyond tight thighs
and a skinny waist

682
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,377
and that,
when all that goes,

683
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:42,813
the rest of it
will sustain you.

684
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:44,448
Well, it just
isn't phrased that way.

685
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,284
But if... if it was, would you still
have married her?

686
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:48,852
Yeah, of course, but...

687
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:51,855
you just don't realize
how much you'll miss things,

688
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:53,690
you know, little things,
like kissing.

689
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:55,592
Y- You don't kiss
Joanne anymore?

690
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,027
Yeah, we kiss
all the time,

691
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,995
but it's habit.
It's like a handshake.

692
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,631
You don't even
think about it.

693
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:01,833
But when Annie kissed me...

694
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:03,334
fuck.

695
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:07,338
It was like the hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

696
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,408
It's hard to say, but there's more in
that first kiss with someone new

697
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,844
than there is in the whole
shebang after four years.

698
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:14,145
That's how everything was.

699
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:16,082
It was just exciting,
you know, touching her,

700
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:17,951
taking her clothes off
for the first time.

701
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:21,888
And then the... the rest of the
weekend at... at the conference,

702
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,124
I'd be sitting
in some stupid speech,

703
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:27,494
and all I could think about was
those tiny, little legs

704
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:28,862
and those little
black panties,

705
00:33:28,864 --> 00:33:32,066
and I just... I felt like
I was going fucking crazy.

706
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,035
So then, at lunch,
I found her...

707
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:39,507
and we blew off
the rest of the conference,

708
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,475
just blew it off.

709
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,310
Did it four times
on Sunday...

710
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,047
once an hour before
we went to the airport.

711
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:48,783
Now, you have
to understand,

712
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,587
if Joanne and I do it
four times a month,

713
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:53,222
it's a fucking miracle.

714
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:56,792
But it's like I knew that it was gonna
disappear forever,

715
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,929
and I just...
I couldn't get enough.

716
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,931
And did it
disappear forever?

717
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:05,135
Yeah, we email
sometimes, but...

718
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:06,803
nothing serious.

719
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,540
But every time I see
her name in my in-box,

720
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,408
it's like my heart
doubles up, man.

721
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,043
Are you gonna
see her again?

722
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:15,546
Why? That would just
ruin it, you know?

723
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:18,949
Everything I felt for Annie,
I used to feel for Joanne.

724
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,288
So, what, I just run off with this
gorgeous little football fan. Then what?

725
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,926
Next thing you know, talking to
Annie is like talking to Joanne,

726
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:29,395
kissing Annie is like
kissing Joanne. It's...

727
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:33,365
That's just
what marriage does.

728
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:40,273
You asked if I ever mention
the music to Joanne.

729
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,274
Well, I have.

730
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:42,709
Hmm.
I do.

731
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:44,277
It's like clockwork.

732
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,914
Every couple of months,
I'll wake up,

733
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,884
freaked out that my life
is meaningless.

734
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:53,253
She'll try on some clothes,
have a breakdown,

735
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:56,157
swear she's gonna lose 20 pounds,
swears off food.

736
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,295
I swear that I'm gonna turn in
my tie for a guitar strap.

737
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,564
We both say, "Good for you, honey.
I'm with you,"

738
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:06,802
not believing a single fucking word
the other person's saying.

739
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,072
That's the problem
with marriage. You...

740
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,442
You can't do it
without learning to lie

741
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,378
to the one person
you're supposed to trust.

742
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,147
Can I ask you something?

743
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,282
What?

744
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,019
And I don't... I don't
mean to upset you.

745
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,120
Um...

746
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,057
if it's so bad,
why don't you get out?

747
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,793
Let me see your keys.

748
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,096
I told you, I tried
a million times.

749
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:33,197
Just...
Just let me see 'em.

750
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,499
It's not gonna work,
brother.

751
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,069
That's it?

752
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,105
Two keys?

753
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:41,273
Yeah, why?

754
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,046
Jesus.
Yeah.

755
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:48,781
It's like you
mugged a locksmith.

756
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,116
Yeah, I know. It's, uh...

757
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:52,418
Okay, there's my...
my house keys.

758
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,953
I got my gym locker.

759
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:55,421
I've got my toolshed.

760
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,623
I've got my boat keys.

761
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,593
I don't know what the hell
that one's for...

762
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:00,927
Jesus.
or that one.

763
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,796
I mean, it's like...
You know when people say

764
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:03,964
they're gonna
put down roots?

765
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,866
Well, that's what
it looks like.

766
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,206
Shit.

767
00:36:14,843 --> 00:36:17,146
You know what
I always wanted?

768
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:18,414
What?

769
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,516
Mohawk, fucking Mohawk,

770
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:25,054
just like that dude from...
from "Taxi Driver. "

771
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:26,622
Travis Bickle?
The nutcase?

772
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:27,623
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

773
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,124
But I could never do it.

774
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:30,225
Why not?

775
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:33,163
Well, because my parents
would have killed me.

776
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:34,998
Then when I got to college,
I was working.

777
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,300
Then I was working as soon as
I got out of college.

778
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:39,636
Then of course I got married
and had a kid, so...

779
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,204
So?

780
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:44,041
So you don't see
many responsible parents

781
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:47,878
or functioning members
of society with Mohawks.

782
00:36:48,715 --> 00:36:50,349
So?

783
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:52,217
So forget about doing

784
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:53,952
something crazy
and life-altering

785
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:56,421
like quitting my job
or leaving my wife.

786
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,824
I can't even get
a haircut anymore

787
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:00,225
without thinking
about the keys,

788
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:02,527
and the keys,
they don't like Mohawks.

789
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:06,199
Well, how long do you have to listen
to the keys exactly?

790
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:08,935
U- Until you retire?
Until Cole goes to college?

791
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,437
Oh, I'll probably
be bald by then.

792
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,473
Exactly.

793
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:17,978
You know, I used to have something
on my key chain,

794
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,314
but it kept
falling off.

795
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:24,753
Do you know
what this is?

796
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,888
This is a multi-tool.

797
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,426
And do you know what
one of the tools is?

798
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:34,562
Shing.

799
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:35,597
Mohawk?

800
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,867
Dude, put away
the multi-tool.

801
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:38,868
It's not happening.

802
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,102
Why not?

803
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:42,338
Because I just told you
two pounds of why.

804
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,439
So what, man?
Nobody's here.

805
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,640
We're freezing
our asses off

806
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:45,741
in the middle
of the desert.

807
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:46,976
There's not a soul
to stop you.

808
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,411
Whoa.
Mohawk!

809
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,679
It's not something that
I think Cole needs to see,

810
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:52,115
is his old man
with a Mohawk.

811
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:53,850
So what? You'll...
Man, you'll...

812
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:56,621
you'll prove to him that..
that it's good to be your own man.

813
00:37:56,623 --> 00:37:58,322
What about Joanne?

814
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,892
Joanne's probably as bored with
you as you are of her.

815
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:03,594
You're probably one Mohawk away
from fucking like rabbits.

816
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:04,595
Okay, well...

817
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,397
Mohawk!
Mo...

818
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,866
Come on.
Just say fuck it, man.

819
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,702
Fuck it. Fuck the keys.

820
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,171
Do it for you.

821
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,774
Oh, God, you don't...

822
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,509
You're
pulling on it.

823
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:18,977
Just re...
Just relax.

824
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:20,345
Don't be a pussy.

825
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:22,347
There we go.

826
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,850
Whee.

827
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,318
That's looking good, man.

828
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,806
Here we go.

829
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,844
Ow!

830
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,846
Yeah, that's gonna
leave a mark.

831
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,347
Are you
fucking kidding me?

832
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:57,986
Is it straight?

833
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,488
It's fairly straight.

834
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,692
Yeah? Does it look
like Travis Bickle?

835
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:02,960
Heh. You look
pretty crazy.

836
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,431
What do you think?
Oh, no.

837
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,632
Do you love it?

838
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,035
Yes.

839
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:13,070
Oh, my God.

840
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:14,371
I'll give you 100 bucks

841
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:16,741
if you let me come to work
with you on Monday.

842
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:18,142
You don't have $100.

843
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:19,911
I know!
I'll sell something.

844
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:21,546
You gonna sell a book?

845
00:39:21,548 --> 00:39:22,347
Something of value,

846
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:25,383
like my kidney, maybe.
God.

847
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,919
Oh, my God. This look is never
gonna make it to work.

848
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,355
Oh, come on, man.
This is new Mitch coming through.

849
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:32,925
Oh, my... I can't believe how
many times you cut me.

850
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:34,126
The lacerations will fade,

851
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:36,263
but the memories
will last us a lifetime.

852
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:39,466
Oh, we can't say nothing happened
on this trip, huh?

853
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:41,768
God.

854
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,036
Yeah.

855
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,479
What?

856
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:55,449
Have you ever
been this thirsty?

857
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,319
No.

858
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:09,831
Really?

859
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,868
It tastes like water.

860
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,869
Gimme.

861
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:14,337
Yeah, tastes like water.

862
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:20,910
It's blue and soapy.

863
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:22,212
Yeah, well,
it's washer fluid.

864
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,714
What do you expect?

865
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:27,418
That's horrible.

866
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,287
I don't...

867
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,658
I don't
want any more.

868
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,130
All right.

869
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,299
I don't like it.
Well...

870
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:43,902
I- I'm gonna save
mine for tomorrow,

871
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:47,106
in case I have
to go for a walk.

872
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:52,111
Yeah, well,
we should pro...

873
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:54,848
We should probably
get some sleep...

874
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,384
Yeah.
in case you do, huh?

875
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:59,486
Yeah.

876
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:55,647
Holy shit.

877
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,117
Hold on. Hello.

878
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,753
Hello? Hi. Oh, God.

879
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,922
Thank you. Wait.

880
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:04,257
Hi. Hi.

881
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,658
Hold on. Hi. Hi.

882
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,894
How... How are you?
It's so good to see you.

883
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:09,328
We had...
Ow.

884
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,330
Okay, don't
go anywhere.

885
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:14,434
Um, we had a...

886
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:16,870
problem last night.

887
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:19,473
It's so good to see you.
I'm sorry. Um,

888
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:23,143
oh, my God. We had a bit of
an issue with the engine.

889
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:25,212
I guess I tampered with it,

890
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:26,814
or... I didn't really
dismantle it.

891
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:30,118
It's fine.
It's all good, but, uh,

892
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,753
God, we were here
all night,

893
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:33,656
all day and
all night last night.

894
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:35,758
Maybe you have food
or water or something?

895
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,359
Just... Just anything?
A ride, you know?

896
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:39,795
We...
We'll...

897
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:40,763
Wait! No!

898
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:43,699
Where are you going?
Wait! Wait! Wait!

899
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:51,007
Oh, God.

900
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:55,679
What the fuck
are you doing?!

901
00:42:57,715 --> 00:43:00,751
I... I thought she was
gonna take us with her.

902
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,085
She was!

903
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:04,856
Until you scared
the shit out of her!

904
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:08,060
You couldn't wait one minute to get
into the car, man?

905
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:09,294
Come on!

906
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,395
I don't...
I don't know.

907
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:12,464
I thought she...
I thought that...

908
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:17,069
You look like a goddamn fucking
horror movie extra!

909
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,906
Let's remember
why I look like this.

910
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:22,742
This...
This was your idea!

911
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:26,112
What am I afraid of?
What can it hurt? Well, there you go.

912
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:29,816
That is exactly why you can't have
a Mohawk in the real world.

913
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,520
I gave you a haircut,
not a lobotomy.

914
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:36,656
I don't feel well.

915
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:37,690
Ahh.

916
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:39,728
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

917
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,597
that I spent a day in the oven and
the night in the freezer

918
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,499
with nothing but fucking washer fluid
in my system!

919
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:46,535
I told you not to drink
that shit, man.

920
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:47,569
Oh!
It tasted like soap!

921
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,237
Okay, so this is
all my fault.

922
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:51,706
I got us stuck
in the desert.

923
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:55,678
Well, you certainly got us stuck
for another 20 hours.

924
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:59,148
Hey, do me a favor.

925
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,717
If you see
any more cars coming,

926
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,521
try not to be
such a fucking moron!

927
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:07,023
This is exactly
what happens

928
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:09,959
when you let a homeless person
cut your hair!

929
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,735
Don't worry.
I'm gonna call Joanne for you.

930
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:20,471
I'll tell her you're just fine,
you'll be home soon,

931
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:22,640
but you won't be able
to get it up looking at

932
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:23,908
her fat fucking thighs...
Hey!

933
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,144
unless you think about
your girlfriend Annie.

934
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:27,880
Hey, You better keep
your mouth shut!

935
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,815
Then maybe she'll give you

936
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:32,418
that divorce you're
so scared to ask for.

937
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,590
Then you can give those keys you love
so much to Cole's new dad!

938
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,591
Hey!

939
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,861
You fucker.

940
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:45,999
Aah!

941
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:50,404
Oh, shit.

942
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,446
Hey.

943
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,047
You son of a bitch.

944
00:45:01,184 --> 00:45:02,384
Hey.

945
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:04,419
Come here.
Hey!

946
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:06,054
Come here!
Hey! Hey!

947
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,429
You son of a...

948
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:18,801
You...

949
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,773
You just broke my nose!

950
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:23,774
Fucking...

951
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:26,644
Yaah!

952
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:28,913
Damn it.

953
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,948
Hyah!

954
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:44,629
Come on!

955
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:48,266
Aah! Oh, my eye!
Time-out!

956
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:49,869
Are you all right?

957
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,607
Damn it!

958
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:12,460
I think you broke my nose.

959
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,066
Now I'm going
to have two casts

960
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,001
and a fucking Mohawk.

961
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,813
Hey, quit fucking around,
and get up.

962
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:34,985
Come on. Get up!

963
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:38,088
Carter.

964
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:41,826
Carter?

965
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:51,836
Hey.

966
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,274
Get up!

967
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,275
C...

968
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:58,410
Hey.

969
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:01,113
Hey! Come on.

970
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:03,081
Come on.

971
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,549
Carter.

972
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:08,021
Oh, shit.

973
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:12,126
Oh, man.

974
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:13,861
I'm so sorry.

975
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:17,197
Carter, come on, buddy.
Wake up.

976
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,134
Wake up.

977
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:28,393
Oh, my God.

978
00:47:29,185 --> 00:47:31,499
Oh, my God.

979
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:41,690
Carter, come on, buddy.

980
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,526
Get up. Get up.

981
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:46,730
Get up!

982
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,033
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

983
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,104
Oh, my God.

984
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,975
H- Hey...

985
00:48:03,282 --> 00:48:04,916
Ah, fuck.

986
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,953
What the...

987
00:48:33,348 --> 00:48:35,483
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

988
00:48:35,485 --> 00:48:36,951
It's gonna be okay.

989
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:39,820
You know, I was
thinking about it,

990
00:48:39,822 --> 00:48:41,188
and it's really funny.

991
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,226
We should have
thought about it sooner.

992
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:47,761
We scared
that old lady, man.

993
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:50,333
We scared her.

994
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:53,269
I mean, look at me, right?

995
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,872
I'd be scared of me.
I'm... I look fucking crazy.

996
00:48:55,874 --> 00:48:57,907
But that's okay.
That's good. That's very good,

997
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,642
because she probably
went straight to town

998
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:00,910
and told somebody
about it, right?

999
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:02,612
She probably went
to the first house

1000
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:04,514
or store or whatever

1001
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:07,050
and was like,
"Ohh, you gotta help me.

1002
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,286
"Some crazy guy
with a crazy haircut

1003
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:10,921
tried to get in my car. "

1004
00:49:10,923 --> 00:49:13,290
But I wasn't trying
to get in her car.

1005
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:15,425
I was just... I was just
feeling it, you know.

1006
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:19,129
I was just trying to make sure it wasn't
one of those, what, mirages,

1007
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:21,298
like in the cartoons,
you know?

1008
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:27,139
But that's okay.
That's good.

1009
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:29,542
That's very good, because
she probably told somebody,

1010
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:32,745
and they're gonna come
out here and check it out.

1011
00:49:32,747 --> 00:49:34,346
They're probably
sending somebody right now.

1012
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,648
They're probably...

1013
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,383
They're probably
sending the police.

1014
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,623
The police are probably
coming right now.

1015
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:47,360
Carter.

1016
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:50,597
Carter, hey,

1017
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,599
I think the police
are coming.

1018
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:55,536
Carter, I need you
to wake up, buddy.

1019
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:57,538
I need you to wake up!

1020
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,940
Carter!

1021
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:00,909
The police are coming.

1022
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,844
The police are coming!

1023
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:07,583
I need you to help me make them
understand how this happened.

1024
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:09,484
Carter, come on!

1025
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:11,286
Come on!

1026
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,288
Hello!

1027
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,390
Do you hear me?

1028
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:17,994
'Cause if you
don't help me explain,

1029
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:19,729
they're not gonna
understand, Carter.

1030
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:23,099
Come on!

1031
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:27,770
You remember my keys?

1032
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:28,939
Do you remember my keys?

1033
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:30,941
I got a lot of things
to worry about.

1034
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:33,277
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1035
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:35,180
Wake up!

1036
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:48,294
Fucking...
I am sorry.

1037
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:19,660
Carter?

1038
00:52:19,662 --> 00:52:20,728
Carter.

1039
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,029
Holy shit!

1040
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:23,398
Holy shit! You're alive!

1041
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,699
You're alive!

1042
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:26,668
Carter! Oh. Okay.

1043
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,736
J- Just wait here.

1044
00:52:27,738 --> 00:52:29,104
Just...
You're okay.

1045
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,939
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

1046
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:32,941
Everything's gonna
be okay. All right?

1047
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:35,677
What's happening?

1048
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:37,412
You scared the shit
out of me!

1049
00:52:37,414 --> 00:52:38,847
That's what's happening.

1050
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:39,849
Ow, my head.

1051
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:41,050
Ohh. Oh, my God.
Quit it.

1052
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:42,585
I can't believe it.

1053
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:45,020
I have the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

1054
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:46,055
Okay.
All right, well, just...

1055
00:52:46,057 --> 00:52:47,390
Just stay
right there, okay?

1056
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:49,091
We'll get you
taken care of.

1057
00:52:50,026 --> 00:52:52,896
Oh shit. Oh, fuck.

1058
00:52:52,898 --> 00:52:54,898
Um...

1059
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,434
is this all mine?

1060
00:52:56,436 --> 00:52:58,469
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

1061
00:52:58,471 --> 00:52:59,637
Ohh.

1062
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:03,174
Jesus.

1063
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:04,609
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1064
00:53:04,611 --> 00:53:06,511
You.

1065
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:08,246
Wow.

1066
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:12,751
Okay, just...
Keep breathing.

1067
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:14,019
Breathe in.

1068
00:53:14,021 --> 00:53:15,988
Breathe in. Breathe in.

1069
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,689
Okay.
There you go.

1070
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:19,491
All right.
Good job. Good job.

1071
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:22,027
I hope I don't look
as bad as you do.

1072
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:23,862
Let's just say
we're tied.

1073
00:53:23,864 --> 00:53:25,597
Let's just...

1074
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:29,937
Um...

1075
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:32,540
what the fuck
happened to my hand?

1076
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,641
Oh.

1077
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,443
Uh, it...

1078
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,144
looks broken.

1079
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:38,879
Yeah. It looks
really broken.

1080
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,880
Yeah.

1081
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,483
Look, I'm just...

1082
00:53:43,885 --> 00:53:45,353
Look, it d...
It doesn't matter, okay?

1083
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,189
I'm just happy that
you're alive and okay.

1084
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,758
W- What the fuck
happened here?

1085
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,893
W- We were arguing.

1086
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,028
You don't remember?

1087
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,162
No.

1088
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,064
It really hurts
to think, actually.

1089
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,333
Well, then don't. Just...
Just sit here. Rest.

1090
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,335
It doesn't matter anyway.
It's over.

1091
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,373
Oh, my God.
It's almost dark.

1092
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:04,174
Yeah.

1093
00:54:04,176 --> 00:54:06,477
And nobody's come?

1094
00:54:06,479 --> 00:54:09,379
No. I hoped that lady was
going to send somebody,

1095
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:10,180
but she, uh...

1096
00:54:12,418 --> 00:54:15,018
Just take it easy.
I- I'll keep lookout.

1097
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,722
Oh, watch out.

1098
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:18,890
Oh, God.

1099
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:19,991
Maybe
I just need to...

1100
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,392
No, no. You stay.
Just stay...

1101
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:24,262
I just need to sit up
for a second.

1102
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:30,001
What the hell is that?

1103
00:54:31,737 --> 00:54:32,737
Uh...

1104
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:33,739
Well, it...

1105
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:35,107
What the fuck is that?!

1106
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:36,943
You don't understand.
I thought you were...

1107
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:38,712
What the fuck is that?!
Listen. Listen.

1108
00:54:38,714 --> 00:54:39,746
Stay back!
Listen.

1109
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:40,981
Get away from me!

1110
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:43,149
Come on, Carter.
I thought you were dead.

1111
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,518
I thought you were...

1112
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,352
Stay back!

1113
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:47,354
I... I didn't feel a pulse.

1114
00:54:47,356 --> 00:54:49,222
I checked your...
And there was no pulse.

1115
00:54:49,224 --> 00:54:50,791
I didn't
know what to do.

1116
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:54,729
So you were just gonna fucking
bury me in a hole?!

1117
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:56,264
No, no.
It's not like that. Listen.

1118
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:57,665
Are you fucking crazy?!

1119
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:00,067
We were fighting, and you pulled
the knife on me!

1120
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:01,202
You broke
my fucking nose!

1121
00:55:01,204 --> 00:55:02,637
You get the fuck back!

1122
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:03,738
You bit
my fucking cast!

1123
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,875
What was I supposed to do?
Come on. Just...

1124
00:55:06,877 --> 00:55:08,744
You tried to fucking kill me!

1125
00:55:08,746 --> 00:55:11,481
I wasn't trying
to kill you, buddy. Just...

1126
00:55:11,483 --> 00:55:13,950
Where you going?
What are you...

1127
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:15,685
Stay the fuck back!
Okay!

1128
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,686
Okay, okay. Listen...

1129
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,687
I'll kill you.

1130
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,521
I didn't know.

1131
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,690
I panicked.
I panicked, okay?

1132
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,160
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

1133
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:24,495
I wasn't feeling
all right.

1134
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:26,130
'Cause I thought
you were dead.

1135
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:28,065
You thought
I was gonna do it.

1136
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:29,733
Didn't you? Didn't you?!

1137
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:32,803
You thought...
You thought I was gonna do it,

1138
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:36,206
I was gonna fuck up your...
your perfect little life,

1139
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,542
and so you were just
gonna... gonna bury me,

1140
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,746
bury me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

1141
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:47,520
Your stupid, loner,
novelist friend...

1142
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:49,989
No.
who no one would ever miss.

1143
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:51,524
Hey, hey. Hey.
I didn't.

1144
00:55:51,526 --> 00:55:53,426
You stay the fuck
away from me!

1145
00:55:53,428 --> 00:55:54,894
All right.
Where you going?

1146
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:56,396
Get back!
Where are you going?

1147
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:57,998
I'll kill you!
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

1148
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,166
Don't follow me.

1149
00:55:59,168 --> 00:56:00,734
Hey. I'm...
Please don't go!

1150
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,669
Carter.

1151
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:29,866
Carter?

1152
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:33,370
Carter?

1153
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:35,071
Quit fucking around, man.

1154
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,706
You're freaking me out.

1155
00:57:02,202 --> 00:57:03,736
Ah, fuck!

1156
00:57:03,738 --> 00:57:05,371
Get out of here!

1157
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:17,716
Hey, Mitchell.

1158
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:22,321
I'm not well.

1159
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:26,659
It'd be so fucking easy.

1160
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:29,863
I just pull this
right across your throat,

1161
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:32,599
and I cover you
in this hole, Mitchell,

1162
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:35,702
and leave you in this godforsaken
hellhole forever.

1163
00:58:37,304 --> 00:58:41,009
You'd have to be
out of your mind.

1164
00:58:42,745 --> 00:58:45,413
No. That happened
a while ago...

1165
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:49,584
and I still can't do it.

1166
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:57,960
Why are you in the hole?

1167
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,763
Because it's warmer.

1168
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:20,750
We're in here.

1169
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,776
You... Do you hear something?

1170
01:01:09,906 --> 01:01:12,573
I would have
done things differently.

1171
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:16,678
I'd have made changes.

1172
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:20,982
Yeah. Me, too.

1173
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:29,124
You know, It wasn't
that bad of an idea.

1174
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:30,125
It's just we...

1175
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:34,297
We just
didn't do it right.

1176
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:38,935
Well...

1177
01:01:38,937 --> 01:01:40,071
next time.

1178
01:02:27,856 --> 01:02:29,958
There's gotta
be something.

1179
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:48,278
Carter.

1180
01:02:49,313 --> 01:02:51,248
Carter. Carter.

1181
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:56,319
Can you walk?

1182
01:02:56,321 --> 01:02:57,587
Look.

1183
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:59,356
I found another dot.

1184
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,726
That might not
even be a town.

1185
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:03,628
Well, then, what is it?

1186
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,296
It might just be a dot.

1187
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:06,864
Y- You can't have a dot

1188
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,067
if there's nothing there,
can you?

1189
01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:10,401
I don't know.

1190
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,603
Okay look,
the sun set over there,

1191
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:14,639
so that's west,
so we got...

1192
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:17,076
Never eat shredded wheat.

1193
01:03:17,078 --> 01:03:18,078
Okay, so it's...

1194
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,612
I- It's southwest,

1195
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:21,714
so we... we gotta
go that way.

1196
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,717
What if we get lost?

1197
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:26,352
Or eaten or...

1198
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:27,887
or something?

1199
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,589
Okay, no,
w- we use the sun

1200
01:03:29,591 --> 01:03:32,792
to make sure that we
stay in a straight line.

1201
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:34,762
Okay? I figure
in this condition,

1202
01:03:34,764 --> 01:03:36,864
we could probably go,
like, a mile an hour, okay?

1203
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:38,299
That's one day
to get there.

1204
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:42,736
We should just stay
near the road,

1205
01:03:42,738 --> 01:03:45,306
and then s-someone
will come for us.

1206
01:03:45,308 --> 01:03:48,075
Okay, we haven't seen
a car since that lady.

1207
01:03:48,077 --> 01:03:50,211
And what if you're right?
What if...

1208
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:53,015
What if this road was
closed down like you said?

1209
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:55,251
I can't...
I can't keep doing this.

1210
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:56,486
I can't do it.

1211
01:03:56,488 --> 01:03:57,987
Look, if we're
gonna go out...

1212
01:03:57,989 --> 01:03:59,755
if we're
not gonna make it,

1213
01:03:59,757 --> 01:04:02,191
I want to go out trying,
all right?

1214
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:06,229
Okay.

1215
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:07,397
You go.

1216
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:08,832
What?

1217
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:10,167
You go. I can't.

1218
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:13,370
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not going without you.

1219
01:04:13,372 --> 01:04:14,371
I'll be fine.

1220
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:15,639
No, you're not fine.

1221
01:04:15,641 --> 01:04:17,207
You're lying
in a fucking hole. Come on!

1222
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:19,109
We got three hours
until the heat rolls in.

1223
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:21,178
You can do it.
This is our best shot.

1224
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:23,380
I won't make it.

1225
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:24,716
Yes, you will, Carter.

1226
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,085
You remember the Grand Canyon?
Remember that?

1227
01:04:26,087 --> 01:04:28,053
When you tied the rope to me
and you pulled me up?

1228
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:29,388
Mitchell.
Do you remember that?

1229
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,525
I lost a lot
of blood, okay?

1230
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:33,526
You go.

1231
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:35,161
Come on. Get up.

1232
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,162
Get up!

1233
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:37,429
Come on. Get up!

1234
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:38,430
Ow!

1235
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:40,133
Come on.
Wait. Wait.

1236
01:04:40,135 --> 01:04:41,268
Wait.

1237
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,671
Fuck you.

1238
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:45,672
Come on.

1239
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,174
Help me up.
Come on.

1240
01:04:47,976 --> 01:04:49,509
I'll carry your ass.

1241
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:03,325
Come on.

1242
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:11,667
Come on.

1243
01:05:14,439 --> 01:05:15,872
Come here.

1244
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:42,801
What?

1245
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:45,303
I hear something.

1246
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:01,254
Hey!

1247
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:06,426
Hey! Hey!

1248
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:10,832
Hey!

1249
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,269
Hey!

1250
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:21,510
Hey!

1251
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,049
# I tell her
that I loved her #

1252
01:06:27,051 --> 01:06:29,818
# And lived with no regret

1253
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,888
# Oh, Laura

1254
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,758
# You just look away

1255
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,759
# Just look away...

1256
01:06:35,761 --> 01:06:37,861
No! Hey!

1257
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:40,130
Hey! Hey!

1258
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:44,635
# Oh, Laura

1259
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:46,003
# You just look away

1260
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:47,371
# Just look away

1261
01:06:47,373 --> 01:06:50,508
# Oh, nothing

1262
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:53,211
# Will get you to stay

1263
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,027
Forward or backward?

1264
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:10,661
Hmm.

1265
01:09:10,663 --> 01:09:12,563
Hey. Hey.

1266
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,031
Got you something.

1267
01:09:14,033 --> 01:09:15,499
I got you something.

1268
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,999
Hey. Hey.

1269
01:09:48,135 --> 01:09:49,703
I found something.

1270
01:09:49,705 --> 01:09:51,606
Heh.

1271
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:53,174
I saw something.

1272
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,480
See?

1273
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:02,617
Look. They go
to the town, probably.

1274
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:03,618
Oh, my God.

1275
01:12:09,524 --> 01:12:11,290
Jesus.

1276
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,671
Come on.

1277
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:29,376
We good?

1278
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,845
Yeah. Let's go.

1279
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,719
After you.

1280
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:39,789
All right.
Let's just...

1281
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,436
Is it heavy?

1282
01:12:52,438 --> 01:12:53,870
Yeah.

1283
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:03,213
Heh.

1284
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,359
Answer it.
Hello.

1285
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:16,328
Hello. Hello!

1286
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:39,018
Ah, you remember
Uncle Carter? Huh?

1287
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,352
Hey, doggie.

1288
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:42,121
Ha ha. Hey, what's up?

1289
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:43,389
How are you, man?

1290
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:45,558
Oh, I'm good.

1291
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,760
Remember Uncle Carter?

1292
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:47,928
Real good.

1293
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,964
Hey, Cole.

1294
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:51,132
Hi.
Hi.

1295
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:53,134
Low five.

1296
01:14:53,136 --> 01:14:54,669
This is everything.

1297
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:55,870
Yeah? That's it, huh?

1298
01:14:55,872 --> 01:14:57,338
Yeah.

1299
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,841
Are you sure
about this?

1300
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:01,242
Hey, Cole.
Yes?

1301
01:15:01,244 --> 01:15:04,012
Why don't you show Uncle Carter
his new room, huh?

1302
01:15:04,014 --> 01:15:05,047
Yes.
Yes?

1303
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:06,048
Good boy, Cole.

1304
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,382
All right.
Let's do it.

1305
01:15:07,384 --> 01:15:08,383
All right.

1306
01:15:08,385 --> 01:15:10,352
Thanks.
You got it.

1307
01:15:14,023 --> 01:15:15,457
So is this it?

1308
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:16,658
This is it.

1309
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,659
All right.

1310
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:12,151
All right, buddy, let's go.

1311
01:17:15,991 --> 01:17:16,991
There you go.

1312
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:18,058
You ready?

1313
01:17:20,395 --> 01:17:22,229
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

1314
01:17:22,231 --> 01:17:24,231
Are you kidding me, man?
It's the least I can do.

1315
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:27,768
Besides, it'll give me a chance to
knock out a big chunk.

1316
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,569
Yeah.

1317
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:30,739
I'm proud of you, man.

1318
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:33,008
Well, it's just
flowing from me now.

1319
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,610
How long is it
gonna take you guys

1320
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:36,611
to circumnavigate
the world?

1321
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,146
Uh, you know,

1322
01:17:38,148 --> 01:17:40,382
we're gonna stay with the parents
for a couple days,

1323
01:17:40,384 --> 01:17:43,052
and I'm still not entirely sure we're
gonna get through that,

1324
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:45,087
but if we do,
the tickets are open-ended,

1325
01:17:45,089 --> 01:17:47,991
so we'll just pick a continent
and stay until we get bored

1326
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:49,960
or, you know,
run out of money.

1327
01:17:51,095 --> 01:17:53,163
You know,
she's... she's not...

1328
01:17:53,165 --> 01:17:54,898
what I thought,
you know?

1329
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,666
I mean...

1330
01:17:56,668 --> 01:17:57,968
I never really knew.

1331
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:00,837
Yeah, well, she said
the same thing about you.

1332
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:03,207
Yeah.

1333
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:04,942
All right,
come here, you.

1334
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:07,412
All right, man.
See you.

1335
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:08,446
Be good.
All right.

1336
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:10,281
Be safe.
All right.

1337
01:18:10,283 --> 01:18:12,083
All right.

1338
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:05,074
Hello.

1339
01:19:05,076 --> 01:19:06,476
Hey.

1340
01:19:06,478 --> 01:19:08,010
I wake you?

1341
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:10,514
No, I just... I'm finishing
some stuff up.

1342
01:19:10,516 --> 01:19:12,182
What's going on?

1343
01:19:12,184 --> 01:19:14,818
Eh, you know,

1344
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,287
I just wanted
someone to talk to.

1345
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:19,356
I'm feeling...

1346
01:19:19,358 --> 01:19:20,858
weird.

1347
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:24,194
Has it occurred to you that maybe
you need some sleep?

1348
01:19:24,196 --> 01:19:25,797
I guess...

1349
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:28,234
I thought that
I was past the point

1350
01:19:28,236 --> 01:19:31,403
where I really believed that people
could change, you know?

1351
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:34,740
At least, the point where
I thought that I could.

1352
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:37,176
Sounds like
a pleasant surprise, no?

1353
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:38,677
Yeah. Absolutely,

1354
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:41,414
but I'm just not sure
I believe it.

1355
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:42,816
Believe what?

1356
01:19:42,818 --> 01:19:44,851
That I'm really
doing this.

1357
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:47,954
Well, what exactly
is the alternative?

1358
01:19:47,956 --> 01:19:49,923
Well, this is gonna
sound a little crazy.

1359
01:19:49,925 --> 01:19:52,659
Imagine that. You called me
in the middle of the night

1360
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,361
with something
that sounds a little crazy?

1361
01:19:54,363 --> 01:19:56,263
Part of me
believes that...

1362
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,735
we never made it
out of that desert...

1363
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:05,207
that we're just
lying there, overcome...

1364
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:10,078
and this is just all part
of our imagination.

1365
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,081
I told you this was
gonna sound crazy, but...

1366
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,985
And you didn't
sell it short.

1367
01:20:15,987 --> 01:20:19,255
A- Are you telling me that
you're not at all suspicious

1368
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:21,858
that things have
gone so smoothly?

1369
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,493
Suspicious? No.

1370
01:20:23,495 --> 01:20:25,795
I'm stunned,
I'm impressed,

1371
01:20:25,797 --> 01:20:27,764
but I'm not suspicious.

1372
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:29,799
Well,
maybe you should be.

1373
01:20:29,801 --> 01:20:31,202
I mean, think about it.

1374
01:20:31,204 --> 01:20:33,904
Things may be just a little
too good to be true,

1375
01:20:33,906 --> 01:20:35,105
you know what I mean?

1376
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:37,342
Believe me, if I
was making this up,

1377
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:40,078
there'd be a lot more lottery
winning and supermodeling.

1378
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,814
Well, at least convince me that
it's probable,

1379
01:20:42,816 --> 01:20:44,182
you know,
that life really

1380
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:46,819
can turn on a dime,
that you really can...

1381
01:20:46,821 --> 01:20:48,120
I don't know...
reinvent yourself.

1382
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:49,789
Which is harder
to believe,

1383
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:53,059
that things are finally going the way
you always wanted them to

1384
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:55,094
or that the only way
it could be this good

1385
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:56,662
is if it's all
in your head?

1386
01:20:56,664 --> 01:20:57,830
I don't know.

1387
01:20:57,832 --> 01:20:59,498
You don't have
an opinion on that?

1388
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,067
Well, I don't
know about you,

1389
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:02,668
but this better
be reality for me,

1390
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,538
because if we're still
out in the middle

1391
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:05,806
of the desert somewhere,

1392
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:07,874
I just finished
an imaginary book.

1393
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:11,679
Wow, that's...
That's really, really fast.

1394
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:14,148
So tell me how it ends.

1395
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,451
Well,
that's the funny thi...

1396
01:21:18,622 --> 01:21:20,356
Carter?

1397
01:21:21,558 --> 01:21:22,891
Carter?

1398
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,998
Piece of shit.
