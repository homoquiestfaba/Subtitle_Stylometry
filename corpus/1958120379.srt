- Exactly.

179
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,548
He's a pervert.
You know that, right?

180
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,851
The clown? Oh, yeah.

181
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,177
Couple years ago, he got
busted for putting cameras

182
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,812
in women's dressing rooms
in the mall.

183
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,901
Yeah,
but he got off pretty easy.

184
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,990
Yep.
Big rich kid, pizza money.

185
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,383
What store was it?

186
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,629
- I think it was Cole's.
- [girlfriend] Hmm.

187
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,474
[laughs]

188
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,061
[girlfriend]
Have you finally realized

189
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,000
how impractical
a barefoot costume is?

190
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,350
Listen, sister.

191
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,837
It's not called
Die Easy, all right?

192
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,397
- What are you doing?
- Just need to adapt.

193
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,270
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

194
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,337
You should take the ladder, pal.

195
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,710
Fine.

196
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,671
[grunting in pain]

197
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,069
So, when are we
putting on our costumes?

198
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,289
[crunching]

199
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,030
Yeah, uh, here's the thing.

200
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,293
I don't wanna do that.

201
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,749
I kinda like
what I'm wearing now.

202
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:27,991
I know it's a sin to say,

203
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,776
but I don't even like Halloween.

204
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,797
Yeah, I mean,
I don't like scary movies,

205
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,605
I don't like
dressing up, and frankly,

206
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,086
I find that people that
take it too seriously to be...

207
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,609
Well, they're idiots.

208
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,239
So anybody
that dresses up is an idiot?

209
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,303
No, no, no, no, just people

210
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,526
that take it too seriously.

211
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,485
All right. Attention.

212
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,008
You, I need your paint.

213
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:46,638
And who here
has the best handwriting?

214
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:48,055
This is a Halloween emergency.

215
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,280
I have a calligraphy set
back at home if need be.

216
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,255
[girlfriend] There's not
too many people out there.

217
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,672
Mm, it'll be all right.

218
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Not even dark yet,
and it's a beautiful night.

219
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,026
Mm, you know what it's
a perfect night for, literally?

220
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,505
[Hayes] For me
to put on my costume on?

221
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:11,556
Jesus Christ, fine!

222
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,559
But, I put this on,

223
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,654
and we are definitely
fucking in costume tonight.

224
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,259
I mean, that is a given.

225
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,304
[customer] Excuse me.
You there, on the roof.

226
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,880
There's a man down there
holding a pumpkin

227
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,229
with a swastika.

228
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,424
[customer]
Are you the manager?

229
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,058
Uh, yeah.

230
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,688
I mean, technically,
we're closed for the season,

231
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:37,757
so if this is a complaint,

232
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,091
which I'm gonna assume it is,

233
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,498
- then I have to...
- Nah, nah.

234
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,952
I just wanna
clear this with you.

235
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,260
I... I think
I'm gonna take this one.

236
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,589
I can definitely make this work

237
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,164
with Julian's
Indiana Bones costume.

238
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,847
Luckily for me,
I have a miniature whip.

239
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,030
Not really sure who you are

240
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,467
or what that means, but, okay.

241
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,793
[Addison] Hey, uh,
we have any more paint?

242
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,688
- I ran out.
- No, absolutely not.

243
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,778
What?
It's from the movie.

244
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,040
Simon made me do it.

245
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,258
[Hayes] Take it off!

246
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,871
- [Santa] What the hell?
- What kinda theater is this?

247
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,685
[Addison] Shut up, assholes,
we're closed.

248
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,312
Thank God you stopped him
before he got to the ER.

249
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,097
[gentle electronic music]

250
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:18,012
Well, you've ruined Halloween.
I hope you're happy.

251
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,755
Yeah, possibly saved your life.

252
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,515
Yet I can see
you have no problem with her

253
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,193
dressed as a prostitute.

254
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,997
By the way, should all
three of us really be up here?

255
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,607
I mean, there's gotta be
some kind of weight limit.

256
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,351
How many Nachos Libre
is that for you today?

257
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,288
[laughs] Yeah, okay,
fat John McClane.

258
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,073
You want some help off the roof?

259
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,292
All right, guys, guys, guys.
Hey, beer, all right?

260
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,502
Let's try
not to kill each other tonight.

261
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,296
[Addison] I can't promise that.

262
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,081
Especially not
on All Hallows Eve.

263
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,345
God, you're just a lot
of big talk and a stupid badge.

264
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,173
Guys. A toast.

265
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:48,697
To Halloween
and all it comes with.

266
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,067
[Addison] What the fuck
does that mean?

267
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,702
[Hayes] I don't know,
just cheers.

- Why would you hope so?

if she's not dead,

neither one of us are doing a
very good job of reviving her.

281

And what's up with that
AIDS on the mirror thing?

00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,785
What? Oh, don't worry.
That's just lipstick.

283
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,920
I don't think you can put
actual AIDS on a mirror.

284
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,137
Is this fucking funny to you?

285
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,680
Oh, I mean, bud,
you know, like anything,

286
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:40,704
there are funny parts.

287
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,098
What did you do?

288
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:43,534
What do you mean, what did I do?

How could I
make this more clear?

290
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,513
Whenever something bad
goes in my life,

291
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:47,857
I can usually
pinpoint the source.

292
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,106
So, I ask you again,
what did you do?

293
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,862
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

294
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,563
My God, I mean,
do we even know if she's dead?

295
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,761
- Did you check her pulse?
- You wanna go make sure?

296
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,900
Wait, what do you mean, check?

297
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,529
"Make sure" kind of implies
that if she's not dead,

298
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:03,593
we'll be finishing the job.

Only thing I did was wake up
about an hour before you

301
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,647
into a horrifying situation.

302
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,476
And as unbelievable
as it may seem,

303
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,001
I assure you,
things can get worse.

304
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,003
So let's focus
on what I'm gonna do.

Which is my best,

306
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,589
to make sure
that doesn't happen!

Honestly,
it's none of your business.

I can't ask
if you got a haircut?

315

I just don't know why
one guy would ask another guy

if he got a haircut,
I mean, who cares?

317
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,864
Honestly, it's a little gay.

318
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,083
It's gay?

319
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,521
It's gay
if I ask if you got a haircut?

320
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,543
[Addison] I don't think
it's very straight.

I mean, come on,
back me up here.

it's a little gay?

you know how stupid that is?

The drunk people aren't
even supposed to be here.

there's a line at the drive in,

they know the owner.

I do know the owner.

He's the moron behind
this asinine plastic plan.

to what you're gonna do

in regards to party planning.

352
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,675
So we're gonna get a nice
layer of slippery moisture

353
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,721
going on here
from their filthy pussies.

354
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:09,028
It's gonna be
like a slip 'n slide.

355
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,812
No, I haven't thought about it.

356
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,815
Ooh! Smooth [indistinct]
lay down all this plastic,

357
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,817
I sure hope
his pants have a Velcro fly,

358
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,795
'cause I can't get his penis
in my mouth fast enough.

359
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,038
[glass breaking]

360
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,735
Motherfucker!

361
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:23,955
Was that expensive?

362
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,611
No, it's just a...
Just a family heirloom.

363
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,570
Maybe my grandfather
got it in the war.

364
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,486
Oh, well, he's dead,
so he has no say.

365
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,879
I mean, chances are
he didn't want his fancy house

366
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,751
to go to his Nancy
of a grandkid either.

367
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,275
You know,
take solace in the fact

368
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,529
that it's just some bullshit
he stole off a Chinaman.

369
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,410
Pretty sure
there weren't any Chinamen.

370
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,020
[Addison] Well, you know,

371
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,034
they all look the same
at the end of a bayonet.

372
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,114
[Hayes] Listen.

373
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,378
- About tonight...
- [Addison] Is she blonde?

374
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:57,946
[Hayes] What?

375
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,904
Is her hair blonde in color?

376
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:04,431
[Hayes chuckles] Uh, yeah.
How'd you know that?

377
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,323
[Addison] Well,
it's typically your pattern.

378
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,000
Brunette, redhead, blonde.

379
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,370
You've hid this chick
away for a while,

380
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:12,743
but now the drive-in's open,

381
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,591
you have no choice
but to bring her around.

382
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,530
So, you know,
this is where you say to me,

383
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,314
"I really,
really like this girl.

384
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,143
Can you do your best
to please not scare her away?"

385
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,537
To which I answer,
"Of course, buddy!

386
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,060
Whatever it is you need."

387
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,757
In fact, you know,
I better start doing

388
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,851
some more drinking
as to soothe my savage tongue.

389
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,158
What's this?

390
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,682
That's called whiskey,
and it's for emergencies only.

391
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,211
Lemme ask you something?

392
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,737
You find that you jerk off more,

393
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,435
or less, now that
you're in a relationship?

394
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,153
And it was the haircut question
that was gay?

395
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,703
I'm just collecting
a little bit of data.

396
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,879
Well, oddly, I find

397
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,925
I jerk off more
in the relationship.

398
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,534
That's what I thought,
that checks out.

399
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:10,974
Six months.

400
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,186
This thing will not make it

401
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,413
to the next drive-in season.

402
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,825
- Guaranteed.
- My relationship?

403
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,024
Yeah, your relationship.

404
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,939
In fact,
I will even give you odds.

405
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,004
No, no, no, I'm not betting
against that, even with odds.

406
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,161
You know, I happen to find
that it's a good thing

407
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,771
that I jerk off more.

408
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,816
[snorts] Okay.
You know what? Five months.

409
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,862
[microwave beeping]

410
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,257
You know, this is... this is
a new level for me, all right?

411
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,478
I've never been to this stage.

412
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:38,177
You know,
as usual in the beginning,

413
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,179
you know, I'll use anything.

414
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,833
But then when I get
to the climax I...

415
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,226
I use her as the fuel.

416
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,142
As some kinda courtesy to her?

417
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:49,275
Okay, come on,
you're making it sound gross,

418
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,928
but I think
that means something.

419
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,932
Well, I think
you should probably save

420
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,386
some of this stuff
for your vows.

421
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,935
[Hayes]
Wait... wait a minute.

422
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,720
And what do you mean,
"That checks out"?

423
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,591
You've been monitoring
my jerk off habits?

424
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:10,209
So, I suppose
I should be more like you.

425
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,820
Preying on the young.

426
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,474
Pitting my hopes and dreams

427
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,563
to jello shots and naiveté.

428
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,782
[Addison] Oh, I'm sorry.

429
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,741
Who should
I be preying on exactly?

430
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,264
Old women?

431
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,633
They're brutal beasts
that are fueled

432
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,136
by white wine and pilates.

433
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,877
You know
you're coming dangerously close

434
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,488
to the definition
of a woman hater.

435
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,620
I don't hate women.

436
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:31,839
Really?

437
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:33,884
So when we play Monopoly...

438
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,394
and you make them be the iron?

439
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,821
That's more
of a tradition thing?

440
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,477
The worst part about the stupid
abortion of a plastic plan

441
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,176
isn't even the putting down
of the plastic,

442
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,767
it's the picking it up
the next morning.

443
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,204
Oh, that's nice.

444
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,293
Seriously, do you have keys?

445
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,184
Picking up a beaten,
ripped shell of a corpse

446
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,384
that's left behind from a night
that's forever gone

447
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,473
and used to be full
of limitless possibilities.

448
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,527
Yeah, it's strange
you have such strong feelings

449
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,609
for a process that I've
never seen you participate in.

450
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,310
[eerie music]

451
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,986
You know, if you could
put actual AIDS on a mirror,

452
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,553
it'd probably would have
something to do with that

453
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,100
Bloody Mary lady.
Did you ever do that?

454
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,555
Say it three times
in the mirror?

455
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,843
Check her pulse.

456
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,673
Not like that.

457
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,067
Not like what?

458
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,351
You can't use your thumb,
you have a pulse in your thumb.

459
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:31,986
You do!

460
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,034
I don't know,
I don't feel anything.

461
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,253
You seem pretty confident.

462
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,039
Take a look at the confident
marks on her neck.

463
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:43,432
Somebody choked her.

464
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,129
I don't know if that killed her,

465
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,933
but her lack of enthusiasm
about the situation

466
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,917
makes me pretty fucking
confident that she's dead.

467
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,250
When did you get that coffee?

468
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,896
Does that make a difference?

469
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,138
Yeah, it does.

470
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,507
Did you get
yourself a cup of coffee

471
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,793
and then find the body,

472
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,404
or did you realize she was dead

473
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,120
and then decided
to make yourself a cup of Joe?

474
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,668
- Who care...
- [coffee spilling]

475
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:07,674
She's definitely dead.

476
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,127
I think you need to focus on
some bigger picture questions.

477
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,463
[Hayes] Like who killed her?

478
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:17,031
Nope.
In fact, we just know dead.

479
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,554
We don't know kill.

480
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:21,035
What, like she died
of natural causes?

481
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,578
Like someone choked her,
and she couldn't breathe,

482
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,038
so she naturally died?

483
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,257
I'm saying, I don't know.
She's in a tub.

484
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,792
How do people
usually die in a tub?

485
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,086
They drown.

486
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,090
[clock ticking]

487
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,618
[exhaling loudly]

488
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,740
That might have been
a new record for ya.

489
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,623
Now, hypothetical question.

490
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:44,972
Let's say I died there.

491
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,888
Do you try to save me yourself,
or do you go get help?

492
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,386
That's your answer
for everything.

493
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,374
[lighter flicking]

494
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,898
[eerie music]

495
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,350
[Hayes exhaling]

496
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,744
You ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

497
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,007
You're already
taking off your costume.

498
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,052
Yeah, I mean, uh, funny story.

499
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,576
There was this accident.

500
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,926
Took me five hours alone
to make that wig.

501
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,755
Well, it's flammable,
in case you were wondering.

502
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,498
You know, you have nice feet.

503
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:34,238
Many don't.

504
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,652
I think it's the shoes
that fuck you guys carrying

505
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:37,807
those puppies in there.

506
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,047
It's funny, the wearing of
shoes can fuck your feet,

507
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,231
but then the not wearing shoes

508
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,509
can equally fuck your feet.

509
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,555
I like to hit a nice 50/50

510
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,427
sneaker/flip flop split myself.

511
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,518
What I'm getting at is that, um,

512
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,476
I would like to suck your toes.

513
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,349
Listen,
if you wanna take the courses,

514
00:23:58,524 --> 00:23:59,873
take the courses.

515
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,831
If you don't, then don't.

516
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,921
I just want you to be happy.

517
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,880
And what would make me happy

518
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:09,709
is you making
one fucking decision.

519
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,973
[Hayes, sarcastically]
Oh, my God. You're so selfless.

520
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,279
You just want me to be happy.

521
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,282
Actually, it's selfish
'cause you're never happy,

522
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,589
and I'd just like
to have something different.

523
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,330
The best-selling album

524
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,593
from 1996

701
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,703
You have anything
to drink last night?

702
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,749
[upbeat percussive music]

703
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,538
Sounds like
you had more than a couple.

704
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,627
A real booze hound.

705
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:17,196
Oh, is that true?
You a booze hound?

706
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,372
Did you have
anything to drink today,

707
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,113
Mr. Booze Hound?

708
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,640
What we're dealing with here
is a young white girl.

709
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,903
So rest assured
the police will come,

710
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:30,731
they will
have questions, but, uh,

711
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,733
with each other
as alibis and pretty soon

712
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:35,214
with a little
elbow grease, no body,

713
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,216
I think we can get past this.

714
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,697
So, did you murder
the girl in the tub?

715
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:42,743
- Nope.
- Whoo, he's good.

716
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,006
So you're a funny guy.

717
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,877
You think this is a big joke?

718
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,923
Well this
ain't no joke, brother.

719
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:52,013
A skeleton walks into a bar,
orders a beer and a mop.

720
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,710
That is a joke.

721
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,976
You know, we had a funny guy
like you down on the force.

722
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,282
You wanna know
what happened to him?

723
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,589
If I had to guess,
I imagine he was

724
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,156
well-liked by his coworkers,

725
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,027
excelled at his job
and got promoted...

726
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,595
No! No, no, no, no!

727
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,205
No, that's not what happened!

728
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:14,079
You know, we got your buddy
in the other room.

729
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,038
He's telling us another story.

730
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,084
Maybe I'll go
ask him a few questions.

731
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,007
We have one story
and we stick to it.

732
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:30,821
You can't tell 'em
anything we don't know.

733
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,227
Something happened.

734
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:33,721
We're talking
about an environment

735
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:35,157
where there's
a known sex offender

736
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:36,840
walking around
dressed as a clown.

737
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,104
[gun fires]

738
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,280
- Well, we shot your buddy.
- Shot him dead.

739
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,022
- [Addison] Really?
- You don't think so?

740
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,545
I didn't like his answers.

741
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,231
What do you think about that?

742
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,201
Well, I think the whole thing

743
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,015
sounds like
a shocking abuse of authority.

744
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,333
All right, all right,
all right, I have a question.

745
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,121
Considering we're
dealing with a murderer,

746
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:58,558
you certainly
don't seem to be very alarmed.

747
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:01,039
I mean,
theoretically, there's still

748
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:02,910
a killer out there
lurking about, correct?

749
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,444
Well,
I can't speak to his lurking,

750
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,827
but unless you think our killer

751
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:09,569
is the hockey mask-wearing
machete-wielding variety,

752
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:11,962
and he's just biding
his time 'til you and I

753
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,269
carelessly go
butt fuck by the lake,

754
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,619
why would the killer
return to the scene of a crime?

755
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,057
To cover his tracks.

756
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,146
Gosh.

757
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,150
I can't say I like
what you're implying there.

758
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,762
So let's look at
a couple facts, shall we?

759
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:33,506
We have a girl.

760
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:36,291
Your girl.

761
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,511
Currently deceased.

762
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,383
Got a party full of people,

763
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,559
watched you argue,
as they often do.

764
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,736
We got drugs, we got booze,

765
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,174
and the only thing we know
for sure about this girl?

766
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,524
She currently resides in a tub.

767
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:52,742
Whose tub?

768
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,961
Your tub.

769
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,921
Now, given those facts,
who would you think did it?

770
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,185
Oh, and of course, the, uh,

771
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,144
most damning piece of evidence.

772
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,322
- The vampire.
- The vampire.

773
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,936
The vampire was what
I was gonna say.

774
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:16,592
[clock ticking]

775
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,005
[partygoer] You ever
danced with the devil

776
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,335
in the pale moonlight?

777
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:22,294
What?

778
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:24,774
Sorry.

779
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,125
I said,
you ever danced with the devil

780
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,343
in the pale moonlight?

781
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,650
Don't worry,
I say that to all my prey.

782
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,609
Yeah, I know about that.

783
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,136
[clock ticking]

784
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,053
Wow. You can drink a lot.

785
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,534
Yeah. I can.

786
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,152
So this whole house is yours?

787
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,807
Yeah. It is.

788
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,069
Hmm.

789
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,160
[drink pouring]

790
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,123
[coughing]

791
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,733
[Vampire] Oh, careful.

792
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,258
Oh, you're... you're freezing.

793
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,220
You, uh...

794
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,266
You wanna come inside?

795
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,139
Yeah, let's go inside.

796
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,361
Ah, but you're right.

797
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,058
Murder and cheating
rarely intersected,

798
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,775
- you should be fine.
- Oh, no, I... I didn't cheat.

799
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,105
I... I mean, I don't think I...

800
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,325
What? Came?

801
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:40,110
Ugh, now you're
making it disgusting, pervert.

802
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,828
I'm guessing a few people,
well, your girlfriend,

803
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,506
dead one,
included, may not share

804
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,291
your liberal view of infidelity.

805
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:48,162
It's called emotional cheating,

806
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:49,990
and it happens
to a lot of people.

807
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,774
Leave it at home, Tom.

808
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,108
Oh, I almost forgot one thing,
show him the tablecloth.

809
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,565
Whose blood you suppose that is?

810
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,830
I... I don't know.

811
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,932
So we should probably
get rid of that too, huh?

812
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,750
If you're being 100% honest,

813
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,186
can you say that you remember

814
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,275
everything that
happened last night?

815
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,451
He eats cats.

816
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:21,195
[clock ticking]

817
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,458
Okay, I now realize
trying to explain ALF

818
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,155
to someone who hasn't seen ALF

819
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,332
kinda makes me
sound like a lunatic.

820
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:30,248
I mean, how you know
who Michael Keaton's Batman is

821
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,945
but you haven't heard of ALF?

822
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,687
Wait, okay, Michael Keaton
is Pennsylvania pride.

823
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,516
I actually saw him
in a Long John Silver's once.

824
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,996
He was totally cool.

825
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,477
I still feel like he comes up
in pop culture like,

826
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,218
he's bowled a 286.

827
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:46,002
I mean, ALF,

828
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,440
he was this third man
in Three Men and a Baby.

829
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,964
Wait, you saying his name
over and over again

830
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,661
does not make me
know this person.

831
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:54,707
All right.

832
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,441
Okay, is something
wrong with your dick?

833
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,406
'Cause... Yep, that should help.

834
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:00,626
I mean...

835
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,237
I mean, he's not like, uh,

836
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,413
it's like a... like a puppet.

837
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,328
It's like a... it's like a man

838
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,983
and like his little...
Little man.

839
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,942
Like little brown puppet man
[indistinct].

840
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,249
[laughs]
[indistinct]

841
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:17,164
Right.
I should have known.

842
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,470
There were signs.

843
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:20,994
I'm not blowing a retard.

844
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,301
I am not my mom.

845
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,585
[Officer Shane]
So you admit it.

846
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:26,956
Admit what?

847
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,450
That you were
with the other girl.

848
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,612
That's what
we're talking about, right?

849
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:33,093
How would he know that?
How would anyone know that?

850
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,661
[urine splashing]

851
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:40,883
[clock ticking]

852
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:44,322
[party music playing inside]

853
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,029
This isn't gonna work.

854
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,207
What, are you too busy

855
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,078
thinking about
your fucking friend, Ralph?

856
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,516
[Hayes snoring]

857
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,692
Oh, for fuck's sake.

858
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,998
Ugh.

859
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,746
You know,
a finger or two up the old anus

860
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,531
oftentimes gets
the ball rolling.

861
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,620
Read into that what you will.

862
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,600
[Officer Shane] I got a hobby.
You want to know what it is?

863
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,800
- He likes trains.
- That's right, I like trains.

864
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,106
And I built this town
for the trains to roll through,

865
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,457
little place I like to call
Timberlake Falls.

866
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:34,110
It's lovely!

867
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,939
And the only thing
I love more than the train

868
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,289
and the good, hardworking
people of Timberlake Falls...

869
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,509
I thought it was more like
a retirement community

870
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:43,206
- slash fishing village kinda...
- No!

871
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,513
There's restaurants, shops.

872
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:46,688
There's a post office.

873
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:47,907
People work there.

874
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,125
The point is,

875
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,867
I got a brand new hobby,

876
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,740
and that hobby is
sticking you in a dark hole

877
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:56,481
where the next light you see

878
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,700
will be the flames
burning your flesh

879
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,093
in eternal damnation!

880
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,355
[banging thud]

881
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,609
[Addison] And that's why...

882
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:05,837
we cut.

883
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:07,100
Look at it this way.

884
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:08,928
We're just doing the cutting.

885
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,191
It's the difference between
stealing someone's wallet

886
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,165
versus finding a wallet
and keeping the money.

887
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,064
This feels worse.

888
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,936
[sighs]

889
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,630
I can understand
how you're conflicted.

890
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,114
I wasn't as fond of her myself.

891
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,910
But when we get through this,
and I promise you,

892
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:27,425
we will get through this,

893
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,689
I guarantee you
I will make every effort to...

894
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:32,604
[thudding, Hayes screaming]

895
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:33,822
What the fuck!

896
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,129
I did that for you.

897
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,394
That right there
is the point of no return.

898
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:43,441
Whenever someone's gonna
find this body and say,

899
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,695
"Hey, why are there three
fucking chop marks in it?",

900
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,116
you're gonna
know the answer to that

901
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,576
'cause you saw me do it.

902
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,665
We don't have time to grieve.

903
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:52,580
We're burning daylight.

904
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,778
Can you do me a favor and get
her purse and her phone?

905
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,162
They're gonna
have to come with us.

906
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,111
Hey!
Her purse and her phone.

907
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,766
Can you get them for me?
Please and thank you.

Are these
your clothes in the dryer?

916
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,160
'Cause they've been
in here for a while,

917
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:32,925
and I'm about
to throw 'em on the ground.

918
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,339
Uh, I'm not doing laundry,
and those are women's clothes.

Okay, well, they could be
your girlfriend's clothes

920

or some other weird reason.

921
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,109
You're sitting in a laundromat,
not doing laundry.

922
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:45,154
I don't have a girlfriend.
How about you?

923
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,243
Nope, never had a girlfriend.

924
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:50,464
Kissed a few girls before,
but nothing ever stuck.

925
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,335
No, I meant, how about you?

926
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,685
You wanna be my girlfriend?

927
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:54,860
No, thanks.

928
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:57,638
I don't think
I've seen you here before.

929
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:58,733
You live around here?

930
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,107
You don't think you've seen me

931
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,388
in the laundromat before?

932
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,650
Yeah.

933
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:07,002
Well, the washing machine
I usually use is broken,

934
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:08,700
so I came here.

935
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:11,287
But somebody
definitely knows where I am,

936
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:12,591
if that's
what you're getting at.

937
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,510
What are you, the sheriff
of the laundromat or something?

938
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:20,233
No. I mean, I ran
for sheriff of the laundromat,

939
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,279
but I lost an election
that was clearly rigged.

940
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,013
You probably wanna
hear the whole story.

941
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:27,153
No, I'm actually
really sorry I asked,

942
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:28,676
that sounds boring.

943
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:32,158
I can assure you, laundromat
politics are anything but.

944
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,814
If you must know,
I'm waiting for someone.

945
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:37,946
I bet.

946
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,382
What happens when you find them?

947
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,123
Does it start
with R and end with ape?

948
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:44,562
No, I'm searching for justice.

949
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:45,974
You probably wanna
hear the whole story.

950
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:47,303
Nope.

951
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:48,877
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

952
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,221
It all started six months ago.

953
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,875
I was doing
some thrift store shopping.

954
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,362
Nothing really
blowing my hair back.

955
00:42:58,271 --> 00:43:00,839
But then, out of the corner
of my eye, I see it.

956
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:04,756
Baby blue,
right size, perfect color.

957
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,453
You know, I'd been hurt before.

958
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,847
Thought I'd found
the perfect shirt

959
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:11,284
only to have it fit too tight

960
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,895
or have a hole in the armpit
or a bleach stain.

961
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,462
It fit like a glove.

962
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,159
Something happened that day.

963
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,031
The sun was a little brighter.

964
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:20,554
Food tasted a little better,

965
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,687
and it would stay that way
until...

966
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:23,992
that day.

967
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,691
What happened?

968
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:28,705
It happened right here
in this very laundromat.

969
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,137
I remember it
like it was yesterday,

970
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:32,522
and even remember the date.

971
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:34,046
September 11th.

972
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:37,223
Baby Blue went missing.

973
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,660
Stolen?

974
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:42,074
Well, I mean, clothing doesn't
just get up and walk away.

975
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:44,317
I hear some boots
are made for walkin'.

976
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,971
Okay, I get jokes.

977
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:48,626
See, ugh, I tried
to remember the last place

978
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,715
that I had laundered it.

979
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:53,805
Then I remembered
the laundromat.

980
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:56,503
A hornet's nest had
driven me from my own washer.

981
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,940
Was there anyone else
in the laundromat?

982
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,986
Then I remembered the cowboy.

983
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,294
I called him the cowboy
because, well,

984
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:07,035
he wore a cowboy hat,

985
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:09,089
and 'cause of the immortal
words he spoke to me.

986
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,257
[Hayes] Howdy.

987
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,129
So you're going to wait
down here all day

988
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:15,583
on the off chance
that the cowboy

989
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,437
decides to do laundry?

990
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,961
And an even slimmer chance,
that he stole your shirt?

991
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,267
Oh, he stole it, all right.

992
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,964
He's sick.

993
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,507
And I've been
monitoring his laundry habits.

994
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:26,359
Tuesdays seem
to be a sweet spot.

995
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,317
And how long
do you plan on waiting here?

996
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:29,797
As long as it takes.

997
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:31,581
And you don't find that boring?

998
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:35,194
Well, I mean, I work nights
and, uh, whiskey helps.

999
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,456
[Corpse laughs]

1000
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,981
Have you actually ever seen
the cowboy wear your shirt?

1001
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:42,505
Oh, no, no, no.
He's way too smart for that.

1002
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,029
He wasn't counting on one thing.

1003
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,727
Your delusions
and flexible schedule?

1004
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,207
- Exactly.
- Okay.

1005
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,992
So, I see him
in here the other day

1006
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,342
and I set the trap.

1007
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:56,128
"Howdy." he says,
like a fucking idiot.

1008
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:57,564
Say, "I'm moving to Delaware."

1009
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:00,567
[bell dings]

1010
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:02,581
"So you won't be
seeing me around here no more.

1011
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,572
Not in this town, and certainly
not in this laundromat."

1012
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,270
It's gonna be great.

1013
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:09,964
The cowboy is
going to mosey on in here

1014
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:11,230
without a care in the world.

1015
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,276
And then he'll see me,

1016
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,090
"Ah, ah, I thought you moved
to Delaware?"

1017
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,281
Nope, asshole,
just doing some laundry.

1018
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,892
[coins clinking]

1019
00:45:21,066 --> 00:45:22,894
- Need to borrow some quarters?
- [laughs]

1020
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:24,460
Then I got him.

1021
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,028
So why'd you actually
pack a suitcase

1022
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,074
full of clothes
and bring it to the laundromat?

1023
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:32,249
For weight. Why are you trying
to ruin this for me?

1024
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:35,123
I'm just saying, there's
probably easier ways to do it.

1025
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:37,735
I could seduce him,

1026
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:39,606
spend the night,

1027
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,651
steal the shirt
the next morning.

1028
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,274
You'd be willing
to do that for me?

1029
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,309
Maybe. I guess
I'd have to see the shirt.

1030
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:50,617
Oh, and by the way, back there,

1031
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,595
you were just like,
"Hey, maybe these are

1032
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,055
your girlfriend's clothes."

1033
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,797
Very subtle way
of finding out if I'm single.

1034
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,407
I think we've established

1035
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,540
that it's probably gonna
stay that way for you.

1036
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,237
Oh, yet here you are.

1037
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:04,251
Waiting with me
in the laundromat, interesting.

1038
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:05,850
I'm doing laundry!

1039
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,678
And I guess
it would be kind of cool

1040
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,898
to see the cowboy
punch you in the throat.

1041
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:12,378
He sounds kinda hot.

1042
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:14,772
What's your name?

1043
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:17,829
You struck me
as the kind of fellow

1044
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:20,038
that likes to be
in control of a situation.

1045
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:24,129
[clock ticking]

1046
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,262
But what I found about
most men's sexual desires,

1047
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:28,873
is it's the opposite
of the image

1048
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,091
they like to portray.

1049
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:36,054
- [Hayes grunting in pain]
- [giggling]

1050
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:38,143
Dominate might be

Uh, because $15 an hour

[friend] The whole thing
about liking your job

that actually love their job?

that he wouldn't like your job.

1331
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,783

it's me that makes

1333
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:13,071

my life was miserable.

your life is miserable.

the normal amount, all right?

that most electricians

a bit of a torch for me.

I need to talk to you.

Just wanna ask you
a couple of questions

01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:02,093
about a party
you had here last night.

1383
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,531
Don't say anything
and he'll go away.

We need to know who that is.

It's probably just
some idiot customer.

Then you answer it.

I would, but it really looks
like it's my time of the month.

01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:44,396
All formal complaints
must be lodged down

1394
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,200
at the drive-in during
regular business hours.

1395
01:01:46,224 --> 01:01:47,486
You said it one million times,

1396
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,060
I just need
you to say it right now.

1397
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,445
But what if it's not nobody?

1398
01:01:51,882 --> 01:01:53,535
Well, we need to know that, too.

1399
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:57,844
[Clyde] Mr. Hayes?

1400
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,846
Yeah, I'm the manager
of the drive-in.

1401
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,196
Great. Are you the owner
of this house?

1402
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,287
Yeah. It's, uh...
It's a private residence.

1403
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:07,898
And you're Mr. Hayes?

1404
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:10,727
Yeah.
How do you know that?

1405
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:12,946
It's right down there
in the mailbox.

1406
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,948
Oh, yeah, right.

1407
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:16,820
So, would you be the person

1408
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:19,213
who was hosting a party
here last night?

1409
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:20,693
A Halloween party?

1410
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,522
Uh, yeah, I mean,
at the drive-in.

1411
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:24,958
We're closing for the season,

1412
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:26,568
so we had a...
A small staff party.

1413
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:29,963
But it was a Halloween party?
People in costume?

1414
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:33,967
Yeah. I dressed up too.
Uh, do you dress up?

1415
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,622
Never really celebrated
the day, Mr. Hayes.

1416
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:38,885
Do you live here alone?

1417
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:40,887
[Hayes] Yep.

1418
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,194
I thought I heard
another person in there.

1419
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:45,718
[Hayes] Nope.

1420
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:48,068
Are you okay, Mr. Hayes?
You seem anxious.

1421
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:49,591
Is there something wrong?

1422
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,551
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
Just a little hungover.

1423
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:54,858
Makes sense.

1424
01:02:55,032 --> 01:02:56,832
Probably had something to do
with the alcohol.

1425
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,515
I don't know
if I look familiar to you.

1426
01:03:00,689 --> 01:03:03,301
Don't worry, I'm not here
in any official capacity.

1427
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:05,477
If I was,
I'd come out with a partner.

1428
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:06,739
It's procedure.

1429
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,610
I'm just hoping you can help me.

1430
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,089
With what?

1431
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:11,918
I'm looking for a girl.

1432
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:14,921
[dramatic echo]

1433
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,448
- What?
- She was here,

1434
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:22,102
she was at the party.

1435
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:25,279
Is she missing?

1436
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:28,326
Yep, and that has me
very worried.

1437
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:31,808
I wanted to get here sooner,
but there were some issues.

1438
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,029
I think there's a fair chance
she may be here in this house.

1439
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,292
No, like I told you,
I'm here by myself.

1440
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,729
Mr. Hayes,
this is all I need.

1441
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,317
I just need to come in and ask
you a few very basic questions.

1442
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,778
You answer honestly,
and I'm fairly certain

1443
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:47,912
I can determine whether
she's in the house or not.

1444
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:51,044
I'm not here to bother you,
I'm here to help.

1445
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:52,959
But time is a factor.

1446
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:57,137
Mr. Hayes, did you have
some sort of accident today?

1447
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:58,791
- What?
- Your shirt,

1448
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:00,227
it has something on it.

1449
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:03,927
- Did you cut yourself?
- Oh, no, that's, uh...

1450
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,626
barbecue sauce
from smoking ribs out back.

1451
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,976
Really?

1452
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,849
- Hangover cure?
- Yeah, it's a, uh,

1453
01:04:13,632 --> 01:04:14,807
consuming endeavor.

1454
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:16,374
- Hmm, I bet.
- Mm-hmm.

1455
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:18,637
You know I do love ribs...

1456
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:21,379
but they are some messy
suckers, ain't they?

1457
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,424
You know... [sniffing]

1458
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:24,817
I think
I can smell 'em.

1459
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,255
Mm. [smacking lips]

1460
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,648
Tastes okay to me.

1461
01:04:30,997 --> 01:04:31,998
Sweet.

1462
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:36,829
So, Mr. Hayes,
are you gonna let me in?

1463
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:40,006
What'd you say your name was?

1464
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,052
Clyde.

1465
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:46,186
Yeah, I'm, uh... Mr. Clyde,
I'm really busy,

1466
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,251
but, you know, if you wanna
leave your name and number,

1467
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:49,711
- I'll be sure...
- Unfortunately,

1468
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,626
the situation at hand
has the potential

1469
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,193
to be fairly severe.

1470
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:55,152
So I'm gonna have to
adjust accordingly

1471
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:57,110
as to the next thing I do.

1472
01:04:57,284 --> 01:04:59,721
Mr. Hayes, I have to
get into the house,

1473
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,506
but I wanna be 100% clear,

1474
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,986
I mean you no harm.

1475
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,770
But if you stand in my way,

1476
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:07,642
I will have to overpower you
for the greater good.

1477
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:09,427
- You're gonna attack me?
- I've done it.

1478
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,603
If you would prefer
to restrain yourself

1479
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:12,996
while I look around the house,

1480
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,610
I am more than happy
with that route.

1481
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:16,608
But now, as I say,
we are short on time,

1482
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:19,108
so I'm only gonna be able to go
with the standard three count.

1483
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,481
- One...
- What... just give me...

1484
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:22,701
You got two more.
Two. Two and a half.

1485
01:05:23,267 --> 01:05:25,834
- [electronic music]
- [moaning softly]

1486
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,277
[moaning softly]

1487
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,368
Are your eyes closed?

1488
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,631
Are they not supposed to be?

1489
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,131
Well, typically,
when your eyes are closed,

1490
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:43,591
you're thinking
about somebody else.

1491
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,830
So I'm supposed
to look at you the whole time?

1492
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:47,310
'Cause, I mean,
I can't really see your face,

1493
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,988
so I can't be
100% sure it's you.

1494
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:51,053
I'm not saying you need
to stare at me the whole time,

1495
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:52,620
I'm just talking about
being in the moment.

1496
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:55,516
All right, well,
I'll just stare at the ceiling

1497
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,127
with my eyes wide open.

1498
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,824
Like a maniac.

1499
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:04,525
[clears throat]

1500
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,310
- [Corpse] What the fuck?
- Bro.

1501
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:08,044
[Corpse] What the fuck,
get out of here!

1502
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:09,878
- You guys want me to leave?
- [Corpse] God.

1503
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:16,711
Why does she have more
than one pair of shoes here?

1504
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:18,800
- What is she, living here now?
- Get out.

1505
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,909
Don't you come at me
with an erection, number one.

1506
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:22,108
You know, this is your fault.

1507
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:23,805
You guys
were supposed to pick me up.

1508
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,900
Took me an hour to walk
here from the beer store.

1509
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,766
[scoffs] Took you
an hour to walk a mile?

1510
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,463
That's certainly not the point.

1511
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:31,224
Take a look at the sun, guys,
it's almost dusk.

1512
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:32,488
You guys are fucking killing me.

1513
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,469
All right, listen,
I'm not going.

1514
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:38,907
Well, that's stupid.

1515
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,711
She scored tickets,
we're driving to Philly.

1516
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,041
Tickets to what?
The gay show?

1517
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:43,584
All right, you know what,
I told you

1518
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:45,001
we should've
done this in the car.

1519
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:46,500
You're the one that
wanted to come home

1520
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,265
- and change your shirt.
- Are you crazy?

1521
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:49,912
A Frighteners,
Dead Alivedouble feature,

1522
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:52,356
that comes along once,
maybe twice in a lifetime.

1523
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,314
[Corpse] Your next blowjob
is so far away

1524
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:55,924
from this moment right now.

1525
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,665
Well, you know what,
the good news is

1526
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,513
I don't need you fucking fools.
Just your car keys.

1527
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:01,080
[Hayes] I don't have my car,
we're taking hers.

1528
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,496
- Is that my shirt?
- [banging]

1529
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,150
[Addison] That's just great.

1530
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:06,109
You know what?
You don't need a fucking car.

1531
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:07,545
Well, it's a drive-in,

1532
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:09,155
so it's fairly
fucking important...

1533
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:10,741
- Yeah, you know what?
- What are you doing?

1534
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,985
Well, I want you to leave, so...

1535
01:07:13,942 --> 01:07:17,555
I was just sucking his dick
and I kissed you, so...

1536
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,809
I don't care
for what you did just there.

1537
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:26,868
Can I borrow your radio?

1538
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,392
[thud on door]

1539
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,046
That sounded like
another girl's shoe.

1540
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:33,745
[doorbell ringing]

1541
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:45,322
[Clyde] Oh, uh, Mr. Hayes?

1542
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:46,560
[Addison] No, he's upstairs
getting blown.

1543
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:47,889
Can I help you guys?

1544
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,504
What are you,
a couple of... ah, shit.

1545
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,371
My name is Clyde
and this is Ethan.

1546
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:52,945
Super, guys, look,
I'd love to chat,

1547
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,309
but I'm on my way to the movies.

1548
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:55,569
- Movies?
- Yeah. Forget about it.

1549
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,073
It's a recent development.

1550
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:58,876
But please come inside
and, uh, I sure as hell

1551
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,700
hope you have some
literature to leave for me.

1552
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,165
[doorbell rings]

1553
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:03,601
Two and a half!

1554
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,280
Does anyone ever take the option

1555
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:10,651
to restrain themselves?

1556
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:12,088
[Clyde] You'd be surprised.

1557
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,526
Most people would do
a lot to avoid confrontation.

1558
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:17,745
Can... can I get you something?

1559
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:20,357
