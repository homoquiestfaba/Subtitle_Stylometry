One, two, Diablos!

185
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,586
Come on Diablos, let's go!

186
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,417
[upbeat music]
[crowd hollering]

187
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,988
[Cheerleaders] Diablos!

188
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,686
[crowd cheering]

189
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,563
Well, isn't this a pickle.

190
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,130
Principal Simmons,
I can explain.

191
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,567
Ms. Miller, you had one
rule and one rule only.

192
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,917
It's not our fault.

193
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,700
The Green Knights
were kicking our ass.

194
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:58,962
You broke by trust.

195
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,095
Reagan could have been
seriously injured.

196
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,705
Football players get
injured all the time.

197
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,360
Football players are
athletes, big difference.

198
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,709
Athletes train.

199
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:09,059
Athletes know how to
not injure themselves.

200
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,060
Cheerleaders don't.

201
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:12,933
If anyone should understand
anything about that,

202
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:15,370
I would think it
would be you Abby.

203
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:19,940
[upbeat music]

204
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,855
What?

205
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:25,728
Don't think I'm not aware
of your little plan.

206
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,776
Recruiting my daughter
into your club,

207
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,734
just to curry a favor for me.

208
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,736
Not at all, Paige, she...

209
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,085
I wasn't born yesterday.

210
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,785
For Paige's sake and
Paige's sake only,

211
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,917
I will not disband the
Diablo cheer squad,

212
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,527
but here's the deal.

213
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:45,922
There will be no jumping,
no lifts, no flips,

214
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,750
no whatever it is you people do.

215
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,621
One foot on the
ground at all times.

216
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:50,927
Do I make myself clear?

217
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:51,754
What about regionals?

218
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,755
They're in two weeks.

219
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,365
Principal Simmons, please.

220
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,541
There's already a no
stunt rule in place.

221
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,412
Our routine is...

222
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,196
Sucking!

223
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,199
Listen, just be grateful
I'm letting you compete.

224
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,724
But if there is so much
as a single somersault

225
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,638
on school property,

226
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,945
I will cancel the cheer
squad for the next 50 years.

227
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,429
I mean, did you see the
look on Simmons' face?

228
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,039
You mean this?

229
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,606
Yeah, do that long
enough it's gonna stick.

230
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,651
It's too late for her.

231
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,436
Anyway, it could
have been way worse.

232
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,699
She could have banned this
regionals all together.

233
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:28,008
You know, Simmons
is not gonna be

234
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,227
at the actual competition.

235
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,925
Yeah, so?

236
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,405
So she said no practicing
stunts on school property.

237
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,801
Wait, are you saying?

238
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,063
Oh, you sneaky B.

239
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,761
That cheerleader
choreographed his fire.

240
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,545
Now we just need somewhere
else to practice.

241
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,590
Yeah.

242
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:49,464
All right dill holes,
here's the cheer facts.

243
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,988
This school gives zero
shits about our squad,

244
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,077
but that's gonna end now.

245
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,905
Wait, we're still
going to regionals?

246
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,646
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

247
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,867
There's there's no time
to nail our rogue routine.

248
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,130
Look, team, this
isn't gonna be easy.

249
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:04,609
We don't have any funding

250
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:05,915
and we barely have enough
people to make a full squad,

251
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,613
but that's not what
cheer is about.

252
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:09,919
We're more than
just a social club.

253
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,138
We're athletes.

254
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,443
We've got stunts.

255
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,967
We've got moves
and we've got style

256
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,491
and we are gonna show them
that we're the real deal.

257
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,320
And I'm pretty sure
nobody's gonna say anything.

258
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,060
Right, Paige?

259
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,063
Good.

260
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,586
We just need to practice
away from the school,

261
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,414
and I'm not talking
just practice.

262
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,547
We need a 24 hour cram
sesh this weekend.

263
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:32,637
Oh, but this
weekend is Halloween

264
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,291
and I have a dope
costume picked out.

265
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,597
Tori, it's okay.

266
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,903
You can be a slutty
Jigsaw next year.

267
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,645
Okay guys, this weekend we eat,

268
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,039
breathe and sleep
Diablo cheer leading.

269
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,258
Okay, but where?

270
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:45,868
I know, my house is big.

271
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,175
And bonus, we have
two hot tubs now.

272
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,743
Sharing with my brother was
so gross, like ass soup gross.

273
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,702
Okay, but mcmansion
isn't big enough

274
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:54,964
for us to go full out.

275
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,314
Our baskets need
20 feet at least.

276
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,881
Wait, what?

277
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,752
I'm going up 20 feet?

278
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,450
What about the
old abandoned school

279
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,973
on the other side of town?

280
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:05,801
You mean the old
Elk Moore High School?

281
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,455
Yeah, where our
high school used to be

282
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,891
before they built this one.

283
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,980
It had lead pipes or something.

284
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,764
They closed it
because of the pestos.

285
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,158
I think you mean asbestos.

286
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,814
The school board
uses it for storage.

287
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,555
I think I can get the key.

288
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,035
Seriously?

289
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,950
Way to impress, new.

290
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,908
Okay wait, so how are
we going to get there?

291
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,824
Oh, my dad owns a bus company.
I'll see if I can get us a bus.

292
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,521
Really?

293
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,958
He's cheating on my mom
with my sister's nanny.

294
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,873
He'll do anything I want,
as long as I don't tell.

295
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,699
It's pretty sweet.

296
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,355
All right, we have a plan.

297
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,882
Bring your sleeping bags
and plenty of food and water.

298
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,057
We'll make a small
party out of it.

299
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,362
Yeah, but we're gonna go hard.

300
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:47,364
It's gonna be 24 hours
of straight cheer.

301
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:50,106

it, we won't win it.

the game the other night.

he looks at you

of me just to say that?
