1
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,790
- You gotta get
this fuckin' role.

2
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,623
You're gonna book this.

3
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,665
You're gonna book this one.

4
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,165
You're gonna book this one,

5
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:37,873
you're gonna pull
yourself out of

6
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,540
this fuckin' situation, okay?

7
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,125
I know this is my last chance.

8
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,206
I won't let you down.

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,748
You gotta let me play,
coach. You gotta.

10
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,623
Fuck! I'm gonna fuck this up!

11
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,165
I'm a fuckin' loser!

12
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,500
- Hey.

13
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,373
You remember me?

14
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,873
- Yeah.

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,665
It was that party in the
Hills a few months ago,

16
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,331
in the hot tub.

17
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,208
- I hit you up a
few times after.

18
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:11,083
- Been busy.

19
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,831
- You got a boyfriend?

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,667
- Mm-hm.

21
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,165
- Do you remember my name?

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,581
- We were going at in
that hot tub all night.

23
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,500
I remember you, Ernesto.

24
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,417
- It's Anthony.

25
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,123
- Open that cash
register,now.

26
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,290
- I'm from Yemen.
I don't understand.

27
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:33,958
-Now!

28
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,123
- They
really like you.

29
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,040
They'll definitely
call you in again,

30
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,831
but they're gonna
go a little younger.

31
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,540
- Younger?

32
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,748
I'm 33 and everybody still
thinks I'm in my 20's.

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,748
- Bitch, you're 35.

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,623
I gotta take this
call, Danny. Bye.

35
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,125
- Goddammit!

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,456
He's some trick I fucked years
ago, before I even met you.

37
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,748
- And he's suddenly hitting
you up out of the blue?

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,665
- Eddy.
- Really?

39
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:54,790
- Hey.

40
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,290
- You expect me to believe that?

41
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,167
- Eddy, I would
never do you dirty.

42
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,415
Hey, come here, come here.
- Danny.

43
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,623
- You're the best thing

44
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,456
that has ever happened
to me, all right?

45
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,542
- Don't do this to me.
- Stop being stupid.

46
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,623
- Make me be able to trust you.

47
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,831
- You can trust me.

48
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,750
I love you.

49
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,873
- I can get you
thrown out for that.

50
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,290
- They comp my membership.

51
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,623
I'm the reason guys
join.

52
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,331
- Danny Maldonado.

53
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,498
Oh, it's so good
to see you again.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,456
You know, everyone's
still talking about

55
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,748
your arc as the
necrophiliac rapist in SVU.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,498
- Narcoleptic rapist.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,498
I loved, loved doing that.
It was a great experience.

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,581
- Oh, well, when was that?

59
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,706
- You're doing this shit again?

60
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,623
- Two, three years ago.

61
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,956
- Five years.

62
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,581
- Five, five years.

63
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,498
Five.

64
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,665
Once I book a good role, I'm
gonna turn everything around.

65
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,915
No, I promise.

66
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,790
Listen, just don't
give up on me, baby.

67
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,873
Oh, what about the "Green
Acres" reboot at Netflix?

68
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,706
They castin' Latinos for that?

69
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,873
- They're
going with Victor Rasuk.

70
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,456
- One other Dominican
in Hollywood

71
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,873
and he gets all
the fuckin' work.

72
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,540
- I have to go, Danny.

73
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,540
Gotta take this call.

74
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,873
Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,831
- All these
whiny fucking actors.

76
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,706
Like it's my fault
they can't get work.

77
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,331
I'm just a fucking agent.

78
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,373
- Um, Phyllis? You
didn't hang up.

79
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,706
I can hear you.

80
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,540
- Jesus Christ, Jane.

81
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,623
When you hear me say, "I
gotta take this call,"

82
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,998
that means you're supposed
to hang up for me.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,373
You're the worst
fucking assistant ever.

84
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,331
- So, so what have
you been up to?

85
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,623
- You know, keepin'
busy. Auditioning.

86
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,373
- Sorry.

87
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,998
- Fucking
useless millennials.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,290
You're all a fuckin' pox
on the face of this earth.

89
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,540
Geez!

90
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,540
- I said I was
sorry, Aunt Phyllis!

91
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:52,167
- Jesus.

92
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,915
- Things will pick up.

93
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,873
You've been down before
and you'll bounce back.

94
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,415
Auditions have
been so for me too.

95
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,706
It's a slow year, it is.

96
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,915
Avi and I are
having drama again.

97
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,665
Fuck, I gotta go.

98
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:05,873
It's my sister.

99
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,040
- Oh, okay.

100
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,415
Love you.
- Love you, too, Ilana.

101
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,415
- Danny, you
have to fly out here.

102
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,542
- It's not a good time.

103
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,415
- I'll
send you the money.

104
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,748
- I got a big gig
lined up and I can't.

105
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:25,915
I gotta take this call Sabrina.

106
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,415
It's my agent and it's
about the gig. Okay?

107
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,873
Bye.

108
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,956
- I'm in the pink blouse

109
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,373
right in front of Trader Joe's.

110
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,623
Where are you?

111
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,292
- I see you.

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,333
Claire?

113
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,456
- And Phyllis said to
tell you they really liked you.

114
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,456
They'll call you
in again real soon,

115
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,583
but they're going in
a different direction.

116
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,665
- What the fuck?

117
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,040
What the fuck?

118
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,792
Fuck!

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,333
Oh, fuck!

120
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,042
What the fuck am I gonna do?

121
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,831
What the fuck am I gonna do?

122
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,667
- Excuse me?

123
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,956
I love actors and I
just wanted to say,

124
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,083
I loved you in "Raising
Victor Vargas."

125
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,790
- That was Victor Rasuk.

126
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,165
Oh, god.

127
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,665
- Oh.

128
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,458
Sorry.

129
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:20,625
- Oh god.

130
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,915
- But that was you
on "SMILF," right?

131
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,456
- That was Miguel Gomez.

132
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,500
- Oh, sorry.

133
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,748
- Fuck.

134
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,581
Fuck!

135
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,125
What the fuck am I gonna do?

136
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,081
- "Scandal?"

137
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,417
- Guillermo fuckin' Diaz, lady!

138
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,581
- What is up brotha?
Long time no see.

139
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,040
- Yo, Tony, thank you so much

140
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:09,956
for letting me crash here, man.

141
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,581
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

142
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,581
Hey, thanks for taking
care of the place

143
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,581
while we're on vacay.

144
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,581
Nina's sorry she missed you.

145
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,581
She already flew out.

146
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,915
Is that everything?

147
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:17,915
These days, yeah.

148
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,790
- Okay.

149
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,623
- Please, you are talking
to someone who spent

150
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,623
way too much time in
shelters as a kid.

151
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,790
Yo, this place is fire, son.

152
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,498
Come on.
- Yeah, well, with Nina

153
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,873
being a designer, she's
classed me up a bit.

154
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,540
We're still settling in,

155
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,081
but as soon as we get
back from vacation,

156
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,875
she wants to get
started on the nursery.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,623
- Come on.

158
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,956
Nah.
- Dude, where have you been?

159
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,040
I text blasted, emailed.

160
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,873
I'm gonna be a dad.

161
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,623
- Yo, aye, I'm
so, so sorry, man.

162
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,956
I've been busy with like so
much shit lately wrapped up.

163
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,290
This is great news, man.

164
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,623
- Thank you, thank you.

165
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,873
- Wow, look at you.

166
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,623
Can't believe that
you're gonna be a dad.

167
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,540
Wife-
- Right?

168
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,040
- Kid, this fuckin' house.

169
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,790
- Geez.

170
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,248
Dude, we were ballers back
in those bartending days.

171
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,831
- Yeah.

172
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,998
Oh.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,748
Oh, it's my sister. It can wait.

174
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,831
- Yeah, come on. Let
me give you a tour.

175
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,667
- Please.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,833
Wow.

177
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,165
- Hey, listen.

178
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,665
We didn't get a chance to
talk about you and Eddy.

179
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,998
- Nah, it was time to move on.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,081
You know, I'm actually
more worried about him.

181
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,040
He took it pretty hard.

182
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,290
- Two years, right?

183
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,956
- Two years, three
months, one week.

184
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,749
Yeah, something like that.

185
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,124
- So you gonna be
okay by yourself?

186
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,666
- Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

187
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,999
I'm gonna, like, use
this time to decompress.

188
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,832
You know, read.

189
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,249
Definitely step back
from the industry.

190
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,001
You know, meditate.
- Uh huh.

191
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,166
- Definitely doing
all those things.

192
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,001
- Okay.

193
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:25,126
- Fuck.

194
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,043
Fuck.

195
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,082
- Hello?

196
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:51,999
- Hi, I'm looking
for Danny Maldonado.

197
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,916
- Speaking.

198
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:55,832
- Hi Danny, this is Kate
from Consolidated Credit.

199
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:56,834
Just wondering-

200
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:02,959
- Aw, sh...

201
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,793
Shit.

202
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:06,834
Shit.

203
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:10,957
Fuck.

204
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,793
Shit.

205
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:15,876
Fuck!

206
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,166
What the?

207
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:23,001
Fuck!

208
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:18,707
Don't even offer to
pay for the flight.

209
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:20,832
I can't pay you back
what I owe you as it is.

210
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,249
- I don't care about the money.

211
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,832
It's really bad now.

212
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,834
This is it. You need to be here.

213
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,541
- You act like I owe
this woman something.

214
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:32,416
- It's not for her.

215
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,793
- I gotta go. I got a rehearsal.

216
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:39,876
- Danny?

217
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,001
- Check it out.

218
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,124
I'm thinkin' of
doin' a one man show

219
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,374
and I'm gonna call it,

220
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:58,166
"No, I Will Not
Send You An Uber:

221
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,124
Stories of Trickin' Up In LA."

222
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,459
- Oh my God. It's so good.

223
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:05,457
You must.

224
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,041
- Right? It's gonna be good.

225
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,207
Things are just
really slow right now.

226
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,957
Like everything is trans.

227
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,249
- Honestly, Danny, maybe
you should just cut it off.

228
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,499
Like imagine life
without your big dick.

229
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,334
- Ugh.

230
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,332
I'd read more, I guess.

231
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,541
- Good.

232
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:19,499
- And I'd finally
binge those last

233
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:20,916
two seasons of "Scandal."

234
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:21,832
- It'd be like a whole
new life for you.

235
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,082
That's all I'm sayin'.

236
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:23,918
Consider it.

237
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,374
- When did you see him?

238
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,916
- Avi and I ran into him at
the ArcLight for like a second.

239
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,082
I shouldn't have said anything.

240
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,499
- Was he with a guy?

241
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,249
- He was with a friend.
- A guy?

242
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:38,374
- A friend that is a male,
a male that is a friend.

243
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,207
- Did Eddy ask about me?

244
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,084
- Not really.

245
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:43,916
Well he asked how you were doing

246
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:44,916
and I said that you were kind of

247
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,209
having a tough time right now.

248
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,082
Well, and then he said

249
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:50,374
that you spent your
entire life being selfish

250
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:51,959
and self absorbed and
that this is your karma.

251
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:56,501
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:03,334
- Oh my God...

253
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,291
We're broken up for two months

254
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,457
and he's already running
around getting new dick.

255
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,291
Like who does that?

256
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,041
- You know what your problem is?

257
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,957
You think you have the
right to get away with shit.

258
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,249
You think you're owed.

259
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,374
- My mother was a drug addict.

260
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,541
If it wasn't for my sister,

261
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:26,957
I probably wouldn't
even be alive.

262
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,084
And you're telling
me I'm entitled?

263
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,457
Why are all my friends
beating up on me today?

264
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,166
- Only when we
stop playing victim

265
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:36,834
can we finally move forward.

266
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:38,999
- Whatever the fuck that means,

267
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,168
- You know what that means.

268
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:44,124
- Raven, I appreciate
you coming by today,

269
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,624
but I do not need your life
coaching shit right now.

270
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,918
- Excuse me?

271
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:53,918
I have 33,832
followers on Instagram

272
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,293
and I'm this close to
signing a major ebook deal.

273
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,582
- Wait, really?

274
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,582
- Mm-hm.

275
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:01,291
- Dead ass?
- Dead ass.

276
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:02,999
Positive manifestation geared

277
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:03,541
to single women on
the dating scene.

278
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,249
- Nice.

279
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,916
- It's called "Send Me No Ubers:

280
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:08,332
A Memoir of Learning
to Love Yourself."

281
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,291
- Oh, Jesus.

282
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:11,126
- What?

283
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,501
That's a fucking great
title, you Philistine.

284
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,707
- Hi Danny, this is
Kate from Consolidated Credit.

285
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,084
Just wondering if you're
ready to make a payment on-

286
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,876
- Hey bro, it's Antonio.

287
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:46,207
I know you're going
through a lot,

288
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,207
but I need to talk to you.

289
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,043
It's about Mikey.

290
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,666
- Yo, come on.

291
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,207
I've been with Sprint
for like 10 years.

292
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,249
You guys can't gimme one
more payment extension?

293
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,209
Come on, just one more.

294
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:07,707
I really don't wanna have

295
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,084
to take my business
somewhere else.

296
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:11,749
Hey Jane, how are you?

297
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,582
Listen, I'm gonna leave Sprint

298
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,499
and I haven't selected
a new carrier yet,

299
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:17,082
so just giving everybody

300
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,249
my friend's home
phone number for now.

301
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,749
It's even got like this whole
answering machine and shit.

302
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,541
- Why don't you
just get a new carrier?

303
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:26,543
- Okay, 323...

304
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,376
461...

305
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,959
- Where's the fuckin' soap?

306
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,209
Fuck!

307
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,001
- Listen to me.

308
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,084
I know cheaters.
Mikey's not one.

309
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,582
He's not playing you.

310
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,166
He's a great guy.

311
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,001
He loves you.

312
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:03,624
- Things haven't been the same

313
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,707
for like a couple of months now.

314
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,209
I feel like something is up.

315
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,709
You think I'm being paranoid?

316
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,293
- You know, I always
envied you and Mikey.

317
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,418
You're like a happy family.

318
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,251
- We are. I love that boy.

319
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:31,832
We're so happy,
it's fucking corny.

320
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,666
- Yeah, you guys
are fuckin' corny.

321
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,334
Yeah.

322
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,582
I wish Eddy and I had what
you two have, you know?

323
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:47,249
Hey, stay calm. This will pass.

324
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,084
It's nothin'.

325
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,209
Don't you worry about it.

326
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,334
- You're a good friend, man.

327
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,793
Thank you for being here for me.

328
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,251
And I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

329
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,834
Why do smell like Cascade?

330
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,709
- Mira, it's Dawn.

331
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,084
Not fuckin' Cascade.

332
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:30,332
- Thank
you for the number.

333
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,626
It's not too late. You
could still make it in time.

334
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,251
Don't run away, Danny.

335
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:14,626
- Fuck!

336
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:03,541
- Hey Danny, this
is Jane from Aunt Phyllis's

337
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:06,374
from the Phyllis
Osgard Talent Agency

338
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:09,416
and I have great news.

339
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,999
You got called in for the new
Shonda Rhimes Netflix pilot.

340
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,874
And she called
you in especially.

341
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,668
She remembered you from CSI.

342
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:19,293
- SVU!

343
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,624
- So give us a call back.

344
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,376
It's time sensitive.

345
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:44,374
- You're a
pre-op transgender surgeon

346
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,082
who just got out of the OR.

347
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:48,749
- So I'm transgender,
male to female?

348
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:49,916
- No, you're pre-op.

349
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:50,666
You've not had the surgery.

350
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:51,543
You're still male.

351
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,582
- You said I just
got out of surgery.

352
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,082
- Listen to me.

353
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:59,582
You're a pre-op transgender
individual, still male,

354
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:02,582
but you're also a hot shot
surgeon riddled with demons

355
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,416
and you just got outta surgery-

356
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:05,874
- My surgery. I'm
operating on myself?

357
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:06,999
- Whoever
heard of such a thing?

358
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,582
No, you were operating
on your mother

359
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,957
who revealed to you as you
were wheeling her into the OR

360
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,791
that she's a lesbian with
a crystal meth problem.

361
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:17,416
Plus she's in possession
of top secret information

362
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:19,624
that could bring down the
entire government of Singapore

363
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:20,791
in one fell swoop.

364
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,957
They've got Rosie
Perez pinned for that.

365
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,624
Also you have two lovers.

366
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:28,124
One is played by Peter Dinklage
and he has Lou Gehrig's.

367
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,124
I'm emailing you the
sides now, Danny.

368
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,791
Get me that tape by five.
- I'll print it out.

369
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,916
Oh my god.

370
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:36,584
5:00 PM.

371
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:38,168
5:00 PM.

372
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,707
- I am so grateful
as I book this pilot.

373
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,166
- One more time.

374
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:23,001
Smile.

375
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,999
- I am so grateful
as I book this pilot.

376
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,916
- That's right. You're
a grateful bitch.

377
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,624
- I'm a grateful bitch.

378
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,707
- You're a grateful bitch.
- I'm a grateful bitch.

379
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,707
- You're a grateful bitch.
- I'm a grateful bitch.

380
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,541
- Repeat your gratitude
affirmation constantly.

381
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,707
- I'm so grateful as I
book this book pilot.

382
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,499
I am so grateful as
I book this pilot.

383
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,126
- Next.

384
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,001
You want it?

385
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:48,918
Commit.

386
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:50,957
- Okay.

387
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,916
- So clean up your act.

388
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,541
- Okay.

389
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:56,376
- Get yourself in a
good, clean head space.

390
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,499
Drug free.

391
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:01,126
- Mm-hm.

392
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:03,791
Mm-hm.

393
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,457
- No drugs.

394
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:08,541
- Mm-hm.

395
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:09,832
- You can do this.
- I can do this.

396
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,457
- You can do this.
- I can do this.

397
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,459
- You can do this.
- I'm gonna do this.

398
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,543
I'm gonna book this pilot and
then I'm gonna get Eddy back.

399
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:22,584
Raven, thank you. Watch
me turn shit around.

400
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,709
- Thank you.

401
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,709
- Why does you cologne
smell like Palmolive?

402
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:33,459
- It's Dawn.

403
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:37,916
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

404
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:38,584
Clearly Dawn.

405
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:42,876
I am so grateful as
I book this pilot.

406
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:47,168

5:00 PM.

409
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:58,584
Six hours.

410
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:00,626
I got this.

411
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,624
Cleaning up my act

412
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:09,999

413
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:11,624

440
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,793
I'm cleaning up my act,
I'm gonna book this pilot.

441
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:04,000
I asked for 20 CCS of a pina...

442
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,333
Epinephrine and
some snot nosed RN

443
00:25:06,335 --> 00:25:08,167
hands me after atra-atro...

444
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,542
Tropine, and I'm
supposed to calm down?

445
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,752
If I can't save my own mother,
what kind of doctor am I?

446
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:19,833
If I can't save my own mother,
what kind of doctor am I?

447
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,710
Get me the ambassador
to Singapore, stat.

448
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,625
I asked for 20 CCS
of apprenaphrene

449
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:27,833
and some snot nosed RN
hands me atropine...

450
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,250
Atro...

451
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:30,708
- Endotracheal.

452
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,708
- Endo...

453
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,667
- Endotracheal.

454
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:33,958
- Trach...

455
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,042
En...

456
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:38,708
If I can't even say
my own mother, what
kind of doctor am I?

457
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,875
- Ep, epiniphrene?

458
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,167
Stat!

459
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:43,667
- Endotracheal.

460
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,710
Endotracheal.

461
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,002
- Endotrach...

462
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,333
En...

463
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,002
Fuck.

464
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,710
Would it kill you to put
some fuckin' clothes on, man?

465
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,375
Fuck.

466
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,044
Fuck me, man. Fuck my life, man.

467
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:28,835
- Tony.

468
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,375
Oh, I'm so sorry.

469
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:34,627
The door was ajar.

470
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:39,000
I texted Tony to say
I would be dropping by

471
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:41,042
with some paperwork
for the house.

472
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,917
I'm the realtor.

473
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:43,752
I'm Lila.

474
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:46,752
- You are so beautiful.

475
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:49,919
- Well, hello.

476
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:54,958
- You're an actress?
- Yes.

477
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,750
I started very young,

478
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:59,083
modeling for department
stores and such.

479
00:26:59,085 --> 00:26:59,917
- In London?

480
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,375
- Yes, yes.

481
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,958
London, swinging
London.

482
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,125
And then that led to commercials
and small parts in films

483
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,792
and I was a single mother, so
I took whatever came my way.

484
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:16,085
And then an American
agent signed me,

485
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:20,458
and so I packed up my boy
and off we went to Hollywood.

486
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,792
The year was 1971.

487
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:23,417
- Wow.

488
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,417
Hm?

489
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,877
- No, thank you.
I don't partake.

490
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:30,042
- What was Hollywood like then?

491
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:30,877
- Oh.

492
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,000
It was fabulous.

493
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,000
The first party I
attended when I got here

494
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:40,125
was at Natalie Wood's house.

495
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,167
Everyone was there.

496
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,875
- No.
- Yeah.

497
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,500
Paul Newman, Joanne
Woodward, Robert Wagner,

498
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:49,958
although he and Natalie hadn't
remarried at that point.

499
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,375
Mia Farrow, Warren Beatty.

500
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:57,167
And everyone was so glamorous.

501
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,167
And in the middle of the party,

502
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,292
in walked this delicate creature

503
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:06,333
in the most divine dress
with her hair in rollers,

504
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:07,835
covered in a handkerchief.

505
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,500
It was Joan Collins.

506
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:13,875
- Oh really? From "Dynasty?"

507
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:15,419
- Yes, but that was years away.

508
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:17,833
- Did you work a lot?

509
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:19,042
- Quite a bit, yeah.

510
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,042
I made two films
with Frank Sinatra

511
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:24,000
and I worked with Ryan
O'Neal and Donald Sutherland,

512
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,377
all the biggest stars
of the day.

513
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,375
I was going to be the
next Julie Christie.

514
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,960
That's what everyone said.

515
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,169
Julie Christie.

516
00:28:38,044 --> 00:28:38,669
Oh.

517
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:43,458
Oh, she was divine then and now.

518
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,333
She was nominated
for an Academy Award

519
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:46,335
a few years back.

520
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:48,458
- Oh, right, right, right.

521
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,250
She played a woman with AIDs.

522
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:51,208
- Alzheimer's.

523
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,377
- Alzheimer's.

524
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:54,294
Why'd you stop?

525
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:56,377
Acting?

526
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,417
- My son, Donnell.

527
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,002
He got into some trouble
when he was a teenager.

528
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:07,835
Do you do that a lot?

529
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,125
- The vape?

530
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:11,002
Weed?
- Mm.

531
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,917
- I guess, I don't know.

532
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,250
It's legal now, right?

533
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:21,917
I don't know anything
about being a surgeon.

534
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,377
I barely got
through high school.

535
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,335
- You don't need a university
degree to play a surgeon.

536
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,125
- Things were going
so well in my career

537
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:42,958
for a couple of years.

538
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,292
I was working a lot.

539
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:45,752
Everybody was saying
I was gonna blow up.

540
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,794
And then I just, I
started to choke.

541
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,458
I would get these, I would get

542
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,169
these panic attacks
before auditions.

543
00:29:58,294 --> 00:29:59,210
I don't even know why.

544
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,125
I felt like I was so close,
like I was gonna make it

545
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,044
and then it all just fell apart.

546
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:08,958
It's like the universe
was saying, that's it,

547
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,794
that's all you get, now go back
to groveling and struggling.

548
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,044
It's all I ever knew, anyway.

549
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:19,667
Some days I just
wanna wake up dead.

550
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:21,460
That's what my mom used to say.

551
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,917
- And where is she?

552
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,919
Your mother.

553
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:30,210
- She passed.

554
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,583
- Okay.

555
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,125
On your feet.

556
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:39,919
Come on.

557
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,002
Stand up straight.

558
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,000
You know what you are?

559
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:49,960
You're a surgeon and
you're a damn good one.

560
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,000
Words are irrelevant.

561
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,375
This is what matters, Danny.

562
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:01,042
Tap into your pain.

563
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,377
That's your truth.

564
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:07,375
- I asked for 20
CCS of epinephrine

565
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,708
and some snot nosed RN
hands me atropine and...

566
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,667
Ah, I fucked up the line!

567
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,877
- It doesn't matter. Keep going.

568
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:17,625
- I ask for 20
CCS of epinephrine

569
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,667
and some snot nosed
RN hands me atropine

570
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,169
and I'm supposed to stay calm?

571
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:25,294
- Danny, why are you so angry?

572
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,208
- Because some RN almost
just killed my mother.

573
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,333
- Don't. Don't play anger.

574
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,252
Anger's banal.

575
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:39,417
What's behind the anger?

576
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,250
What's fueling it?

577
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,250
Guilt?

578
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:43,210
Self-loathing?

579
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:51,544
- Okay.

580
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:57,044
For years I was the hot shot,

581
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,377
the one that was going places.

582
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,544
I was the guy
everyone wanted to be.

583
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:05,960
Everyone...

584
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:08,085
But me.

585
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:13,085
Now I'm finally
figuring out who I am

586
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,127
and she reappears outta
nowhere, just to hold me back,

587
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:21,044
like she always did.

588
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,585
- What if it's funny?
That last line.

589
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:27,585
- Like she always did?

590
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,083
Well, his mother
reappeared out of the blue

591
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:41,500
with all her drama so all
the pain she caused him

592
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,625
is like flooding back.

593
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,792
He's crashing and burning.

594
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:48,292
- What if he's not
crashing and burning?

595
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:49,960
What if he's finding himself?

596
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:51,877
- Huh...

597
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,544
Let me look at the dialogue.

598
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:04,625
- My brother.

599
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:05,460
This is it.

600
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,125
She's not coming back.

601
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:12,169
She probably won't make
it through the night.

602
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,500
- Sabrina, it's not a good time.

603
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:20,333
Can I give you a
ring back in a bit?

604
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:24,333
No, I'm rehearsing
right now. I gotta go.

605
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,833
I gotta, we'll talk about
it later, all right?

606
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:26,669
Bye.

607
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:31,294
- Who's dying, Danny?

608
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,127
Is it your mother?

609
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,875
- I haven't seen or
spoken to her in 20 years.

610
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:44,750
She's a drug addict. Can we
go back to rehearsal now?

611
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,502
- She's your mother.

612
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,294
- I don't have a mother.
My sister raised me.

613
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:55,542
You don't know what it's like

614
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:58,208
dealing with a selfish,
angry fucked up addict, Lila.

615
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,335
That's that's not your world.

616
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:03,044
- My son, Donnell.

617
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,583
I lost him to drugs. Heroin.

618
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:08,044
He was only 19.

619
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,500
It's not their fault.

620
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:12,542
- Yes. Yes it is, actually.

621
00:34:12,544 --> 00:34:14,292
- No, it's not.

622
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:16,833
It's in their
genes. In their DNA.

623
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,669
We didn't know that then.

624
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,583
Oh, I was so angry with him.

625
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:24,708
Why wasn't he trying
to get better?

626
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,250
Why was he doing this to me?

627
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:28,585
Why wouldn't he just stop up?

628
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,377
I didn't know what
he was up against.

629
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,333
Where is she?

630
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,667
Your mother?

631
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,583
- Doesn't matter. New York.

632
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:42,750
- You must go to her.

633
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,500
No.

634
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:46,583
- Oh, if it's the money, if
it's the money, I can help-

635
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,250
- No, stop it, I'm not
taking money from you.

636
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,250
- We can use my air miles and-

637
00:34:51,252 --> 00:34:52,375
- Air miles.
- And it won't cost anything.

638
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:53,210
- Lila.

639
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,419
- Danny, I'm a mother.

640
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,377
Please let me help you.

641
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:10,625
- She would disappear on
us to hook up with guys

642
00:35:10,627 --> 00:35:12,458
or go looking for drugs.

643
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,294
It didn't matter
how young we were.

644
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,792
We would wake up and
she'd just be gone.

645
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:20,375
One time, I must have
been like nine years old,

646
00:35:20,377 --> 00:35:21,752
and she was gone for days.

647
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,792
So Sabrina and I went looking.

648
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:27,292
I knew this guy she
hooked up with a lot.

649
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,875
I knew where he lived,
so I went to his house.

650
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,625
My mother answered the door.

651
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:32,958
She started screaming at me.

652
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,417
Why was I always
causing trouble?

653
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:36,377
Why couldn't I just
leave her the fuck alone?

654
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:40,167
It was winter, it
was freezing out.

655
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:41,835
But I stood outside
and I waited for her.

656
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,667
People would walk by,
ask me if I was okay.

657
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,333
"No I'm all right.

658
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:47,000
My mom's just inside.
She's visiting friend.

659
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,252
She'll be out in a minute."

660
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:52,667
I was just happy
to find her alive,

661
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:53,627
to be honest with you.

662
00:35:57,835 --> 00:35:59,667
You may be a mother, Lila,

663
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:02,500
but there's no
mother in this story.

664
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,833
There's no role for you to play.

665
00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:06,627
I'm homeless, all right?

666
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,752
I have no money, I'm a failure.

667
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,333
This, this is all I have, okay?

668
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:14,625
I don't nail this,
put a bullet in me.

669
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:15,252
I'm done.

670
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:18,333
I don't need this, all right?

671
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:19,750
I can take it from here.
Thank you for your help.

672
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:20,544
Please.

673
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:25,460
- I understand.

674
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,627
Good luck, Danny.

675
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:43,625
- I gotta do this.

676
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:26,875
- Oh God, Danny.

677
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,083
What...

678
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:29,583
Somebody's boyfriend
kicked your ass?

679
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:30,833
Jesus, what-
- Shh, shh.

680
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:33,042
I'm in pain, it's perfect.

681
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,917
You remember to
bring the makeup?

682
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,917
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

683
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,000
- I got it.

684
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:37,835
- Let's do this.

685
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:41,333
- Such an idiot.

686
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:46,335
Oof.

687
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,877
- Oh.
- Sorry.

688
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,544
Oh, this is covering up nicely.

689
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,792
- Three years I
was the hot shot.

690
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,960
I'm gonna be honest with you

691
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,794
and I'm gonna tell
you the truth.

692
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:12,542
I've been selfish
and self-absorbed.

693
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:13,792
- No.

694
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:16,294
- Because of everything
that I've been through,

695
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,458
I guess, like, I felt
like it gave me license

696
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,625
to always put me first, only
care about the next fuck.

697
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:25,458
- That's not true.

698
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,294
- It is.

699
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:29,958
For years, I was the hot shot.

700
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,625
The guy that was going places,

701
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:33,377
the one everyone wanted to be.

702
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,627
Everyone...

703
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:38,502
But me.

704
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:44,667
Now I finally know
who I am, you know?

705
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:48,502
And she reappears outta
nowhere just to hold me back.

706
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,877
Like she always did it.

707
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,419
- What are you gonna
do now, Dr. Rodriguez?

708
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,167
- I'm gonna go back in there

709
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:04,833
and I'm gonna stay
until she wakes

710
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,419
and I'm gonna make things right.

711
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,875
- Nailed it.

712
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:13,000
- Feels good.

713
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,000
- Oh. I'm proud of you, Danny.

714
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,708
- Thank you.

715
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,167
- Seriously, that
was so terrific.

716
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:18,794
- Oh, come on.

717
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,042
- Why do you smell like Ajax?

718
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:26,208
- It's Dawn.

719
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,625
- I've got a good
feeling about this one, pal.

720
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:30,583
Sending it to them right now.

721
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,542
- Thank you, Phyllis.
Thank you for everything.

722
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:33,833
- Talk soon, Danny.

723
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:35,083
- Bye.

724
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,625
Oh my God. Ugh.

725
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,167
I just wanna, I wanna book this

726
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:43,708
and I wanna call
Eddy and tell him

727
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,792
that I turned everything around.

728
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:47,000
I want him to
believe in me again.

729
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:47,875
- Totally.

730
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:49,708
- Hm.

731
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,667
How are you? How
are things with Avi?

732
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,042
- Things are great.

733
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,750
I actually have some exciting
career news of my own.

734
00:39:56,752 --> 00:39:58,458
- Go on.

735
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,833
- I booked a callback for the
Brady Bunch revival on Hulu.

736
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:01,458
- Oh my God.

737
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,583
- It's just like
the original series

738
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:04,083
except Alice is undocumented

739
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,208
and Bobby has gender
identity issues.

740
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,875
- That is so great. Who
are you reading for?

741
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:09,875
- Carol's ex-wife.

742
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:12,208
Ah!

743
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,917
- I am so grateful
as I book this pilot.

744
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:22,752
I am so grateful as
I book this pilot.

745
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:29,833
So grateful as I
book this pilot.

746
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:30,917
I'm so grateful-
- What?

747
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,167
- As I book this pilot.

748
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm so grateful as
I book this pilot.

749
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:35,085
I'm so...

750
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:50,500
Hello?

751
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:52,625
- I have one
question for you, buddy.

752
00:40:52,627 --> 00:40:54,750
What is the almost
cast, soon to be star

753
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,167
of the hot, new Shonda Rhimes

754
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:58,167
Netflix series want for dinner?

755
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,958
Because I'm taking you out.

756
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,750
- Oh my God, I'm pinned?

757
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,125
- You're pinned, boo.

758
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,833
- Well when will
we know for sure?

759
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:06,958
- Soon, maybe even
by the time I see you tonight.

760
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,042
I'm gonna take you to some
place real expensive looking.

761
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:11,833
Picking you up at six.

762
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,542
Give Jane your address and
make her repeat it back to you.

763
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:16,042
She's a fuckin' moron.

764
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:16,917
- Okay.

765
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:24,833
- So I had a really
great time, papi.

766
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:26,000
- Yeah.

767
00:41:26,002 --> 00:41:27,292
- And you know, I could
tell you did, too,

768
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:28,667
so you know, when are
we gonna hang again?

769
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:29,833
You know, 'cause your
cock is incredible.

770
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,125
- Thanks. Five stars on Yelp.

771
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:31,960
Don't forget.

772
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:35,502
Dale.

773
00:41:55,253 --> 00:41:56,084
Please don't hang up.

774
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:56,836
I got great news.

775
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:00,503
- What is it?

776
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,959
- I'm pinned for the
new Shonda Rhimes pilot.

777
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,961
It's a series regular.
It's the lead.

778
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,711
I finally got my shit together.

779
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:13,003
- I'm so happy for you.

780
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:19,795
- Eddy, I'm so sorry
for everything that
I put you through,

781
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:22,376
but I wanna celebrate with you.

782
00:42:22,378 --> 00:42:23,920
Will you come to
me, baby, please?

783
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,251
I am so grateful as
I book this pilot.

784
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,334
So grateful as I
book this pilot.

785
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:38,545
I'm so-

786
00:42:56,378 --> 00:42:59,084
So there's liquor and
mixers if you wanna drink.

787
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:01,836
Tony left the place pretty
empty, but the bar is stocked.

788
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:03,711
- I'm good.

789
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,668
- There's no real food.

790
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,876
There's some leftover Chinese

791
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:09,918
that Raven brought
over the other night.

792
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,001
I can microwave it for us.

793
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,003
- I can't hang for long.

794
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:16,293
- You got plans?

795
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:17,751
- Mm-hm.

796
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:20,045
- Work, you gotta
teach a yoga class?

797
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:21,920
- Mm-mm.

798
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:26,084
- What, you got somewhere to be?

799
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:26,920
- Mm-hm.

800
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,959
- With the guy that Ilana
and Avi saw you with?

801
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:34,043
- This place is beautiful, man.

802
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,918
- With the guy that Ilana and
Avi caught you with, right?

803
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,334
That guy?

804
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,711
- Tell me about the series.

805
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,751
- Okay.

806
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,793
So I play a surgeon whose
mother is a drug addict

807
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:47,793
and a lesbian and she
gets brought into the ER

808
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:50,084
with an overdose, so I
gotta try to save her life.

809
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,918
- Wow. Wow, okay.

810
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,126
- Get this, get this.

811
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:54,793
I'm transgender.

812
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:56,670
About to have the
surgery, male to female.

813
00:43:59,128 --> 00:43:59,878
- That's ironic.

814
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,753
- What?

815
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:06,253
- That you're playing a
transgender individual.

816
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:09,836
You were always pretty
transphobic, dude.

817
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:12,126
Me?

818
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:13,459
No way. What?

819
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:16,251
No.
- Yes way, actually.

820
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,834
- Uh, not at all.

821
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:20,293
I think they are so brave,

822
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:22,001
plus they're so in right now,

823
00:44:22,003 --> 00:44:23,834
so it's got like awards
potential for me and shit.

824
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:25,084
- You won't be
winning on any awards

825
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:26,961
for self-awareness,
that's for fucking sure.

826
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,253
- Eddy.

827
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,170
What'd I do?

828
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,045
Please don't leave me.

829
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:45,878
Don't go.

830
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:49,001
I don't know what to do.

831
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:49,920
I love you.

832
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm sorry.

833
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:41,918
- Danny?
- Yeah, baby?

834
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,795
- You're not hard.

835
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:48,334
- This has never
happened to me before.

836
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:51,168
And things were finally
starting to go well again.

837
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,253
- It doesn't matter.

838
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,920
- I'm a top. It matters.

839
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,918
Wait, you mean that
the important thing

840
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,251
is that you're here with me?

841
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:02,045
That's what matters?

842
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:04,251
- I mean, I don't really care

843
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:06,084
that you can't
fuck me right now.

844
00:46:06,086 --> 00:46:07,753
You're not that good in bed.

845
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,834
I've had better sex.

846
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,126
- We had sex all the time.
I fucked you constantly.

847
00:46:15,128 --> 00:46:16,959
You love my dick.

848
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:19,959
- I liked having sex with
you because I loved you.

849
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:23,876
But you're lazy in bed.
You coast off your dick.

850
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:29,043
You're a good kisser, I
like the way you hold me.

851
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:31,293
You know, you have a great body-

852
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:33,126
- Hey, okay, every
guy I've ever fucked

853
00:46:33,128 --> 00:46:34,959
has hit me up and
begged me to come back.

854
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,459
All right, you
wanna see my phone?

855
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,795
You wanna see how many guys
are hittin' me up 24/7?

856
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:40,336
- I've seen.

857
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,503
- That's not what I...

858
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,253
Eddy.

859
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:52,295
Where are you going?

860
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:54,920
- To get some dick.

861
00:46:59,128 --> 00:46:59,920
- Fuck!

862
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,001
- Swanky, swanky.

863
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:35,459
I see somebody saved
their residuals

864
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:38,334
from their big stint on SVU.

865
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:39,043
- I wish I had.

866
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:40,459
I spent all that money on blow

867
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:42,001
and tricking up in
Miami for the summer.

868
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:44,126
- At least you didn't waste it.

869
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:45,668
- Hey, I know you're driving,

870
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,668
but you want a drink?
- Oh, no.

871
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,543
God forbid the
po-po pulled me over

872
00:47:49,545 --> 00:47:51,668
and hit me up with a
breathalyzer again,

873
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,586
spread eagle in a cheap car.

874
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:55,878
Let's stick with this.

875
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:59,043
- I'm in.

876
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,545
Let's do it.

877
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:05,126
Let's do it.

878
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:09,459
This is great shit.

879
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:11,626
- My guy Jacob's the best.

880
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:13,043
Here's his card.

881
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:13,878
- Oh.

882
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:19,501
You know, Phyllis, after
I book this series,

883
00:48:19,503 --> 00:48:22,209
I wanna make some
changes in my life.

884
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:25,418
- Just don't go into recovery.
It makes people boring.

885
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,251
- Well, I wanna start
to give back, you know?

886
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:32,376
I wanna do stuff for the trans
community, the environment.

887
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:34,209
- Can I just say something?

888
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,084
And it's not like I'm a
Trump supporter or anything.

889
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:38,920
Well, what's so bad
about global warming?

890
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:43,001
I mean, who the fuck
doesn't like warm weather?

891
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,168
Have you ever been
to Palm Springs?

892
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,709
Everybody's happy.

893
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:49,376
Those queens, they're just
grinnin' from ear to ear.

894
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:51,251
I mean they're old,
but they're happy.

895
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:52,668
I mean, think about it.

896
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,418
Have you ever met
anybody in your life

897
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,209
that woke up and said,

898
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:59,001
"Geez, I wish it was fuckin'
freezing balls out today,"

899
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,626
because I haven't,
and I know everybody

900
00:49:00,628 --> 00:49:02,709
that's worth
knowing, believe me.

901
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,420
- I want this series to
start a new chapter for me.

902
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:13,586
I gotta grow up, Phyllis.

903
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:18,170
- Danny, you didn't
get the pilot.

904
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:21,211
I got the call on
my way over here.

905
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,751
They just decided it
was more appropriate

906
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,668
to go with an actual
trans performer.

907
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,459
Look, it's nothing personal.

908
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,086
It's just everything
about you is wrong.

909
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,043
- Okay, um...

910
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:48,668
Well the good thing
is I'm starting

911
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,501
to get my heat back, right?

912
00:49:50,503 --> 00:49:53,501
So I'm feeling momentum again.

913
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:55,834
Maybe at dinner tonight,
we can strategize

914
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:58,084
about how to build
on this, right?

915
00:49:58,086 --> 00:50:01,170
It was, I mean I was
pinned, so it was close.

916
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,461
Phyllis?

917
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,668
- Danny, we're dropping
you as a client.

918
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,003
You're just not booking.

919
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,543
Look, it's not me. I love you.

920
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,586
It's those assholes
down at the agency.

921
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,420
They just don't see what
I see. What can I do?

922
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:34,211
- But it's your
agency. You own it.

923
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:38,543
- You ever wonder
why there's so many

924
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:41,168
assholes on the
face of this earth?

925
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,086
Because there are
assholes everywhere.

926
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:47,376
Like today I was driving
down Laurel Canyon

927
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,209
on my way to see you and
I got stuck at a light

928
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,751
behind one of those transport
vans for disabled people.

929
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:55,336
You know what I'm talking about?

930
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:00,793
And let me tell you,
these disabled people,

931
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:04,709
they took their sweet fuckin'
time gettin' on that van.

932
00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:05,918
I mean, you would've thought

933
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,168
that the whole world
revolved around them.

934
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,626
They could give a shit
about anybody else.

935
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,503
What a bunch of assholes.

936
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,751
So there I am, stuck
behind that fucking van,

937
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:21,793
unable to get past, but
that's when I got the call

938
00:51:21,795 --> 00:51:23,584
that you didn't get the pilot.

939
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:26,418
And I was like, wow.

940
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,751
Well now I have time to
cancel my dinner reservations

941
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,376
and make plans with one
of my working clients.

942
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:37,668
So you see, Danny,
those disabled people,

943
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,711
they were fuckin' assholes,
but they served a purpose.

944
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,711
And it's the same thing
down at my agency.

945
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,626
Each and every person that
works for me is an asshole.

946
00:51:50,628 --> 00:51:52,293
You've been down at the agency.

947
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:53,793
Haven't you ever
been in that office

948
00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:57,459
and thought, wow, these
people are really assholes.

949
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:00,626
But here's the thing,
that's why I hired them.

950
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:02,751
Because now I can
sit here with you,

951
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,293
my very dear and good friend,

952
00:52:05,295 --> 00:52:08,834
and I can say, Danny, I'm sorry.

953
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:10,876
The assholes down at the agency

954
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,793
are insisting that I let you go.

955
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,420
What can I do? They're assholes.

956
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:19,543
But without them
there to hide behind,

957
00:52:19,545 --> 00:52:22,168
I'd be the one dropping you.

958
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,461
I'd be the asshole. And
I'm not an asshole, Danny.

959
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:27,795
I'm your friend.

960
00:52:34,753 --> 00:52:36,959
You're gonna turn this around.

961
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:37,836
You will.

962
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:42,334
You've got that star quality.

963
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:43,793
And when things
swing back your way

964
00:52:43,795 --> 00:52:45,461
and you land that perfect role

965
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,501
and you step up to that podium

966
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:53,295
to collect your Golden
Globe or SAG Award or Oscar,

967
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:59,834
I want you to know that
when you turn around,

968
00:52:59,836 --> 00:53:02,795
there I'll be, right beside you,

969
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:06,170
acting like I was
there the whole time.

970
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:11,793
In this town, Danny,
that's the closest thing

971
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:13,836
to true friendship
as you can get.

972
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:17,961
So you hang in there, sunshine.

973
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:42,211
- Danny, she's dead.

974
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:53,461
Why did you make me
go through this alone?

975
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:21,670
- Oh.

976
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:23,503
Hello, Danny.

977
00:54:24,753 --> 00:54:25,545
How are you?

978
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,545
- I never wanted
to succeed for me.

979
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,420
It was always for her.

980
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:36,920
- Your mom?

981
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,045
- No, my sister.

982
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:45,459
I don't think I ever
made anyone happy.

983
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:47,378
Not her, not Eddy.

984
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:49,295
No one.

985
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:58,420
- I had to put him
in a rehab facility.

986
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:04,045
It was the third try, but he
ran away with his girlfriend

987
00:55:05,628 --> 00:55:09,295
and they ended up in some seedy
hotel outside Los Angeles.

988
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,584
And of course the
first thing they did

989
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:14,878
was score some heroin.

990
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,461
She shot him up.

991
00:55:18,836 --> 00:55:22,918
He was only 19, but
he was already so sick

992
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,586
and his body couldn't handle it.

993
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:29,459
He began to choke
on his own vomit

994
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:30,961
and then he began
to have convulsions.

995
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,336
And she panicked, then she fled.

996
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:39,876
You know, sometimes
I struggle to recall

997
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,420
the sound of his voice.

998
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:45,003
So many years have passed.

999
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:52,459
Some days, I think
I've forgotten it
for good and I panic.

1000
00:55:52,461 --> 00:55:57,043
And then suddenly I can
hear it in the distance

1001
00:55:57,045 --> 00:55:58,836
and it brings me such relief.

1002
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,586
But I know the day will come

1003
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:04,586
when I will have
forgotten it for good

1004
00:56:06,003 --> 00:56:09,545
and then all I will
have left is the guilt.

1005
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,045
My son died choking on his own
vomit on a motel room floor.

1006
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,378
No one was there to hold him.

1007
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,961
He left this world alone.

1008
00:56:26,545 --> 00:56:29,086
"The moment we ceased
to hold each other,

1009
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:33,711
the sea engulfs us and
the light goes out."

1010
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:36,545
James Baldwin.

1011
00:56:38,753 --> 00:56:40,753
Donnell's favorite
American writer.

1012
00:56:43,711 --> 00:56:46,001
Go to her funeral, Danny.

1013
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,628
Don't let her leave
this world alone.

1014
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:54,420
You've hit bottom and
that's a terrible thing,

1015
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,876
but it's also a good thing.

1016
00:56:57,878 --> 00:56:59,628
Things can only get
better from here.

1017
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:01,918
- No.

1018
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,420
It can get worse, I've learned.

1019
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:11,084
- I have to show a
house in the Palisades.

1020
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:13,084
Can I come back later and
take you out to dinner

1021
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:14,209
and we can talk?

1022
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:17,170
- Give up on me, lady.

1023
00:57:25,795 --> 00:57:26,586
- You're right.

1024
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,711
You haven't hit bottom.

1025
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,920
You're still a
self-absorbed shit!

1026
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:38,709
- You couldn't even
save your own son, Lila.

1027
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:40,170
And you can't save me.

1028
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:27,544
- Hello, Danny.

1029
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:31,002
This is Jane from the
Phyllis Osgard Talent Agency.

1030
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:32,129
I have great news.

1031
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:36,335
Shonda Rhimes wants
you after all.

1032
00:58:36,337 --> 00:58:39,294
The actor they offered
the role to dropped out.

1033
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:40,960
- Oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God.

1034
00:58:40,962 --> 00:58:42,585
- Hey Danny.

1035
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,377
The actor they offered
the role to dropped out.

1036
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:45,877
She booked the second lead

1037
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:48,710
in the new "Howard the
Duck" reboot at Sony.

1038
00:58:48,712 --> 00:58:49,710
- Great.

1039
00:58:49,712 --> 00:58:51,210
- So you're in?

1040
00:58:51,212 --> 00:58:53,752
You need to meet Shonda ASAP.

1041
00:58:53,754 --> 00:58:56,877
How soon can you get to
the Shondaland offices?

1042
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:59,044
- Um, gimme like 45 minutes.

1043
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:01,171
- Great. I'll email
you the drive on.

1044
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:04,169
- I'm so happy.
I love you, Jane.

1045
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:06,710
- We love you too, Danny.

1046
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:07,960
And Phyllis wanted
to let you know,

1047
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,210
we take the commission on this,

1048
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,294
having dropped you
not withstanding.

1049
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,252
- Sure thing.

1050
00:59:11,254 --> 00:59:12,710
- Bye Danny.

1051
00:59:12,712 --> 00:59:16,710
- Bye.

1052
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:54,671
- I'm a horrible person.

1053
01:00:03,962 --> 01:00:06,752
- Hey superstar.
So fucking proud of you.

1054
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:08,919
Now you can show these
asshole down at the agency

1055
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:09,879
what you're capable of.

1056
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:44,835
- Hello,
Danny, it's Jane.

1057
01:00:44,837 --> 01:00:48,419
Aunt Phyllis can't believe
you bailed on Shonda Rhimes.

1058
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:50,335
You blew this, Danny.

1059
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:52,837
She said to tell you
we're dropping you again

1060
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:57,046
and you should no longer
consider her your friend.

1061
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:54,877

01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:18,252
- Phyllis Osgard
gave me your number.

1067
01:02:18,254 --> 01:02:19,087
- Okay?

1068
01:02:20,546 --> 01:02:22,210
- I need a delivery.

1069
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:24,085
- Cash only.

1070
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:15,921
- Hey Eddy...

1071
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:28,879
- Message deleted.

1072
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:38,504
- It's open.

1073
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:42,421
It's open!

1074
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:05,460
- You Danny?

1075
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,169
- One and only.

1076
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:12,087
- What happened to your face?

1077
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:16,044
- Had a bad breakup. With life.

1078
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:21,879
- That supposed to be funny?

1079
01:04:28,504 --> 01:04:31,002
- I keep trying to move forward.

1080
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:33,504
You know, taking steps,
living the dream.

1081
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:36,377
- I hear you, man.

1082
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:37,544
- Just trying to get
to where I want to be.

1083
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:40,004
You know, so many times
I thought this is it.

1084
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:42,419
I'm gonna call my sister
and I'm gonna say,

1085
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,585
"I finally made it.

1086
01:04:44,587 --> 01:04:45,462
I've arrived.

1087
01:04:47,004 --> 01:04:48,129
I'm in Hollywood."

1088
01:04:52,546 --> 01:04:55,335
This is just too tough for me.

1089
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:56,462
- Well...

1090
01:04:57,671 --> 01:04:59,004
Life is tough.

1091
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:02,587
- Yeah.

1092
01:05:05,754 --> 01:05:06,671
Yeah it is.

1093
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:18,421
- Let me see your vein.

1094
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:39,794
There you go.

1095
01:05:39,796 --> 01:05:41,046
Pump your fist.

1096
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:42,962
Come on.

1097
01:05:45,754 --> 01:05:46,627
Okay.

1098
01:05:46,629 --> 01:05:47,629
That's good.

1099
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:50,962
All right?

1100
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:55,794
- Ow.

1101
01:05:55,796 --> 01:05:56,629
Ow.

1102
01:05:58,629 --> 01:06:00,046
- Nice.

1103
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:02,046
- More.

1104
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:05,129
Oh.

1105
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:07,712
Oh, fuck.

1106
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:15,587
- Can you let go?

1107
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:22,169
- Wow, that's...

1108
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:23,004
That's...

1109
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,379
Yeah.

1110
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,129
Yeah.

1111
01:06:29,212 --> 01:06:30,046
Wow.

1112
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:34,504
- There you go.

1113
01:06:36,254 --> 01:06:38,129
- Hey, Jacob.

1114
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:44,502
Thank you.

1115
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:45,337
Really.

1116
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:48,629
- You want me to lock
the door behind me?

1117
01:06:50,629 --> 01:06:51,460
Danny?

1118
01:06:51,462 --> 01:06:53,335
Hey.

1119
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:56,252
Over here, over here.

1120
01:06:58,837 --> 01:07:00,712
Do you want me to lock
the door behind me?

1121
01:07:04,671 --> 01:07:05,504
All right.

1122
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,046
- Oh that's...

1123
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:28,129
That's nice.

1124
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,171
Oh that's nice.

1125
01:07:35,671 --> 01:07:37,754
I just wanna go to sleep.

1126
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:46,212
Eddy.

1127
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:49,587
You got my message?

1128
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:55,254
I'm so glad you're here.

1129
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,710
I'm so sorry for
how I treated you.

1130
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,087
I know I need your forgiveness.

1131
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:22,377
We just got to the east coast
to see my sister and I can't.

1132
01:08:22,379 --> 01:08:24,502
- But you can record
yourself on your iPhone.

1133
01:08:24,504 --> 01:08:26,294
It's so easy.

1134
01:08:26,296 --> 01:08:28,294
- Nah, I think I'm
gonna skip this one.

1135
01:08:28,296 --> 01:08:30,129
- All right.
I'll let 'em know.

1136
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:32,710
- Hey, we'll
get 'em next time.

1137
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,419
- Bye Danny.

1138
01:08:34,421 --> 01:08:36,585
- Bye Phyllis.
- Bye Eddy.

1139
01:08:36,587 --> 01:08:38,252
No, Jane.

1140
01:08:38,254 --> 01:08:40,460
You cannot take a lunch.
You're a fucking intern.

1141
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:42,627
Good God, you're a waste
of millennial space.

1142
01:08:44,629 --> 01:08:46,377
- Bad day at the
office for Jane.

1143
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:47,294
- Apparently.

1144
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:48,544
- Poor thing.

1145
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:49,379
- Oh my God.

1146
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:00,587
I'll be back in a minute.

1147
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:02,794
You want anything?

1148
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:04,129
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

1149
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,460
These guys...

1150
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:30,502
- What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

1151
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:31,296
You stupid?

1152
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:34,335
Fuck, man.

1153
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,835
What are you, stupid?

1154
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:37,502
I gotta tie your
fuckin' shoelaces?

1155
01:09:37,504 --> 01:09:38,171
Really?

1156
01:09:39,504 --> 01:09:41,502
You know what? I can't
do this shit, man.

1157
01:09:41,504 --> 01:09:42,296
I gotta pee.

1158
01:09:59,754 --> 01:10:02,544
- What's up, little man?

1159
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:06,710
Hey, you want me to show
you how to tie your laces?

1160
01:10:06,712 --> 01:10:07,835
Yeah? All right.

1161
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:09,419
So check this out.

1162
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:12,294
So first make bunny ears
like that. See that?

1163
01:10:12,296 --> 01:10:13,544
- Uh huh.

1164
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:14,460
- All right and then
you cross 'em over

1165
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:16,377
and you make an X like that.

1166
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,002
And then you pull
the bunny ears out.

1167
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:18,796
Go ahead.

1168
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:26,294
Easy, right?

1169
01:10:28,421 --> 01:10:30,544
- Rico!

1170
01:10:30,546 --> 01:10:31,960
I'm sorry, love.

1171
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:33,419
- Danny?

1172
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:34,002
- Mama gets a
little crazy sometimes,

1173
01:10:34,004 --> 01:10:35,835
but mama loves you.

1174
01:10:35,837 --> 01:10:37,587
Look, I got you a treat.

1175
01:10:38,837 --> 01:10:39,835
- Hey.

1176
01:10:39,837 --> 01:10:41,044
- Danny?

1177
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:43,585
- You're loved,
remember that, okay?

1178
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:44,587
And don't lose your way.

1179
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,710
Now go to her.

1180
01:10:47,712 --> 01:10:49,254
- Hi,
come. Give me a hug.

1181
01:10:51,879 --> 01:10:53,377
- I'm such an adult now.

1182
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:55,044
I don't even know who
I am anymore. Tell her.

1183
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,335
- He's making great strides
into near adulthood.

1184
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:11,796
- Danny?

1185
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:20,544
Don't panic. It's
all right, Danny.

1186
01:11:20,546 --> 01:11:21,919
I'm here. Don't panic.

1187
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:22,960
Don't panic.

1188
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:24,419
Now, come on. That's it.

1189
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:25,835
That's it, giving
it up. That's it.

1190
01:11:25,837 --> 01:11:26,960
That's it.

1191
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:27,919
Good boy.

1192
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:29,460
That's it. Get rid of it.

1193
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:30,919
That's it, get rid of it.

1194
01:11:30,921 --> 01:11:32,002
That's it.

1195
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:33,460
Good boy.

1196
01:11:33,462 --> 01:11:34,919
Oh, you're doing it.

1197
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:36,460
Here we go.

1198
01:11:36,462 --> 01:11:37,669
Here we go.

1199
01:11:37,671 --> 01:11:38,504
Good boy.

1200
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,212
Good boy.

1201
01:11:41,629 --> 01:11:44,460
Oh, good boy.

1202
01:11:44,462 --> 01:11:45,587
Can you feel me?

1203
01:11:46,879 --> 01:11:49,462
- I can feel you, Lila.

1204
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:51,960
I can feel your warmth.

1205
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:53,752
- Good.

1206
01:11:53,754 --> 01:11:56,044
You're gonna be okay.

1207
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,754
You're gonna be okay.

1208
01:11:59,754 --> 01:12:00,629
There you go.

1209
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:03,710
You're okay now.

1210
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:04,796
You're okay.

1211
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:17,837
- Come here.

1212
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:20,796
You're doing great.

1213
01:13:08,546 --> 01:13:09,379
- Hello.

1214
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:30,046
- There's so much I
wanted to say to you,

1215
01:13:32,462 --> 01:13:35,171
so on the plane, I
wrote it all down.

1216
01:13:52,837 --> 01:13:53,671
Sis...
