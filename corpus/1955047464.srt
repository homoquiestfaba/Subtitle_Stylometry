1
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:13,350
- Three months, oh, my god,
it's felt like forever.

2
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,318
It's just, you are all
i can think about.

3
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,020
I couldn't think about anything
other than your eyes

4
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:18,989
and your hair
and your--everything.

5
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:21,925
and--and I mean, I just couldn't
wait to come home for break.

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,227
I mean, don't get me wrong.
California is awesome.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,463
It's literally everything
that everybody says.

8
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:29,099
It's amazing,
but I just--

9
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,834
I couldn't wait
for my dad's pumpkin pie.

10
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,969
Oh, my god, and turkey and just,
like, turkey sandwiches

11
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,739
Turkey chili,
literally everything.

12
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:37,941
It's, like, you don't realize
how much you love someone

13
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:40,277
Or place until you leave them,
you know?

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,412
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, I just--

15
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:43,847
I love you so fucking much.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,751
- Can I get on top?
- Oh, yeah.

17
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,724
Hey.
Hey, let's take this off.

18
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:56,760
- It's cold.
- All right.

19
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,428
It's too cold,
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,330
Yeah, let's leave it on.
We gotta love it. I love this.

21
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:01,831
It's, like,
my favorite sweater of yours.

22
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:05,068
It's soft and sexy.

23
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,271
Well, thank you for
picking me up from the airport.

24
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,473
Oh.

25
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,176
Hey, are you okay?
Pooh bear?

26
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,046
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,448
- Look it, we should stop.
Let's stop.

28
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,283
- No. No, you should come.

29
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:22,185
Do you want to fuck me
from behind until you come?

30
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:23,586
- What is going on?

31
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,255
- I don't know.

32
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,191
Lately I've just been
walking around

33
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:31,161
and--and I feel like
I'm trapped in my body

34
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:34,164
But I'm also, like--like,
floating above it.

35
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,671
I think about dying.

36
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:44,841
A lot.

37
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:47,611
But other than that,
school's fine.

38
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:55,352
- I think we should stop
having sex.

39
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,221
- I think we should break up.

40
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,828
- What?!

41
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,558
- In second grade,
i humped a teletubby

42
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,293
and was sent home
from school.

43
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:40,296
I didn't know what I was doing,
but I knew to be embarrassed.

44
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,566
And since then,
I've never really stopped

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,669
Being embarrassed.

46
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:49,572
That's what's so awesome
about college.

47
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,976
No one at college knows
that I molested that teletubby.

48
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,378
No one at college
knows anything about you.

49
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,514
- Mom!

50
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,882
- All these new people,

51
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,151
and they don't know
that Troy Garskoff

52
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,953
once told Chad Weisengartz that
i kissed with too much teeth.

53
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,922
They don't know that I didn't
get, like,

54
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,025
Any boobs at all
until junior year.

55
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,994
If you were Scott Karazewski,
the coolest guy

56
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:13,463
in my high school
because his brother had been...

57
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,198
- Mom!

58
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:16,933
- Or if you were
Heather Zerilli,

59
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,302
The hot girl
who everyone wanted

60
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,771
Or wanted to be,

61
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:24,140
It just doesn't matter anymore.

62
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:26,476
I wasn't cool in high school,

63
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,978
and I definitely
wasn't considered hot.

64
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,882
I was someone else's sidekick.

65
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:35,151
I know it's only been
three months,

66
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:37,086
but I feel totally different.

67
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:39,489
For one, I'm underlining
a lot more stuff in books,

68
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:42,325
Which makes me feel way deeper
than I was in high school.

69
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:53,069
Getting another go at things
is awesome,

70
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:55,839
Until, of course,
you come home

71
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:58,608
for Thanksgiving break.

72
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,376
- We called.
We e-mailed.

73
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,179
I tried to skype you
every night last week.

74
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,515
If not for you liking things
on facebook,

75
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,517
I would have thought
you were dead, meesh.

76
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,786
- No one likes to skype
with their parents, mom.

77
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,521
No one likes to skype period.

78
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:13,923
- They wanted me to start
on november 15th or nothing,

79
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:16,759
so we packed up what we could
and we went.

80
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,628
It was a whirlwind.

81
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,631
Philip's packing the rest up
and driving everything down.

82
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:23,132
Are you paying
your phone bill?

83
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:24,801
- Yeah,
I'm just out of minutes.

84
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:27,937
- We find it very strange
that you decided to come home

85
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,240
without calling us.
Is everything okay?

86
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:32,308
How did you pay for the ticket?
How's Heather?

87
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,377
- I'm fine. She's fine.
I'm--i just--

88
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,446
you know, they gave me
extra hours for my work-study.

89
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,780
- All right.

90
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,916
We gave Phil some money
for emergencies.

91
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:44,321
Please make sure
he doesn't use it on marijuana.

92
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,759
- Mom.

93
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,995
- Uh-huh.

94
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:54,931
- I'm dropping out of school.

95
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:57,033
I want to move home.

96
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,668
- What did your dad say?

97
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,004
- I haven't told him yet.

98
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:04,140
- Good luck with that.

99
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,348
- Do you hear what he's saying?

100
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:14,984
He wants all females
to crawl towards him

101
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,986
so that he can jizz
on their faces.

102
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,454
This song is
like a hate crime.

103
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,490
- Timmy Hartman's having
a little thing tonight.

104
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:21,791
He got his G.E.D.

105
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,293
and an apartment
with Mike Dills, I guess.

106
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:25,862
We're going, yeah?
- We'll see.

107
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,564
If my parents
let me out of my cage.

108
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:30,466
Timmy Hartman's sweet,
but who else is gonna be there?

109
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,435
I guess I wasn't really close
with their class.

110
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:34,504
- I don't know.
A bunch of people.

111
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,773
I've been hanging out a lot
with them.

112
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:38,942
Tanya spinelli and them came out
to Penn State on halloween

113
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:40,643
When you bailed.

114
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:43,146
That's when I blacked out
and hooked up with Chris Suey.

115
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,081
But Heather said his overbite
wasn't that bad,

116
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,417
and he's, like, legitimately
on the soccer team

117
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,585
so at least that.

118
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:50,787
There was this guy
that I hooked up with

119
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,121
He was--he was, like,
kind of bald.

120
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:54,157
- Lately, when I was around
my best friend,

121
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,025
I found myself thinking about
all the secrets

122
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,027
I'd picked up over the years

123
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,163
and just how many of them
i wished I didn't know.

124
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:03,166
How she nairs her arm hair,

125
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,301
The rare condition she has that
makes her nipples lactate

126
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,703
At odd times,

127
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,571
The fact that she once killed
her pet hermit crab

128
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:12,642
with a hammer, and then told
her parents it just exploded.

129
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,977
- So?
- I only get the van

130
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,912
When I'm home.
- Well, fuck it.

131
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,647
I'll come visit you then.

132
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,882
I'll hook up with one of
your gaybay art school boys.

133
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:23,219
- It's mostly computer kids.

134
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,855
- Whatever.

135
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,458
Stop with me at ruthfred's.
I gotta get tampons.

136
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,462
- My parents will freak
if I'm not home soon.

137
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,564
- Oh, ooh.

138
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,068
- Meesh?

139
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,437
- Hey, mush.
- Have you talked to mom yet?

140
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,539
- Yeah, we talked.

141
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:45,708
These are my school portraits,
aren't they?

142
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,210
- They are. Why?

143
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:48,878
- You could've waited
till I got here, man.

144
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,513
- Except I had no idea
you were coming

145
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,548
because you haven't called
anybody back in three weeks.

146
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,384
And now, you're unwrapping
all my hard work.

147
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:55,852
Come on, meesh.
- Question.

148
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,620
What were you doing
out in the car?

149
00:06:57,653 --> 00:07:00,490
- Relaxing.
Why, what'd you see?

150
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:03,092
- Boxed wine.

151
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,994
- I get cravings
around all these boxes, okay?

152
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,329
You would, too.

153
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:08,364
- This is fucked, mush.
- I know, man.

154
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't know what to tell you,
but I did promise mom

155
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,335
that I would show you
this device

156
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,670
that would blow your mind.
Have you ever heard of this?

157
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:15,438
It's called a phone.
- Oh, my god.

158
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,106
- I don't know if they taught
you this yet in college,

159
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,275
but all you have to do
when it vibrates or rings,

160
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:22,045
you pick it up and say "hello."
- Stop. Listen, I called her.

161
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:23,780
Last I heard,
she had a job offer in Tampa

162
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,548
and she was thinking about it,

163
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,750
Maybe the move would happen
during christmas break.

164
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:30,053
- Okay, first off,
it's Clearwater, not Tampa.

165
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:32,255
It sounds mellower. I like it.

166
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:35,224
- And that was in september,
bud.

167
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:38,294
- Notice the nuance here.
- It's good.

168
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,563
- I could have gone full wig,
but I said no.

169
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,899
Terry Fong of
Terry Fong studio photography

170
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,600
is on to me,

171
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,569
and he's not gonna let just
anything slide this year.

172
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:48,304
- You know
I've heard this story before.

173
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:51,474
- Quiet. As you can see,
with the simple utilization

174
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:54,877
of mom's maternity sweater
and dad's backup glasses,

175
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,848
i was able to achieve an effect
far much more impactful,

176
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,450
nay, profound,

177
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:03,886
than any simple wig could ever
be expected to achieve.

178
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,621
- Okay, meesh. Okay.

179
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:07,890
Should I go right upstairs
and grab mine?

180
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,826
- Junior year?

181
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,327
- When I slicked my hair back.

182
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,262
- With the seashells?
- The puka beads.

183
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:16,166
- Go get it.
- Deadly. I'll be back.

184
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,937
- Hey, where were you?
Mom is not happy.

185
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,972
- Katie, this is Courtney.

186
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:25,608
- Courtney has
a vocal chord injury,

187
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,243
so she has to speak
really softly right now.

188
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:29,345
- Hi, how are you?
Really nice to meet you.

189
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,647
- Really nice to meet you.

190
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,349
- Hey, need help?
- Yes, please.

191
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,385
Thank you.
- Is mom mad at me?

192
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,387
- Um, well, I mean,
a little bit.

193
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,590
- Okay.
- You got it?

194
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:43,993
- Yeah, I got it.
You look pretty. Come on.

195
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:46,763
- Hey, where were you?

196
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,831
You were supposed to go shopping
with mom.

197
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:50,567
- Um, my bus was late.

198
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,505
- You know what? I just wanted
my daughters with me.

199
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,807
That's all. Okay?
It's a tradition.

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,509
- We had to take a xanax.

201
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,644
- Hmm.

202
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:03,513
- I'll pick you up later.
- No.

203
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,448
If I go, i'll drive myself.
- Hey, what later?

204
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,016
Where is she going?
She's not going anywhere.

205
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,051
No, no, no, no, no.
Not tonight, no.

206
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,386
It's the night before
Thanksgiving.

207
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,288
This is a very big weekend
for this family.

208
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,756
- Dad, I see you guys
all the time.

209
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:16,392
- We're not guys.
We're your parents.

210
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,060
- You see us when you want
to do your laundry.

211
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:19,495
Now, your sister and Courtney,

212
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,063
They came all the way
from Colorado

213
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,232
with a vocal chord injury,
i might add.

214
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,802
They're getting married.
- We don't give a shit.

215
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,171
- What?
- God, I'm hot.

216
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:30,139
Are you hot?
- Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,974
- It's like a greenhouse
in here.

218
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:34,043
- I want to plan the engagement
party for saturday,

219
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,878
and I want all of you cooking.

220
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,580
Your dad wants to brine
the turkey this year.

221
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,282
- Yeah, I'm giving up
on deep-frying.

222
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,417
Did you know that 90% of fires
during the holidays

223
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,952
Are caused by people
deep-frying turkeys?

224
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:45,421
- We read all about it
in reader's digest.

225
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,190
- Mm-hmm.
- Stop eating those.

226
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,591
Put 'em away.
They're for saturday.

227
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:49,992
Will you chop that for me,
sweetheart?

228
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:52,695
- Yeah, sure.

229
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,933
Find it now. We're on it.

230
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:59,168
- I don't know, man.

231
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,637
I just wanted one more
Thanksgiving at home.

232
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,006
- Well, we got leftover pumpkins
from halloween.

233
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,908
We could make pie.

234
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:08,377
- I don't know. I don't think
that's how dad makes 'em.

235
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,613
- How does he make 'em?

236
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,348
Say what you will
about our father,

237
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,550
but that man can
bake his balls off.

238
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,119
- He can bake his balls off.
That's weird.

239
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,754
- I feel like
it de-stresses him.

240
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:20,656
Huh.

241
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:24,294
You know, they say
you can never go home again.

242
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,231
- Yeah, man.

243
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,366
I guess not.

244
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,668
- No, I mean, you actually
can't go home again.

245
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,570
I'm packing everything
in the u-haul

246
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,072
and driving it down
on sunday.

247
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,274
We have to be out by the 30th.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:39,742
Mom said.

249
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,944
- Which means you have to
pack your room by then.

250
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,747
I haven't touched it, so...

251
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,884
- No more house, mushy.

252
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:50,453
- No more house, meeshy.

253
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:52,388
The building's comin' down!

254
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:55,324
Everyone out, now!
Now! Leave it!

255
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:57,894
- So how's Pittsburgh?

256
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,228
Seems you're in love,
from your e-mails.

257
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,897
- Oh, my god, I love it.

258
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,965
It's not New York,

259
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,434
but it's, like,
100 times better than here.

260
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,104
- Oh, I like Altoona.

261
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:09,772
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

262
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,774
- What do you like
about Altoona?

263
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,843
- Courtney thinks there's a kind
of Charles Dickens

264
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,112
Meets flashdance kind of thing
going on.

265
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,381
- It's very poetic.

266
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,816
- Who's even coming
to this thing on saturday?

267
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,685
- It's all their friends.
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:25,321
- You know? It's--
it's Ben Kennedy and Kathy,

269
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,923
The Greens.
- Phil Green.

270
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:29,025
- Phil Green.
We don't like Phil Green.

271
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,693
What the fuck?

272
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:34,730
We said why don't we just get
some pizza and some beers

273
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,532
and we'll shoot the shit
with your friends?

274
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,200
- That's a great idea.
- Exactly.

275
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:39,669
- But no.
- Mm-mm.

276
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:43,406
- She wants to make deviled eggs
and 40 fucking desserts.

277
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,676
She bought phyllo dough.

278
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:47,543
- Phyllo dough.

279
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,378
- Whoa.
- Exactly.

280
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,380
- Phe-llo dough.
- Phyllo dough?

281
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:54,550
- Phyllo dough, phe-llo dough.
- Phe-llo dough.

282
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,619
- I don't know.
Which is it?

283
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,821
- Phyllo.
- Phyllo, phe-llo?

284
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,290
- I like phe-llo.
- I like phe-llo, too.

285
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:03,359
You're right.

286
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,998
- I think I'm gonna go out,
guys.

287
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,467
- With Katie?
- Yeah.

288
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,905
- Hmm. Hey, remember when Katie
used to make you dress like her?

289
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,774
Courtney didn't believe me.
- Sounds so dehumanizing.

290
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,543
- Seventh grade,
dark times for everyone.

291
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:23,412
- Remember that time
that she made you come home

292
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,748
From the dance and she pretended
to hyperventilate

293
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,451
because she said she saw
her dead grandma?

294
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:30,786
- Yeah, I do remember that,
in fact.

295
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,055
- Remember the time she tried to
attack you with a round brush?

296
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:35,324
We move on.

297
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:36,859
- She sounds fantastic.

298
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,061
- You met her earlier.

299
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:41,597
- Oh. I did not like her.

300
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,200
Mm, mm-mm.

301
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,837
- Barf.
Super gross.

302
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,906
- The worst kind.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:54,377
- So he was married
to this stripper from Reno

304
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,212
Named Sparkler.

305
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,713
She turned out to be
a total bitch,

306
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:00,549
Using him for his money,
cheating on him like crazy.

307
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:03,786
So the guy hires an assassin
to kill his wife.

308
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,256
But on the day it all goes down,
the guy gets killed instead.

309
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,458
Turns out Sparkler
and the assassin

310
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,961
Went to high school together
and were fucking.

311
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,163
- What?

312
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,132
Oh, Dateline, dude.

313
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,267
- Dateline.

314
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,572
So how you likin'
the sunny side?

315
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:26,509
You all into that pilates
and veganism now, yeah?

316
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,377
- Yeah.
- I can read it on your skin.

317
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,679
- Yeah, dude, I wear moccasins
constantly,

318
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,782
you know, when I jog through
Runyon Canyon.

319
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,817
- Oh.

320
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,652
So you're likin' it out there?

321
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:40,456
- Yeah, dude.
It's tight.

322
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,259
- So, like, shouldn't you
be off somewhere

323
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,729
Spooning and popping
your girlfriend's back zits?

324
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,131
- She's going through something
right now.

325
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:51,233
I don't know.
We're not really talking.

326
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,969
Timmy Hartman's having people
over tonight, though.

327
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,038
Think she'll be there?
- I have no fucking clue.

328
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:59,075
- Should probably
make an appearance.

329
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,976
Yeah.

330
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,046
I'm sure everybody's just
holding their breath

331
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,282
Waiting on you to show up.

332
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:07,850
- What? No, I'm in town.

333
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:10,119
People are gonna expect me
to make an appearance,

334
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,088
Show my face.

335
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,291
- Yeah, well, sorry I didn't
have a surprise party waiting,

336
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,659
Mr. El presidente.

337
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,961
- That's okay.
Do you wanna come?

338
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,730
- Nah, I think I'm in
for the night.

339
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:22,765
- Mm.

340
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,775
- Dude, it'd be pretty cool
if I moved in here.

341
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,844
- Get the fuck outta here.

342
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:37,346
My mom isn't gonna let
anybody else move in here.

343
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,249
She keeps jackin' up the rent
just to try to get me out.

344
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,487
Lucky I've been able to pay it,
so fuck her.

345
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:53,562
- You ever think
about California?

346
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,232
- Yeah, went there once
when I was 7.

347
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,767
Didn't love it.
- You were 7.

348
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,804
- Yeah, I know,
and it wasn't the right fit.

349
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:19,088
- I could have said hi
to Heather Zerilli.

350
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,689
She was kind of town royalty

351
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,625
because her dad owned a chain
of sports bars,

352
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:25,961
and her mom,
our only chinese restaurant.

353
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:27,963
Senior year,
her parents split.

354
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,865
Turns out they were cheating
on each other,

355
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:32,501
Her dad with his waitress
and her mom fell in love

356
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:34,703
with their mechanic, Mitch.

357
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,172
Hey, Billy Goat.
- Heather Zerilli

358
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:38,107
just told me she broke up
with Scott Karazewski

359
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,808
and I think I'm gonna wait till
my cut heals to ask her out.

360
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,777
- Oh!
- What do you think?

361
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,413
- Don't do that. Sorry.
Just put it down.

362
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:49,084
- Hey, man.

363
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:50,886
Sorry, I gotta go.
Heather's not responding.

364
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,688
I'm a little concerned.
I'm gonna go to that party.

365
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,890
- All right, man.
Well, hey, have fun

366
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,559
Hangin' out
with the young'uns.

367
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,694
What are you doing
on Thanksgiving?

368
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,096
I don't even know anymore.

369
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,765
- Well, cool, man.
We'll hang out.

370
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,433
Play some b-ball or something.

371
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,868
- Cool.
- How long you in town for

372
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,570
Anyway?
- Sunday afternoon.

373
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,972
- You flew all the way out here
for three days?

374
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,808
- It's five
including travel time.

375
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,578
Peace.

376
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,954
- Oh, my god, I literally
thought you were bailing

377
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:27,156
and had just become, like,
a huge bitch since college.

378
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,258
- Thanks. You smell good.
- I always smell good.

379
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,461
- Hmm. I brought mixers.

380
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:38,234
- Good job.
So is that all you know?

381
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:41,537
- Just that she broke up with
him, according to Billy Goat.

382
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,205
- Missy Deacon
lives on her floor

383
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,708
and says she's shower crying
constantly.

384
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,476
Says she sleeps,
like, 14 hours a day.

385
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,145
- Well, she's clearly depressed.
- Yeah, but it's like

386
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,582
I'm depressed, too,
and I actually have a reason.

387
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:56,218
My roommate
barely speaks english.

388
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:59,121
- I thought she was born here.

389
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,690
- Yeah, but she, like,
talks indian on the phone

390
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,225
All the time with her parents.

391
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:05,995
Not to mention, ben markle
and I have slept in the same bed

392
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:07,963
The last three
lacrosse house parties,

393
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,665
but he won't admit
it's more than a hookup.

394
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,233
I mean, he lives
in the lacrosse house.

395
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,702
It's not a small deal
that I'm sleeping there.

396
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,606
No other freshman
have slept there three times.

397
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,541
He just needs to acknowledge.

398
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:22,144
- I thought you loved
Penn State.

399
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,649
- I mean, I was taught
to be strong.

400
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:32,187
- Katie Krake was way more into
Timmy Hartman's crew than I was.

401
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,924
I started keeping my distance
after this one junior year party

402
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,227
Where we all convinced the only
russian kid in our school

403
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,862
that we were on heroin.

404
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,064
Until he agreed
to also do heroin.

405
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,266
Only we didn't
have any heroin.

406
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,602
It was all just a joke we
thought would be really funny,

407
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,237
but it wasn't.

408
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,473
I still can't look ivan
in the eye.

409
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,798
Ow. Oh, fuck.

410
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:25,774
- Oh, my god!
Oh, you. Hi.

411
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,076
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

412
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,877
- Did you hit your head?
- Yes.

413
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,479
I don't know if it was
on the--the ground or the van.

414
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,681
- Ooh, I don't think it matters.
- I'm okay.

415
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,483
- Do you wanna go
to the hospital?

416
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,085
- You think I need to go
to the hospital?

417
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:37,920
- You may have a concussion.
- You think I have a concussion?

418
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:40,389
- You might.
- Okay. I guess, um...

419
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,157
- Oh, god. Oh.

420
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,927
- Can you take me
to the hospital?

421
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,004
- Here's the deal.

422
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,840
I don't feel drunk,

423
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,175
but I had, like,
three vodka crans in there.

424
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,812
So you could have a concussion
and I could get a dui.

425
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,215
Or you could not have
a concussion,

426
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,751
They tell us we're idiots
for bringing you in,

427
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,986
and--and I still get a dui.

428
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,855
My parents die from shame,

429
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,690
and I lose my scholarship
to CMU over it.

430
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:17,092
You feel so guilty
for ruining my life

431
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,194
that you eventually blow out
your brains in California,

432
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:21,063
and everyone thinks
you did it

433
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:22,398
because you didn't
become famous.

434
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:23,999
- Okay, that got dark fast.

435
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,735
I obviously don't want you
to get a dui, poopdick.

436
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,237
- This one's totally
up to you.

437
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,205
I can also put you in a cab
to the hospital

438
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,708
you can tell 'em
it was a hit-and-run.

439
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,276
I'm not a bad person.

440
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,744
And I will tell you
that I got a concussion

441
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,846
When I was 8 years old
in gym class,

442
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,715
and all they did at the er
was send me home

443
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,050
and tell my parents
to keep me up all night

444
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,019
so I didn't slip into a coma.

445
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:48,090
Let me do some research
so I'm "a" not drunk driving,

446
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:50,526
and "b" helping you,
which are two things

447
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,262
that a good person would do.
- Sounds good. Do it.

448
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:57,666
Okay. It says that your pupils
dilate if they're concussed.

449
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:00,836
- Are they?

450
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,442
How was Hartman's?

451
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:09,878
- Eh, video games.
- Yeah.

452
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,249
- Did you really come back here
for just four days?

453
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,985
Why is that so hard to believe?

454
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:20,055
My roommate flew back
to Tel Aviv for the holiday.

455
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,523
- Hmm.

456
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:24,293
Do they even celebrate
Thanksgiving in Israel?

457
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,330
- Hey.
- Hi.

458
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:35,037
- What's up?
- Nothin'.

459
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,306
What's up with you?

460
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,975
- Why do you have to say it
like that?

461
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:41,577
- Say it like what?

462
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,345
- "What's up with you?"

463
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:45,080
- I don't know. I'm just
really surprised to be getting

464
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,882
All these "need weed"
text messages from you.

465
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:49,284
I seen you smoke,
i don't know,

466
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:51,887
Maybe zero times.

467
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,255
I don't even have your number.

468
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,424
- Yeah, I know.
I find that so weird.

469
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,359
- It's not that weird.
You're Scott's girlfriend.

470
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,862
- Yeah, I see you
all the time.

471
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:01,763
- Yeah,
you're Scott's girlfriend.

472
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,866
- Right, so not in your phone.

473
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,335
You don't think we're friends.

474
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,838
- Scott was just here.

475
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,242
- Okay.

476
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,778
- Okay.

477
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,014
So we're not gonna
talk about Scott?

478
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,451
- Not unless you want to.

479
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:24,820
- Yeah, prefer not to.

480
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:27,089
- Great.

481
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:30,926
So are you gonna sell me
some weed or not?

482
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:36,966
Okay, so here's the deal.

483
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,435
We're gonna smoke
a little pinner in here now

484
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:42,738
Under my supervision,
'cause I'm actually, like,

485
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:45,474
A little bit worried
about you.

486
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,243
- If I see you
inhale your shit,

487
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,412
I'll give you another little bit
to take home.

488
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:52,614
Sound like a fair deal?
- Are we talkin'

489
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:54,750
Or are we smokin'?

490
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:56,986
- We're smokin'.

491
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:01,790
- No, no, no. We went
to whipple's dam with dante.

492
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,158
- What?

493
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,693
- Katie and Heather
came in another car.

494
00:22:04,726 --> 00:22:06,528
That's why they missed
the magic hailstorm.

495
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,131
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice.
- I remember it so clearly,

496
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:11,733
because I was hanging out
with you guys without Katie,

497
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,368
Which, like, never happened.

498
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,337
- Yeah, you guys were a 2-headed
monster in high school.

499
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,840
You know what? I could swear
when we were in seventh grade

500
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,076
and she broke up with me,
i could swear

501
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,912
it was you on the phone.

502
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:26,515
Doing her dirty work.

503
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:29,418
- I can neither confirm nor deny
that fact.

504
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:32,621
- Hmm, that was some
fucked up shit, poopdick.

505
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:35,857
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

506
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,993
Yeah.

507
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:39,394
- She just really
didn't want to do it,

508
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,930
and she thought our voices
sounded the same.

509
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,465
- I knew it!
Yep, aw!

510
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,667
I can't believe,
finally admitting it, poopdick.

511
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,436
- I'm really sorry.

512
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:49,371
Actually, it was one of
the meanest things I've done.

513
00:22:49,404 --> 00:22:50,839
Honestly, I think
i was just excited

514
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:52,441
To talk to you on the phone.
- God,

515
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:55,110
I can't believe I was right.
- I'm really sorry.

516
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,045
But you called me poopdick
for three years

517
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,380
because of one oral presentation

518
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,681
Where I mispronounced
"poop deck."

519
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,049
I think we're even.

520
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:04,486
- I always thought
you kinda liked it.

521
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:09,291
So you were excited
to talk to me on the phone, hmm?

522
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,426
- Uh, what are
you talking about?

523
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,495
- You said you were excited
to talk to me on the phone

524
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,030
in seventh grade.
- I said that?

525
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:16,498
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't say that.

526
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,167
- You liked me in seventh grade,
didn't you?

527
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,103
I mean, you had a little
girl boner for me,

528
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:22,771
Didn't you, poopdick?
Mm-hmm.

529
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,142
- Hmm.

530
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:30,379
- So there's this
whole group of girls

531
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:33,115
From high school, you know,
like Kyleigh Dececcho

532
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:36,952
and Lindsay Beegle
and Lauren von dam Hagen,

533
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:39,354
and they all go to Penn State
with me, right?

534
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:43,058
So as a group,
they decided to major

535
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:46,862
in recreation
and parks management

536
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:49,631
because they heard
it was easy.

537
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,300
Like, I'm just figuring out
what a scam it is.

538
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,636
- Why do you think I'm here?

539
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,239
All you really need are books
if you wanna learn shit.

540
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:58,473
- Yeah, I know, right?

541
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:01,610
Meanwhile,
I'm majoring in english.

542
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:04,246
I'm gonna be worse off
than the park management girls.

543
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,982
Like, are there gonna be
that many parks

544
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,984
for them to manage
when they graduate?

545
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:11,820
What are they gonna manage,
playgrounds?

546
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,889
Who am I kidding?

547
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,324
We're all gonna be unemployed.

548
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:20,062
College just feels like
some big,

549
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:24,266
Pre-unemployment,
binge-drinking,

550
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,503
Like, party vacation.
- I hear ya, sister.

551
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,374
Did you hear about
north dakota?

552
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:35,744
- What about north dakota?

553
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:37,779
- It has oil, tons of jobs.

554
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:39,915
You can make, like,
half a million a year there.

555
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:41,717
But you gotta live
in your car

556
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,019
'Cause there's not enough houses
yet where the oil is.

557
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:47,489
- Yeah? You thinkin' about it?

558
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:51,326
You gonna go ride the rails
with your high school buddies?

559
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,628
Shh.

560
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,598
- My friends will never leave
this town.

561
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,433
Figured i'd hitchhike
up there

562
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,602
and just move into
somebody else's car.

563
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:04,539
I don't mind blowing a trucker
to get shit done.

564
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:07,876
- Yeah, I totally pushed a kid
off the swings once

565
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,379
To get an erection.

566
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:16,084
- There's so much I don't
understand about that joke.

567
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:21,223
- Oh, god.

568
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:24,693
I am not an optimist.

569
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:27,963
- Me neither.

570
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,998
Scott is.

571
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:45,380
- You asleep?

572
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,850
- No.
But the smell of that stuff

573
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:50,852
that you're putting
on your fingernails

574
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:54,122
Might cause the brain damage
you're trying to avoid.

575
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:57,593
- Just don't fall asleep.
- Okay.

576
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:03,799
You seem good.

577
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:06,501
I didn't see you
that much last year.

578
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:07,769
- Yeah.

579
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:10,772
Senior year was weird for me.

580
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:13,108
It felt like the credits
were rolling the whole time.

581
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:15,710
Or like somebody
turned on the lights

582
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:18,747
At a party.

583
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,916
- You weren't actually there
that much, it felt like.

584
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:22,684
Is that right?
- Yeah.

585
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:24,753
I abused that
"learning enrichment" program

586
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,788
that lubisher had
for the ap kids--

587
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:30,458
Claimed to take, like, three
community college classes

588
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,394
but really I was home
watching the view

589
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,029
and eating golden grahams.
- Oh.

590
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:36,598
Brilliant.
- Hmm.

591
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,402
- I loved senior year.

592
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,671
- Senior year loved you.

593
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:46,274
Pretty sure the entire school
had a crush on you,

594
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,977
Especially todd,
the assistant principal.

595
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,114
- Hey, todd and I did some
really great work together.

596
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:55,851
- Okay.
Let me see your pupils.

597
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,720
My blood alcohol level's
probably okay,

598
00:26:58,753 --> 00:27:00,222
so we're good to go.

599
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,500
- Then we should go.

600
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:32,554
- Oh, I forgot how awesome
dry humping is.

601
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:34,790
- Yeah.

602
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:49,471
- Did you just?

603
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:51,273
- Yeah.

604
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:55,410
- I'm so proud of myself.

605
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:03,318
What?

606
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,021
- Nothing.

607
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:08,357
- Okay.

608
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,015
- Holy shit.

609
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,451
Karazewski.

610
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,788
- Hey.

611
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,158
Hey!

612
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:45,927
Karazewski.

613
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,229
Oh, my god.

614
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,633
- I'm in a coma.

615
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,402
- Fuck you!

616
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:57,339
I'm in a coma, be quiet.

617
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:59,441
Ow.

618
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:02,844
- Hey, don't piss
on my fuckin' lawn!

619
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,612
Get the fuck out!

620
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:06,348
- Yeah.

621
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:08,350
- Hey!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:11,353
- This is not a public urinal!
- I'm going.

623
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:13,822
I'm on--I'm on the street.

624
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,426
- No, give me five seconds
to get done, please!

625
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,696
- This is not
a public urinal.

626
00:29:24,232 --> 00:29:25,834
- Drive, drive, drive, drive.

627
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,203
Drive, drive, drive.

628
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:35,310
- Oh, hey, trish.
- Oh, hey. How you doin', donny?

629
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:49,958
- Well, that was interesting.
- Thank you so--

630
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:53,962
Hope my parents
didn't call the cops.

631
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:57,665
- The same.
Oh, wait. I'm an orphan.

632
00:29:57,698 --> 00:29:59,701
- Uh...

633
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,371
- Uh, so I guess
i'll see you around.

634
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,040
- Okay. Okay.

635
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:08,676
Sure. I'll have to make sure
we're facebook friends

636
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:11,046
since you won't
be around much...

637
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,881
- Hmm.
- Anymore.

638
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:15,050
- Okay. Okay.

639
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,618
- Okay.
- Here.

640
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,920
Oh.

641
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:20,789
Okay. Oh, sorry.

642
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:23,325
- Okay, bye. I'll see ya.
- Sorry. Bye.

643
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:08,403
- Oh, poopdick.

644
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,705
Oh, poopdick, poopdick.

645
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:20,048
- Mm. Meesh.

646
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:27,255
Mush, what's goin' on?

647
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:29,924
- I'm on a journey, meesh.

648
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,793
When I started this,

649
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:35,663
I was determined to use
those perfectly good pumpkins.

650
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:38,733
I boiled them up,
added a bunch of stuff,

651
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,468
but I just couldn't
get the taste right.

652
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,303
So what do I do?

653
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,038
I go to the source.
I call dad.

654
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,107
Turns out, you were right,
meesh.

655
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,543
Canned pumpkins, totally where
it's at for dad's pies.

656
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,044
It's the only way to do this.

657
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,080
So I go to the store and I grab
some canned pumpkins

658
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:54,048
and I add 'em
to the real pumpkins.

659
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,950
Only problem is, I gotta go
back to the store

660
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,719
'Cause the goddamn
real pumpkins,

661
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,621
They're still takin' over
flavor-wise.

662
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:02,557
Meanwhile, my filling
is--is growing to a volume

663
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,827
Where it's clear I'm eventually
gonna need more piecrusts.

664
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,329
But not until
my batter's perfected.

665
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,798
I'm close, meesh.

666
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:13,134
I'm on prototype six
right now.

667
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,604
Really looking forward to when
i hit actual production stage.

668
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,840
- Mm, what's this bad boy like?

669
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:21,376
- Prototype three?
I don't think so.

670
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,278
It's basically dirt.

671
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:25,046
Have some patience, meesh,
please.

672
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,982
You're gonna wait till
it's ready, just like dad's.

673
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,951
Oh, my hands.

674
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,186
You got a cloth?

675
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,254
- You locked the oven.
You locked the oven.

676
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,758
- Well, my 'ove' gloves are all
fucking full of filling.

677
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,896
This could be the one, meesh.
- Sweet.

678
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:44,332
So what are we gonna do
for Thanksgiving dinner?

679
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:45,967
- I don't know, man,

680
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,803
but this oven's dance card
is full.

681
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,839
- Okay.

682
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:53,908
- Meesh, what happened
to your eye?

683
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:57,145
- It's a story for christmas.

684
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:59,447
- You should really do
some packing today.

685
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,917
- Okay.
- It's not bad.

686
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:18,700
- Mom!

687
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,669
I'm sleeping.
- What's new?

688
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,671
This is my house, too,
girlfriend,

689
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:27,008
and you need to get up
and scrub some potatoes.

690
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,443
Mitch is here.

691
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,445
I can't find it!

692
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:32,881
Mitch!
Mitch!

693
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,760
- Everybody cool?

694
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:48,630
I just need to get my box
from the closet.

695
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:52,834
- He needs his box
from the closet!

696
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,837
- The dang thing's right here,
pooh bear!

697
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,672
- Oh.

698
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:11,386
- Good morning.

699
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,489
- Oh, look who decided
to grace us with her presence.

700
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,391
- Want a martini, coma baby?

701
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:18,493
We ran out of vermouth, though.

702
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:21,029
- It's pretty much
just a glass of warm vodka.

703
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:24,032
- Look, you're not going out
tonight, t-baby. You got it?

704
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:25,833
We're playing
trivial pursuit.

705
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:28,036
- That's fine.
I don't wanna go out.

706
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,371
That's, like,
a lot of food.

707
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,140
- You hear this? She's
complaining because we feed her.

708
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,709
Must be nice.
- It must be nice, I tell ya.

709
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,311
- Mm.
- Mm.

710
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:39,580
You, too?

711
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,783
- How was last night?

712
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:43,918
- It was fine.

713
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,821
- Cool. I told mom I heard you
come in around midnight.

714
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,490
Oh, thank you.

715
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:57,031
- "Police spend five hours
chasing Florida men

716
00:34:57,064 --> 00:35:00,001
in canoe."
- that's good.

717
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,103
"Florida man demands money

718
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:05,073
While slapping woman in face
with penis."

719
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:09,577
- "Florida man drops pants,

720
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,947
Asks cop to stick finger
in his ass."

721
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,185
- Uh-oh.

722
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:18,519
This is the one.

723
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:20,054
"Florida man fights cops

724
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,990
"While also trying to perform
exorcism on son

725
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:25,426
After meth makes him
abnormally strong."

726
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,532
- We're gonna be Florida men.

727
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,802
- I know.

728
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:38,072
Come on.
Let's go eat our feelings.

729
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:39,974
- Do it.

730
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,029
- I'm thankful for my, uh,

731
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:06,000
My sense of right and wrong.

732
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:09,771
- I'm thankful for
my soon-to-be sister-in-law.

733
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:15,276
- I'm thankful for
all this amazing food.

734
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,678
Thanks, mom.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

735
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,883
I'm thankful for all of you.

736
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:25,253
And I'm thankful for
forgiveness.

737
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:26,654
And, um,

738
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:30,057
New beginnings.

739
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,894
I'm sorry.

740
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,662
- I'm sorry, guys.

741
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,431
This is between us.

742
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:40,468
Our group therapist told us
to experiment in the bedroom.

743
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:44,072
Things got a little intense.

744
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:48,242
- Just eat.

745
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,511
- How about some stuffing?
- Perfect.

746
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,114
- I don't know why you're making
such a big deal about this, dad.

747
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,982
Look, lots of people
don't go to college.

748
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,984
The smartest people I know
just go straight to work.

749
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:58,920
It doesn't mean that I'm gonna
be successful

750
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,188
If I get my degree.

751
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,889
It's just a way
to be in debt

752
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,691
for the rest of your life.
- In what?

753
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:04,992
In debt till you die?

754
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:06,694
I'm paying
for your college, okay?

755
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,095
And you're going to college.
This is not up for discussion.

756
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,498
What's the problem here?
Sorry.

757
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,600
- Yeah, that sounds like
a really great idea in theory.

758
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,168
But I have no fucking clue

759
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,103
What I wanna do
with the rest of my life.

760
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:18,239
- That's exactly
what you figure out in college.

761
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,977
Hmm. Sorry.

762
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,646
- You know, I still regret

763
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,216
Not finishing
my hypnotherapy degree.

764
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:34,121
- Look, I can come home.
I can work at champs.

765
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:37,091
I'll just figure out
a better plan while I'm here.

766
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:39,861
- No, you cannot move home.
No, you cannot work for champs.

767
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,863
I did not bust my ass
my entire life

768
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,331
just to get you an education

769
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:45,132
so you can come home
and work at champs.

770
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,034
You're going back to school.

771
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:49,036
You gonna come home now
and throw your whole life away

772
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:50,638
'Cause you miss mommy?
You miss your bed?

773
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:53,241
What is it?
What's the problem here?

774
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,376
- Kenny!

775
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,079
What's wrong with champs?

776
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:01,616
Sorry.

777
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,851
Y'all, I love restaurants.

778
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:05,553
No, I'm serious.

779
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:07,522
I love restaurants,
and this food, straight up,

780
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,892
is restaurant quality.
That is not an exaggeration.

781
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:12,560
Y'all know about turkey,
though, right?

782
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:17,031
Y'all gonna be tired,
tired, tired.

783
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:19,500
- You guys remember that kid
Bobby Lancaster?

784
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,702
Worst behaved, most horniest
fuckin' kid ever?

785
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:22,904
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

786
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:24,839
- He had sex with a nun
in eighth grade.

787
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,241
- No, but he did punch a nun
in the face and call her a nazi.

788
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:28,709
- Oh, did he?

789
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:30,978
- I wish i'd put myself
out there more in middle school.

790
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,380
Like, in eighth grade,
Kim Garvey...

791
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,549
- Kim Garvey.
- She invited me over

792
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,717
To watch tv,
but, like, the week before

793
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,720
I had heard that she put
a whole bottle of hand lotion

794
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,856
Up her hoo-ha.
I didn't go.

795
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,691
- So...
- I thought it was mouthwash.

796
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,660
- Whatever it was,
it was, like, a girthy bottle.

797
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:47,695
I felt emasculated.

798
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:50,331
- Bobby Lancaster used to spit
in Lisa Meekins' mouth

799
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:52,567
Every day after lunch, and she--
and she fuckin' loved it.

800
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,502
- I bet she did.
- Well, because they were

801
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:56,404
Making out, right?
- No, it was, like, a thing.

802
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:58,472
He used to gather us all up
and be like, "guys, watch this."

803
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,309
And he would spit
right in her fuckin' mouth.

804
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,224
So it wasn't all just

805
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:19,026
Human feces anymore,
it was changed.

806
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,597
- So two weeks ago,
I'm at the jiffy lube

807
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,931
Getting my oil changed

808
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:25,800
and I run into Bobby Lancaster.

809
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,169
And it turns out he's
the nicest guy in the world.

810
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:31,072
Gave me a bunch of gum,
so sweet.

811
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:33,341
Told me he was sorry
for all the stuff that happened

812
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:35,142
in middle school.
He was driving a beamer.

813
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,877
Apparently he owns the largest
landscaping company

814
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,145
in all of pennsyltucky.
- What?

815
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,914
- Total success story.

816
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:42,817
- Thought a guy like that would,
i don't know, end up in jail.

817
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,052
- Yeah, or on, like,
a reality show.

818
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:46,954
- Well, you gotta think
at some point

819
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:48,623
He looked at himself
in the mirror and said,

820
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:51,058
you know, "i don't wanna just be
the toughest, coolest dude

821
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:53,728
in middle school.
I want more."

822
00:39:53,761 --> 00:39:55,796
- That's guy's got it all.

823
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:01,202
- Yeah, so my mom just texted
from her shift at the hospital.

824
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,304
Apparently there's been
a pipe burst in my basement.

825
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:04,605
So I gotta go.
- Oh, nasty.

826
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,340
- Oh, man, pipe burst.

827
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,442
- Think we could, uh...
- Yeah.

828
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,311
- Split it
as a consolation prize?

829
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,079
- All right, dude.
- All right, i'll see ya.

830
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:14,048
Have fun.
- I'll take that.

831
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,933
- So where to, miss Daisy?

832
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:36,470
- I don't even know.
I just had to get outta there.

833
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,873
I hope I'm not ruining
your Thanksgiving or anything.

834
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:41,409
It's just that I figured your
mom's normally working today

835
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:45,613
so I thought if you...
- Got you.

836
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:48,649
- You know, even though
we're not friends,

837
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:51,485
I knew that personal detail
about your life.

838
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,422
- Right.

839
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:55,990
- Right.

840
00:40:58,392 --> 00:41:00,594
- Still don't know
where you want to go?

841
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,596
- No.

842
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:05,399
- I think
I've got an idea.

843
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:07,968
- Great idea.
Yeah, i'll try that.

844
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:10,504
No, no, no, I did that.
I did that.

845
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:13,240
No, no, no,
i wasn't talking to you.

846
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:15,042
Yeah, he's good.

847
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:22,383
- No, I can do that today.

848
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:28,856
That's a good idea.
Yeah, i'll try that.

849
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,225
No, no, no, I did that.
I did that.

850
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:33,761
No, no, no,
i wasn't talking to you.

851
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:34,929
Yeah. He's good.

852
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:53,481
Yeah, I did.
Yep, preheated, totally.

853
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,516
- Dude, I'm outta here.
- Did you pack up?

854
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:57,251
- Yeah.
- I'm moments away

855
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,887
From production here.
Get excited.

856
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,356
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no,
I'm not talking to you.

857
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,558
So let me ask you, this whole
evaporated milk thing,

858
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:07,061
Do I actually have to worry
about it evaporating?

859
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,672
- Hi. I brought pie.

860
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,475
- Who's out there?
- Nobody.

861
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:24,211
- Well, invite nobody in.
- I brought pumpkin pie.

862
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,914
Hello! Hey! How are ya?
Scott. Nice to meet you.

863
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,716
- Hi.
- Scott. Hi, how are you?

864
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,152
Oh, sorry. Hey. Scott.
Happy Thanksgiving.

865
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:32,586
- Thank you.
- Scott.

866
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,288
Thank you so much
for having me over.

867
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,524
I brought you guys some pie.

868
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:41,629
- Hello?

869
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:44,231
Mr. Mcintyre?

870
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:46,834
- Are we doing something
illegal?

871
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:50,171
- Not at all.

872
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:56,243
Ian's folks are so rich,
they could give two shits.

873
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:58,412
Sometimes he pays me double
just to actually come in

874
00:42:58,445 --> 00:42:59,980
and put the weed
in his sock drawer for him

875
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:02,583
so it's there when he gets home.

876
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:05,219
Spoiled little sophomore
dickwad.

877
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:11,091
Anyway, the whole family's
in boulder skiing

878
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:14,128
for the holiday.
Seems ridiculous.

879
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:17,198
I don't know why you would go
to Colorado for Thanksgiving.

880
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,668
but he always tells me
i can use his pool

881
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,337
If I feel like it, and, well,
i finally feel like it.

882
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,240
- There's a pool?
It's freezing out.

883
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:33,180
Whoa.

884
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:51,131
- What'd you get
on your SATs?

885
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:53,367
- I'm not telling you that.

886
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,370
- You're embarrassed
because it's high.

887
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:58,606
- Please,
what are you getting at?

888
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,876
I'm thinking
about coming home.

889
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,143
- From school?

890
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:06,714
Seriously?

891
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,549
Terrible idea.

892
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:10,818
- You don't go to school.

893
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,189
- Do as I say, not as I do.

894
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:16,757
Okay, mom.

895
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,995
- What? So I have to agree
with everything you say?

896
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:23,330
- No, I just

897
00:44:23,363 --> 00:44:25,332
Thought you would understand.

898
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:27,001
- I do understand.

899
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,169
But I also think it's a terrible
idea to give up an education

900
00:44:29,202 --> 00:44:31,305
that your dad's giving you
as a gift

901
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,674
'Cause he likes you.

902
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,344
Especially for somebody
as smart as you.

903
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:42,183
- Can I have a cigarette?

904
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:46,754
- No.

905
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,026
Can I ask you something?

906
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,896
When's the last time
you changed clothes?

907
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,966
- None of your business.

908
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,168
- That's what I thought.

909
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,037
Anyway...

910
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,738
- Okay, go.
- I've had too much to drink.

911
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:07,474
- Scott! You two are in cahoots,
you know.

912
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,376
- Elvis!
- That was good!

913
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,612
- Kermit! Kermit the frog!
- Oh, wait! Wait!

914
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:13,714
Bobby Brown!
I knew it!

915
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,849
- Bobby Brown?

916
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:18,786
- Cookie monster! Ha ha!
- Cookie monster.

917
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:20,788
Whoa! Whoa.

918
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,590
You're hot! Hot!
- Undefeated.

919
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:25,893
- No, no, no,
it's simple really.

920
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,128
The secret is in creating
mnemonics in the first round

921
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:30,597
that'll last you all the way
to the pantomime round.

922
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,433
- Right.
- I mean, you get princess Leia,

923
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:33,968
for example...
- Yeah.

924
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:36,036
- You gotta get those
hair danishes going right away.

925
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,905
Right away, plump and full,
side of the head.

926
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,907
Nobody will make any mistakes
again.

927
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,475
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

928
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,477
- Yeah, let's go.
I'll be back!

929
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,348
- Where you go?
- Oh, he's so great.

930
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,483
- What is going on here?

931
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,585
You're like a villain
in a kevin costner film.

932
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:53,253
I hit you with my van
and then you show up at my home.

933
00:45:53,286 --> 00:45:55,756
- What? Phil made extra pumpkin
pies, and you told me last night

934
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:58,525
you love pumpkin pie so much,
so I brought a pumpkin pie.

935
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:00,594
- No, I didn't say anything
about pies.

936
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,563
Also, I tried some
when I went to the bathroom

937
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,465
in the second round.
It tastes like envelopes.

938
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:06,100
- Oh, shit.
He warned me about that.

939
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,102
- Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be rude.

940
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:12,673
It's just I'm not good
with family and friends

941
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:18,212
Besides, what about Heather?

942
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:20,080
- It's all right. Heather and i
broke up, like, four months ago.

943
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:23,550
We're totally cool.

944
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,453
Hey,
what are you doing tomorrow?

945
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,122
I was thinking about
having a day.

946
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:29,890
- A day?
- Yeah.

947
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:31,325
Yeah, you know, like a day,
a thing.

948
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,426
You have to come
for your own good.

949
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,194
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

950
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:37,097
Like, I'm concerned for your
well-being if you don't show up.

951
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,766
And I'm kind of
depending on it

952
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,768
Seeing as I've got no car.

953
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,771
- You want me to be your driver?
- No.

954
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,306
- I want to borrow your car.
I can drive.

955
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:48,742
You just have to, you know,
pick me up in the morning

956
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:50,778
and drop me off at night.
- I don't know.

957
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,780
My--my sister's engagement
thing's on saturday.

958
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:55,315
And you can see how attached
my parents are.

959
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:57,551
I'm lucky we don't co-sleep.

960
00:46:57,584 --> 00:47:00,254
- Let me handle them, okay?

961
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,656
One more round and I'm gone.

962
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,526
I swear.

963
00:47:06,726 --> 00:47:09,530
No! Wow, aah!

964
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:11,698
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

965
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:13,267
- One more round.
- All right, let's do it.

966
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,502
- Your turn.

967
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:18,906
- Hey, what are you doing
the rest of break?

968
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:22,510
- Probably gonna eat a kielbasa
and google school shootings.

969
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:29,016
Thanks for the pool.
- You, too.

970
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,836
- Pack your room, meesh!

971
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,005
- Aah!

972
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:04,952
- I'm driving, poopdick.

973
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:15,696
- God, what are you,
like, 5 feet and 3/4?

974
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,298
- So what's this plan?

975
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:21,201
- Oh, I just thought you could
use a field trip day.

976
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:23,370
You know what?
I think you're one of those

977
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,738
Who think life is better
elsewhere,

978
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,306
you know, like one of those
escapee ones

979
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,542
and thus before I am forced

980
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:31,679
To leave
this hallowed ground...

981
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:38,852
I want you to understand
its splendor.

982
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:41,788
I mean, this town birthed
the slinky.

983
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:44,425
And you can't get much more
loveable than that.

984
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:25,299
- You--are you coming?
- Yep, just give me a minute,

985
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,034
Please.
- Come on!

986
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,969
- Just go, and i'll go.
- Come on!

987
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:30,804
- Just go, and i'll go.
Please don't shake the bridge.

988
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:32,739
- What's wrong?
- Please don't shake the bridge.

989
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:34,608
- All right.
This was your idea.

990
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:37,311
- Doesn't mean
you have to throw caution.

991
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,194
- Sup?

992
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,702
- Hey!

993
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:03,637
- Come on.
You're coming to work with me.

994
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,772
I like what you've done
with the place.

995
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:07,241
Come on, we gotta go
before your mom and Mitch

996
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:09,142
Start making love
in the living room.

997
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:10,811
- That's disgusting.
- Seriously.

998
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,480
It's already happening.
We should go.

999
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:22,289
- You just came again,
didn't you?

1000
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:24,458
- Shut up.

1001
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:27,094
- This is fun.

1002
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:29,363
But onwards.

1003
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:30,564
More adventures await.

1004
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:39,539
- Eat it, it's good.

1005
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:46,847
- Just in case.

1006
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,197
- Yes!
Look at that.

1007
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,402
- $7.21 is your change.

1008
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:15,909
- Circle. Yep.

1009
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,546
- They say they want sausage
and pepperoni.

1010
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:20,614
Is that okay?

1011
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:23,450
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1012
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:25,218
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

1013
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,862
- I think you're gonna
really like it.

1014
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:39,566
It's a little bit weird,
but it's beautiful.

1015
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,301
- Is it dangerous?

1016
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:43,837
- It's a little bit dangerous,
but it's beautiful.

1017
00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:51,345
- So what's California like?

1018
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:53,580
- I don't know.

1019
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:58,285
This is gonna sound
really stupid,

1020
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:02,322
but no one out there
returns my high fives.

1021
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:04,224
And it's happened,
like, three times.

1022
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:06,059
- No.
- Yeah.

1023
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:08,195
And it's highly disconcerting.

1024
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:10,630
- California sounds like
it sucks.

1025
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:12,933
- Don't make fun of me.
- Oh, come on.

1026
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,736
If the worse thing you can say
about UCLA

1027
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:17,738
is that no one returns
your high fives,

1028
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,774
I'm guessing it's pretty great.

1029
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:24,444
Then why doesn't it
feel great?

1030
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,947
- I don't know.

1031
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,049
Maybe it takes some time.

1032
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:32,252
First three weeks at cmu
i felt like I was walking around

1033
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:35,089
Doing a weird impersonation
of myself.

1034
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,725
You're homesick, homeboy.

1035
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:44,198
- What?

1036
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,102
- You're right.

1037
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:56,209
You know the worst part?

1038
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:58,245
I used part
of my student loan

1039
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:00,313
To pay for
my plane ticket home.

1040
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:03,784
And god, if my parents find out,
they'll destroy me.

1041
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:05,986
- Wow, you must really love
high fives.

1042
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:12,025
- Hey, thanks for hitting me
with your van.

1043
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,660
- Hmm.

1044
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:18,031
Thanks for bringing me
to this abandoned warehouse

1045
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,300
and not murdering me.

1046
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,669
- Yet.

1047
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:25,406
Yet.

1048
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,787
That's okay.
Hey, it's okay.

1049
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,490
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No.

1050
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:45,459
- I had, like, no boyfriends
in high school,

1051
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:47,294
and I don't really watch porn
because it stresses me out

1052
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,396
About the well-being
of the actors.

1053
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,364
- No, no, no. Hey, don't--
- I don't know what I'm doing.

1054
00:53:51,397 --> 00:53:53,867
- Don't apologize. No, I just
wanna--i wanna kiss you.

1055
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,122
I should get a condom now.
- Yeah.

1056
00:54:16,155 --> 00:54:18,859
Yeah.

1057
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:25,999
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1058
00:54:26,032 --> 00:54:28,535
Maybe we shouldn't.

1059
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:31,238
- We were already doing it.
I was halfway inside you.

1060
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:35,876
- Hmm, wasn't that more of,
like, a just the tip situation?

1061
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,544
- That's very flattering,

1062
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:40,580
but I was halfway inside you.

1063
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:43,917
- Yeah, it's not that it didn't
feel like the best thing ever,

1064
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,253
I just--oh,

1065
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,255
I just know
I'm a supersensitive person,

1066
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,891
and I'm probably gonna turn
psychotically obsessed with you

1067
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,260
If we do it, and then you'll
go back to school in California,

1068
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,495
and your parents
are moving away.

1069
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:57,464
I don't know.

1070
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:01,068
We're probably never
gonna see each other again.

1071
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,543
I'm--I'm sorry.
- No, it's--

1072
00:55:09,576 --> 00:55:12,145
No, it's fine.
I--no, we don't have to do it.

1073
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,648
I don't want to do anything
you don't want to do.

1074
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:16,783
Of course.

1075
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:18,919
It's fine.

1076
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:30,097
- Ready?

1077
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,670
Thanks.

1078
00:55:56,522 --> 00:55:58,224
- Who is it?

1079
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,727
- Katie's having people over.

1080
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,064
I'm worried she might kill me
if I don't go.

1081
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,600
- It could be fun.
- I don't know.

1082
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:09,569
There's, like, this feeling
that she hates me

1083
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:12,372
but also kind of wants to
wear my skin.

1084
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:14,207
- Fine. I mean,
we don't have to go.

1085
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,875
Or you know, whatever--
whatever you want.

1086
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:17,344
We can say our good-byes
whenever.

1087
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:20,380
It really doesn't matter.
It's fine.

1088
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:23,049
- I mean, like,
what do you want to do?

1089
00:56:23,082 --> 00:56:25,185
- Oh, you wanna do something?

1090
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:28,722
- If you wanna go to Katie's,
I'm fine with that.

1091
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:30,757
- Okay.

1092
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,426
Um, I guess we can do that.

1093
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:35,629
- I mean, like,
if you wanna keep hanging.

1094
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:37,597
- I do. No, I do.

1095
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,067
Uh, I think. I was
supposed to hang with Petroff,

1096
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,237
but he's, like, not answering
any texts, so that's weird.

1097
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,340
It's green.
- What?

1098
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:48,541
Oh.

1099
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,011
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

1100
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,146
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

1101
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:55,348
- Only in your hometown

1102
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:57,817
Can walking into a basement
next to someone

1103
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,586
Feel like
the biggest deal ever.

1104
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,488
- It's, like, the second day
i get to Boston

1105
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:03,223
They had this thing called
the freedom rally.

1106
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:04,791
Hey, man,
will you hold it steady?

1107
00:57:04,824 --> 00:57:06,292
- Dude, pump.

1108
00:57:06,325 --> 00:57:08,461
- I had said my good-byes
at senior week.

1109
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:10,664
I had written long messages
in everyone's yearbooks.

1110
00:57:10,697 --> 00:57:13,333
But hanging out now
felt a little like

1111
00:57:13,366 --> 00:57:16,936
Some sort of lame,
very subtle time travel.

1112
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,938
Or like we were all ghosts

1113
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:21,408
Haunting Katie Krake's basement.

1114
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,777
- Okay, let's see
if this works.

1115
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,445
Fuck yes!
Yes!

1116
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:27,914
- Are you taking bong rips
of vodka?

1117
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:29,916
- Yes, we are.

1118
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,084
- I saw this video.
It totally works.

1119
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,255
- Zewsk.

1120
00:57:35,288 --> 00:57:37,157
- That's good, isn't it?
- Yeah!

1121
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,392
Yeah.

1122
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:41,361
- My buddy Josh--it's actually
the guy I live with

1123
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:44,130
Out in Boston,
he grew up in Syracuse.

1124
00:57:44,163 --> 00:57:45,699
He plays lacrosse on
the Boston team and everything.

1125
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:47,000
But he, uh, same weekend--

1126
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,601
Fucked four girls
in one weekend.

1127
00:57:48,634 --> 00:57:49,969
He hit up a freshman,
a sophomore,

1128
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:52,005
A junior and a senior

1129
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:53,940
in high school.
- No, he didn't.

1130
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:56,142
- Dude, he's, like, the shit.
He's so fuckin' tough.

1131
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:57,711
He's, like, my boy, though, man.
I love him.

1132
00:57:57,744 --> 00:57:59,412
- Before or after he locked
tongues with you, though?

1133
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:01,081
- Mm.

1134
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:02,515
- Dude, wait.
What the fuck?

1135
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:04,250
- I have a question
about that guy.

1136
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:08,021
- Come on.
- Fuck off, man.

1137
00:58:08,054 --> 00:58:10,390
Hmm.
- Are they just, like, hanging?

1138
00:58:10,423 --> 00:58:12,092
How did this happen?
It's fucking weird, right?

1139
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,828
- It was a little sudden.
- It's kind of fucked, right?

1140
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:18,431
You think he's, like,
making fun of her?

1141
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:22,202
- I don't think so.
How would he be making--

1142
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:24,471
Hey.

1143
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:26,406
- Hey.
- What's up?

1144
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:28,508
- Move your legs.
What's up, Karazewski?

1145
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:30,410
How's UCLA?
- It's the best. I love it.

1146
00:58:30,443 --> 00:58:33,313
- You should move out there.
- What? Why?

1147
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:36,249
- Because you hate it here,
and now you have a reason to go.

1148
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:39,052
- I don't hate it here.
I love it sometimes.

1149
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:40,820
- Yeah, right.

1150
00:58:40,853 --> 00:58:42,822
She's always trying to get away
for some snobby shit.

1151
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:45,125
You know she applied to Brown
and NYU but didn't get in.

1152
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:46,926
- Hey, thanks
for bringing that up.

1153
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:49,362
- What? I just think it's funny
that you didn't get that far

1154
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:52,031
When you were clearly
trying to get far away.

1155
00:58:52,064 --> 00:58:54,234
Pittsburgh
is basically Altoona,

1156
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:55,802
and actually Altoona
has way better outlets.

1157
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:58,805
William Eugene Petroffski.

1158
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:00,240
- Heather?

1159
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:04,044
Heather. Heather!
Hi, girl.

1160
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:10,283
- Hey, what's up?

1161
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:13,286
- Uh, Heather needed a ride.

1162
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,855
So what happened to you
this morning?

1163
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:18,725
- Uh, nothing. I had to help
Phil move some stuff.

1164
00:59:20,827 --> 00:59:23,230
- Hey.

1165
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:30,303
- Hey, girl.
- Hi!

1166
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:33,340
- You smell weird.

1167
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,443
- Oh!
- Wow!

1168
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:57,931
- So when did you two
start carpooling?

1169
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:00,233
- Dude, she really just
needed a ride, that's all.

1170
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,001
- I'm gonna get a beer.
You want one, Tori?

1171
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:03,670
- Sure.
- Oh!

1172
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:06,472
- Motherfucker.

1173
01:00:06,505 --> 01:00:07,440
- Ha ha!

1174
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:10,910
- Oh, there goes her dad's cds.

1175
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,879
- Are you dating Will Petroff?

1176
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:14,180
- No.

1177
01:00:14,213 --> 01:00:16,482
- You know
he fucked Kara Suey

1178
01:00:16,515 --> 01:00:18,618
in the parking lot
behind the mall

1179
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,086
and then never
talked to her again?

1180
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,754
But, like, do whatever
you wanna do.

1181
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:24,324
Tori, can I talk to you?

1182
01:00:27,526 --> 01:00:29,762
- Katie blew Petroff on the
field trip to Gettysburg, right?

1183
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,264
- That is correct.
- Ninth grade.

1184
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:32,565
- Yeah.
- Back of the bus.

1185
01:00:32,598 --> 01:00:35,902
- Oh, yeah.

1186
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:37,537
- What are we doing?

1187
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,673
- You have been acting like
a totally different person

1188
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:42,642
and it sucks, okay?
It's really shitty.

1189
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:44,911
Like, you're not you anymore.

1190
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:46,946
- I don't know what to say.

1191
01:00:46,979 --> 01:00:48,815
- You don't know what to say?

1192
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:50,583
Wow.

1193
01:00:57,924 --> 01:00:59,626
- Vitamin?

1194
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:01,928
It's candy.

1195
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:03,563
- So I heard you're moving
to Florida.

1196
01:01:03,596 --> 01:01:05,164
My aunt lives in Florida.

1197
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:08,334
- Everyone's aunt
lives in Florida.

1198
01:01:10,403 --> 01:01:12,872
- They all called you thespian
behind your back.

1199
01:01:12,905 --> 01:01:15,708
All of high school.
- I was a thespian.

1200
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:17,644
I was in thespian club.

1201
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:19,612
- What, did you, like,
suck Scott's dick this weekend

1202
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:21,514
and now you think
you're hot shit?

1203
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:23,383
For your information,
my mom and dad

1204
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:25,451
Were totally like,
"where is Tori?

1205
01:01:25,484 --> 01:01:27,120
Why isn't Tori around?"
They miss you.

1206
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:29,088
And you know my mom is sick.

1207
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:31,257
- She had
elective knee surgery.

1208
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,693
- My uncle owns a pizza shop
in Tampa.

1209
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:37,764
Give him, like, 20 bucks, he'll
give you a brand new pizza.

1210
01:01:37,797 --> 01:01:40,600
- Yeah,
that's how pizza shops work.

1211
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:42,769
- I guess I thought
we were best friends.

1212
01:01:42,802 --> 01:01:44,837
I guess I thought
that meant something,

1213
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:48,341
but apparently you're too busy
blowing my ex-boyfriend

1214
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:50,476
To care about anyone
but yourself.

1215
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:52,645
- You dated in seventh grade.

1216
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:54,080
- It's not that long ago.

1217
01:01:54,113 --> 01:01:56,049
- Yes, it is!

1218
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,501
- What the fuck, man?

1219
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,239
- No!
- I'm gonna go.

1220
01:02:20,272 --> 01:02:21,774
Katie, look, I'm sorry.

1221
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:25,278
I just don't think we have
a lot in common anymore.

1222
01:02:25,311 --> 01:02:27,580
I'm gonna go!
- No.

1223
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:29,082
- What the fuck's goin' on
with you, man?

1224
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:30,483
- Nothin', I just really wish

1225
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:32,185
I would've played some ball
with you, dude.

1226
01:02:32,218 --> 01:02:33,987
- You need
to chill the fuck out.

1227
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,389
- Oh!
- Zewsk! Zewsk!

1228
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:37,790
- And you know what?

1229
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,326
Maybe I do like
Scott Karazewski.

1230
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:42,362
Deal with it!

1231
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:52,405
Um...

1232
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,275
- Come on, stop it!

1233
01:02:56,308 --> 01:02:58,945
- Whoa!

1234
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:01,347
- Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1235
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,950
Hey. Hey.

1236
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:05,685
- Whoa!

1237
01:03:05,718 --> 01:03:08,855
- Get off me.
Get the fuck off me!

1238
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:12,091
My fuckin' druggie best friend
is fucking the love of my life.

1239
01:03:12,124 --> 01:03:13,960
- There's fuckin'
nothin' between us, man.

1240
01:03:13,993 --> 01:03:16,662
- I don't even live here anyway.
Why would I come back?

1241
01:03:16,695 --> 01:03:18,998
Okay, I'm never
comin' back here.

1242
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:21,868
So fuck it, and fuck you!

1243
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:23,870
And fuck you.

1244
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:11,951
- I think we should break up.

1245
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:14,821
- Just got me so confused,
Heather.

1246
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:16,956
This is comin' outta nowhere.
- It isn't.

1247
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:18,591
- Heather, I know you.

1248
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:21,327
You just--
you need to take a walk,

1249
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,397
Or you need to think about this,
i want you to take a shower.

1250
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,998
- Fuck you.

1251
01:04:26,031 --> 01:04:27,967
- Or maybe a round
of drunk frozen golf

1252
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,570
Or maybe a floor bed
and some movies.

1253
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:32,338
We--we can find harper
and get him so drunk

1254
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:33,706
that he sings that song again.

1255
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:36,275
- Scott, your parents
are moving.

1256
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:38,911
I don't know why you refuse
to talk about this.

1257
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:40,880
- That's--that's not
totally for sure.

1258
01:04:40,913 --> 01:04:43,082
- Tim reyes told me
they're already gone.

1259
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:45,017
- Well, that's not true.
That's not even true.

1260
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:49,088
- Scott, look, we go to schools
on opposite coasts.

1261
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:51,491
We're probably never gonna
see each other again.

1262
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:53,392
- Don't say that!
- It's true.

1263
01:04:53,425 --> 01:04:57,430
I'm sorry, maybe at a wedding
in, like, eight years,

1264
01:04:57,463 --> 01:04:59,532
but probably not, Scott.
- Oh, my.

1265
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:02,235
- I'm just realizing that

1266
01:05:02,268 --> 01:05:05,138
Things change
and things end

1267
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:07,206
and things die.

1268
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:10,710
I'm gonna die,
and you're gonna die and...

1269
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,947
We're either just gonna
rot away slowly

1270
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,084
Or elect to get burnt
into dust.

1271
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:22,421
I don't know if anything happens
after you die,

1272
01:05:22,454 --> 01:05:24,056
but if it does,

1273
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:27,293
you're probably
not gonna be Scott,

1274
01:05:27,326 --> 01:05:30,463
and I won't be Heather.

1275
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:32,932
Scott, listen.

1276
01:05:34,633 --> 01:05:36,702
Unless we force it,
there's no natural way

1277
01:05:36,735 --> 01:05:40,640
Our lives are gonna intersect
after these five days.

1278
01:05:40,673 --> 01:05:43,709
Right now, this weekend,

1279
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:45,811
I would rather not
spend my time

1280
01:05:45,844 --> 01:05:48,514
Reliving some sad, creepy
puppet show

1281
01:05:48,547 --> 01:05:50,717
Of our greatest hits.

1282
01:07:03,455 --> 01:07:05,891
- I got the mix ratio right,
meesh.

1283
01:07:05,924 --> 01:07:08,261
We're on our way now.

1284
01:07:08,294 --> 01:07:10,263
This is the homestretch.

1285
01:07:10,296 --> 01:07:12,431
Four more pies in the oven,
last rotation.

1286
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:15,368
I did it.

1287
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:16,902
Yeah, you know,

1288
01:07:16,935 --> 01:07:19,171
Something happened to me
making these pies, meesh.

1289
01:07:19,204 --> 01:07:22,375
- You got higher

1290
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:25,144
Than any human
has ever gotten?

1291
01:07:25,177 --> 01:07:27,013
- No.

1292
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:29,181
I realized

1293
01:07:29,214 --> 01:07:31,117
I wanna be a dad.

1294
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:34,320
I really, really
wanna be a father.

1295
01:07:34,353 --> 01:07:36,990
- Come here.

1296
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:41,727
Come here.
- Come on.

1297
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,696
- Come here.

1298
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:46,699
I know you do.
I know.

1299
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,701
- I'm so glad you came home
this weekend.

1300
01:07:48,734 --> 01:07:50,636
I couldn't have done this
without you, man.

1301
01:07:50,669 --> 01:07:52,205
- I'm really glad
I'm here, too.

1302
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:07,787
Well, that was some
Thanksgivin' dinner, wasn't it?

1303
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,323
You know I did that, right?

1304
01:08:10,356 --> 01:08:11,791
Dropped outta college.

1305
01:08:11,824 --> 01:08:13,125
Right after my first semester.

1306
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:14,994
I had to get the hell
outta tallahassee.

1307
01:08:15,027 --> 01:08:17,330
Whole thing
didn't feel right.

1308
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:20,666
- Really?

1309
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:23,002
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1310
01:08:23,035 --> 01:08:25,204
And let me tell you
about the next four years.

1311
01:08:25,237 --> 01:08:28,240
I spent some of that time
in jail

1312
01:08:28,273 --> 01:08:30,743
On account of having stabbed
my step-daddy.

1313
01:08:30,776 --> 01:08:33,612
It was a fairly typical
domestic dispute

1314
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:35,348
Over a hornet's nest.

1315
01:08:35,381 --> 01:08:38,484
- You mean, the situation
was like a hornet's nest?

1316
01:08:38,517 --> 01:08:40,953
- No, no. We was fightin'
over a hornet's nest.

1317
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:43,622
He thought it was his,
and I thought it was mine.

1318
01:08:43,655 --> 01:08:46,992
But I learned so much
in jail.

1319
01:08:47,025 --> 01:08:48,994
And then I went to Hawaii,

1320
01:08:49,027 --> 01:08:52,064
and I got a girl pregnant,
'cause she told me

1321
01:08:52,097 --> 01:08:54,700
that the hot tub was gonna kill
all the sperm.

1322
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,001
Turns out that wasn't true.

1323
01:08:56,034 --> 01:08:57,770
Turned out she wanted
to get pregnant

1324
01:08:57,803 --> 01:09:00,406
'Cause she was in a cult and
she had to give them a child.

1325
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:02,641
Child's still with the cult
for all I know.

1326
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:04,143
I'm--I'm not allowed
to see it.

1327
01:09:04,176 --> 01:09:06,779
Otherwise, I swear to god,
i would be its daddy.

1328
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:09,582
Point is, those are the years
that I would've been in college.

1329
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:12,318
And I learned so much more

1330
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:13,853
just being out in the world,
you know?

1331
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:16,055
And a little bit in jail.

1332
01:09:24,797 --> 01:09:27,266
- Thanks, Mitch.
- Hey, any time.

1333
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:36,108
Hey, you need some clean piss,
you let me know.

1334
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:38,644
I got a guy.

1335
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:59,792
- Hey.
Okay, um,

1336
01:10:59,825 --> 01:11:02,161
so I just--i wanted to say

1337
01:11:02,194 --> 01:11:03,362
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1338
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:04,864
It was--it was stupid.

1339
01:11:04,897 --> 01:11:07,099
I don't know why I felt like
i needed to drink that much.

1340
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:08,834
I said a bunch
of stupid things

1341
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:10,936
I know for a fact
aren't true,

1342
01:11:10,969 --> 01:11:12,771
but the reason
that I'm here

1343
01:11:12,804 --> 01:11:14,573
is because
i feel different.

1344
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:19,044
And I know for a fact that
that's because of you.

1345
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:21,046
I spent the past couple of days
saying good-bye

1346
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,548
To so many things,

1347
01:11:22,581 --> 01:11:25,150
and I'm not ready
to say good-bye to you yet.

1348
01:11:35,627 --> 01:11:37,463
- Thank you

1349
01:11:37,496 --> 01:11:40,900
for saying that,

1350
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:44,036
but I'm sorry.

1351
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:48,274
I just don't think
it's gonna work out.

1352
01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:50,109
I'm just admitting it
to myself.

1353
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:52,878
I'm sorry, Scott.

1354
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:55,748
I'm too weird.

1355
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:57,516
I'm too sensitive.

1356
01:11:57,549 --> 01:12:00,352
I can't really be,
like, physical with you

1357
01:12:00,385 --> 01:12:02,254
When I know that you care
about someone else.

1358
01:12:02,287 --> 01:12:04,590
- No, Tori, if you--
- no, I'm sorry.

1359
01:12:04,623 --> 01:12:06,859
I wish I was different.

1360
01:12:06,892 --> 01:12:09,395
I'm sorry.

1361
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:26,579
- Wow.

1362
01:12:26,612 --> 01:12:28,480
Did you eat?

1363
01:12:28,513 --> 01:12:31,784
- Not a chance. I just ordered
so they'd let us sit here.

1364
01:12:31,817 --> 01:12:34,086
- I followed your lead.

1365
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,761
- I'm gonna miss Phil.

1366
01:12:42,794 --> 01:12:46,499
- He'll always be there
for you.

1367
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,336
- Will he really, though?

1368
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:52,438
I mean, wouldn't that be
kind of weird after a while?

1369
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:54,840
- No.

1370
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:57,643
I don't know. Yes.
I hate this.

1371
01:12:57,676 --> 01:13:00,079
- Yeah.

1372
01:13:19,097 --> 01:13:21,467
- You--you owe me this.

1373
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,669
You know you owe me.
You have to do it.

1374
01:13:23,702 --> 01:13:25,437
Come on, neck face guy.

1375
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,042
Do--do your mom's cousin mark.

1376
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:32,344
Oh, my god.

1377
01:13:32,377 --> 01:13:34,380
All right, give me creepy doll.
You know I want it.

1378
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:37,049
Give me creepy doll.

1379
01:13:37,082 --> 01:13:39,051
Do the--the spanish man.

1380
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:41,086
Okay.
- Español.

1381
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,122
- No. No.
The one you've been doing.

1382
01:13:43,155 --> 01:13:45,591
The one you were doing
the other day.

1383
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:49,294
- That was a voice.
- Yeah, do the voice.

1384
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:51,263
Want me do the voice?

1385
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:53,165
Why not do it for you
all the time?

1386
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,301
I'm gonna miss this.

1387
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:57,903
I'm gonna miss you.

1388
01:13:57,936 --> 01:13:59,271
- Stop.
- What?

1389
01:13:59,304 --> 01:14:01,106
- Can't make it a joke.
Come on.

1390
01:14:01,139 --> 01:14:03,108
You really have to miss me.

1391
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:06,012
- I'll miss you.

1392
01:14:21,193 --> 01:14:23,762
Hey.
- How's it goin'?

1393
01:14:23,795 --> 01:14:25,998
- It's all right,
i guess.

1394
01:14:26,031 --> 01:14:27,533
- Phil called me over
to help out

1395
01:14:27,566 --> 01:14:30,669
since you're all banged up.
Sorry about that.

1396
01:14:30,702 --> 01:14:34,273
- It's all right.
Most of it wasn't you.

1397
01:14:34,306 --> 01:14:36,642
- Good.

1398
01:14:36,675 --> 01:14:38,877
You know nothing happened
between her and i,

1399
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,379
If you're wondering.
- No, I don't wanna know.

1400
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:42,081
- She just needed
something, man.

1401
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:45,050
- Petroff, it's cool.

1402
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,586
- All right.

1403
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:49,488
- Weird break, huh?

1404
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:51,390
- You seen the inside
of your house?

1405
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:53,425
Weird fuckin' weekend.

1406
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,494
- Hey, when you two lovebirds
get a chance,

1407
01:14:55,527 --> 01:14:58,197
There's a few more boxes
in the basement.

1408
01:15:02,768 --> 01:15:04,436
I mean,
i know it's a little different,

1409
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:06,305
'Cause they didn't
really marry for love

1410
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:08,607
They married for convenience.

1411
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,843
- Hey, mom says you have to stop
watching tv.

1412
01:15:10,876 --> 01:15:13,579
- No, she didn't.
- Okay, I'm saying it.

1413
01:15:13,612 --> 01:15:15,581
- Leave me alone.

1414
01:15:15,614 --> 01:15:17,116
- Are you gonna go

1415
01:15:17,149 --> 01:15:19,651
To Phil and Scott's tonight?

1416
01:15:19,684 --> 01:15:22,187
Jen Steinacker called
and told us about it,

1417
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:25,357
Something about pie.
- I love pie.

1418
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,259
- I'm manning your party
tonight, duh.

1419
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:30,896
- Yeah, well, you can make
an early exit. Duh!

1420
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:32,998
I mean, Courtney and i
are probably gonna go after.

1421
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:34,800
- Yeah, totally.

1422
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,302
- Okay, look.

1423
01:15:37,335 --> 01:15:40,038
I'm going to lay something out
on you here.

1424
01:15:40,071 --> 01:15:44,009
We were totally spying
on you and Scott.

1425
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:47,513
You are being
a prude piece of shit.

1426
01:15:47,546 --> 01:15:49,548
Come on, you gotta live
a little.

1427
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:51,917
You can't be all protected
in your blankie.

1428
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,519
- Leave me alone!

1429
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:57,089
- Your vagina is going to
fall off unless you use it.

1430
01:15:57,122 --> 01:16:00,192
- That is not
a nice thing to say!

1431
01:16:00,225 --> 01:16:02,728
- Stop watching tv!

1432
01:16:02,761 --> 01:16:05,131
- No!

1433
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:10,362
- Guys! Guys, if you want
to win in the third round,

1434
01:17:10,395 --> 01:17:12,664
you have to--
you have to do mnemonics.

1435
01:17:12,697 --> 01:17:15,234
With--with your whole body,
like, Abraham Lincoln.

1436
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:17,035
Yeah.
- Who's that?

1437
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:19,104
- Monet!
- A western painter!

1438
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:22,107
A western painter.
- I have no idea.

1439
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,108
- Charlie Chaplin!
- You see?

1440
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:24,843
- Is that time?

1441
01:17:50,902 --> 01:17:52,238
- Tori! Hey!

1442
01:17:55,206 --> 01:17:56,975
Tori, no!

1443
01:17:57,008 --> 01:17:58,277
Hey!

1444
01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:03,916
Ah.
- Ow.

1445
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:06,018
Are you okay?

1446
01:18:08,053 --> 01:18:09,721
Oh, god.

1447
01:18:09,754 --> 01:18:12,791
- Okay, a grating sound
or feeling

1448
01:18:12,824 --> 01:18:15,294
When the nose is touched
or rubbed,

1449
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:17,930
Swelling of the nose,
nose pain...

1450
01:18:17,963 --> 01:18:21,166
- Oh, nose pain, yeah.
- Crooked or bent appearance,

1451
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,137
Okay, it says
that it isn't broken

1452
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,039
If it doesn't look broken.

1453
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:28,974
- Okay.
- And it looks--

1454
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:31,510
It looks good.
- Okay.

1455
01:18:31,543 --> 01:18:33,812
- Oh, you got blood
on your shirt.

1456
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:37,449
- Oh, that's okay.
I still need to do my laundry.

1457
01:18:37,482 --> 01:18:39,351
Why were you running?

1458
01:18:39,384 --> 01:18:42,955
- Didn't want to miss
the free pie.

1459
01:18:44,556 --> 01:18:47,826
- Phil might have pie
for everybody in town.

1460
01:18:47,859 --> 01:18:49,795
Even you, poopdick.

1461
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:09,381
- I'm really gonna miss you,
Scott Karazewski.

1462
01:19:09,414 --> 01:19:11,850
- Well, don't miss me
too much.

1463
01:19:13,418 --> 01:19:15,320
My flight doesn't leave
until 11:40.

1464
01:19:27,732 --> 01:19:31,703
- I want to.

1465
01:19:31,736 --> 01:19:33,572
Do you want to?

1466
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:35,808
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

1467
01:20:14,846 --> 01:20:17,682
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

1468
01:20:17,715 --> 01:20:19,518
- Sorry.

1469
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:23,055
- That's okay.
I owed you one.

1470
01:20:37,335 --> 01:20:39,471
- Oh, thank you.

1471
01:21:30,822 --> 01:21:32,858
- They say
you can't go home again,

1472
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:34,993
and I never really understood
what that meant.

1473
01:21:35,026 --> 01:21:38,597
I mean, yes I can.
I go home all the time.

1474
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:42,534
I do my laundry and run
into people I don't want to,

1475
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:46,371
and it pretty much
always sucks.

1476
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,482
- When I miss something,

1477
01:21:57,515 --> 01:22:00,252
It's usually a certain group
of people

1478
01:22:00,285 --> 01:22:01,887
at a certain time.

1479
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,723
That I know
can never be re-created.

1480
01:22:07,992 --> 01:22:10,395
Summer camp,

1481
01:22:10,428 --> 01:22:12,998
that family trip
with the mugs...

1482
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:18,303
High school.

1483
01:22:19,671 --> 01:22:22,407
- Thanks for letting me
drive you.

1484
01:22:26,544 --> 01:22:29,648
- That time
we broke into the gymnasium,

1485
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:32,984
that time we stayed up
all night,

1486
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:34,953
that time
with the golf cart,

1487
01:22:34,986 --> 01:22:37,989
that time
with the sticky buns.

1488
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:52,070
- John Updike,
who grew up in P.A.

1489
01:22:52,103 --> 01:22:54,606
Now far from Hollidaysburg,
wrote,

1490
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,709
"Each day we wake
slightly altered

1491
01:22:57,742 --> 01:23:00,345
"and the person
we were yesterday is dead.

1492
01:23:00,378 --> 01:23:03,615
"So why be afraid of death,

1493
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:06,651
When death comes all the time?"

1494
01:23:06,684 --> 01:23:08,887
I underlined the shit
out of that quote.

1495
01:23:11,022 --> 01:23:13,525
There's just something nice
about the idea

1496
01:23:13,558 --> 01:23:16,061
of dying every day

1497
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:18,396
and of being born,

1498
01:23:18,429 --> 01:23:20,098
and born,

1499
01:23:20,131 --> 01:23:22,667
and born.
