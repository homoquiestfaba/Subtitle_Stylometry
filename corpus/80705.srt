1
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:38,536
<i>Never thought that</i>
<i>I'd be fighting you</i>

2
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,902
<i>But you stole my heart</i>
<i>You cheated and lied</i>

3
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:49,413
<i>You weren't in my corner</i>
<i>You weren't on my side</i>

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,014
<i>The gloves are off</i>
<i>You hit below the belt</i>

5
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,654
<i>Now it's time-out, baby</i>
<i>And they've rung the bell</i>

6
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,461
<i>I'm not a fighter</i>
<i>I'm a lover</i>

7
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,461
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,635
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,676
- <i>When it's round two, girl</i>
- Turn this up! Now!

10
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,872
- Good.
- <i>I get a knockout punch</i>

11
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,053
<i>With this heartfelt song</i>

12
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,748
<i>I know when I count you</i>
<i>Down from ten</i>

13
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,962
<i>I'll find you</i>
<i>In my loving arms again</i>

14
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:43,800
<i>The gloves are off</i>
<i>You hit below the belt</i>

15
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:49,134
<i>Now it's time-out, baby</i>
<i>And they've rung the bell</i>

16
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,641
<i>I'm not a fighter</i>
<i>I'm a lover</i>

17
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,508
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

18
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,446
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

19
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,404
<i>I'm not a fighter</i>
<i>I'm a lover</i>

20
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,342
<i>But if you run</i>
<i>Then run for cover</i>

21
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,642
<i>Fight for your love</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

22
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,963
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,225
I don't think he's moving.

24
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,940
He is a lazy freeloader,

25
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,774
and it's time for all this
dysfunction to stop.

26
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,177
Can't we just do this later?

27
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,945
I mean, you know how
he gets in the morning.

28
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:12,284
Ned, aren't you tired of letting people
push you around?

29
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,221
Yes.

30
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,624
Then get in there and do it.

31
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,534
What?

32
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,963
What is it?

33
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,334
Dewey, hey,
it's the first of the month, and...

34
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,702
...l'd like your share
of the rent now.

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,639
Man, you know I don't have it.

36
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,439
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!

37
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,707
Sorry.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,180
Dewey, I mean, you owe me
a lot of money as it is.

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,119
Yeah, try $2,200.

40
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:51,457
OK, you guys,
the band is about to hit it bigtime.

41
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:55,122
We'll win Battle of the Bands.
When I'm rolling in Benjamins,

42
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,099
I will throw you and your dog a bone.
Good night.

43
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,035
- Your band has never made 2 cents.
- Patty, come on, I'm on this.

44
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,335
Oh, you're on this?
You're on this?

45
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,068
He's walking all over you.

46
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,804
Mommy, could we please
talk about this later?

47
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,644
No, we can't talk about it later,
because we have to go to work.

48
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,151
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right?

49
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,553
I am an assistant to
the mayor of the city, "hello"!

50
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,320
What? Can you get her out of here,
please? Why? Why her?

51
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,225
And Ned has the most
important job there is.

52
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,194
Temping?

53
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,801
Dewey, a substitute teacher
is not a temp.

54
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,370
- He's a babysitter.
- Think it's so easy?

55
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,337
I'd like to see you try.
You wouldn't last a day.

56
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,601
Dude, I service society
by rocking.

57
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,405
I'm out there liberating people
with my music.

58
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,139
Rocking ain't no
walk in the park, lady.

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,443
All right, this is useless,
all right?

60
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,555
Tell him if he doesn't come up
with the rent by the end of the week,

61
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,985
he's out of here.

62
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,251
Dewey, I'm not paying
your share of the rent, so...

63
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,760
...maybe you should sell
one of your guitars or something.

64
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,364
What?

65
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,194
Would you tell Picasso
to sell his guitars?

66
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,538
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.

67
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,044
Dude, I've been mooching off you
for years,

68
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,476
and it was never a problem until
she showed up. Dump her.

69
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,651
If you don't come up with
some money, she'll dump me.

70
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,445
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.

71
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,214
Come on. I may never have
another girlfriend.

72
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,552
I mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,988
Please.

74
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,323
OK. For you. Not for her, man.
For you.

75
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,528
Thank you.

76
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,597
<i>Heal me</i>

77
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,828
<i>I'm heartsick</i>
D minor.

78
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,203
<i>I'm hungry</i>
<i>And A minor, G, on you</i>

79
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,537
- <i>Heal my heart</i>
- Hey! What's up?

80
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,976
Is that a new song?
Who's this guy?

81
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,413
We're taking the Battle of the Bands
seriously this year.

82
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,246
Good, because I need
the money. Now, listen.

83
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,789
If we're gonna win this thing, we gotta
actually start playing some music.

84
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,584
I agree. You're fired.

85
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,423
Your lyrics, now don't take this
the wrong way, Theo, are lame.

86
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,192
But I've been sitting on some
awesome material, so...

87
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,199
Did you hear what I said?

88
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,701
We voted.

89
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,463
You're out.

90
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,904
This is Spider. He's replacing you.

91
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,873
What's up, dog?

92
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,379
I was gonna tell you last night,
but you passed out, man.

93
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,951
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?

94
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,612
- It's my band. I brought us together.
- Theo wanted you out.

95
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,193
- There's nothing I could do.
- Shut up, man. You voted him out too.

96
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,091
Dewey, listen to me.

97
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,090
You're a good guitar player,

98
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:45,327
but it's the 20-minute solos.
It's the stage dives.

99
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,998
We're trying to land a record deal here,
man, and you're an embarrassment.

100
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,467
Read between the lines, Theo.

101
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,078
Read between the lines!

102
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,079
Dewey, man, I hope
this doesn't come between us.

103
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,081
Like, I care about you, man.

104
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,483
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.

105
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,987
You've been focused
so hard on making it,

106
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,127
you forgot about one thing.
It's called the music.

107
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,922
And I don't even care.
You know what? So what.

108
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,225
I don't wanna hang out with
wannabe corporate sellouts.

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,802
I'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.

110
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,271
And you're gonna be a funny
little footnote on my epic ass.

111
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,583
I feel sorry for you guys.

112
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,858
Yes.

113
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,964
Yeah, it's a 1968 Gibson SG,
mint condish.

114
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,629
No.

115
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,430
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.

116
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,300
No, Hendrix played this guitar.

117
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,271
Hello?

118
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,216
- Yeah?
- <i>Is this Mr. Schneebly?</i>

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,718
No, he's not here.

120
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,619
- <i>Could you take a message for me?</i>
- Yeah.

121
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,885
<i>Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins.</i>

122
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,225
I'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.

123
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,493
One of our teachers broke
her leg this morning,

124
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,967
<i>and all of our subs</i>
<i>are already working.</i>

125
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,268
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep
recommended I call Mr. Schneebly.

126
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,239
Do you know if he's available?

127
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,548
- How long is the gig?
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

128
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,876
How long is the job?

129
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,814
As much as a few weeks,

130
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,352
but we need somebody
to start immediately.

131
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,249
So how much are we talking here?

132
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,023
We pay our substitutes
650 a week.

133
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,392
<i>Now, do you know when</i>
<i>Mr. Schneebly will be back?</i>

134
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,829
Hold on a sec.
Oh, you know what?

135
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,233
I think he's just coming in right...
Ned, phone!

136
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,247
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.

137
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,929
Pat faxed me your résumé.
It's very impressive.

138
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,861
We've never been in a bind like this
before, so thank you so much.

139
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,400
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront?

140
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,935
I don't understand.

141
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,903
It'd be really great
if I could get paid in cash.

142
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,167
Oh, well, we don't do that.

143
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,370
When you cut my check, make it
payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.

144
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,211
You can discuss all of that
with Candace at the end of the day.

145
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,886
When's the end of the day?

146
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,113
We commence at 8:15,
school lets out at 3.

147
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,824
You know what?

148
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,554
Do you think I could cut out a little
early today? I got some stuff I gotta do.

149
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,230
It's cool. I can stay.

150
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,234
Mr. Schneebly...

151
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,965
...this is considered the best
elementary school in the state,

152
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,633
and we maintain that by adhering
to a strict code of conduct,

153
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,312
faculty included.

154
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,811
Don't worry about me.
I'm a hard-ass.

155
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,315
If a kid gets out of line, I got
no problem smacking him.

156
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,150
No, no. We don't use
corporal punishment here.

157
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,791
OK, so just verbal abuse?

158
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,496
If you have any problems with
any students, send them to me.

159
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,892
- I will do the disciplining.
- Check.

160
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,772
Children.

161
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,299
Please take your seats.

162
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,276
I'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.

163
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,745
This is Mr. Schneebly.

164
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,846
Why don't you write
your name on the board.

165
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,152
Yes, I will.

166
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,992
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me "Mr. S".

167
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,201
Mr. S has never taught here
at Horace Green,

168
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,571
so I want you all to be
on your best behavior.

169
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,544
So the curriculum
is on the desk.

170
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,183
- And do you have any questions?
- Yeah, when's lunch?

171
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,248
The children just had their lunch.

172
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,650
Is there anything else you need?

173
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,158
I'm a teacher.
All I need are minds for molding.

174
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,764
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.

175
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,809
OK, who's got food in here?

176
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,743
You're not gonna get in trouble.
I'm hungry.

177
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,053
You. What do you got?

178
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,061
That's what I'm talking about.

179
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,934
OK. Teach. Teach. Teach.

180
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,265
All right, look, here's the deal.

181
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,932
I've got a hangover.
Who knows what that means?

182
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:29,877
- Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
- No. It means I was drunk yesterday.

183
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,483
- It means you're an alcoholic.
- Wrong.

184
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,621
You wouldn't come to work
hung-over unless you were.

185
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,222
Dude, you got a disease.

186
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,656
- What's your name?
- Freddy Jones.

187
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,625
Freddy Jones, shut up.

188
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,292
Shut up.

189
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,358
The point is,
you all can just chill today.

190
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,266
We'll start on
this crapola tomorrow.

191
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,943
- Yes, Tinkerbell?
- Summer.

192
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,342
As class factotum, first I'd like to
just say, welcome to Horace Green.

193
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,244
- Thank you.
- Any questions about our schedule?

194
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,318
Because usually now
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary,

195
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,150
then gives us a pop quiz, then
splits us up into reading groups.

196
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,519
- Track B is...
- OK, hey, hey, hey.

197
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,062
Miss "Dumbum"
ain't your teacher today, I am.

198
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,232
And I got a headache
and the runs.

199
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,491
So I say, time for recess.

200
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,660
But Mr. S, that poster charts
everyone's performance.

201
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,705
We get stars when we master
the material covered.

202
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,673
How do we get gold stars
if we just have recess?

203
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,639
- What are these black dots here?
- Demerits.

204
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,478
What kind of a sick school is this?

205
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,402
As long as I'm here, there will be
no grades or gold stars or demerits.

206
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,836
We're gonna have recess
all the time.

207
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,068
But Miss Dunham only gives us
recess for 15 minutes...

208
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,476
You're not hearing me, girl.
I'm in charge now, OK?

209
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,414
And I say recess.

210
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,886
Go. Play and have fun, now.

211
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,556
Nice.

212
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:24,324
Now, you don't want me to have
to call your parents, do you?

213
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,263
It's all right, Emily, don't cry.
Just try to be a bit more conscientious.

214
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,060
Would you like a hug?

215
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,866
I'll be good, I swear!

216
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,535
All right, well, that's fine, Emily.
You're excused.

217
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,519
Yes, we did it.
We did it, come on.

218
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,426
Give me some. Give me some.
Give me some. Give me some of that.

219
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,597
I will see you cats
on the flip-flop. Later!

220
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,702
I heard she slipped
in the bathroom.

221
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,001
Yes, but we've got
a wonderful new substitute

222
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,144
who comes very
highly recommended.

223
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,509
- Mr. Schneebly? Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah!

224
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,377
Hold on, buddy!

225
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,455
Oh, my God.
You've gotta be kidding me.

226
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,425
Oh, man, this guy sucks, man.

227
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,430
- Here, call him.
- Call him? Yeah, right.

228
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,679
OK. Yes, you can be in my band.

229
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,076
But, Ned, no power plays, man.

230
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,979
I've got vision up the butt,
so just go with it.

231
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,915
No, thanks.

232
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,481
You're not a teacher, Ned.

233
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,387
You're the cross-dressing,
blood-sucking incubus

234
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,891
from Maggot Death.
That's the real you.

235
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,656
Dewey, I'm not a satanic
sex god anymore.

236
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,698
I'm a working stiff.
And that's cool.

237
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,769
- She's got you brainwashed.
- I'm working.

238
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,304
That's terrific.
But who are you, babe?

239
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,236
This is my apartment, babe.

240
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,435
Not if you don't pay your rent,
it's not. Get a job.

241
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,673
I got a job. I'll have rent by the end
of the week. Go tell the mayor.

242
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,319
- You got a job. Doing what?
- I do what Ned does, temping.

243
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,752
I'm not a temp. I'm a sub.
And soon I'll be a certified teacher.

244
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,189
Come on, man!
One show, $20,000 prize,

245
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,331
we split it 60/40. Grab your bass
and come back to the garage.

246
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,864
I mean, don't you miss rocking out?

247
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,333
If you think anyone is gonna
be in a band with you,

248
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,665
you're more delusional
than I thought.

249
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:53,277
Dewey, you know, maybe it's time
to give up those dreams.

250
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,677
I did, and things are going
really great for me.

251
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,563
Are you gonna teach us anything
or are we just gonna sit here?

252
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,039
Just do whatever you want.

253
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,579
- I want to learn from my teacher.
- Besides that.

254
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,712
Freddy, what do you
like to do?

255
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,817
I don't know, burn stuff?

256
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,113
Just go out and have recess.

257
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:42,521
My parents don't spend $15,000
a year for recess.

258
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,763
- You want to learn something?
- Yes, I do.

259
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,933
You want me to teach
you something?

260
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,466
All right, here's a useful lesson
for you.

261
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,332
Give up. Just quit.

262
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,873
Because in this life, you can't win.

263
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,173
Yeah, you can try, but in the end,
you're just gonna lose, bigtime,

264
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,576
because the world is run
by The Man.

265
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,182
- Who?
- The Man.

266
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,977
Oh, you don't know The Man?

267
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,552
Well, he's everywhere.

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,521
In the White House, down the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.

269
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,991
And The Man ruined the ozone,
and he's burning down the Amazon,

270
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,325
and he kidnapped Shamu
and put her in a chlorine tank.

271
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,833
There used to be a way to stick it
to The Man. It was called rock 'n' roll.

272
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,801
But guess what. Oh, no.

273
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,339
The Man ruined that too
with a little thing called MTV!

274
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,610
So don't waste your time

275
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,508
trying to make anything cool
or pure or awesome.

276
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:40,879
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
washed-up loser and crush your soul.

277
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,180
So do yourselves a favor
and just give up!

278
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,254
Mr. Schneebly, it's after 10.

279
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,864
On Tuesdays, the children
have music class now.

280
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,535
Right. OK. Good work, people.

281
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:02,139
We will continue with our lecture
on The Man when we return.

282
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,707
Have a good music class.

283
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,301
Mr. S, what's going on?

284
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,343
I heard you in music class.

285
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,812
You guys can really play.

286
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,577
Why didn't anyone tell me?
You.

287
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,777
- What's your name?
- Zack.

288
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,650
- You play the guitar?
- Yeah.

289
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,518
OK, come here.

290
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,896
- Ever play electric guitar?
- My dad won't let me.

291
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,999
- He thinks it's a waste of time.
- A waste of...?

292
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,130
Try this one.

293
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,070
OK, here's a guitar pick.

294
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,438
You pluck along with me, OK?
If you can.

295
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,837
Yes.

296
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,083
Yes!

297
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,758
OK, you stay right there.
Don't move.

298
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,657
Piano man, front and center.

299
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,160
- What's your name?
- Lawrence.

300
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,598
Lawrence, you ever
played keyboards? Any techno?

301
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,001
- No, I only play piano.
- OK. All right, fair enough.

302
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,973
Try this out for me, OK?
Just give this a try on my count.

303
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,669
One, two, three, four.

304
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,411
Yes.

305
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,385
<i>Come on, come on</i>
<i>Come on, come on</i>

306
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,614
<i>Now touch me, babe</i>

307
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,419
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>That I am not afraid</i>

308
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,830
<i>Lawrence is good at piano</i>

309
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,093
<i>He shall be rocking</i>
<i>In my show</i>

310
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:55,000
Stop. That's perfect. You're perfect.
Stay right there, OK?

311
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,176
You. Could you come up here,
please?

312
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,038
- What was your name?
- Katie.

313
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,941
What was that big thing
you were playing today?

314
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,376
Cello.

315
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,108
This is a bass guitar.
It's exactly the same,

316
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,256
but instead of playing like this, you tip it
on the side, "chello", you've got a bass.

317
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,924
Try it on.

318
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,095
OK, now play this note
right here. That's a G.

319
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,094
OK, but let your fingers
do the rocking.

320
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,460
Keep that G coming all day long.

321
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:24,965
<i>G, G, G, G, G, G</i>

322
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,628
Good. Stop. Are there any drummers
in the house?

323
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,668
- I play percussion.
- You couldn't play anything else.

324
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,971
- Shut up!
- Come here, dude.

325
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,314
Just see if you can do what I do.
Just give it a try.

326
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,158
OK? Give that a try.

327
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,160
OK!

328
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,097
That's really good.
Just stay right here.

329
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,866
All right, OK.
Lawrence, give me a G note.

330
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,039
With the fifth above it.

331
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,441
And the middle one.
No middle one, I changed my mind.

332
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,081
Now go an octave below.

333
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,308
Now give me some rhythm.

334
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,245
And keep that same rhythm. Go.

335
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,650
Katie, remember that note, the G?

336
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:22,725
Play it, but also keep it rocking. Good.

337
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,953
OK, give me like a...
Like a:

338
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,758
That's bad. That's like
<i>George of the Jungle.</i>

339
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,836
Play it up here on the cymbal,
but really light.

340
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,203
Oh, that's it!
OK, keep going with that.

341
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,776
You remember this thing
I taught you a minute ago?

342
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,012
Yes! Yes!

343
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,043
All right, let's go!

344
00:24:55,594 --> 00:25:00,588
Stop. You guys, stop messing around.
We've got a lot of work to do.

345
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,468
OK, people, pay attention, because
I do not want to have to fail you.

346
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,002
I thought you didn't
believe in grades.

347
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:12,365
Of course I believe in grades.
I was testing you. You passed.

348
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,341
Good work, Summer.
Four-and-a-half stars for you.

349
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,881
Now, listen, normal kids
would have been stoked to slack off,

350
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,486
but not you guys, because you're
not normal. You're special.

351
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,952
Because you guys have
the right attitude,

352
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,251
I think it's time we started
our new class project.

353
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,951
- A science project?
- No.

354
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,928
It's called..."Rock Band".

355
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,901
- Is this a school project?
- Yes.

356
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,400
And it's a requirement.

357
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,573
It may sound easy,
but nothing could be harder.

358
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:48,178
It will test your head and your mind
and your brain too.

359
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,940
Will other schools be competing?

360
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,049
You could say that.

361
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,719
You could say that every school
in the state

362
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,116
will be competing for the top prize.

363
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,790
What's the prize?

364
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:05,258
A win will go on your permanent
record. Hello, Harvard, yo.

365
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,156
We're not supposed
to get started until next quarter,

366
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,064
but I think we should get a leg up
on the competition, don't you?

367
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,533
I do.

368
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,606
- Who else wants to go for the gold?
- I do.

369
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,370
All right. But if anyone finds out,
we'll be disqualified.

370
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,572
So let's just keep it
on the down-low, shall we?

371
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,274
- Can we tell our parents?
- No! Trust me.

372
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,715
They don't want to know.
Keep it zipped.

373
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,448
All right, you guys,
let's kick it into overdrive.

374
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,024
What are the rest of us
supposed to do?

375
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,128
You just sit back
and enjoy the magic of rock.

376
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,494
You mean we're not in the band?

377
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,531
Now, hold up now.

378
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,003
Just because you're not in the band
doesn't mean you're not in the band.

379
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,574
We need backup singers.
Who can sing?

380
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:55,975
You, sing.

381
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,309
- <i>The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>
- Yes.

382
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:03,009
<i>Bet your bottom dollar</i>
<i>That tomorrow</i>

383
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:07,624
Stop. You've got it, and I don't
even know what it is, but you've got it.

384
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,193
And that's why you're in the band.
You, sing.

385
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:16,163
<i>Amazing grace</i>

386
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:20,896
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

387
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,700
- <i>That saved...</i>
- Stop, before I start crying.

388
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,105
I found the missing ingredient.
You're in the band.

389
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,746
- I can sing.
- You can?

390
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,916
All right, Summer, belt it.

391
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,951
<i>Memory</i>
<i>All alone in the moonlight...</i>

392
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,781
Stop. Stop. OK.

393
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,219
Good. That's pretty good.
All right.

394
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,724
- I can also play clarinet.
- I'll find something for you.

395
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:48,331
When we get back from lunch, I'll
assign the rest of you killer positions.

396
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,606
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

397
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,330
- There you go.
- Thank you.

398
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,032
You're welcome.

399
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,220
- Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah?

400
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,650
Hey, what's up?

401
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,392
- I don't think I should be in the band.
- Why not?

402
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:19,029
I'm not cool enough.
People in bands are cool. I'm not cool.

403
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,894
Dude, you are cool. The way you play.
Why do you say you're not cool?

404
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,194
Nobody ever talks to me.

405
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,771
Well, those days are over, buddy.

406
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,670
You could be the ugliest sad sack
on the planet,

407
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,244
but if you're in a rocking band,
you're the cat's pajamas.

408
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,212
- You're the bee's knees.
- Bee's knees?

409
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,044
Yeah, the bee's knees.

410
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,652
You'll be the most popular guy
in school.

411
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,447
OK. I'll do it.

412
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:51,185
Now, listen, this is a big commitment.
Don't say yes if you're gonna flake out.

413
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,688
- I won't.
- Larry...

414
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,059
...welcome to my world.

415
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,859
Boom.

416
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,840
Boom, a couple of these.
Now, here.

417
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,808
Now give me a platform.
Let's rock, let's rock today.

418
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,240
Now do it to me.

419
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,109
- Let's rock, let's rock today.
- That's good.

420
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,978
Slap it.

421
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,846
Shoot it.

422
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,783
Kaboot it.

423
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,083
We'll work on that later.
It's a long shake. Get going.

424
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,157
Good knuckle crack.

425
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,569
Lead guitar...

426
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,301
...Zack Attack. Take a seat.

427
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,941
On bass, Posh Spice.

428
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,412
On keyboards, Mr. Cool.

429
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,279
And on drums, Spazzy McGee.

430
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,046
OK, Blondie, Brace Face,

431
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,486
you're singing backup.

432
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:59,824
All right, Tough Guy, Shortstop,
Fancy Pants, get over here.

433
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,521
You're on security detail.

434
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,759
Make sure no one outside
knows what we're doing.

435
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,834
The band's future depends on you.

436
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,872
OK, your first mission:
Soundproofing this room.

437
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,838
Get on it.

438
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,205
Can I be the band stylist instead?

439
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,210
Of course you can, Fancy Pants.

440
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:21,181
OK. Carrot Top, Roadrunner,
Turkey Sub,

441
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,377
we're gonna have
a lot of equipment.

442
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,886
We're talking amps, electric guitars,

443
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,923
maybe even lasers
and smoke machines.

444
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,721
Now, your job is to master
the transportation

445
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,125
and operation of this technology.

446
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,291
Without a first-rate roadie crew,
we'll never have a psychedelic show,

447
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:43,236
and I can't live with that, OK?
I'm counting on you. Get going. Go.

448
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,375
All right.

449
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,568
You three...

450
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,604
...groupies.
And your job is simple.

451
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,483
Just worship the band.

452
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,143
You're gonna be making hats,
you're gonna be making T-shirts,

453
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,086
all kinds of merchandise, which
leads me to your first assignment:

454
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,590
- Naming the band.
- Yes.

455
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,263
All right. Sit down.

456
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:12,528
As for me, I will be singing lead vocal
and shredding guitar.

457
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,729
Wait. Isn't this a student project?

458
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,773
- What's your point?
- Are you supposed to be in the band?

459
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,110
What, you want to get rid of me?
Why, because I'm old?

460
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,216
You hate teachers,
is that what you're about?

461
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,443
OK, well, teachers like to play too.

462
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,589
And not only am I gonna play,
I'm <i>el capitáno</i>,

463
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,953
and what I say goes.
So put your hands over your hearts.

464
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,129
- I pledge allegiance...
- I pledge allegiance...

465
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,733
...to the band...
...to the band...

466
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,496
...of Mr. Schneebly.
...of Mr. Schneebly.

467
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,697
- And will not fight...
- And will not fight...

468
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,242
...for creative control.
...for creative control.

469
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,504
And will defer to him
on all issues

470
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,239
related to the musical direction
of the band.

471
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,051
- And will defer to him...
- Direction...

472
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,587
Let's get rocking!

473
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:27,171
- Morning, Summer.
- Groupie?

474
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,541
- What's the matter?
- You want me to be a groupie?

475
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:34,809
- Groupie is an important job.
- I researched groupies on the Internet.

476
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,249
They're sluts. They sleep
with the band.

477
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,356
No. That's not true.
They're like cheerleaders.

478
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,392
I don't want to be a cheerleader.
Look, my mother is a room parent,

479
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,894
and she's not gonna be happy
when she hears about this.

480
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,466
OK, I didn't want to say this
in front of the other kids,

481
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,160
but I made a special
position just for you.

482
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,306
It's the most important job
of all.

483
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,002
Band manager.

484
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,508
- Band manager?
- Oh, yeah.

485
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,940
What's that?

486
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,842
I'm gonna be busy rocking out,
so it's up to you

487
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,313
to make sure everyone
is doing their job.

488
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,850
Summer, you're in charge
of everything.

489
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,788
- OK.
- OK.

490
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,957
All right, look alive. Listen up.

491
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,688
First thing you do
when you start a band...

492
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,165
Mr. Schneebly, before we start,
shouldn't I first take attendance?

493
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,768
OK, fine.

494
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,709
OK. Now.

495
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,573
- Michelle?
- Here.

496
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,443
- OK. And Marco?
- Here.

497
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,051
OK. Summer. Here.

498
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,415
- Let's see. Tomika?
- We're all here.

499
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:51,687
The first thing you do when you start
a band is talk about your influences.

500
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:55,957
That's how you figure out what kind
of band to be. So who do you like?

501
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,067
- Blondie?
- Christina Aguilera.

502
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,068
Who? No. Come on. What?

503
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,935
- You, Shortstop.
- Puff Daddy.

504
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,442
- Wrong. Billy?
- Liza Minnelli?

505
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,909
What are you...? You guys!

506
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,345
This project is called "Rock Band".

507
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,145
I'm talking about bands that rock.

508
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,549
Led Zeppelin.

509
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,219
Don't tell me you guys
never got the Led out.

510
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,661
Jimmy Page, Robert Plant?

511
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,027
Ring any bells?

512
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,964
What about Sabbath?

513
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,033
AC/DC?

514
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,998
Mötorhead?

515
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,802
Oh, what do they teach
in this place?!

516
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,481
Summer, you're the class whatever,
go to the board.

517
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,944
Factotum.

518
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,476
"Factotor".

519
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,347
New schedule.

520
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:54,218
8:15 to 10, Rock History.

521
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,885
Ten to 11,
Rock Appreciation and Theory.

522
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,497
Then band practice
till the end of the day.

523
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,997
- What about math?
- No. Not important.

524
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,102
- World cultures?
- Not important.

525
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,239
We need to focus.
Don't you wanna win this contest?

526
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,930
It's prestigious.

527
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,533
Question:

528
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,769
How are we being graded
in all this?

529
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,377
Since I'm band manager, and I have
the most responsibility, wouldn't...?

530
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:25,147
Summer, if you grade-grub, I will send
you back to the first grade. You got it?

531
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:29,019
- Back to your seat now.
- Fine.

532
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,993
- What are we gonna play?
- You don't have to worry about that.

533
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,927
We have awesome material,
which I wrote.

534
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,826
Let's hear it.

535
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,872
- What?
- Let's hear your song.

536
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,070
You wanna hear my song?

537
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,433
I'll play you my song,
if you want.

538
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,009
The thing is,
I just want you to keep in mind,

539
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,341
I wrote it in, like, 15 minutes.

540
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:57,116
- It's not done. You might not like...
- Just play the song, Schneebly.

541
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,587
OK, I will sing it for you,
but let me just get in the zone.

542
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,192
I was not planning on unveiling it,

543
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,061
but I will sing it.

544
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,594
Tip of the tongue,
teeth and the lips.

545
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,201
OK.

546
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,807
It starts off...

547
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,001
...a dark stage,

548
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,873
and then a beam of light,

549
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,140
and you can see me
and my guitar.

550
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,781
<i>In the end of time</i>

551
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,255
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>Who knew the road</i>

552
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,420
<i>And the writing</i>
<i>Was written on the stone</i>

553
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,760
And then a thin layer of fog
comes in around my ankles.

554
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,530
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later.

555
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,435
<i>In the ancient time</i>

556
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,110
<i>An artist led the way</i>

557
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:59,841
<i>But no one</i>
<i>Seemed to understand</i>

558
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,848
Chimes, Freddy.

559
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,817
<i>In his heart he knew</i>

560
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,014
<i>The artist must be true</i>

561
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,993
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way past due</i>

562
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,291
And then, Katie, you come in
with the bass.

563
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:25,769
<i>Well, you think you'll be just fine</i>
<i>Without me, but you're mine</i>

564
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,810
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>Kick me out of the band</i>

565
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,380
And then, Zack, you come in
with a face-melter.

566
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,383
OK?
<i>Well, there's just one problem there</i>

567
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,955
<i>The band is mine</i>

568
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,993
<i>How can you kick me out</i>
<i>Of what is mine?</i>

569
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,425
And then...

570
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,100
<i>Hawaii Five-O.</i>
You ever see that show?

571
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,202
OK, well,
there's a drum solo in it that goes:

572
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,696
<i>You're not hardcore</i>

573
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,703
<i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

574
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,172
And I want the backup singers
to be like:

575
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,176
<i>Well, you're not hardcore</i>
<i>No, you're not hardcore</i>

576
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,214
<i>Unless you live hardc</i>...
<i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

577
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,786
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

578
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,548
Boom! Big old explosion.

579
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,249
Some, like, confetti comes down.

580
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,327
That's all I got so far.
It's a work in progress.

581
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,829
I liked it, Mr. Schneebly.
I thought it was really catchy.

582
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,130
Thank you.

583
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,533
Mr. S? We came up
with some names for the band.

584
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,174
- Yeah? Hit me.
- The Bumblebees?

585
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,435
- No, it's sissy.
- The Koala Bears?

586
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,875
What are you talking about?
It's sissy.

587
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,379
I need to speak
with Principal Mullins.

588
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,211
Hey, Miss Mullins. Hello.
How's it going?

589
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,854
- How about "Pig Rectum"?
- Michelle!

590
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,648
It's a science project.

591
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:51,191
Listen, Ros, I was thinking
about organizing a field trip.

592
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,727
- What do you think about that?
- Well...

593
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:57,025
...substitutes, as a rule,
do not organize field trips.

594
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,794
But I figure I'm gonna be here
for a while.

595
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,905
Well, that remains to be seen.

596
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,507
- Have you met our other teachers?
- No.

597
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,146
But the kids could learn
by getting out of the classroom.

598
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,578
It's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.

599
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,184
Parents need to be notified.
It's against school policy.

600
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,288
Mr. S, I have a lot of ideas.

601
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,687
How about everyone in magenta
with beads and sequins?

602
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,521
Billy, I'm talking to Principal Mullins.

603
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,755
- Oh, hi.
- William.

604
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,555
I'll make up some samples.

605
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:34,136
Everyone, this is Ned Schneebly.
He's covering for Gail.

606
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,273
Gabe Green. He teaches second.
Jane Lemmons, fourth.

607
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,772
Bob's our P.E. Teacher.

608
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,376
- Roberta's our librarian.
- How do you do?

609
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,207
- Care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah.

610
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:49,045
- Did I say that correctly? "Schneebly"?
- Actually, it's "Schnayblay".

611
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,153
We were just discussing testing.

612
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:55,223
Which test do you find most effective,
the TASS or the Wilson-Binet?

613
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,618
I say no testing,
and I will tell you why, Joe.

614
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,821
- Gabe.
- Gabe. I believe...

615
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,865
...that the children are the future.

616
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,764
Now, you can teach them well,

617
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,303
but you have gotta let them
lead the way.

618
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,274
Let the children's laughter...

619
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,467
...just remind us
how we used to be.

620
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,541
That's what I decided long ago.

621
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,141
Isn't that a song?

622
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,483
No. I don't think so. No.

623
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,985
- No?
- No, it isn't.

624
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,748
You sure?

625
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:36,798
<i>So you think you'll be just fine</i>
<i>Without me, but you're mine</i>

626
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:41,870
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>Kick me out of the band</i>

627
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,373
<i>Well, there's just one problem there</i>

628
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,444
<i>The band is mine</i>

629
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,708
<i>How can you kick me out</i>
<i>Of what is mine?</i>

630
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,146
Everybody.

631
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,446
- <i>Because you're not hardcore</i>
- <i>No, you're not hardcore</i>

632
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,625
- <i>Unless you live hardcore</i>
- <i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

633
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:06,889
<i>But the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

634
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,065
All right. Good. Stop.

635
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,961
OK, Freddy, that was awesome.

636
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,693
You're rocking,
but it's a little sloppy-joe.

637
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,270
Tighten up the screws, OK?

638
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,637
Zack, dude, what's up
with the stiffness, man?

639
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,336
You're looking a little robotronic.
OK?

640
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,516
Let's grease up the hinges,
and listen,

641
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,550
loosey-goosey, baby,
loosey-goosey.

642
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,382
- I'm playing it the way you told me.
- I know, it's perfect.

643
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,527
But rock is about the passion, man.
Where's the joy?

644
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:41,494
You're lead guitarist. We are
counting on you for style, brother.

645
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,430
So try out this ancient technique.
It's called "power stance".

646
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,002
That's it. You own the universe.

647
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,673
Now give me an E chord.
Just go:

648
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,569
But let me hear:

649
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,679
Yeah, now raise your goblet of rock.
It's a toast to those who rock.

650
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:02,341
Now smile and nod your head
and let me see your eyeballs wide

651
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,714
like there's something wrong.
Yeah!

652
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,822
Do it again. Give me that:

653
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,652
That's what I'm talking about.
OK, let's do it again,

654
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,330
from "You're not hardcore".
One, two, three.

655
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,330
- <i>You're not hardcore</i>
- <i>No, you're not hardcore</i>

656
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,527
- <i>Unless you live hardcore</i>
- <i>Unless you live hardcore</i>

657
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:25,232
<i>And the legend of the rent</i>
<i>Was way hardcore</i>

658
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,933
Yeah! Now we're rocking.

659
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,706
Your homework is to listen
to some real music. Get inspired.

660
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,146
For Blondie, Blondie.

661
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,479
For Lawrence, Yes.
That's the name of the band.

662
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,316
Listen to the keyboard solo
on "Roundabout".

663
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:44,392
It will blow the classical music
out your butt.

664
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,031
OK, for you, Rush, <i>2112</i>.
Neil Peart,

665
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,395
one of the great drummers
of all time. Study up.

666
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,728
- Are we gonna goof off every day?
- We're not goofing off.

667
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,703
We're creating musical fusion.

668
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,035
Are we gonna do that every day?

669
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,610
Yeah. Get used to it.

670
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,374
OK, and for you, Jimi Hendrix,
<i>Axis: Bold As Love</i>.

671
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,952
- Are you psyched about the project?
- Sure.

672
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,589
"Sure"? Hey. Wait. What's up?
Are you...?

673
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,885
You're the lead guitarist
of an unbelievable rock band.

674
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,754
- This is a dream come true for you.
- OK.

675
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,623
All right. I'll see you.

676
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,167
- Mr. S?
- Hey, Tomika, what's up?

677
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:31,507
- I don't want to be a roadie.
- Why not? It's an important job.

678
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,143
All right. Well...

679
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,609
You wanna be security?

680
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,511
I wanna be a singer.

681
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,077
A singer?

682
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,782
OK. Sing me something.

683
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,051
I can't let you be a singer
if you can't sing.

684
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,525
<i>You told me</i>
<i>To leave you alone</i>

685
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:57,861
<i>My papa said,</i>
<i>"Come on home"</i>

686
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,164
<i>My doctor said,</i>
<i>"Take it easy"</i>

687
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,274
<i>But your loving</i>
<i>Is much too strong</i>

688
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,345
<i>I'm welded to your</i>
<i>Chain, chain, chain</i>

689
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:14,081
Oh, my goodness.
Nice pipes, Tomika.

690
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:17,811
Why didn't you raise your hand
when I was looking for singers?

691
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,720
You're in.

692
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:24,019
Welcome aboard. OK, perfect.
Pink Floyd, <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>.

693
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,425
Listen to the vocal solo
on "The Great Gig in the Sky".

694
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,691
All right? All right.

695
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,771
Off to work.

696
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,776
Goodbye.

697
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,319
You can play music
after your homework,

698
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,654
after your chores,
but not until then.

699
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,662
Zack! Zack, do not walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

700
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,766
It's very rude. All right?

701
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,630
Last thing...
Guitar after homework and chores,

702
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,999
and only what Miss Sheinkopf
gives you.

703
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,141
- No more rock music. OK?
- OK.

704
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,367
All right, get to class.

705
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,040
Watch that attitude.

706
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,974
Do you have another blanket?

707
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,981
That's good.

708
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,454
All right. Everybody,
class has begun.

709
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,225
And you know what?

710
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,832
You guys have been doing
real good in here.

711
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,629
If I was gonna give you a grade,
I'd give you an A.

712
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,237
But that's the problem.

713
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,532
Rock ain't about doing things
perfect.

714
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,937
Who can tell me
what it's really about?

715
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,939
Frankie?

716
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,147
- Scoring chicks?
- No. See? No.

717
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,376
- Eleni?
- Getting wasted.

718
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,612
No. Come on. No.

719
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,949
- Leonard.
- Sticking it to The Man?

720
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,626
Yes! But you can't just say it, man.

721
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,193
You gotta feel it
in your blood and guts.

722
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,921
If you wanna rock,
you gotta break the rules.

723
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,591
You gotta get mad at The Man,
and right now I'm The Man.

724
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:16,671
That's right, I'm The Man,
and who's got the guts to tell me off?

725
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,275
- Who's gonna tell me off?
- Shut the hell up, Schneebly!

726
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,277
That's it, Freddy. That's it.

727
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,608
- Who can top him?
- Get out of here, stupid ass.

728
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,785
Yes, Alicia.

729
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:32,078
You're a joke. You're the worst teacher
I've ever had.

730
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,018
Summer, that is great.

731
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,682
- I like the delivery. I felt your anger.
- Thank you.

732
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,363
You're a fat loser,
and you have body odor.

733
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,424
All right. All right.

734
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,262
- Now is everyone nice and pissed off?
- Yeah!

735
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,404
Good. Time to write a rock song.

736
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:52,371
Now, what makes you mad
more than anything in the world?

737
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,040
- Billy?
- You.

738
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,813
We've already told me off.
Let's move on.

739
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,976
- You're tacky, and I hate you.
- OK, you see me after class.

740
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,123
- You. Gordon.
- No allowance.

741
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:13,219
<i>I didn't get no allowance today</i>
<i>So now I'm really ticked off</i>

742
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,124
You know what I mean?
What else makes you mad?

743
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,960
- Michelle?
- Chores.

744
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:23,402
<i>I had to do my chores today</i>
<i>So I am really ticked off</i>

745
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,474
- What else?
- Bullies.

746
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,671
<i>All you bullies get out of my way</i>
<i>Because I am really ticked off</i>

747
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,685
So, what would you say to a bully?

748
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,787
- Zack?
- I don't know.

749
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,719
Now, come on.
If someone was in your grill,

750
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,984
- what would you say?
- I don't know.

751
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,219
If someone was pushing you around,

752
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,489
- what would you say?
- "Step off"?

753
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:53,764
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

754
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,199
Everybody!

755
00:47:55,405 --> 00:48:00,502
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

756
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:06,683
<i>If I do what you say</i>
<i>I might turn into a robot</i>

757
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,819
<i>Do my chore day after day</i>
<i>And they don't want any lip</i>

758
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:17,256
<i>No! So step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off! Step off!</i>

759
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,689
Step off, everybody.

760
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:24,061
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>
<i>Step off! Step off!</i>

761
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:37,805
All right, now that was
a perfectly decent rock song.

762
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:49,386
Oh, yeah. I was this close to getting
a chair on the Polish Philharmonic,

763
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,461
and I nailed the audish,
but I didn't get it. Guess who did.

764
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:57,122
Yo-Yo Ma's cousin, little "nepotis".

765
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,428
Anyway, I just decided to give up
and become a teacher,

766
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,800
because those that can't do, teach.

767
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:08,103
And those that can't teach,
teach gym. Am I right?

768
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:16,413
- I'm just joshing.
- Cute.

769
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,679
- Hey, Mr. Schneebly.
- Hey, Zack.

770
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,357
That was a really cool lesson today.

771
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,820
Well, thanks, dude.

772
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,117
- I'll see you back in class.
- OK.

773
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:58,186
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it!
No, no, no.

774
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,664
I'm just saying, name two
great chick drummers.

775
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,530
Sheila E? Meg White
from the White Stripes?

776
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,433
- She can't drum.
- She's better than you.

777
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,164
At least she has rhythm.

778
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,402
Freddy, where are your sleeves?
And what have you done to your hair?

779
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,743
- It's called punk.
- Well, it's not school uniform.

780
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,183
- Miss Mullins, you're The Man.
- Thank you, Frankie.

781
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,028
Good morning.
Just a reminder:

782
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,826
Parents' Night is coming up,

783
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,629
and I expect everyone
to have a presentation.

784
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,772
What? Hot!

785
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,811
- You OK?
- It's all right.

786
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,247
As you know, it is the most
important event of the year.

787
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,543
The parents scrutinize
our every move,

788
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:40,348
so I find it's best to over-prepare.
Right?

789
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,821
The best defense
is a good offense.

790
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,287
And, Roberta, now that I see you...

791
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:51,360
Hey, is she always like that?

792
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,769
Oh, yeah.

793
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:59,440
Except for the time she got drunk
at the alumni dinner.

794
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,304
You should have seen that.

795
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,971
She got up on the table and did
a Stevie Nicks impersonation.

796
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,242
And she wasn't bad.

797
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,353
Remember, she took up the tablecloth
and whirled around with it?

798
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,683
...that had been
on the turkey tray

799
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,520
that were touched over onto
the peanut-butter-and-jelly tray.

800
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:22,824
Now, I know that you know
that this is a severe problem.

801
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,395
Clear.

802
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,967
Come on. Go, go, go!

803
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,324
All right, you guys.
Is everybody ready?

804
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,961
- Yeah.
- Strap in. Let's do this.

805
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,265
Oh, dude, cool.

806
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,183
Three horns.
That's very clever.

807
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:23,615
<i>In 1492, Columbus</i>
<i>sailed the ocean...?</i>

808
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:27,490
- Blue.
- <i>Blue. That's right.</i>

809
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:33,192
<i>OK. Now, Columbus had three boats.</i>
<i>The</i> Niña<i>, the...?</i>

810
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,704
- <i>Gordon?</i>
- The <i>Pinta</i>.

811
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,703
Pinta<i>, that's right. And...?</i>

812
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,967
- <i>Marco?</i>
- <i>Santa Marina</i>?

813
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,042
<i>The</i> Santa Marina.

814
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,181
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Actually, it's</i> Santa María.

815
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,442
<i>OK. Now, you got...</i>

816
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,246
- <i>Listen. Pay attention, kids.</i>
- She's gone.

817
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,319
<i>I'm not afraid to flunk you.</i>

818
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:54,885
What's up, dude?

819
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,059
Check out these little kids, man.

820
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,421
- Hey, shut up.
- Oh, sorry.

821
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,588
Thought this was Battle of the Bands,
not the Mickey Mouse Club.

822
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,927
- Want a piece of me?
- Look at this.

823
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,400
Freddy! Come on, man.
We gotta focus up.

824
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,334
We gotta nail this audition.

825
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,337
Mr. S?

826
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,368
- What's up?
- I don't think I can sing.

827
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,580
What are you talking about?
Come here.

828
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:29,082
So, Tomika, what's going on?
What do you mean, you can't sing?

829
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,624
I don't feel good. I feel sick.

830
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,622
- Just let Alicia and Marta do it.
- No.

831
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,391
They can't sing like you can.
I need you.

832
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,591
What is it? Are you nervous?

833
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,862
Yeah? Why?
What are you afraid of?

834
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,367
- They're gonna laugh at me.
- Why would they laugh at you?

835
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,512
I don't know. Because I'm fat.

836
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,143
Tomika...

837
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,483
Hey, you've got something
everybody wants.

838
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,381
You've got talent, girl.

839
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,751
You have an incredible voice.
I'm not just saying that.

840
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,984
You heard of Aretha Franklin, right?
OK, she's a big lady.

841
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,790
But when she sings,
she blows people's minds.

842
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,193
Everybody wants to party
with Aretha!

843
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,366
And you know who else
has a weight issue?

844
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,707
- Who?
- Me.

845
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:22,935
But once I get up on-stage, start doing
my thing, people worship me.

846
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,240
Because I'm sexy and chubby, man.

847
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:30,044
- Why aren't you on a diet?
- Because I like to eat.

848
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,481
Is that such a crime?

849
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,054
You know what?
That's not even the point.

850
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,623
The thing is,
you're a rock star now.

851
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,192
All you gotta do
is rock your heart out.

852
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,330
People are gonna dig you, I swear.

853
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:44,830
Let's just show them what we got.
What do you say?

854
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,828
OK.

855
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,495
Thank you.

856
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,564
Let's rock.

857
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:57,304
- OK. We are good to go.
- No, we're not. Freddy took off.

858
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,176
- Where?
- Some guys invited him to their van.

859
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,784
What?! Come on, you guys!

860
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,613
Freddy?

861
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,588
Hey, have you seen a little kid,
like, yay high?

862
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:15,889
Dang it. Freddy,
this is your teacher talking!

863
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,967
- Hey, Mr. S.
- Oh, man.

864
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,605
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. Just chilling.

865
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,174
Freddy, get out of that van
this instant.

866
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,943
See you guys.

867
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,616
You think you're pretty funny,
partying with an innocent little kid?

868
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,013
Dude, we're just chilling.

869
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,815
That kid's 10 years old.
He looks up to you.

870
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:46,428
You are setting an example for him,
so start acting like a responsible adult!

871
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:50,087
That goes for all of you guys.
Don't make me come back here.

872
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,998
Come on. Let's go.

873
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,965
What's the big deal?
You're acting like my mom.

874
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,835
What's the big deal?
You had me worried sick.

875
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,011
I was hanging with real rockers.

876
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,544
They aren't real rockers.
They're posers.

877
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,511
Rock ain't about getting loaded
and being a jerk.

878
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:11,619
Now, this is serious business here.
We've got a mission.

879
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,756
Putting on a great show
is the most important thing.

880
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,825
One great rock show
can change the world.

881
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,053
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

882
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,165
If you ever scare me like that again,
so help me,

883
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,165
I will send a note home
to your parents. Let's go.

884
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,737
All right, you guys.
Just wait here for a minute.

885
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,470
- Hey, man, check this place out.
- Yeah. It's cool.

886
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,908
Hey, what's going on?
Where is everyone?

887
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,811
- Auditions are over.
- What? Who's in charge?

888
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,146
Listen... you can't leave.
You haven't heard our band.

889
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:49,052
- The bill is full. We're overbooked.
- Let us play one song.

890
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,590
We're here. We're ready.

891
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,192
- Who are they?
- My band.

892
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,690
Kids? Is this some kind
of gimmick?

893
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,924
It's not a gimmick.
They're kids, but they're awesome.

894
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:02,070
Thanks for coming down, but you're
really not what we're looking for.

895
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,968
These kids have worked
their fingers to the bone

896
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,940
just to play one song for you,
so sit down, shut up and listen!

897
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,510
Sheila, call security.

898
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,144
Oh, God.

899
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,921
It was just a warm-up.

900
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,717
We'll still compete
against the other schools.

901
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:26,384
What? This is the gig, Summer.
This was our Woodstock.

902
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,826
Then we shouldn't take no
for an answer.

903
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,229
Don't take no for an answer?
He was gonna call the fuzz.

904
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,426
Would you just listen to me?

905
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,803
I have an idea.

906
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:44,309
Hi there. Hi. It's OK. It's cool.
I just wanted to say, I'm really sorry.

907
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,675
I shouldn't have barged in here.

908
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:48,817
It wasn't fair to you or the kids,

909
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,418
especially after what
they've been through.

910
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,523
God, I feel like a jerk. God.
I'm taking them back to the hospital.

911
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,387
- Just wanted to say I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

912
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,622
See, I volunteer down at
St. Margarita's, in the children's wing,

913
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,062
- teaching music.
- Really? That's nice.

914
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,702
- That's very nice.
- Actually, it isn't,

915
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,635
because I totally screwed up.
I told the kids if they practiced,

916
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,742
they'd get into
Battle of the Bands.

917
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,445
- What did you tell them that for?
- I don't know. I just...

918
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:23,312
I wanted to give them something to
look forward to, to keep their spirits up.

919
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,649
Look at them.

920
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,023
They're terminal.

921
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,023
Every last one of them.

922
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,396
- Jeez.
- Yeah, and all they wanted to do

923
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,762
before they bit the dust
was play Battle of the Bands.

924
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,703
What do they all have?

925
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,237
It's a...

926
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:50,310
It's a rare blood disease.
"Stick-it-to-da-man-niosis".

927
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,812
What's that?
I've never heard of it.

928
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:57,009
You're lucky. Because it's hell.

929
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,282
Wow.

930
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,425
- We're on the bill.
- Yes!

931
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,902
Cut it out! You're dying, remember?

932
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,701
Get in the van.

933
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,186
<i>We come from the land</i>
<i>Of the ice and snow</i>

934
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,192
<i>From the midnight sun</i>
<i>Where the hot springs blow</i>

935
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,661
<i>The hammer of the gods</i>

936
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:47,266
Summer, you get an A-plus
and 50 gold stars.

937
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,931
- I didn't do it for the grade.
- Give me some of that.

938
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,506
Yeah! Yeah!

939
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,918
And it was so scary.

940
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,193
Hey, Mr. S?

941
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,529
We have a name for the band.

942
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,297
Hit me.

943
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,539
The School of Rock.

944
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,685
The School of Rock.

945
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:44,955
And we shall teach
rock 'n' roll to the world.

946
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:50,827
<i>There's no way you can stop</i>

947
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:55,830
<i>The School of Rock</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

948
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,839
Stop. We have a red alert.
It's Mullins.

949
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,066
Let's go. Come on.

950
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,607
To your positions.
To your positions!

951
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,976
Come on, come on.

952
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,964
And therefore, E=MC².

953
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,929
Oh, Miss Mullins. Come in.

954
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:29,332
I'm sorry to interrupt, but Miss
Lemmons said she heard music

955
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:33,305
- coming from the classroom.
- Music?

956
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,377
Music. I haven't heard any music.

957
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,346
You know what? Miss Lemmons
must be on crack, right, kids?

958
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,885
Well... Well, what's that?

959
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,826
Oh, that. Yeah.

960
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,897
We were singing. We were singing
and learning.

961
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,897
We were learning in sing-song.

962
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,067
- One of your methods?
- Yeah.

963
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:08,334
I find it's helpful when
you're teaching the subjects

964
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,876
that are the boring subjects.

965
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:19,877
Well, you don't mind if I just sit in
on your class this afternoon, do you?

966
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:22,751
No. No. Come on back
this afternoon.

967
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,086
It is the afternoon. I meant now.

968
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:31,659
So please just continue
with your method.

969
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,136
Yeah. OK.

970
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:55,217
<i>Math is a wonderful thing</i>

971
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,359
<i>Math is a really cool thing</i>

972
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,262
<i>So get off your "ath"</i>
<i>Let's do some math</i>

973
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,833
<i>Math, math, math, math, math</i>

974
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:13,466
- <i>Three minus four is...</i>
- Negative one.

975
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,143
That's right.

976
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:20,605
<i>And six times a billion is...</i>

977
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,943
- Six billion?
- Nailed it.

978
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:30,148
<i>And 54 is 45 more than...</i>
<i>What is the answer, Marta?</i>

979
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:33,760
- Nine.
- <i>No, it's eight</i>

980
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,232
<i>No, it's nine</i>

981
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:45,165
<i>Yes, I was testing you</i>
<i>It's nine</i>

982
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,969
<i>And that's a magic number</i>

983
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:55,145
I'm very happy that you're able
to extend your stay,

984
01:05:55,351 --> 01:06:01,221
but I must say, I find your methods
of teaching very unusual.

985
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:06,020
Well, I did study with
Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.

986
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,895
- Who?
- Oh, you don't know him?

987
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:15,367
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading
leaders in... unusual methods.

988
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:19,701
Actually, he's how I was appointed
to the Presidential Council

989
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,638
for Experimental Educationers.

990
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,472
That sounds very impressive,

991
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,980
but we're not interested
in experimental education here.

992
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:34,546
So if from now on you could just stick
to the curriculum, that would be great.

993
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,191
- Yes. Right.
- Thank you.

994
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,355
Ros?

995
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,557
- Yes?
- Do you know,

996
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:46,701
I would really love to talk some more
about your philosophy on teaching.

997
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,700
Do you think maybe we could
grab some coffee?

998
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,167
You want to go
get some coffee with me?

999
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,198
Yeah. I really would.

1000
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,719
- You're sure you don't have coffee?
- I'm quite sure.

1001
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:11,921
Well, I've never been here before.

1002
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:17,862
I've never been to this side
of town before, in fact.

1003
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,201
So I have been...

1004
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:26,808
Well, I've been... I've been dying
to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.

1005
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,775
- Please, call me "Dewey".
- Dewey?

1006
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,583
Ned. Call me "Ned".

1007
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,550
I was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.

1008
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,590
- Yeah.
- Well, Ned...

1009
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,721
...in your experience,
how does Horace Green compare

1010
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,365
to the other schools
that you've taught at?

1011
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,592
Oh, your school is the best.

1012
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,395
- You're just saying that.
- I'm not.

1013
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,166
You know that kids at other schools
just have fun all the time?

1014
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:04,403
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. It's anarchy.

1015
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:08,413
This is the best school
I have ever teached at. I swear.

1016
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:11,286
I'll drink to that.

1017
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,958
Stay there. I'm gonna put on
some music.

1018
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,926
- I love this song.
- Really?

1019
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,627
- Yes. Stevie Nicks.
- Yeah.

1020
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,367
Stevie!

1021
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,736
You know, she came to town,
and she did a concert,

1022
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:12,607
- and she was just so... wild.
- I know. Oh, man.

1023
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,716
- Oh, my gosh.
- She put on the best show ever.

1024
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,053
She's better live
than she is on the album.

1025
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,315
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, yes.

1026
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,824
- Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
- Yeah.

1027
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,728
You know what?

1028
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:31,157
Oh, man, I would love
to take the kids to a concert.

1029
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,698
- Concert?
- Yeah.

1030
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,767
There's one at the end
of the month.

1031
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:40,499
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart...

1032
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,475
...Enya, that kind of stuff.

1033
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,640
But you have a policy
about field trips.

1034
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:53,084
- Would it be educational?
- Would it be educational?

1035
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,780
It could be very educational.

1036
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,024
- Maybe we can make an exception.
- Yes!

1037
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,255
<i>Sings a song</i>
<i>Sounds like she's singing</i>

1038
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:06,834
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh</i>

1039
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,564
I'm holding you to that.

1040
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,534
Make an exception.

1041
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:16,575
<i>Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh</i>

1042
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,111
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1043
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:29,020
<i>Keeping your head over water</i>
<i>Making a wave when you can</i>

1044
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,388
<i>Temporary layoff</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1045
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,792
<i>Easy credit rip-off</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1046
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,292
<i>Scratching and surviving</i>
<i>Good time</i>

1047
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,527
Would you stop that, please?

1048
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,171
Yeah.

1049
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:50,170
- I had a really nice time.
- Yeah, ditto.

1050
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,239
This is the first time
a teacher has asked me

1051
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:56,782
- to do anything outside of school.
- No way.

1052
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,145
It's... It's true.

1053
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,219
In six years.

1054
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,127
Well, you know,

1055
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:10,321
I think it might be one of those things
where people are intimidated.

1056
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,262
Intimidated?

1057
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,300
- They hate me.
- No. They don't.

1058
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,302
Yes, they do. They sure do.
I can see.

1059
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,407
I wasn't always like this.

1060
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,511
I wasn't always wound this tight.
There was a time when I was fun.

1061
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:27,941
I was funny. I was.

1062
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:34,487
But you can't be funny and be
the principal of a prep school.

1063
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,887
No, you cannot, because
when it comes to their kids,

1064
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,187
these parents,
they have no sense of humor.

1065
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:46,630
If anything goes wrong, it's my head.
It's my head in the smasher.

1066
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:51,135
These parents will come down
on me like a nuclear bomb.

1067
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,503
I can't make a mistake.
I gotta be perfect.

1068
01:11:54,710 --> 01:12:00,979
And that pressure has turned me into
one thing that I never wanted to be.

1069
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,248
<i>A bitch.</i>

1070
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:07,388
- No. You're not.
- Yes, I am. I am a big one.

1071
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:12,457
Well, I don't think so.
I think you're pretty cool.

1072
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,024
Really?

1073
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,227
- No.
- Yeah. You're way cool.

1074
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,264
Really?

1075
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,369
- OK, drums?
- House.

1076
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,635
- Keyboards?
- House.

1077
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:33,042
- Amps? All right. Cable?
- Got them.

1078
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,715
- All right. Guitar?
- Yes.

1079
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,282
- Mr. S.
- Yeah?

1080
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,282
What do you think?

1081
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,451
I don't know. I...

1082
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,154
They might be a little distracting.

1083
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:54,029
It's glitter rock and it's glam
and it's fabulous.

1084
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,970
Billy, it's just not the right style.

1085
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:00,334
You're gonna talk to me
about style?

1086
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,204
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that bow tie.

1087
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,209
Don't talk about my bow tie.

1088
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:09,145
You know what, I give up.
They can just wear their uniforms.

1089
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:13,915
- That's not a bad idea.
- Not a bad idea?

1090
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,683
- I was kidding.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,796
- Hey, hey. What is that?
- What's what?

1092
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,228
- What are you playing?
- Just something I wrote.

1093
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,764
You wrote a song?

1094
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,805
- Well, let's hear it.
- No, it's not that good.

1095
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,234
Come on, I want to hear it,
Kurt Cobain.

1096
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:39,080
- OK, but I'm not much of a singer.
- It's all right.

1097
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,743
<i>Baby, we were making straight A's</i>

1098
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,945
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1099
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,048
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1100
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,320
<i>Feel like I've been hypnotized</i>

1101
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:59,194
Wait. You wrote that?
You wrote that?

1102
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,236
That's it.
Guys, rock 'n' roll positions.

1103
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,305
- What are you doing?
- We're gonna learn your song.

1104
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,907
- But why?
- That's what bands do, man.

1105
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,668
Play each other's songs.
You got lyrics?

1106
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,008
Hook me up.

1107
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,751
No more secret songs.
All right, Lawrence,

1108
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,717
no more reading. Time for rock.

1109
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:23,524
Get on the drum. Bass it up.

1110
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,215
- What was that chord?
- D.

1111
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:27,224
- Play it.
- D...

1112
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:32,093
...C, G, C.

1113
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,998
- <i>Baby, we were making straight A's</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

1114
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:39,197
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1115
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,899
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1116
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,637
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1117
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,874
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1118
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:51,917
<i>Rock is the reason</i>
<i>Rock is the rhyme</i>

1119
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,418
Know what would be better?

1120
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,217
"Rock got no reason,
Rock got no rhyme."

1121
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:02,489
Can we try that? Also, we need
some "ooh la-la's", so like:

1122
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,189
Try that. Can we take
it from the chorus?

1123
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,028
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three.

1124
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,673
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1125
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,934
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1126
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:18,237
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1127
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:24,943
<i>You'd better get me to school on time</i>
<i>And if you wanna be the teacher's pet</i>

1128
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:28,179
<i>Baby, you just better forget it</i>

1129
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,190
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1130
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:36,091
<i>You better get me to school on time</i>

1131
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,869
I'm gonna solo there
if it's cool with you.

1132
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,043
- All right.
- You can solo later.

1133
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:52,441
- OK.
- Let me rock a solo there, I can feel it.

1134
01:16:03,419 --> 01:16:05,751
Tomorrow is the big day,
so get your rest.

1135
01:16:05,955 --> 01:16:09,356
No late parties, drinking tequila
and trying to get lucky.

1136
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:13,718
Chances like this do not
come around every day.

1137
01:16:14,263 --> 01:16:15,890
You've played hard in here,

1138
01:16:16,098 --> 01:16:19,761
and I am proud of every
last stinking one of you.

1139
01:16:20,703 --> 01:16:24,469
Let's just give this everything we got.
We may fall on our faces,

1140
01:16:24,673 --> 01:16:27,699
but if we do,
we will fall with dignity!

1141
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,908
With a guitar in our hands
and rock in our hearts!

1142
01:16:31,113 --> 01:16:33,104
And in the words of AC/DC:

1143
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:37,012
"We roll tonight to the guitar bite,

1144
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:40,620
"and for those about to rock...

1145
01:16:40,823 --> 01:16:42,757
"...I salute you."

1146
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:00,841
Ros, excuse me, wanted to remind
you about our field trip tomorrow.

1147
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:04,672
- What field trip?
- The educational concert.

1148
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,212
Oh, I forgot about that.

1149
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:11,375
I don't know, school policy
is very difficult to get around.

1150
01:17:11,587 --> 01:17:14,147
But you said
we could make an exception,

1151
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:17,257
and the kids are excited
about hearing some Mozart.

1152
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,692
I know, but the preparations,
there's not enough time.

1153
01:17:21,897 --> 01:17:24,365
I don't know anything about it.
Where is it?

1154
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:29,397
I've got it all covered.
What's going on, are you mad at me?

1155
01:17:29,605 --> 01:17:32,802
No, no, Ned. I'm sorry,
I'm just a little stressed out

1156
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:35,033
because it's Parents' Night tonight.

1157
01:17:35,244 --> 01:17:39,977
Hey, it's all gonna be fine.

1158
01:17:43,152 --> 01:17:48,522
Ned, would you mind coming
with me tonight to Parents' Night?

1159
01:17:49,158 --> 01:17:53,424
It wouldn't be a date or anything.
I get nervous around the parents,

1160
01:17:53,629 --> 01:17:57,292
and there's something about you
that makes me feel more relaxed.

1161
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,230
You know what,
that sounds so great, Ros, but...

1162
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:06,030
- But what?
- I wasn't planning on going tonight.

1163
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:10,574
You have to. You're their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.

1164
01:18:10,779 --> 01:18:14,408
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I got you.
I'm ready for that.

1165
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:16,478
So we'll go together?

1166
01:18:16,685 --> 01:18:21,418
OK. Why don't you pick me up at,
say, 6:40.

1167
01:18:21,624 --> 01:18:24,184
- Done. All right.
- OK.

1168
01:18:30,633 --> 01:18:35,798
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I got a hot date.

1169
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:37,828
That's weird.

1170
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,498
I got a check from Horace
Green Prep for $1,200.

1171
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:43,669
I've never worked there.

1172
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:50,040
- What are you doing?
- Calling the school.

1173
01:18:51,453 --> 01:18:53,853
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly...

1174
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,452
Dewey?

1175
01:18:59,662 --> 01:19:01,027
What's going on?

1176
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,063
I told them 15 times,
make it out to cash!

1177
01:19:05,868 --> 01:19:07,267
Dewey?

1178
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:10,038
I did something bad, Ned.

1179
01:19:10,573 --> 01:19:12,404
- No.
- Yeah.

1180
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:16,009
They called for a sub. I said
I was you, to make some money.

1181
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:19,408
But then I got there, and the kids,
they rock, man.

1182
01:19:19,615 --> 01:19:23,574
There's this kid Larry who's like,
"I'm not cool," but now he's like:

1183
01:19:25,454 --> 01:19:27,922
There's this other girl
who can sing like:

1184
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:32,920
She thought she was too fat, so they
were dying, and the principal got drunk.

1185
01:19:33,128 --> 01:19:36,928
Now we're playing Battle of the Bands.
It's the coolest thing!

1186
01:19:37,132 --> 01:19:39,293
One day.
Then I will come clean.

1187
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:43,562
I'll tell everyone it was my fault.
You'll be fine. One day!

1188
01:19:43,772 --> 01:19:46,036
- Ned, home.
- Don't say anything to her.

1189
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:48,766
She'll blow everything. Please?

1190
01:19:52,648 --> 01:19:55,412
Hey. What's going on?

1191
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:59,743
Nothing. I got a hot date,
that's what's going on.

1192
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:04,356
See you later.

1193
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:12,328
What's going on, Ned?

1194
01:20:14,036 --> 01:20:16,698
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Well...

1195
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:35,654
OK, I don't think I can go in there.

1196
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:39,385
- What's wrong?
- Ros...

1197
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:42,454
...l'm not a teacher.

1198
01:20:43,532 --> 01:20:47,093
Oh, Ned. A substitute is a teacher.

1199
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:50,897
No, no. I'm not a teacher.
I'm a fraud.

1200
01:20:51,106 --> 01:20:53,597
No. You're not.

1201
01:20:53,809 --> 01:20:58,610
You're a dedicated, talented teacher,
and those parents are gonna love you.

1202
01:20:58,814 --> 01:21:03,513
Just get in there and tell those parents
what you've been teaching their kids.

1203
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:07,255
Yeah, you know, math, English...

1204
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:13,091
What...? Science... What else?
Geography, history,

1205
01:21:13,295 --> 01:21:16,890
Latin, Spanish, French,

1206
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:21,297
Latin... Math.
Did I say that already?

1207
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:27,339
Anyway, all the stuff you want your
kids to know, it's been covered, OK?

1208
01:21:27,543 --> 01:21:29,340
So...

1209
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,846
...it was great to meet you all,
and drive safe.

1210
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,415
Excuse me.

1211
01:21:36,618 --> 01:21:39,553
Since you started,
all my son talks about is music.

1212
01:21:39,755 --> 01:21:43,851
He says he wants to be a musician.
Is this your influence?

1213
01:21:44,059 --> 01:21:47,256
Why has my daughter become
obsessed with David Geffen?

1214
01:21:47,463 --> 01:21:49,260
And how is this homework?

1215
01:21:49,565 --> 01:21:54,059
OK, see, I would like to tell you about
what we've been doing in here,

1216
01:21:54,269 --> 01:21:58,103
but there's such a thing as
teacher-student confidentiality,

1217
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:01,299
and I don't want to be in breach
of educational law

1218
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:05,537
because I could be dismembered
by the teacher's union.

1219
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:07,042
So...

1220
01:22:07,249 --> 01:22:09,683
You expect us to believe
this garbage?

1221
01:22:10,953 --> 01:22:14,616
Mr. S, don't you think you should
tell them about the project?

1222
01:22:14,823 --> 01:22:17,053
- What project?
- Our class project.

1223
01:22:17,259 --> 01:22:19,420
Every school in the state
is competing.

1224
01:22:19,628 --> 01:22:22,153
- Competing?
- It's not till next quarter,

1225
01:22:22,364 --> 01:22:24,594
but Mr. S wanted us
to get a head start.

1226
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,031
- Well, what's the project, Summer?
- It's prestigious.

1227
01:22:28,237 --> 01:22:30,467
A win will go on our permanent record.

1228
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:35,073
You might as well tell them,
Mr. Schneebly.

1229
01:22:35,277 --> 01:22:40,305
OK, look. I've gotten to know your kids
the past few weeks. They're awesome.

1230
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:44,748
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He's the next Hendrix, and he's 10.

1231
01:22:44,953 --> 01:22:47,080
And Gordon here, he's a genius!

1232
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:51,817
He did a whole professional light show
on his computer in three days. And...

1233
01:22:52,728 --> 01:22:55,026
And Marta here, she's...

1234
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,994
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you know that?

1235
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,636
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And...

1236
01:23:04,406 --> 01:23:08,638
Summer is gonna be the first woman
president of the United States.

1237
01:23:08,844 --> 01:23:11,472
She could run this year.
I would vote for her.

1238
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,481
Look, they're just really cool kids.
If they were mine, I would be so proud.

1239
01:23:16,685 --> 01:23:20,678
And I am proud,
just to even know them. And...

1240
01:23:21,123 --> 01:23:23,853
Sir, can I see you in the hall
for a moment?

1241
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:26,689
Let me just say
a couple more things.

1242
01:23:26,895 --> 01:23:29,227
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1243
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:32,366
Apparently, that man
is not Ned Schneebly.

1244
01:23:32,768 --> 01:23:34,861
- What?
- What?

1245
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:38,164
- This man is Ned Schneebly.
- He's not even a teacher.

1246
01:23:38,373 --> 01:23:42,332
- You called the cops?
- She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.

1247
01:23:42,544 --> 01:23:46,036
- You're apologizing to him?
- Sorry.

1248
01:23:47,616 --> 01:23:49,243
Ned.

1249
01:23:50,786 --> 01:23:53,186
Ned, is this true?

1250
01:23:54,156 --> 01:23:55,418
Who are you?

1251
01:23:57,359 --> 01:23:59,691
My name is Dewey Finn.

1252
01:23:59,895 --> 01:24:05,265
And, no, I'm not a licensed teacher,
but I have been touched by your kids.

1253
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:08,129
And I'm pretty sure I've touched them.

1254
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:16,872
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1255
01:24:32,494 --> 01:24:35,986
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Me either.

1256
01:24:37,366 --> 01:24:39,960
OK. I'm going to bed.

1257
01:24:40,202 --> 01:24:42,363
It's one thing to throw
your life away,

1258
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:45,062
but to put Ned in jeopardy
is selfish.

1259
01:24:45,274 --> 01:24:47,708
You told me to be like Ned
and get a job.

1260
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:51,346
I told you to be like Ned,
I didn't tell you to be Ned.

1261
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:55,380
- You're not gonna apologize?
- You apologize for calling the cops.

1262
01:24:55,584 --> 01:24:58,678
I didn't murder anybody.
I wanted to play a great show.

1263
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:02,323
- I was this close.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1264
01:25:02,524 --> 01:25:06,187
Would you both just cut it out
for one second?

1265
01:25:12,968 --> 01:25:16,233
Look, I'm sorry, dude.
I was desperate.

1266
01:25:16,838 --> 01:25:19,272
It was easy for you to give up music.

1267
01:25:19,474 --> 01:25:23,001
- It ain't easy for me.
- It wasn't easy for me.

1268
01:25:23,245 --> 01:25:24,610
I miss it.

1269
01:25:24,813 --> 01:25:26,906
Well, then why'd you give it up?

1270
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:29,948
Because I couldn't keep
kidding myself anymore.

1271
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:33,121
You can blame it all on bad luck,
but in the end,

1272
01:25:33,322 --> 01:25:35,688
maybe we just weren't that good.

1273
01:25:36,358 --> 01:25:38,724
Sometimes you gotta know
when to quit.

1274
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:41,925
- Right, maybe I suck.
- That's not what I said.

1275
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:45,964
Well, music is my life, man.
What do you want me to do?

1276
01:25:46,868 --> 01:25:50,065
I don't know, but...

1277
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:52,638
...I think it's time you moved out.

1278
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,399
Sorry.

1279
01:26:04,052 --> 01:26:09,149
- So his name wasn't Mr. Schneebly?
- No, it was, like, Dewey something.

1280
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:11,625
What about the project?

1281
01:26:11,827 --> 01:26:14,227
Wake up, Marco,
there was no project.

1282
01:26:14,429 --> 01:26:17,489
He wanted us to play a show
so we could make money.

1283
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,894
I can't believe we weren't graded.

1284
01:26:20,102 --> 01:26:22,969
Why are you bummed?
We had a three-week vacation.

1285
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:26,364
It was a waste of time,
but it was better than school.

1286
01:26:26,575 --> 01:26:30,705
- It was not a waste of time.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

1287
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,573
- You're an idiot.
- Shut up.

1288
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:34,874
- No, you shut up.
- You want to go?

1289
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:38,018
Touch him, I'll shove those sticks
down your throat.

1290
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:42,919
Mr. S was cool. We worked too long
and too hard not to play the show.

1291
01:26:43,358 --> 01:26:45,383
OK, so what are
we supposed to do?

1292
01:26:45,594 --> 01:26:47,960
We get out of here
and play the damn show.

1293
01:26:48,163 --> 01:26:51,360
How could you let our kids
be exposed to this impostor?

1294
01:26:51,566 --> 01:26:55,730
- Do you just let anyone teach here?
- I pay $15,000...

1295
01:26:55,937 --> 01:27:00,237
Let me assure you that nothing
is more important to us

1296
01:27:00,442 --> 01:27:04,572
than for you to feel your children
are in a safe and secure environment.

1297
01:27:17,259 --> 01:27:19,887
- OK, we're all here.
- Where's Mr. Schneebly?

1298
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:23,587
He didn't tell you? He's at home.
We need to pick him up.

1299
01:27:23,799 --> 01:27:25,357
Let's go, hurry.

1300
01:27:31,506 --> 01:27:36,068
Excuse me.
Just one second, please.

1301
01:27:36,278 --> 01:27:39,213
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1302
01:27:39,414 --> 01:27:44,147
- We want some answers, now!
- Just one second!

1303
01:27:59,334 --> 01:28:04,294
Where did they go?
Help! Children?

1304
01:28:06,808 --> 01:28:08,400
Wake up.

1305
01:28:16,485 --> 01:28:20,421
- How'd you guys get in here?
- Front door was open.

1306
01:28:21,356 --> 01:28:22,948
Why aren't you in school?

1307
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:25,683
We did what you said.
We stuck it to The Man.

1308
01:28:25,894 --> 01:28:29,261
Forget about what I told you.
Look, I'm a loser, OK?

1309
01:28:29,498 --> 01:28:33,298
You listen to my advice,
you'll end up like me, with nothing.

1310
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:37,305
Come on, man, quit goofing around.
This is serious business.

1311
01:28:37,506 --> 01:28:40,669
We're on a mission. One great show
can change the world.

1312
01:28:43,545 --> 01:28:45,479
Look out the window.

1313
01:28:52,587 --> 01:28:55,988
- Mr. S! Come down!
- Come on!

1314
01:28:56,191 --> 01:29:00,491
No way. That is so punk rock.

1315
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:07,830
The dining-room table seats 14,
with no inserts...

1316
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:17,838
- What's going on?
- We've got some rocking to do.

1317
01:29:29,891 --> 01:29:31,620
- Yes!
- All right.

1318
01:29:31,826 --> 01:29:34,818
- Hi, Mr. Schneebly.
- How's it going?

1319
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:42,064
You guys, all I can say is,
let's rock.

1320
01:29:44,272 --> 01:29:49,539
One more thing.
I want to say I'm sorry...

1321
01:29:49,744 --> 01:29:52,008
...that I used you guys.

1322
01:29:54,115 --> 01:29:56,049
I'm sorry I lied.

1323
01:29:56,318 --> 01:29:58,946
- It's not cool to lie to your band.
- Come on.

1324
01:29:59,154 --> 01:30:02,248
We'll be late. There's no time
for apologies. Let's go!

1325
01:30:02,457 --> 01:30:04,015
All right. Let's go.

1326
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,822
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the show.

1327
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:10,259
- You want to go?
- Yeah, I want to go.

1328
01:30:10,465 --> 01:30:13,434
- You're serious?
- I don't want to miss this, Patty.

1329
01:30:13,635 --> 01:30:16,729
Unbelievable. After everything
he's done to you?

1330
01:30:16,938 --> 01:30:20,499
That is so typical Ned. When will you
stop being a pushover?

1331
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:24,236
When are you finally gonna start
sticking up for yourself?

1332
01:30:29,284 --> 01:30:31,013
Excuse me.

1333
01:30:32,254 --> 01:30:34,552
Excuse me.

1334
01:30:34,756 --> 01:30:39,489
I've just been informed
that all of your children are missing.

1335
01:30:40,095 --> 01:30:42,620
- So...
- What?

1336
01:31:03,218 --> 01:31:04,742
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

1337
01:31:04,953 --> 01:31:07,285
We're competing.
We're the School of Rock.

1338
01:31:07,489 --> 01:31:10,083
- You and the kids?
- We're the band and crew.

1339
01:31:10,292 --> 01:31:12,385
- You'd better get in here.
- Come on.

1340
01:31:12,594 --> 01:31:15,062
- We're here.
- You're late. You're up next.

1341
01:31:15,263 --> 01:31:18,755
- OK, we'll be ready. Come on.
- Zack, check this out.

1342
01:31:18,967 --> 01:31:24,496
- Whoa, it's awesome.
- <i>Tears I can find on my own</i>

1343
01:31:26,141 --> 01:31:30,737
<i>I'll take you there</i>

1344
01:31:30,945 --> 01:31:32,845
<i>I'll never...</i>

1345
01:31:33,148 --> 01:31:37,710
Don't listen to those hacks. Come on.
Band meeting. Now. Gather round.

1346
01:31:37,919 --> 01:31:40,683
All right. Frankie, how's security?

1347
01:31:40,889 --> 01:31:42,914
- We're set.
- What about the lights?

1348
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:45,684
Light board's up in the balcony.
I'll patch it up.

1349
01:31:45,894 --> 01:31:47,486
Billy, how's beautification?

1350
01:31:47,696 --> 01:31:50,426
- Are you kidding?
- OK, listen up, you guys,

1351
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:53,965
we only have one song to let
these guys know who we are.

1352
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:57,138
- So I think we should play Zack's.
- But why?

1353
01:31:57,339 --> 01:31:59,500
- I mean, really?
- Yes.

1354
01:31:59,808 --> 01:32:02,208
The thing is, you guys,
I ain't that good.

1355
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:06,369
I'm not. I can admit it. But you're 10,
and you're better than me.

1356
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:09,106
Your song rocks harder,
so let's play it.

1357
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:12,081
But you know what?
That's just one guy's opinion.

1358
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:15,415
This ain't my band, it's our band.
We all have a say.

1359
01:32:15,623 --> 01:32:19,559
We haven't practiced that one
as much. I mean, we might not win.

1360
01:32:19,761 --> 01:32:23,891
Hey, we didn't come here to win.
We came here to play one great show.

1361
01:32:24,099 --> 01:32:27,227
And on Zack's song,
you guys really rock.

1362
01:32:28,036 --> 01:32:31,005
You know my vote,
who else is with me?

1363
01:32:31,406 --> 01:32:33,397
All right, let's pray.

1364
01:32:33,608 --> 01:32:38,511
God of rock, thank you
for this chance to kick ass.

1365
01:32:38,713 --> 01:32:41,876
We are your humble servants.
Please give us the power

1366
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:44,711
to blow minds with
our high-voltage rock.

1367
01:32:44,919 --> 01:32:48,286
- In your name, we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

1368
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:51,084
Now let's get out there
and melt some faces!

1369
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:53,453
- Yeah!
- Go get ready.

1370
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:56,858
- You gotta sing it.
- Are you sure? It's your song.

1371
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,429
- Yeah, it's cool, I'm no singer.
- OK, I'll sing it.

1372
01:33:00,869 --> 01:33:02,734
- Yeah?
- What about the lights?

1373
01:33:02,937 --> 01:33:04,962
All the cues are to the other song.

1374
01:33:05,173 --> 01:33:08,609
You're just gonna have to feel it.
You gotta improvise.

1375
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:11,973
You know this song,
I know you can do it.

1376
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,814
- OK.
- Go. Run like the wind!

1377
01:33:15,016 --> 01:33:17,348
- Hey.
- What's this?

1378
01:33:17,552 --> 01:33:21,716
You wanted to go with the uniform,
so put it on. Quick.

1379
01:33:24,626 --> 01:33:30,223
<i>Hear my heartsick, hungry cry</i>

1380
01:33:31,866 --> 01:33:34,198
<i>I'm heartsick</i>

1381
01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:36,666
<i>So heal me</i>

1382
01:33:36,871 --> 01:33:39,203
<i>I'm heartsick</i>

1383
01:33:39,407 --> 01:33:44,902
<i>I'm hungry</i>
<i>Thought I could survive on you</i>

1384
01:33:45,113 --> 01:33:50,107
<i>Hear my heartsick, hungry cry</i>

1385
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,110
- Slow down.
- My son is...

1386
01:33:54,322 --> 01:33:57,257
- Where's your ticket?
- My son's in there, he's 10.

1387
01:33:57,459 --> 01:34:00,155
You're not going in without a ticket.

1388
01:34:00,361 --> 01:34:03,524
- We're not here for the show.
- We have a situation.

1389
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:06,598
I'm Rosalie Mullins.
I'm principal of Horace Green.

1390
01:34:06,801 --> 01:34:08,792
We had a field trip that went awry.

1391
01:34:09,003 --> 01:34:12,097
Some lunatic kidnapped our kids.
Our kids are in there.

1392
01:34:12,307 --> 01:34:15,242
You're breaking my heart.
There's the ticket table.

1393
01:34:15,443 --> 01:34:18,674
- Maybe we should just get tickets.
- Let's get tickets!

1394
01:34:19,047 --> 01:34:20,981
- Excuse me.
- My child's up there.

1395
01:34:21,182 --> 01:34:23,548
Excuse me, please,
our kids are in here.

1396
01:34:23,751 --> 01:34:26,185
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

1397
01:34:26,387 --> 01:34:27,945
- Quit pushing!
- Excuse me.

1398
01:34:28,156 --> 01:34:30,920
- Excuse me.
- Hey, stop it.

1399
01:34:34,262 --> 01:34:37,254
Hey. What's up?

1400
01:34:38,233 --> 01:34:39,461
Come on!

1401
01:34:39,667 --> 01:34:41,191
We're the School of Rock.

1402
01:34:41,402 --> 01:34:45,736
And this song was written
by our own Zack Mooneyham.

1403
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,545
<i>Baby, we was making straight A's</i>

1404
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:30,115
<i>But we were stuck in a dumb daze</i>

1405
01:35:30,318 --> 01:35:34,118
<i>Don't take much</i>
<i>To memorize your lies</i>

1406
01:35:34,322 --> 01:35:36,654
<i>I feel like I've been hypnoticized</i>

1407
01:35:36,858 --> 01:35:40,658
<i>And then that magic man</i>
<i>He come to town</i>

1408
01:35:41,129 --> 01:35:43,597
<i>He done spun my head around</i>

1409
01:35:43,798 --> 01:35:47,393
<i>He said, "Recess is in session</i>
<i>Two and two make five"</i>

1410
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:50,432
<i>And now, baby, oh, I'm alive</i>

1411
01:35:51,139 --> 01:35:54,233
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>I am alive</i>

1412
01:35:54,442 --> 01:35:58,208
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1413
01:35:58,413 --> 01:36:01,576
<i>Well, baby, you just better forget it</i>

1414
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,677
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1415
01:36:05,887 --> 01:36:09,345
<i>You better get me</i>
<i>To school on time</i>

1416
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:10,785
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1417
01:36:10,992 --> 01:36:12,721
<i>Yeah</i>

1418
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:30,634
<i>Oh, you know I was on the honor roll</i>

1419
01:36:30,845 --> 01:36:33,837
<i>Got good grades</i>
<i>Ain't got no soul</i>

1420
01:36:34,415 --> 01:36:37,873
<i>Raise my hand before</i>
<i>I can speak my mind</i>

1421
01:36:38,086 --> 01:36:40,554
<i>I've been biting my tongue</i>
<i>Too many times</i>

1422
01:36:40,755 --> 01:36:44,247
<i>And then that magic man</i>
<i>Took you away</i>

1423
01:36:44,459 --> 01:36:45,790
<i>Do what magic man do</i>

1424
01:36:45,994 --> 01:36:48,224
- <i>Not what magic man say</i>
- Say what?

1425
01:36:48,429 --> 01:36:51,626
<i>Now, can I please have</i>
<i>the attention of the class?</i>

1426
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,769
<i>Today's assignment:</i>

1427
01:36:57,372 --> 01:36:58,600
<i>Kick some ass!</i>

1428
01:36:58,806 --> 01:37:01,900
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1429
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:05,477
<i>Well, baby, you just better forget it</i>

1430
01:37:05,813 --> 01:37:08,941
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1431
01:37:09,617 --> 01:37:12,211
<i>You better get me</i>
<i>To school on time</i>

1432
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,912
<i>And if you wanna be</i>
<i>The teacher's pet</i>

1433
01:37:16,124 --> 01:37:19,582
<i>Well, baby, you just better forget it</i>

1434
01:37:19,794 --> 01:37:23,321
<i>Rock got no reason</i>
<i>Rock got no rhyme</i>

1435
01:37:23,531 --> 01:37:27,433
<i>You better get me</i>
<i>To school on time</i>

1436
01:37:28,002 --> 01:37:29,230
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1437
01:37:36,944 --> 01:37:39,071
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1438
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:55,425
<i>This is my final exam</i>

1439
01:37:56,698 --> 01:37:58,689
<i>Now y'all know who I am</i>

1440
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:02,034
<i>I might not be that perfect son</i>

1441
01:38:02,503 --> 01:38:04,994
<i>But y'all be rocking when I'm done</i>

1442
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:20,952
Your son is very skilled.

1443
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:23,055
Thanks. So's yours.

1444
01:38:44,412 --> 01:38:46,141
Take me back!

1445
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:52,515
All right. Yeah!

1446
01:38:54,555 --> 01:38:55,783
Yeah!

1447
01:39:04,132 --> 01:39:05,793
Let's go!

1448
01:39:11,672 --> 01:39:12,969
School of Rock!

1449
01:39:17,578 --> 01:39:20,513
To get in, you gotta be
in a band or have a pass.

1450
01:39:20,715 --> 01:39:23,047
I am principal of the school's band.

1451
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:24,878
- Oh, right on.
- All right?

1452
01:39:25,086 --> 01:39:28,180
All right? All right? All right?

1453
01:39:28,523 --> 01:39:32,721
That was incredible!
That was incredible.

1454
01:39:32,927 --> 01:39:37,261
Oh, my gosh, the lights
and the guitar solos...

1455
01:39:37,465 --> 01:39:40,059
- Was it really you playing?
- You're not mad?

1456
01:39:40,268 --> 01:39:42,702
Mad? I'm furious!

1457
01:39:42,904 --> 01:39:46,169
I'm horrified, but it was incredible.
It was so great.

1458
01:39:46,374 --> 01:39:49,775
You guys were so great,
I can't believe it.

1459
01:39:49,977 --> 01:39:53,469
Dude! You did it, man!
Those lights were awesome!

1460
01:39:53,681 --> 01:39:55,273
They were awesome.

1461
01:39:55,483 --> 01:39:57,314
- They're incredible.
- Amazing.

1462
01:39:57,518 --> 01:39:59,383
- Who's the manager?
- I am.

1463
01:39:59,587 --> 01:40:02,488
Summer Hathaway. Nice to meet you.

1464
01:40:02,757 --> 01:40:04,281
Nice to meet you.

1465
01:40:04,492 --> 01:40:06,221
Hey, wait. Come here, guys.

1466
01:40:06,427 --> 01:40:08,657
- You guys rock. How old are you?
- Ten.

1467
01:40:08,863 --> 01:40:11,388
Ten? No way, dude.
How long you been playing?

1468
01:40:11,599 --> 01:40:14,693
Three years. I used to play classical,
now I play rock.

1469
01:40:14,902 --> 01:40:16,836
Hey, you in a band?

1470
01:40:17,939 --> 01:40:20,464
No. No.

1471
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:25,907
No, I am the principal of a school.

1472
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,511
Yeah? Wow, that's cool.

1473
01:40:29,717 --> 01:40:32,117
- That's cool.
- Yes, yes, it is.

1474
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,550
It's very... It's very cool.

1475
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:37,417
- Yeah. It is cool.
- Yes. It is very cool.

1476
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:39,217
- I like that.
- Do you? Yes.

1477
01:40:39,427 --> 01:40:41,418
- You're hot. You're so hot.
- What?

1478
01:40:41,629 --> 01:40:42,994
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1479
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:44,596
Are you warm?

1480
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:51,505
All right, guys, this is it,
the moment of truth.

1481
01:40:52,106 --> 01:40:55,633
The winner of this year's
Battle of the Bands competition...

1482
01:40:57,445 --> 01:41:00,278
...is No Vacancy!

1483
01:41:05,253 --> 01:41:07,744
No! Boo!

1484
01:41:07,955 --> 01:41:12,358
It was a beauty contest. They didn't
listen to the music. Boo! No!

1485
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,959
What?

1486
01:41:15,763 --> 01:41:17,128
Oh, no.

1487
01:41:17,331 --> 01:41:19,356
On behalf of
the Battle of the Bands,

1488
01:41:19,567 --> 01:41:24,595
I'd like to present this check
for $20,000 to No Vacancy.

1489
01:41:24,906 --> 01:41:27,966
Yeah! No Vacancy!

1490
01:41:28,175 --> 01:41:30,336
- No, School of Rock.
- School of Rock!

1491
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:32,136
School of Rock!

1492
01:41:32,747 --> 01:41:33,975
School of Rock!

1493
01:41:34,482 --> 01:41:35,779
What's wrong?

1494
01:41:35,983 --> 01:41:38,816
What's wrong, Summer?
Didn't you hear? We lost.

1495
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,784
Chill out, dude.
Rock isn't about getting an A.

1496
01:41:41,989 --> 01:41:45,948
- Sex Pistols never won anything.
- Don't let The Man get you down.

1497
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,323
Dude, you gotta cheer up.
We played a kick-ass show.

1498
01:41:50,331 --> 01:41:51,889
We did, didn't we?

1499
01:41:52,099 --> 01:41:55,466
- It was unbelievable, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

1505
01:42:12,687 --> 01:42:15,383
- <i>School of Rock!</i>
- It's an encore.

1506
01:42:15,589 --> 01:42:19,116
They want us to go play another song.
It's good! Go, you guys!

1507
01:42:19,327 --> 01:42:21,955
Wait, no. Just the band.
OK, everybody, go!

1508
01:42:34,575 --> 01:42:37,601
Thank you. Yes, we will play one more.

Bye, Mom. See you later.

1514
01:43:25,259 --> 01:43:29,491
I told you, as soon as I talk
to the band, I'll get back to you.

1515
01:43:29,697 --> 01:43:33,189
If you're so desperate,
then quit low-balling us.

1516
01:43:40,608 --> 01:43:42,743

01:44:02,096 --> 01:44:04,792

And that's a C.
All right? You got that?

1524
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:18,203
Let's see. OK, Paola, let's see you.

1525
01:44:18,412 --> 01:44:21,939
Yeah, your fingers are... basically right.

1526
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:24,481
DeShawn, what do you got?
All right, play.

1527
01:44:24,685 --> 01:44:28,086
Toby, you got it? Let's see.
Very good, you guys.

All right, now take it down
nice and quiet.

1536
01:44:53,247 --> 01:44:56,080
The next thing I wanna hear...

1537
01:44:56,617 --> 01:45:01,452
...is a face-melting solo by
our own Zack Mooneyham. Go!

1538
01:45:01,655 --> 01:45:03,282
Here we go!

1539
01:45:16,971 --> 01:45:21,670
Dude, is my face OK?
I think you melted it off.

1540
01:45:22,443 --> 01:45:25,412
All right, now the next thing
I wanna hear...

1541
01:45:25,613 --> 01:45:30,312
The very next thing... I don't wanna
hear anything unless I hear...

1542
01:45:31,085 --> 01:45:37,285
...a gut-busting drum solo from Freddy.
Take it away!

1546
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:05,348
What did you do, Freddy?

1547
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:14,721
Now I think it's time we heard
from a little somebody.

1548
01:46:16,797 --> 01:46:20,699
Lawrence on lead solo keyboard, go!

1549

1550
01:46:38,986 --> 01:46:41,887
All right, slow it up.
Listen up, you guys.

1551
01:46:42,089 --> 01:46:43,613
Here's what I need.

1552
01:46:43,824 --> 01:46:47,726
I need you girls to repeat after me:

1553
01:47:00,674 --> 01:47:02,073
All right.

1554
01:47:02,276 --> 01:47:04,574
Now the first test is over.

1555
01:47:04,778 --> 01:47:11,013
I'm gonna need Alicia to give me a
two-second vocal solo. Here it comes.

That was beautiful, but now it's time.

1558
01:47:21,729 --> 01:47:24,220
Come on, Tomika, melt it.

1559
01:47:31,105 --> 01:47:33,130
That was tasty.

1560
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,400

1581

1582
01:49:04,665 --> 01:49:07,190
- That was a good class.
- I'll see you, man.
