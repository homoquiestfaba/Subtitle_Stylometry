Get that cannon ready.

27

We're going to blow
this guy away.

without your support, my pet.

- Mwah.
- Mwah.

Go on. Get out,

- No.

Yes.

I don't know.

[chuckles]
Well,

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,566
that sounds like a nifty game,

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,369
but I had something
else in mind.

00:02:58,404 --> 00:02:59,972

Don't worry. He'll be fine.

Wonderful.

00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:37,143
- So beautiful.
- Mm.

a different game.

lots of angel powder.

He's good for nothing.

These ugly motherfuckers just
have big life insurance policies.

80
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,700
They always have, like,
five babies that need it.

81
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,469
We want
the red Wallendorf shoes,

82
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,671
and his family wants the money
from his life insurance.

on the roof of a convent.

00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,949
Look at him, Rebecca.

86
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,851
You got to watch him die.

All of you, let's find the GPS
tracking system and make it quick.

92
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:35,247
If it's portable, I want to activate
it and leave it on this big body.

Sorry not sorry.
[snickering]

94
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,589
Go. Go!

95
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,961
We've got one tracking system
only and it's attached.

96
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,462
Okay, wait
before you destroy it,

97
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,131
we got to be ready to put
the pedals to the metal

98
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,399

99
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:54,566

Fuck!

It's fucking instant ramen.

106
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,047
It was supposed to be
Wallendorf shoes.

107
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,716
How did this happen?

108
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,519
Well, that's just
empty calories.

109
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,321
Are we even the criminals
in this situation?

110
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,090
What do we do now?

111
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:19,425
- Just leave it?
- No.

112
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:21,126
We have to get rid of it.

113
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,062
[loud thud]

114
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,633
- How's life?
- Gets better with every step.

115
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,942
Sir, we've been doing
extensive marketing research

116
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,878
and we think it's more than a
good time to expand our product

117
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:43,382
beyond only manufacturing
red high-heeled women's shoes.

118
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:48,887
Sir, your talents as an artist and
a designer are globally renowned.

119
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,124
Everybody wants more from you
than just red shoes.

120
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:57,429
You guys try the new garlic
chicken fries over at Annabelle's?

121
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,331
Mm, mm, mm.

122
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,834
That is the finest shit
I've had in years.

123
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,970
To be honest, I haven't been
to Annabelle's in year, sir.

124
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,638
Why not?

125
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,408
What's wrong with Annabelle's?

126
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:12,611
Oh,

127
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:14,580
don't tell me.

128
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:19,251
You two are just a couple
of bark eating little vegans.

129
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:21,854
Nope, nope. That's a negative.

130
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,222
Neither am I, sir.

131
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:24,958
Well, [sighs]

132
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:28,627
either of you seen my daughter
in the last couple of days?

133
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:30,329
No, sir.

134
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,397
[clears throat]
Should we, um,

135
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:35,000
deploy the rangers?

136
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,568
Where to?

137
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:38,737
Your apartment?

138
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,342
Sir, your daughter is
definitely not in my apartment.

139
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,344
How do I know that?

140
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:49,648
You said you were a hot-blooded
carnivore just a second ago.

141
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:53,752
And I'm also
a happily married man.

142
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,120
Well, who isn't?

143
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,992
You know what? Just go get my
daughter and bring her back here.

144
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:04,196
And then we talk about how my fashion
dominance skills are needing to improve.

145
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,532
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,068
And try the chicken fried steak
over at Annabelle's,

147
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,204
and then we'll talk about
product development.

148
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:14,773
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,276
- Hey, cheers.
- Hey, cheers.

150
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:37,296
So, you grew up in a restaurant
like this one?

151
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,265
It was similar.

152
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,834
My mom and dad
and my uncle ran it.

153
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,904
Kind of like
your family business,

154
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,840
except from mine was
just a cool restaurant.

155
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:53,211
I was helping in the kitchen since
before I could reach the stove.

156
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:56,381
That... sounds cool.

157
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:01,620
Everything kind of sounds cool,
but it's really hard work.

158
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:04,122
That's why I ended up
the way I am now.

159
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,729
- I got no heat in the heart.
- Oh.

160
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,436
If I cut you,

161
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,205
would you feel it?

162
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,784
Nobody likes me. Not even you.

163
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,287
Yes.

164
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,856
You didn't hear what I said,
did you?

165
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:39,858
What?

166
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,195
Are you even listening to me?
Do... Does anyone?

167
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,197
What are you trying
to say to me right now?

168
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:50,135
I said, nobody likes me,
and you said "yes".

169
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,172
Of course I like you.

170
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,275
- Why?
- Why not?

171
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,211
Oh my God, mom,
it's Jennifer Wallendorf.

172
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,379
I know sweetie but it's...

173
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,614
it's rude to stare, so just...

174
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:03,382
Hi.

175
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,816
- Come on.
- Sorry.

176
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,585
Okay.

177
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,286
That was great. Alright.

178
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,823
Fuck, I got spotted.

179
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:18,697
[romantic music]

180
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,500
- What's this?
- It's no big deal,

181
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,201
it just makes you faster.

182
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,770
What, like a superhero?

183
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,471
Exactly like a superhero.

184
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:34,379
Not wearing heels, are you?

185
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,484
[scoffs]

186
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,921
Can I clear away some
of these empty plates?

187
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:44,890
Yeah, uh, yeah.

188
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,659
We'll just have two pieces
of banana cream pie.

189
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,327
À mode.

190
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,263
À la mode.

191
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,631
Of course.

192
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,272
- You remember the route?
- Yeah.

193
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:02,407
Now, you were right
about that pill.

194
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,043
I feel like a race car.

195
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,844
- What kind?
- I don't care.

196
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,781
So are we going to do this or
just start talking really quickly?

197
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:10,950
Let's go.

198
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,087
Fuck you!

199
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:16,155
- [laughs]
- Whoa. Hey, hey!

200
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:19,224
- Go, go now.
- Get back here!

201
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:20,792
[panting]

202
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,195
Stop!

203
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:23,595
Little fuckers!

204
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:24,997
[panting]

205
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,232
Get back here, goddammit!

206
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,768
Go, go.

207
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,804
[panting]

208
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:38,310
Wallendorf!

209
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,812
[panting]

210
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,380
Wait!

211
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,017
[panting]

212
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,286
Oh, hey, don't kill him.

213
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,654
Quiet, he's fat.

214
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,556
Does fat mean
he deserves to be hurt?

215
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:53,658
Obesity is the number one
killer in the country.

216
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,594
Even if you combine war
and all disease.

217
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:57,596
Keep my face out of the frame
with that thing.

218
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,132
I'm not going
to frame your face.

219
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,365
[panting]

220
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:01,833
Don't kill him though.

221
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:03,102
This guy is like a whale.

222
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:04,736
He can take a bat
to the stomach.

223
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,305
[grunts and groans]

224
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:10,842
[groans and coughs]

225
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,879
Oh fu... Oh my God.

226
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,550
[loud groan]

227
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,589
What... hey ya...

228
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,458
[crying]

229
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,898
- [groans]
- Goodbye.

230
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:38,737
Why...?

231
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:43,708
[suspenseful music].

232
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,677
Okay, roll down your window.

233
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:50,183
Unbuckle your seat belt
right after we hit the water.

234
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,084
Get ready to swim out.

235
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:53,986
Okay.

236
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:56,888
Ready.

237
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:11,870
[eerie music]

238
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,980
[eerie music]

239
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,817
[inhales deeply]

240
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,087
[panting]

241
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:33,092
[panting]

242
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:34,327
Is that hidden enough?

243
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,095
- Yeah.
- Great.

244
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,931
I mean, I would've wanted
it to go under more, but

245
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,166
doesn't make a difference now.

246
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,533
[shivering]

247
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,834
No one's going to find
it here anyway.

248
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,304
Makes about as much
sense as anything else.

249
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:47,405
We could firebomb that.

250
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,641
Would draw attention. Okay.

251
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,476
Let's go back to the house
and find the girls.

252
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,510
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

253
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:55,647
[whimsical music]

254
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,885
[electronic music]

255
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,497
[background chatter]

256
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,669
[man in background] <i>Oh, hell.
Cane brought Jennifer. How cool is that?</i>

257
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:21,073
[laughter in the background]

258
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,645
[electronic music]

259
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,249
- Hi, Stew.
- Hello, Jennifer Wallendorf.

260
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:35,254
[Jennifer laughs] Knock it off.
Hey, can I get a pint of straight whiskey?

261
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,454
[laughs]
Sure thing.

262
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,157
It's quite a drink, little lady.

263
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,228
Cane, Cane. Oh, beautiful Cane,
thank God you're here.

264
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:44,397
It is complete anarchy
in the kitchen. I mean,

265
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,399
we're just trying to make big pots
of the simple potato and beet soup,

266
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,767
a little bit of veggies,
and these guys are just fucking it up

267
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,169
in ways that I can't
even describe.

268
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,038
Okay, man,
I'll come help out in a sec.

269
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:53,838
- Let me just grab a quick drink.
- Thank you. You are a saint.

270
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,408
I'm sorry. One second. What
the fuck are you doing?

271
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,209
Hey Stew, I'll just have
a shot of that.

272
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,446
[electronic music]

273
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,684
Don't. What the fuck?
Look at this...

274
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,953
Look at this.
Does that look good to you?

275
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,553
It's fucking disgusting.
Do it again.

276
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,222
Jennifer, take it easy
with that whiskey.

277
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:11,723
I got to help in the kitchen.

278
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,225
I am taking it easy.

279
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:15,560
Go do your thing.

280
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:18,931
Okay, okay,
relax, people. Relax.

281
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,200
Everybody stay calm.

282
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,701
...it goes in the peel,
you slice it...

283
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,769
...so much, I swear to God.

284
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,673
- Stew, can I get another?
- Of course, but

285
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:32,311
I honestly think two pints of whiskey
is going to make you fall down again.

286
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,114
Stew, can you just let me live?

287
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:39,051
[electronic music]

288
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,598
<i>Cut, you don't kill the flavors,
it's going to...</i>

289
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,935
Alright, chicken broth,
people, chicken broth.

290
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,902
Let's get some chicken broth.

291
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,515
[gentle music]

292
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,327
Hi, girls, what did
you get up to tonight?

293
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,962
[laughing]

294
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,796
- Scanner?
- Pleasure.

295
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,632
[grunts softly]

296
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,301
- Hmm.
- To be honest,

297
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,636
it wasn't the best
evening so far.

298
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,571
We... we... we've
been keeping busy.

299
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:35,274
- What about you?
- Hmm.

300
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:38,277
Cane took me out to dinner.

301
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,678
- He can be such a doll.
- I know.

302
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:42,348
Well, love's the devil.

303
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:43,482
And so is Cane.

304
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:44,916
Wants some angel powder?

305
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,885
Oh yeah, put it
on the back of my hand.

306
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,528
[snorts]

307
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,562
[sighs with pleasure]

308
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,733
- Look at her go.
- [scoffs]

309
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:07,273
- [disgusted grunts]
- Jesus Christ.

310
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,246
Wow, that wasn't necessary.

311
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,613
What? Was she stuck

312
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,483
in a dark elevator
as a child or something?

313
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,120
Lean her against the wall,
so she doesn't choke in her own vomit.

314
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,255
Cane!

315
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,292
Oh, Cane?

316
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,328
Can you come get
your girlfriend?

317
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,234
[Jennifer grunts]

318
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,838
[groans]

319
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,673
I need a drink.

320
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,910
Where are my clothes?

321
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,347
Where is my purse?

322
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:51,783
Well, you've got
my shoe at least.

323
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,120
Well, your clothes
are right over there.

324
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:56,522
- There's vomit on them.
- Oh.

325
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,790
[groans softly]
Okay.

326
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:00,692
Oh, wow. No.

327
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,095
Hey, come here.

328
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:05,464
How did I get so sick?

329
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,832
- You don't remember?
- Hmm, no.

330
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,204
Well, you downed two
straight pints of whiskey

331
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:13,738
and I tried to stop you.

332
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,474
Then you went into Cynthia's
ladies only room

333
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:18,377
and started snorting rails
and venting with the girls.

334
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,645
Mmm...

335
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:26,986
Why are you looking
at my shoe like that?

336
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:32,291
Don't tell me, like, you're
just one of those guys who

337
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:35,995
likes my dad's shoes
more than he likes me.

338
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:40,566
It's not like that.

339
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,768
I was checking out the shoe
and trying to figure things out.

340
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,409
Okay. So did you figure things out while
staring at my shoe while I was passed out?

341
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:55,680
Can you get me some champagne?

342
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,454
I just don't understand all the
conspiracy theories about your family.

343
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,225
Did you know there's a whole movement
where they believe your family are lizards?

344
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:09,028
- Mm-hmm.
- And you guys are trying to make the world hotter

345
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,963
because it's
your natural climate?

346
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,899
It's backed up with
mathematicians, scientists,

347
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:17,937
as well as former Wallendorf
shoes executives.

348
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:21,140
Well, do you think that's true?

349
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:23,908
- I know you're not a lizard.
- [chuckles]

350
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,778
What's up with the red shoes?

351
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,113
Ugh...

352
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,018
It's information.

353
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,588
So, in order to get
the seven-year

354
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,057
unlimited replacement warranty,

355
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,824
you have to give
Wallendorf shoes access

356
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,860
to all of your personal
information and everything else.

357
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:45,531
Once my father has access to
someone's personal information,

358
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:48,900
he can categorize their whole
life in less than a paragraph.

359
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:51,637
How much you're willing
to spend on a sandwich

360
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,871
or how much you're willing
to spend on a cup of coffee,

361
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,407
and then he'll get
you to spend more

362
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,642
or influence your behavior

363
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,743
based off of your
personality type.

364
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,349
That's just as crazy
as the lizard thing.

365
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,184
Well, nobody wants
to believe that their life

366
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,053
can become less than a syllable
in under a second.

367
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:10,623
Madness.

368
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,391
Ooh, yeah, definitely.

369
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,561
Hey, there's no cameras
allowed in here.

370
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:16,729
Yeah, I know.

371
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:19,365
This is an antique
Polaroid camera.

372
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,101
It's untraceable.

373
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:29,108
You want me to take some
pictures of you with this thing?

374
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:31,176
Hm, exactly.

375
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:33,946
Alright.

376
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:50,162
[camera clicks]

377
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,634
[camera clicks]

378
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:57,869
[clicks continue]

379
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,485
Ah, cool, you're not dead.

380
00:23:14,787 --> 00:23:16,121
I think I'm alive.

381
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:19,058
Mostly because of this
feeling of terminal love.

382
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,660
Well, did you ever
wake up feeling like

383
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,729
you're looking out a window

384
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,365
at a beautiful beach
with the wind in your hair?

385
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,233
- Yeah.
- Well,

386
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,968
Mitch thinks
we drank all of his beer

387
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:31,270
and destroyed his motorcycle.

388
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:32,638
He's been saying it
for over a week

389
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,706
and won't back down,

390
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,808
so now Cynthia has to fight him.

391
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:37,443
[crowd chanting]
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch!

392
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:39,712
I am the king. King!

393
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:42,715
That guy is huge. [chuckles]

394
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,450
I am the crusher.

395
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,785
This isn't your dad's tower,
princess.

396
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:50,289
Someone's about to get hurt
because of living space and food.

397
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:53,692
Nothing around here is just
about beer or motorcycles.

398
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,694
- Uhh...
- Clean as usual.

399
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:58,797
- How's the champagne?
- Cool. It's pretty clean, too.

400
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,434
- Okay, you guys want to grab some breakfast real quick?
- Yeah, go get some food.

401
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,869
I will just make some
breakfast burritos real quick.

402
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:06,071
Be right back.

403
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:08,374
- Nice shoes.
- Yeah?

404
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,275
Are... are you patronizing me?

405
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,444
Do rich people eat breakfast?

406
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,879
Or are you guys living
off of champagne,

407
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:17,516
- nice shoes and jewelry?
- Yeah.

408
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:19,884
We just survive
off of champagne,

409
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:21,720
and then we name
fancy shoes after ourselves.

410
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:22,887
How does that not make sense?

411
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:24,123
- Huh?
- Oh, okay.

412
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,824
Well, Jennifer. [groans]

413
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,160
Can you just
get yourself together?

414
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,295
Why don't you just go marry
prince charming, little mermaid.

415
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:32,664
You just... look at me,
look at me.

416
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,667
Girls, kind of... this...
I'm going to talk.

417
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,603
So, here's the thing,

418
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:40,806
I've already taken
a private jet to the Bahamas

419
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,174
and pretty much everywhere else.

420
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:44,543
I've met, like,
ten Prince Charming's,

421
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,512
and they weren't
the least bit charming.

422
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:50,549
Half of them were not even
real princes. So bleh.

423
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:54,787
Why can't you just accept that,
like, maybe I am just as lost

424
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,291
if not, maybe a little... little
bit more lost than all you.

425
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:02,361
Fine. But can I just give you
some friendly advice

426
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:04,696
about chef boy Cane over there?

427
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:06,465
Yeah.

428
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,368
Don't get too attached,
sweetheart.

429
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,904
Thinking you can
hold on to Cane is like

430
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:14,273
thinking you can grab smoke.

431
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:18,110
[Mitch]
Cynthia. Come on, Cynthia.

432
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:21,346
- Here you go, ladies. Fresh breakfast burritos.
- [Mitch] It's okay,

433
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,382
just sit there
and eat your breakfast

434
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:25,984
while I'm up here, ready to go.

435
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,386
- I don't eat food.
- It's...

436
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,720
- it's a private jet, just...
- I don't...

437
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:30,556
you don't eat private jets.

438
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:34,393
[exhales

439
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:37,596
[Mitch]
Yeah. Get it on. Get it on.

440
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,667
[grunts softly]

441
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,938
[growls]

442
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,505
[woman]
And fight.

443
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,774
- Get him!
- [Crowd chanting] Cynthia!

444
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:51,643
You squirmy little worm,
I will crush you flat.

445
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,013
[woman]
Get him!

446
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:58,750
Get here, girl,
I'm gonna do you dirty.

447
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:00,452
Get here. Oh, yeah.

448
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,087
Oh, goddamn!

449
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:06,191
Gonna rip your legs off, bitch!

450
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:10,829
- Cynthia, yeah!
- Come on, come on, let's go, Cynthia!

451
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,466
Fire, prison, faster.

452
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,436
Come to papa.

453
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:18,704
[grunts]

454
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,008
I'm going to put
a stick on your thighs.

455
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,276
Gonna be dirty!

456
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:27,746
[screams]
Help, help!

457
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,083
I'll kill you!

458
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:34,286
I'm gonna crush you
fucking flat.

459
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:35,521
[groans]

460
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:40,926
[crowd chanting]
Cynthia! Cynthia!

461
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:41,928
[Cynthia]
Come on!

462
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,463
[groaning and grunting]

463
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:45,932
You got no good.

464
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:47,533
I'm gonna crush you!

465
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:53,038
[woman] It's okay, Cynthia, you can do it.
Get up. Come on, let's go!

466
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,509
- [woman 1] Yes!
- [woman 2] Steal his breath.

467
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:59,144
[Mitch pants]

468
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:01,880
Stop.

469
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,650
I give up. I was only joking.

470
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:05,918
I was getting...

471
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:07,286
[grunting]

472
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:13,559
[grunting continues]

473
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:21,333
Cynthia, come here, come on, you're
okay, you're okay. Come... come on.

474
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,901
Am I... am I alive?

475
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:24,436
- We got you.
- Where's Mitch?

476
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,505
- We won. The fights over.
- You did it.

477
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,106
I can't remember
the fight in my brain.

478
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,174
I think you're better off.

479
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:30,542
- It's okay.
- What?

480
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:32,210
- I think he's choking.
- Mitch is dead.

481
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:34,713
- Get it off. Get off.
- You killed that big guy.

482
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,382
They're not getting
this now, girl.

483
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:38,584
[crowd]
Come on, Mitch, get up.

484
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:40,218
- Come on, Mitch.
- Mitch, get up.

485
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,821
[somber music]

486
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,202
[fire crackles]

487
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,504
[somber music]

488
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:07,046
[suspenseful music]

489
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,949
Chad, there's rumors
of you spending nights and days

490
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,618
in Mrs. Wallendorf room
with her and her maids.

491
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,291
[chuckles]

492
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:22,394
- Mrs. Wallendorf and her maids, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,565
Don't go spreading rumors
like that about me.

494
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:28,767
You know, I'm loyal
to the Wallendorf family.

495
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,901
I only do...

496
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,572
what is asked.

497
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,374
I know, it's not me.

498
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,244
Rumors about you and Mrs.
Wallendorf are being spread on their own.

499
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,116
I thought you were my friend.

500
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,617
Rumors don't get
spread on their own.

501
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:47,719
Somebody spreads it.

502
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,721
I am your friend.

503
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:53,158
That's why I'm telling you
what everyone's talking about.

504
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,795
I don't want you to wind up being a lead
of one of Mr. Wallendorf commercials

505
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,233
because you have a problem
with self-control or something.

506
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,403
If you need to talk about it,
I'm here.

507
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,876
I'm not very chatty.

508
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:13,912
And everyone's lying.

509
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,651
[distorted voice]
Where's your precious truck?

510
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,154
I'm so sorry.

511
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:22,654
It's all my fault.

512
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:24,756
I'm going to find it soon.

513
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:28,694
But your plan was flawless,
and you believe in God.

514
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:30,862
Who would steal ramen?

515
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,966
There's no way anybody could
have known there was gold inside.

516
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,867
Ramen has the least spiritual,

517
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:39,838
monetary or sentimental value
of anything you can think of.

518
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,540
I dropped the ball.

519
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,976
I'm too busy for my pants.

520
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:48,114
So $1.6 billion dollars
worth of gold was untraceable.

521
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,248
It was completely my fault.

522
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:52,484
Someone inside the palace knows.

523
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,454
Must be an inside conspiracy.

524
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,389
You have to kill.

525
00:29:57,522 --> 00:29:59,025
You have to torture
the senior staff,

526
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:00,193
it's your only option.

527
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,393
Ah...

528
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:03,662
There are always traitors.

529
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,231
That's the golden rule.

530
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:07,566
I'll kill.

531
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,735
I'll kill the staff.

532
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,870
Oh, they all believe in God.

533
00:30:12,304 --> 00:30:15,407
They'll be blessed to leave
this world by my merciful hands.

534
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,476
Find out who
the conspirators are.

535
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,480
There's always lies and murder
when gold is on the line.

536
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,515
And always remember,

537
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:27,120
"Murder is plan A."

538
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:30,355
[dramatic music]

539
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,728
[grunts]

540
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:48,373
[Jessica] <i>So you grew up in
a restaurant like this one?</i>

541
00:30:48,507 --> 00:30:51,576
[Cane] <i>I was helping in the kitchen
since before I could reach the stove.</i>

542
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,345
I remember standing on a stool.

543
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,781
Anyway, my whole family
got murdered,

544
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:57,415
and the restaurant
was burned down.

545
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:00,485
- So, here's your happy ending.
- [laughs]

546
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,791
Wait, are you serious
about that?

547
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,093
Yeah.

548
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:09,461
[whimsical music]

549
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:13,032
- Chad?
- Hmm?

550
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,934
You've seen my daughter lately?

551
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:17,136
Nope.

552
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,038
Neither have I.

553
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,174
I suppose that makes
fucking three of us.

554
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,943
Get the rangers
looking for her, huh?

555
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:27,579
- Of course.
- I don't understand why we can't find her

556
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:31,583
with all the satellites and
the digital tracking machines.

557
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,087
She's constantly posting where
she is and what she's doing.

558
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:36,956
And I don't like it!

559
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:39,225
It's a disgrace.

560
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,759
She does things, like,

561
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:43,361
sets up devices
in different parts of the town.

562
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:46,364
It's as if she wants everyone to
know that she's somewhere else.

563
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:49,035
Sometimes we have rangers
deployed all over the city

564
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,603
and then your cook or
one of your maids finds her here

565
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:54,339
eating cereal or sleeping
in her room, you know?

566
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:55,507
[snores]

567
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,243
- It's great.
- It's stupid.

568
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,910
It is, it is.

569
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:00,378
Just get her.

570
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,049
Bring her back to me.

571
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,083
Yes, sir.

572
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,517
[clears throat]

573
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:10,422
Chad?

574
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:12,124
You got a point?

575
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:14,026
Or you just going to stare at me

576
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,828
like some weird
hungry vulture all night.

577
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:20,365
Sir, we believe
it's time to expand.

578
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:26,339
Beyond just the simple manufacturing
of women's red high-heeled shoes.

579
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:28,874
- Them here shoes?
- Right?

580
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,444
These here shoes?

581
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:37,515
These shoes are
overwhelming the planet.

582
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:41,153
Ain't nothing simple about
a pair of woman's shoes.

583
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,092
[sighs]

584
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,827
[snorts]

585
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,541
Are you okay, Jennifer?

586
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:05,244
Your father's been
looking for you.

587
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,579
Who asked you, doll face?

588
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:09,949
Okay.

589
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:14,387
- Here, let me help you.
- Batch, ba...

590
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:17,123
I strongly suggest you keep
your hands to yourself

591
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:21,060
unless you want to be the star
of my first murder mystery.

592
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:28,000
- I've got too many pots on my fire.
- Hey, hey, hey.

593
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,869
It's not all your fault,
Mrs. Wallendorf.

594
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,172
And I'm gonna find everything.

595
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:35,540
- Trust.
- [door slams]

596
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:39,778
Jennifer, Jennifer.

597
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,214
Where have you been?

598
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:45,517
Oh my God, sweetheart.

599
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:47,420
You're drunk.

600
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,455
Your hair is green,
and you're covered in vomit.

601
00:33:50,588 --> 00:33:53,225
It's a wig, Mom.

602
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:57,896
But I'm gay,
and I'm leaving the church.

603
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,465
[uplifting music]

604
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:19,185
Your depression is only
due to negative thoughts.

605
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:24,023
If you just breathe
and stay loving God

606
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:26,691
and only have positive thoughts,

607
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,894
the whole world will
change around you.

608
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:33,798
I hate you.

609
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,501
Please get out of my life.

610
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,638
The heart of a mother
is a deep abyss,

611
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,541
at the bottom of which

612
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:46,078
always find forgiveness.

613
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:04,863
[suspenseful music]

614
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:18,643
[Mrs. Wallendorf <i>All of
the information was coded</i>

615
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:20,812
<i>and sent
through private satellites.</i>

<i>If the conspirators
start to disappear,</i>

620
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,958
it will send a clear message
to the others,

621
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:34,726
and they'll start to talk.

622
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,130
Make them talk or die.

623
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,035
Either way, it's the best
thing for everyone.

624
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:45,804
Where's my ramen noodle soup?

625
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:48,807
I know that you know
where it is.

626
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,843
You have my ramen noodle
soup truck, don't you?

627
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,313
Mrs. Wallendorf, I don't know
anything about your ramen noodle soup.

628
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:56,282
- [shouts] Don't you?
- What are you talking about?

629
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,951
Why... why... why do you care
about ramen noodle soup?

630
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:02,587
But... you're a... you're...
you're a good person.

631
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:04,856
Let me go now and...
and I will get you

632
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,891
the best ramen noodle soup
in the whole world.

633
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,861
Do you know how much
it will hurt

634
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:12,498
- to be shot in the cranium with a derringer?
- Oh, God.

635
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,700
The bullet will just rattle
around inside your skull.

636
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,404
It won't kill you right away.
No, it will just leave you there

637
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,439
with your brains shuffled
like a deck of cards

638
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:24,043
and stirred up like oatmeal.

639
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,146
Then you'll just choke
on your own blood.

640
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,014
Or maybe dehydrate.

641
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:32,218
Do you know that it
could take over 24 hours

642
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:36,621
for your spirit to leave this
meaningless meat that is your body?

643
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:40,359
[whimpers] Mrs.
Wallendorf, please don't shoot me.

644
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:42,161
This is crazy, over ramen?

645
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:45,864
I'll fly to Japan and... and
I'll... I'll... I'll get you the...

646
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,567
the most authentic ramen
from the finest chef in Tokyo.

647
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,269
Just let me go.

648
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:52,538
You... you're such a good person,

649
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:55,207
you're... you're such
a good person.

650
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,075
[whimpers]

651
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,344
A violent death over ramen?

652
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,113
This is... This is unnecessary.

653
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:03,616
[distorted voice]
This is necessary.

654
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:05,417
This is necessary.

655
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,621
If you know anything about
history or religious scripture,

656
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:12,291
you would know that violence is
the most natural cause of death.

657
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,194
And since your death
is imminent,

658
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:17,563
I can say

659
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,901
we both know
this isn't about ramen.

660
00:37:23,902 --> 00:37:26,272
- It's about gold.
- What?

661
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:28,440
What the hell
is she talking about?

662
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:30,342
<i>So a violent death over gold...</i>

663
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,378
Ramen is gold?

664
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:34,947
Well, that's not only natural,

665
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:37,715
it's necessary.

666
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:41,287
- [gunshot]
- [chokes]

667
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,190
Can you talk?

668
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:51,997
You want me to put some mellow jazz on and
dance around naked for you while you die?

669
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,367
I'm happy to.

[knocking on door]

00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:30,936
What?

674
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:32,870
[Wallendorf]
What you're doing, pumpkin?

675
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,807
Told you not to come in here
with the door closed.

676
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:38,876
I told you not to call me
pumpkin anymore either.

677
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,913
Well, I... I didn't come in.
I'm just knocking.

678
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,882
Fine, whatever.
Come in. I don't care.

679
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:46,518
[chuckles]

680
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,588
Holy shit.

681
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,658
Why do you insist
on having the entire world

682
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,093
see you in your underwear?

683
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,229
Is that necessary?

684
00:38:57,997 --> 00:39:00,399
Holy shit!
Some of it's even nude.

685
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:01,700
[exhales]

686
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,202
You know, this is crazy.

687
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:04,336
Crazy!

688
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:06,505
You could be inviting stalkers,

689
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,508
kidnappers, creepy cyber daters.

690
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,243
I learned this from you.

691
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:14,013
This is what you do
with your models.

692
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,649
I'm just so much better at it.

693
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:20,185
I'm your most famous model
by ten hundred times.

694
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,187
I mean, without me,
sales would drop.

695
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,525
God, you think
everything is about you.

696
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,294
My fans love me.

697
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:32,231
You know, all the social media
is not really love.

698
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:35,534
And what are you doing with
rainbow-colored cheerios in your hair?

699
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:39,204
Is that some new "I'm the most
popular model in the world" look?

700
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:40,606
Yes.

701
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,141
And if you don't get it,

702
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:43,808
you just don't get it.

703
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:44,943
Oh, I get it.

704
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,046
No, you don't get it, Dad.

705
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,846
You don't get it at all.

706
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:52,884
Well, why don't you just explain
it to me then, pumpkin?

707
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,255
I'm talking about something that
you don't get or understand,

708
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:57,723
that's why I can't
explain it to you.

709
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,325
And stop calling me pumpkin.

710
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,695
My so-called renegade marketing
is just as important

711
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:06,265
as all the videos that you bombard people
with through your private satellite.

712
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:08,067
Can we take this
conversation downstairs?

713
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,804
Your mama had Becky in the
kitchen make amazing ramen

714
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:13,739
and it's topped
with white truffles,

715
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,274
gold leaf.

716
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:18,344
You had Becky in the kitchen
gold leaf your ramen noodle soup?

717
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:20,579
I mean, you know how
your mother is about food.

718
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,282
And look who's talking,

719
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,250
you got cereal in your hair.

720
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:27,353
What's that all about?

721
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:28,520
Whatever.

722
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:31,023
That ramen sounds crazy though,

723
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:32,691
I'm going to take
a picture of it.

724
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:37,129
And then I'm going to post it.

725
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:40,999
[scoffs]

726
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:43,535
Pumpkin.

727
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,975
[whimsical music]

728
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:01,353
[scoffs]

729
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:03,088
I can't stand those
bodybuilder guys.

730
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:04,790
We've already been through this.

731
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:08,926
Look, a locker in the gym is the
safest place to keep our computer.

732
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:11,063
Maybe it was the cheapest place.

733
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:14,666
You don't have to work out with those
people just to make it look casual.

734
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,470
It's like steroid cops asking me if I wanna
get a protein shake with a long shower.

735
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,440
Well, your girlfriend probably
appreciates that you're fit.

736
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:23,075
Let's just get to work.

737
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,248
Well, it looks like there's a truckload of
flat screen TVs coming into town tonight.

738
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,049
Are you sure they're
flat screen TVs?

739
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,819
I don't know how that ramen
noodle soup mix-up happened.

740
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,823
I honestly think there could have been
some other criminals involved or something.

741
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,324
Or maybe a computer glitch.

742
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,460
I don't want to hit
Wallendorf shipping again.

743
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:42,628
Okay, not right now.

744
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:44,163
I'm not stupid.

745
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:45,330
I'm not gonna put
you and your bandits

746
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:46,932
in more danger than I have to.

747
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:50,002
This is CBA freight systems
and flat screen TVs.

748
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:52,204
Look at it, it's right here.

749
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:54,440
Sounds good.

750
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:55,974
The CBA always has those

751
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,743
geo-fences
around their trucks.

752
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,311
I can just fry the whole system.

753
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:00,813
We're actually running
really low on food

754
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:03,015
and even basic ingredients
to make bread, so...

755
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:09,154
I know. Us... [laughs] bandits are
hitting a supermarket for groceries.

756
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:11,690
- Great.
- And you and your finaglers.

757
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:13,959
can figure out how to safely
sell the electronics.

758
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:15,494
And get whatever else we need.

759
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:19,698
And then I am off for a while.

760
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:21,433
- That works.
- Ok.

761
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,636
Well, stare deeply
into the computer screen,

762
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,506
you got the ETA to memorize
and a location.

763
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:30,008
Got it.

764
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,253
[Mr. Wallendorf]
<i>Close your eyes, pumpkin.</i>

765
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:43,489
[suspenseful music]

766
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,358
<i>You want to play a game?</i>

767
00:42:46,758 --> 00:42:47,659
Yes.

768
00:42:57,002 --> 00:43:00,172
<i>This game is called pumpkin.</i>

769
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:02,841
[distorted voice]
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

770
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:04,209
[groans softly]

771
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,782
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

772
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:15,120
[vintage music]

773
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,194
Can I get you
something to drink?

774
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,999
Yeah. Can I, uh, have a mimosa?

775
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:01,600
Just a mimosa?

776
00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:02,936
That'll be all.

777
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,236
Sure.

778
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:08,507
[sighs]

779
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:10,208
Thank you, Nathan.

780
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:12,377
[chuckles]
I'm not Nathan.

781
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:14,846
Sorry, I..., uh...

782
00:44:15,547 --> 00:44:17,182
I fell asleep last night
with the fan

783
00:44:17,316 --> 00:44:19,018
aimed directly at my head.

784
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:22,554
Today everything looks and
sounds like I'm underwater.

785
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:27,192
Must have thought
you were someone else.

786
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,331
[lively music]

787
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:48,413
[Rick] <i>Well, she does things,
like, have, um, three devices</i>

788
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:50,049

789
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:51,583
<i>and she sets them up to activate</i>

790
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:54,152
<i>and start posting things
at different times.</i>

791
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:57,923
<i>It's as if she wants
everyone to know</i>

792
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:00,026
<i>that she's somewhere else.
Somewhere else.</i>

793
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:02,160
<i>Somewhere else. Somewhere else.</i>

794
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:14,139
- Would you like another?
- I'm fine, Nathan.

795
00:45:14,272 --> 00:45:15,607
[sighs]

796
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:17,442
Didn't your mother ever tell
you not to sleep with the fan

797
00:45:17,576 --> 00:45:18,810
pointing straight at your head?

798
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:20,212
You'd be lucky if
you don't catch the flu

799
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,246
- or something.
- [sighs]

800
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,748
Oh, Nathan.

801
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,183
Fuck you.

802
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,037
Would you wear these two
bracelets around your wrist,

803
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:48,807
drive around the block for about an
hour and then come back and get me?

804
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:50,709
Yes, ma'am. Happy to.

805
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:51,810
Thank you.

806
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:12,297
What are you wearing?

807
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:14,566
Look who's talking,
you're in a costume.

808
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,170
Uh, this isn't a costume.
It's a disguise.

809
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:18,470
What is the difference?

810
00:46:18,603 --> 00:46:22,240
A costume, you wear for fun.

811
00:46:22,774 --> 00:46:25,844
A disguise, you wear
for deception.

812
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:29,881
Coincidentally, I have
costumes in this suitcase.

813
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:31,017
What are the costumes for?

814
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,485
Your masquerade ball.

815
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:38,590
What did you think
they were for?

816
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:42,461
Are you inviting me to the
Wallendorf palace freak out thing

817
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,262
- that everyone talks about?
- I'm not inviting you.

818
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:45,731
I'm taking you.

819
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,005
Can you hand me those
bracelets back?

820
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,240
Of course, Miss Wallendorf.

821
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:00,779
What's this?

822
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,280
Tracking device.

823
00:47:03,983 --> 00:47:06,384
- You have to wear it?
- Yes.

824
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:11,958
Is this dangerous?

825
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:15,360
Well, you can't have
an adventure

826
00:47:15,494 --> 00:47:16,963
without an element of danger.

827
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:21,833
Besides, you seem to be the type who veers
more towards the dangerous side of things.

828
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:23,301
So...

829
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,837
Will you stop being so dramatic?

830
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:28,673
We're just sneaking into a party
at my parent's house.

831
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,243
I find it...

832
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:34,379
unlikely that they'd kill you,
even if they caught us.

833
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:45,891
Can you wait for us?
We should just be a couple of hours.

834
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:47,292
Yes, of course.

So just give it to me, and we'll
make him think we're somewhere else.

we have quiche puffs.

- Can't he see us? Aren't there cameras everywhere?
- [laughs] No.

He relies way more on tracking
systems than he does on cameras.

00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:06,125
and other stuff like that.

883
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:07,826
Uh, he can even hear
what you're saying

884
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,728
if you're in the same room
as your cell phone.

885
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,198
And you can see through any
camera that's attached to a device

886
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:13,531
with internet capabilities.

887
00:51:13,966 --> 00:51:15,800
Why on earth would he want
to do all that anyway?

888
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:17,136
Well, he takes
the conversations

889
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:18,603
and people's
personal information,

890
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:20,006
stores it in
his super computers,

891
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,906
and then computers
and the tech teams

892
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,675
figure out what people are
talking about.

893
00:51:23,808 --> 00:51:25,877
And then they sell
that information off

894
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:28,813
to massive corporations
and to government agencies,

895
00:51:28,948 --> 00:51:32,851
and then they easily influence people to
talk and think about whatever they want.

896
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:34,686
Why?

897
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:36,821
Money, religion,

898
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:38,890
world domination.

899
00:51:39,425 --> 00:51:40,592
Well, that's scary.

900
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,795
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Yeah, most people don't.

901
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,297
That's why it works so well.

902
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:48,434
- You went back to Annabelle's?
- Yeah.

903
00:51:49,235 --> 00:51:52,238
I can't even go there any more
without a disguise, thanks to you.

904
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:54,173
- [screeching]
- Hush.

905
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,678
Thank you, Mr. Wallendorf.
It's been our lifelong dream

906
00:52:00,812 --> 00:52:02,281
- to model for you.
- Oh.

907
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:04,950
I'm... I'm not saying we're not
doing this just because it's cool,

908
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:06,751
but everyone you put
in your commercials

909
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:09,455
gets a hundred thousand
super fans, sponsors,

910
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:12,891
and, we're just trying
to express our gratitude, sir.

911
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:15,794
Pleasure is all mine, son,
the pleasure is all mine.

912
00:52:15,995 --> 00:52:17,729
Uh, now, what I'd like
you to do is...

913
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:20,865
I'd like you to all get in front
of that green screen there

914
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,835
and, uh, make yourself a nice
little circle, alright?

915
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:25,037
Now, I want you all to...

916
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,571
- What's happening?
- [shushes]

917
00:52:26,704 --> 00:52:28,240
Close your eyes.

918
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:32,844
Close your eyes.

919
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:38,951
Now, this game is called Snafu.

920
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:42,154
- I think you...
- [shushes] Don't talk.

921
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:44,689
- Don't even breathe.
- Thought it'd be a little hard...

922
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:46,791
Otherwise, my dad will kill you.

923
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:48,660
...to get along
without his head.

924
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:51,330
That's what I was trying to say
before you brought me here, princess.

925
00:52:51,464 --> 00:52:55,101
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna take down all your parts

926
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:57,269
and then put them all
back together again.

927
00:52:57,735 --> 00:53:00,005
Alright? Here we go.

928
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,743
Now, I want you
to take your legs

929
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:09,014
and put them all the way
on the other side of the group.

930
00:53:09,914 --> 00:53:13,152
And then I want you
to take your torso

931
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:17,822
and put it on top of your leg.

932
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:24,029
And take your head
and put it on top of your neck.

933
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:28,100
Now, I would like you
to make a new body

934
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,469
right over here

935
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:33,072
to replace the old body.

936
00:53:34,406 --> 00:53:38,344
You want to play snafu
with that body?

937
00:53:40,112 --> 00:53:41,113
Good.

938
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,282
Now, make it two heads

939
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,585
and put them where the hands
are supposed to be

940
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:51,190
and take the hands and put them
where the head is supposed to be.

941
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:53,292
And now,

942
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:57,062
I want you to unshuffle

943
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:00,865
until all there is,

944
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:05,237
is one perfect body
unshuffled, with no name.

945
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:10,109
Now, I want you to take
those revolvers.

946
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:13,245
And I want you to cock them.

947
00:54:13,512 --> 00:54:14,580
[revolvers clicking]

948
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:15,914
And I want you

949
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,384
to place them
directly up to the ear

950
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:20,852
of the body to your right.

951
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,127
And I am going
to count to three.

952
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:31,696
And I want you
to pull the trigger.

953
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:34,466
Alright.

954
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,370
And one,

955
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:42,041
two,

956
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,947
- three.
- [guns fire]

957
00:54:56,155 --> 00:54:57,722
[Wallendorf]
Cut. Well, how did look?

958
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:00,858
- Was it beautiful?
- I've never seen anything like that.

959
00:55:01,527 --> 00:55:02,661
My God.

960
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:05,763
We will organize this
footage to a symphony,

961
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:09,301
and then we'll broadcast it
at the stroke of midnight.

962
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:11,769
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

963
00:55:11,903 --> 00:55:13,372
That was pretty.

964
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:17,775
I knew it!

965
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:20,212
That's what rich people do.

966
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:24,383
Well, I... I don't do that.

967
00:55:25,517 --> 00:55:28,786
Wait, did this make
you stop loving me?

968
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:32,424
Not sure if it made
me stop loving you.

969
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:35,327
Just made me stop
loving overall.

970
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,031
Look, my dad is
a particular individual.

971
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:41,467
I mean, he... [chuckles]
he can make people do anything.

972
00:55:41,866 --> 00:55:43,469
Is your mom in on this?

973
00:55:44,902 --> 00:55:48,240
She's... she's...
she's in on it.

974
00:55:48,741 --> 00:55:51,577
Oh, do you want to go downstairs and get
another drink and then spy on my mom?

975
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,446
I know where we can see into
her room without a computer,

976
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,048
so no one can track us.

977
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:58,217
I think I want to have
two more drinks than go home.

978
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:00,785
[suspenseful music]

979
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:02,321
You always do all the drugs.

980
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:03,821
- [door shuts]
- That's not true.

981
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:05,557
Give me some
of the devil's dandruff.

982
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:07,993
[scoffs]
Look at this guy, Cynthia.

983
00:56:08,127 --> 00:56:09,827
You gotta shoot him
in the nuts, for sure.

984
00:56:10,529 --> 00:56:15,067
Hey, you want it so bad,
Rebecca? You do it.

985
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,835
I don't know if I can get
a bullseye from here at all.

986
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,871
You've been doing pretty
good in target practice.

987
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:22,474
It's not nearly as hard a shot as
the ones who were making yesterday.

988
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:25,244
It's true. You never
missed the target once.

989
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:30,416
This is a far more technical shot
and his nuts are a moving target.

990
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:33,585
[Cynthia] Just don't panic
or overthink it in your head.

991
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:38,991
[suspenseful music]

992
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:40,759
[screams]

993
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:42,494
Fuck!

994
00:56:43,262 --> 00:56:44,396
[screams]

995
00:56:44,997 --> 00:56:46,332
Fuck me!

996
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:48,233
[chuckles]

997
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,601
[groaning]

998
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,805
Damn, I know I'd miss, you guys
shouldn't have let me do that.

999
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:54,872
I wouldn't exactly
call that miss, now.

1000
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:57,409
Look, are you gonna let him suffer
and draw attention, Rebecca?

1001
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:58,977
Or are you going
to finish him off?

1002
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,646
Can you just do it like normal?

1003
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,348
- I'm shaking now.
- No!

1004
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:04,383
- [groans]
- This specimen is yours.

1005
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:05,484
Do it.

1006
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:12,624
Then I'm going to make a better
world for all you boys and girls.

1007
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:15,260
[coughs and groans]

1008
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:17,129
[whimpers]
Fuck.

1009
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:20,332
This is so gross.
Can you just do it?

1010
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,468
[Cynthia]
Oh, it gets addictive.

1011
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:24,937
You'll probably start wanting
to do it again in a week.

1012
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:28,507
I think I'm gonna get nightmares
for the rest of my life.

1013
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,042
Yeah, that too.

1014
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:32,945
[groans]

1015
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:37,349
[sharp thud]

1016
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:39,852
- You did it!
- Alright. Let's go check out the truck,

1017
00:57:39,985 --> 00:57:41,886
and this better be flat screen
TVs like it's supposed to be.

1018
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,524
[woman] Little does she know
her skin is gonna fall out.

1019
00:57:45,657 --> 00:57:48,026
Yeah, and then her hair
and her teeth will just follow.

1020
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,329
[both laugh]

1021
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:52,164
So much blood.

1022
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:55,601
- So many people.
- I know.

1023
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:58,137
Their timing was impeccable.

1024
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,776
- That was weird. That was really fucking weird.
- Don't worry about it.

1025
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,310
You can't tell me
that wasn't weird.

1026
00:58:05,744 --> 00:58:07,079
I can't unsee what I just saw.

1027
00:58:07,212 --> 00:58:09,281
Well, I'm telling you
not to worry about it.

1028
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,651
How do you not think
that was weird?

1029
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:18,190
[groans softly]

1030
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:25,431
Are you really gonna spy on your mom,
or did you bring me in here for sex?

1031
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:27,900
Ugh, don't talk about my mom
and sex at the same time.

1032
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:29,301
That's gross.
Totally not a turn on.

1033
00:58:29,435 --> 00:58:31,670
Sorry, it's just
a really confusing position.

1034
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,740
[breathing heavily]

1035
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:36,375
Pour some whiskey in my mouth.

1036
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:42,948
Please, don't use
the power drill on me.

1037
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:44,917
This is complete madness.

1038
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:48,320
[distorted voice] <i>In a mad
world, only the mad are sane.</i>

1039
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:51,457
He's trying to convince
you that you're crazy.

1040
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,058
Go away with him.

1041
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:55,427
[drill whirring]

1042
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:01,800
[Mrs. Wallendorf] <i>We both know that
you know why I have to do this to you.</i>

1043
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:03,635
[Rick]
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1044
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:08,106
I could reschedule for next week
about drilling a hole in your brain,

1045
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,210
but I'm sorry.
I'm just too busy for that.

1046
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:12,744
- [whimpers]
- It is what it is.

1047
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:15,481
I dropped the ball,
too busy for my pants.

1048
00:59:16,048 --> 00:59:18,083
Mm, it's all my fault.

1049
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:19,651
Many blessings.

1050
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:21,653
Your mom is completely
out of her mind.

1051
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,890
She's talking to herself. She's about
to drill a hole in that poor guy's head.

1052
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,458
I know. Let's watch.

1053
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:28,861
- You watch, I want to go home.
- Give me a sec.

1054
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:31,163
I don't know anything about
your ramen noodle food truck.

1055
00:59:31,296 --> 00:59:33,665
- [shouts] Yes, you do!
- No, I don't.

1056
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,735
I'm feeling claustrophobic and
nauseous, can you take me home?

1057
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:40,038
Look, it is completely up to you whether
or not you want to tell the truth.

1058
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:43,342
Okay. You have the power
to do anything you want.

1059
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:46,578
What do ramen packets have to do
with business or... or anything

1060
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:47,846
I would even know about.

1061
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:49,983
- [grunts]
- Mrs. Wallendorf.

1062
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:51,149
[screams]

1063
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:52,551
[laughs hysterically]

1064
00:59:52,684 --> 00:59:55,621
- [drill whirring]
- No, no, no, no, no!

1065
00:59:57,222 --> 01:00:00,425
[cries and screams]

1066
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,362
[drill whirring]

1067
01:00:05,464 --> 01:00:06,865
[chokes]

1068
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:09,101
[drill whirring stops]

1069
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:12,638
- Get me out of here.
- Hey...

1070
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:14,606
Hey, don't panic, okay?

1071
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:16,575
We can go back
to your place now.

1072
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,177
[panting]

1073
01:00:20,512 --> 01:00:23,382
You know, I'm actually kind
of sad that my mom killed Rick.

1074
01:00:24,216 --> 01:00:25,784
I've known him my whole life.

1075
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:32,391
[electronic music]

1076
01:00:32,524 --> 01:00:33,592
Oooh!

1077
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:38,463
You guys look like you're getting
ready to do something exciting.

1078
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:41,066
You guys look like
you just did something exciting.

1079
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:43,201
Yeah. What's up
with the costumes?

1080
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:46,438
I always knew rich people
were crazy, but I was wrong.

1081
01:00:46,872 --> 01:00:49,675
They're really,
really, really crazy.

1082
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:51,243
[sighs]

1083
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,412
We just came from my parent's
annual masked ball.

1084
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:55,881
Exactly.
That shit was not normal.

1085
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:58,350
I don't even know how to explain
what I just saw with words.

1086
01:00:58,483 --> 01:01:00,118
It does sound like something.

1087
01:01:00,552 --> 01:01:02,120
So, what are you guys
getting up to?

1088
01:01:02,554 --> 01:01:04,423
We're actually going
to hit up a supermarket.

1089
01:01:05,024 --> 01:01:09,094
- Can I come?
- You want to rob the supermarket with us?

1090
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:12,631
And I want to see
this crazy...

1091
01:01:12,764 --> 01:01:14,968
fancy masked ball.

1092
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:18,037
So I'll let you come
with us on this robbery.

1093
01:01:18,537 --> 01:01:20,906
If you bring me to your parent's
next party at their castle.

1094
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,943
There's gonna be another crazy
party there in a few weeks

1095
01:01:24,077 --> 01:01:26,311
so we won't even have
to wait the whole year.

1096
01:01:27,212 --> 01:01:28,113
Cool.

1097
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:33,251
Cane? [snaps fingers] Why don't you
go change into some normal clothes?

1098
01:01:33,385 --> 01:01:35,187
And Jennifer,
you can borrow some of ours.

1099
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,655
- [squeaks] Okay.
- Okay.

1100
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:39,691
[intense music]

1101
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:49,735
[music fades out]

1102
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:52,170
- [Cynthia] Have you ever killed a man?
- No.

1103
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,173
Not directly.

1104
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:00,846
[sighs] Well, there's this one
incident with one of my super fans,

1105
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,315
and he said he would kill himself
if I didn't fly to his apartment

1106
01:02:03,448 --> 01:02:04,951
to give him a kiss.

1107
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:07,586
[laughs]
Yeah, I know.

1108
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:10,023
And then he hung
himself and posted it.

1109
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:11,356
I think it would
be a lot cleaner

1110
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,858
for your energy
if you just...

1111
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:15,394
[sighs]
...killed someone directly.

1112
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:19,598
Jennifer, take the machete
and go make your father proud.

1113
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,301
Anyone with a heart
only tastes death once.

1114
01:02:24,937 --> 01:02:28,041
Just, uh,
skip on over there and, uh,

1115
01:02:28,473 --> 01:02:30,809
turn that security
guard into sashimi.

1116
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:35,280
And he won't even recognize you're
a threat until it's too late.

1117
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:37,649
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm scared.

1118
01:02:37,783 --> 01:02:40,419
In fact,
that guy probably has a gun.

1119
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,524
Aw... [sighs]

1120
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:49,795
[snorts]

1121
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:01,840
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

1122
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:27,432
[gasps]

1123
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,507
What the fuck? [groans]

1124
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:37,476
[grunts]

1125
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:40,980
- [groans]
- Good night.

1126
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:42,347
Let's go.

1127
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:45,517
- [blood squishes]
- [Cynthia screams]

1128
01:03:51,857 --> 01:03:54,227
- [glass shatters]
- [grunting]

1129
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:56,561
- Hit it again!
- [grunts]

1130
01:03:56,695 --> 01:03:57,729
[groans]

1131
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,432
[Cynthia]
Hey, get off.

1132
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:02,001
[Tressa]
Cane, get out of my way.

1133
01:04:02,135 --> 01:04:04,302
[Cane groans]

1134
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:09,674
[Jennifer] Well,
that was a bit disorganized.

1135
01:04:10,542 --> 01:04:12,711
[upbeat music]

1136
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:27,826
[Tressa]
Whoa, yeeha!

1137
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,628
[laughs, grunts]

1138
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:38,837
[Cynthia]
Get it, like, meat, meat.

1139
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,341
[grunts and groans]

1140
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:46,045
- [Tressa] Oh God, it's stuck!
- [Cynthia] Go, giddiup.

1141
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:49,648
Oh... Okay. Okay, cool.
Let's go, let's go.

1142
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,684
What are you doing?
Why is your helmet off?

1143
01:04:52,818 --> 01:04:53,685
There's cameras everywhere.

1144
01:04:54,653 --> 01:04:57,355
You're so anxious to hit the ball
and so afraid that you won't,

1145
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:59,724
you can't even see
the beauty of the fruit.

1146
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:06,331
[electronic music]

1147
01:05:21,013 --> 01:05:23,049
[electronic music]

1148
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:37,762
That looks pretty good.

1149
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:39,531
That?

1150
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,570
Wow.

1151
01:05:46,005 --> 01:05:46,939
Ah, it's good.

1152
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,609
It's like an explosion
of flavors in my mouth.

1153
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,745
What kind of steak is that?

1154
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:56,448
- Good cows.
- Hm.

1155
01:05:57,883 --> 01:05:59,451
I think we should
hit a house next.

1156
01:05:59,986 --> 01:06:02,387
I don't do home invasions.
This is not cool.

1157
01:06:03,122 --> 01:06:05,624
I've tracked a handful
of people on social media.

1158
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:08,460
They have, like,
$100,000 diamond rings

1159
01:06:08,593 --> 01:06:11,563
and crazy necklaces
and jewelry cases.

1160
01:06:12,198 --> 01:06:14,033
If you hit one of these houses,
I think we can make,

1161
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:17,103
like, hundreds of thousands
of dollars. No joke.

1162
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:19,638
Families are in houses.

1163
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:21,539
Cane, women and children.

1164
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:23,309
That's different
than the truck drivers,

1165
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,643
security guards.

1166
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:27,512
I understand about not
wanting to hurt any children.

1167
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,181
But why no women?

1168
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:30,815
You kill guys all the time.

1169
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:32,385
Why wouldn't you kill a woman?

1170
01:06:33,352 --> 01:06:36,621
Staying away from women
and children is customary.

1171
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:39,624
I think you just
like killing men.

1172
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:43,129
- What?
- Killing men.

1173
01:06:43,495 --> 01:06:45,298
I think you've justified
it in your brain,

1174
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:46,865
and you enjoy murdering men.

1175
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:48,034
Mhm...

1176
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,537
Cane, you've been
a missing person

1177
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:54,572
since you were, like, nine.

1178
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:58,010
If you disappeared,

1179
01:06:58,144 --> 01:06:59,412
it wouldn't even count

1180
01:06:59,844 --> 01:07:03,715
because you're already not here.

1181
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:10,855
[Jennifer] A lot of people like
to put stuff in their bags,

1182
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,992
but I personally just
like to put more bags.

1183
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,062
The great thing about this one
is you could fit a lot.

1184
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,030
What are you drinking?

1185
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:20,632
I just stick
to straight tequila.

1186
01:07:20,765 --> 01:07:23,868
I'm glad everyone's enjoying
all the fancy cocktails,

1187
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:26,205
but fancy drinks make me sick.

1188
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:30,009
Yeah, me too. Mm-hmm.

1189
01:07:30,142 --> 01:07:33,578
That's why I'm... I'm...
I'm drinking straight whiskey.

1190
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:35,680
Straight whiskey.

1191
01:07:36,282 --> 01:07:38,250
I love you all so much.

1192
01:07:40,286 --> 01:07:43,189
Stew, can I get more
coconut rum in here?

1193
01:07:43,655 --> 01:07:45,924
And vodka and berries

1194
01:07:46,058 --> 01:07:48,194
and want to add
some whipped cream on top?

1195
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:50,129
But you sure you don't want
the berries on top?

1196
01:07:50,262 --> 01:07:51,964
Because if I put the berries
under the whipped cream,

1197
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:54,233
- then it's gonna taste a little...
- Do as I say!

1198
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:56,735
- Oooh...
- [laughs]

1199
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:01,107
Cherries, cherries and rum...

1200
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,608
- Come on, Stew.
- Make it fast, hurry up.

1201
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:05,177
At your service.

1202
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:08,580
Now kiss me.

1203
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,149
You mean right now?

1204
01:08:10,749 --> 01:08:12,817
- When do you think I mean?
- [chuckles]

1205
01:08:13,419 --> 01:08:16,888
I just wasn't sure, uh,
sometimes you make me nervous.

1206
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:18,857
You have a lot of demands.

1207
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,227
Yeah? I'm demanding?

1208
01:08:21,693 --> 01:08:24,596
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

1209
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:25,897
Get it, girl.

1210
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:27,832
[laughter in the background]

1211
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:33,172
- Did you like that?
- Okay, I'm not really good at this.

1212
01:08:33,305 --> 01:08:37,009
And what I mean
by that is... that I did.

1213
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:38,810
Me too.

1214
01:08:39,478 --> 01:08:40,812
You wanna a sip of my drink?

1215
01:08:40,946 --> 01:08:43,282
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Oh, he's like a little baby.

1216
01:08:46,352 --> 01:08:47,253
[slurps]

1217
01:08:47,386 --> 01:08:48,421
It's good.

1218
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:53,625
Ha-ha!
Wow, well how about this?

1219
01:08:54,726 --> 01:08:55,961
- [girls laugh]
- [Stew coughs]

1220
01:08:58,464 --> 01:09:03,235
- I'm sorry, did I make you mad?
- No. You're like my favorite person.

1221
01:09:03,802 --> 01:09:06,005
[girls laugh]

1222
01:09:06,138 --> 01:09:09,641
Can you make me another drink
with this straw for each of us?

1223
01:09:10,242 --> 01:09:12,344
- Thank you.
- Don't mess it up, Stew.

1224
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:15,647
Oh, straw... straw.

1225
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,682
[girls laugh]

1226
01:09:21,554 --> 01:09:23,355
[slurps]

1227
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:29,594
You said I was
your favorite person.

1228
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,863
You are.

1229
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:38,504
Oh, I think we should give
these to some space.

1230
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:40,239
Wanna go hang out over there?

1231
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,607
[Jessica]
Oh, okay.

1232
01:09:51,383 --> 01:09:53,152
One of the funniest ones

1233
01:09:53,285 --> 01:09:56,956
was when we accidentally jacked
a ramen noodle soup truck.

1234
01:09:57,556 --> 01:09:58,457
[gasps]

1235
01:09:58,591 --> 01:09:59,492
- Oh, um...
- You okay there?

1236
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:00,692
Ramen truck?

1237
01:10:01,227 --> 01:10:03,596
Why did you, um,
jack a ramen truck?

1238
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:05,531
I was... it was a mistake.

1239
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:08,800
To be honest, it was supposed
to be Wallendorf shoes, but.

1240
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:12,171
We just... we just
ditched in a swamp.

1241
01:10:12,571 --> 01:10:13,973
Huh.

1242
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:17,977
What, um... what swamp?

1243
01:10:19,777 --> 01:10:20,745
Why?

1244
01:10:21,514 --> 01:10:24,583
Well, um, I was just wondering
if you could take a picture

1245
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:26,885
of me in front of the truck,
so I could post it online.

1246
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:30,922
You can't have a phone or any
electronics here or near the truck.

1247
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:33,259
- We... you...
- I know the rules.

1248
01:10:33,392 --> 01:10:36,728
The only thing I ever bring with
me is this antique Polaroid camera.

1249
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:39,064
They can't be traced.

1250
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:44,603
I will take you to the truck.
If you tell me

1251
01:10:44,736 --> 01:10:47,672
- the truth about the red shoes.
- What do you mean?

1252
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,243
I mean, they're...
they're just red shoes.

1253
01:10:53,946 --> 01:10:55,847
Keep talking,
I'll show you the truck.

1254
01:10:56,282 --> 01:10:57,016
Okay.

1255
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:59,118
- Catch up.
- Uh, Okay.

1256
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,389
[Cynthia] So you're
saying the populace

1257
01:11:03,522 --> 01:11:07,859
sell their soul for a pair
of red shoes that they buy?

1258
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:11,630
[gasps]

1259
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,898
You want to pose
for the picture?

1260
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:19,704
[camera clicks]

1261
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:23,775
[camera clicks]

1262
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:50,336
[dramatic music]

1263
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:07,286
[women laugh]

1264
01:12:10,723 --> 01:12:13,392
[laughing continues]

1265
01:12:24,003 --> 01:12:26,238
[grunting and laughing]

1266
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:31,776
[Cynthia} I don't think she's
gonna be conscious anytime soon.

1267
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:33,946
[laughs]

1268
01:12:36,448 --> 01:12:37,950
Just go home.

1269
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:42,787
[Cane]
<i>I'm not worth fighting over.</i>

1270
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:45,157
Cane,

1271
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:47,825
you're mine.

1272
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:08,514
[Mr. Wallendorf]
<i>Pumpkin.</i>

1273
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,455
<i>He's yours, pumpkin.</i>

1274
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,871
[couple moaning]

1275
01:13:34,872 --> 01:13:36,208
[heavy breathing]

1276
01:13:44,683 --> 01:13:46,051
[dramatic music sting]

1277
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:48,821
Jennifer, it's not
what it looks like.

1278
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:50,589
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what it looks like.

1279
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,624
Jennifer... Jennifer,
it's not what it looks like.

1280
01:13:53,891 --> 01:13:57,930
Yeah, it's... it's not
what it looks like. It's...

1281
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:00,165
[panting]

1282
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:02,101
It's what it feels like.

1283
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:05,471
Jennifer... Jennifer, wait.

1284
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:09,708
Jennifer, wait.
Jennifer. Fuck!

1285
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:13,178
[melancholic music]

1286
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:32,598
[moans]

1287
01:14:35,567 --> 01:14:38,570
[grunts and groans]

1288
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:44,909
Hold, hold.

1289
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:49,114
Hold.

1290
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:56,054
[grunts and pants]

1291
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:59,558
- Thank you, thank you.
- [panting]

1292
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,760
- Many blessings.
- [panting]

1293
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:04,329
I can't see. I feel dizzy.

1294
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:09,535
[groans and pants]

1295
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:12,671
- [choking]
- You're okay?

1296
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:14,473
- [groans]
- [gasps]

1297
01:15:20,179 --> 01:15:22,481
Ah, perfect. That's perfect.

1298
01:15:25,617 --> 01:15:26,819
I'm okay, I just...

1299
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:28,821
just didn't eat enough today.

1300
01:15:29,555 --> 01:15:31,924
Well, eating was our original plan
when we came into the kitchen.

1301
01:15:32,224 --> 01:15:38,230
And that's why I made you a
delicious, healthy, vegan ramen.

1302
01:15:40,299 --> 01:15:41,935
- [exhales]
- You should do what I do.

1303
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:43,769
- What is that?
- Every morning,

1304
01:15:43,902 --> 01:15:45,404
I have an entire block of tofu

1305
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:47,239
with absolutely nothing,
completely raw.

1306
01:15:47,372 --> 01:15:49,107
- Yeah?
- Then, no matter what happens,

1307
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,610
I'm properly nourished
throughout the day.

1308
01:15:51,743 --> 01:15:52,978
Really?

1309
01:15:53,879 --> 01:15:55,247
[sighs]

1310
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:57,416
That is delicious.

1311
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:01,420
Mmmm!

1312
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:03,655
Oh my...

1313
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,661
So, all the gold in the entire
ramen noodles trunk are gone?

1314
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:11,697
Officially?

1315
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:15,133
Without a... without a trace?

1316
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:18,704
- I'm such an idiot.
- No.

1317
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,706
- It's all my fault.
- No, no, no.

1318
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,608
[sighs]

1319
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:24,042
I did everything right.

1320
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:25,477
I don't know
how this could have happened.

1321
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:27,446
You know what they say
about plans, right?

1322
01:16:27,579 --> 01:16:31,350
"Best plan B is
to do plan A again."

1323
01:16:31,483 --> 01:16:33,452
- Do the whole thing all over again?
- Mm-hmm.

1324
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:34,686
It took years.

1325
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,456
I am confident
that between the two of us,

1326
01:16:37,589 --> 01:16:43,529
we can transport over six billion
dollars in untraceable gold.

1327
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:46,698
Then we can still fly away
to that secret palace in Fiji.

1328
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:48,100
- That's right.
- Oh...

1329
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:50,202
You're such a blessing.

1330
01:16:50,602 --> 01:16:51,870
[sighs]

1331
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:53,940
I'm sick
of my degenerate daughter

1332
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,976
and my power crazed husband
drinking out of my cup

1333
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:59,411
and putting pots on my fire.

1334
01:16:59,545 --> 01:17:01,680
Oh, baby.
Come here.

1335
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:08,587
[whimpering]

1336
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,657

[voices echoing]

1338
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:32,878
Family values,
human relationships,

1339
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,250
these are the seeds
upon which all success grows.

1340
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:40,987
[woman] What do you say to
all the people who think

1341
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:46,525
your commercials and photography are unclassy,
vile and encourage violent crimes and suicide.

1342
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:48,427
Well, you know,

1343
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:50,629
it's hard, darling.

1344
01:17:51,663 --> 01:17:55,001
I consider myself
above all else an artist

1345
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:58,770
- and a self-help guru.
- [questions overlapping]

1346
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:01,306
[man] What do you think about the
rumors circulating and the theories

1347
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,741
that your commercials are real?

1348
01:18:02,874 --> 01:18:04,843
What do you think
about the rumors circulating

1349
01:18:04,978 --> 01:18:05,877
that the earth is flat?

1350
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:07,981
[laughs]

1351
01:18:09,214 --> 01:18:11,951
[woman] Everyone wants to know
why you only make red shoes.

1352
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:15,854
Do you ever have any intentions of making
other clothes or other colors of shoes?

1353
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:21,094
My sense of art and design start
and stop at red women's shoes.

1354
01:18:21,226 --> 01:18:23,963
[man] Mr. Wallendorf,
what about shoes for men?

1355
01:18:24,097 --> 01:18:25,330
What about it?

1356
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:29,601
Men wear my shoes. Everybody
knows men love my shoes.

1357
01:18:30,036 --> 01:18:33,639
I'm not going to change my
design to cater to a male market.

1358
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:39,045
[overlapping questioning]

[whimpering]

1361
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:56,361
Why did you have to cheat on me

1362
01:18:56,495 --> 01:18:58,463
when I was passed
out downstairs?

1363
01:18:58,597 --> 01:19:00,399
I mean, what were you thinking?

[exhales]

1365
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:21,620
Is there anything I can do?

1366
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:25,190
Can I get some more
champagne, Nate?

1367
01:19:25,323 --> 01:19:26,425
Of course.

1368
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:30,228
You know, my name is not Nathan.

1369
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:35,001
Do you know who I am?

1370
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:36,668
You're Jennifer Wallendorf.

1371
01:19:41,206 --> 01:19:45,911
Do you want me to make you the most
famous bartender in town, Nate?

1372
01:19:46,045 --> 01:19:47,080
Of course.

1373
01:19:47,512 --> 01:19:48,780
What do you have in mind?

1374
01:19:49,115 --> 01:19:50,016
Make out with me.

1375
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:51,084
I'll film it,

1376
01:19:51,216 --> 01:19:53,119
post it and tag you in it.

1377
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:54,786
What's the catch?

1378
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:56,621
There's no catch.

1379
01:19:57,123 --> 01:19:58,457
Now, uh,

1380
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:00,392
get us two shots of tequila,

1381
01:20:00,525 --> 01:20:01,860
pour yourself
a glass of champagne,

1382
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:05,263
and let's do this.

is permanent banishment.

01:21:17,636 --> 01:21:20,806
Oh yeah,
way crazier than you thought.

1393
01:21:21,606 --> 01:21:23,375
I don't want to have
to hurt you.

1394
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,578
Just be one of my girls. Yeah?

1395
01:21:27,312 --> 01:21:28,647
Like everybody else.

1396
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:32,151
You have no choice. [laughs]

1397
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:33,819
Maybe you have no choice.

1398
01:21:33,953 --> 01:21:36,521
I mean,
they are your stupid laws.

1399
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,992
You really want to fight me?

1400
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:42,727
And the loser gets
banished forever.

1401
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:51,070
I thought you were my friend.

1402
01:21:52,972 --> 01:21:55,241
So yeah,
now I'm gonna banish you

1403
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:56,775
and not just that,

1404
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,312
I'm gonna beat you to a pulp.

1405
01:21:59,444 --> 01:22:00,912
[laugh]

1406
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:07,987
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

1407
01:22:10,022 --> 01:22:11,790
[chuckles]

1408
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:13,025
You're cute.

1409
01:22:14,026 --> 01:22:15,127
I am. Thank you.

1410
01:22:15,927 --> 01:22:21,067
Why don't we go over to the bar and
have Stew write up some combat rules?

1411
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:24,502
- Great. [mouthing]
- Great.

1412
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:26,105
[laughs]

1413
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:29,808
Stew!

1414
01:22:31,344 --> 01:22:32,377
Can I get you ladies a drink?

1415
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:35,014
- No.
- No. Stew, combat rules.

1416
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:36,315
Who's fighting?

1417
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:38,516
- Jennifer is challenging me.
- [sighs]

1418
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:41,153
You're... you're drunk, and you're
planning to use the bartender...

1419
01:22:41,287 --> 01:22:42,188
I get it.

1420
01:22:42,821 --> 01:22:44,357
- It's not a joke.
- Well, if it's not a joke,

1421
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:46,058
it sounds like
a really bad plan.

1422
01:22:46,192 --> 01:22:48,560
I already tried convincing
her not to do it.

1423
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:50,997
Yeah, she's insisting on combat.

1424
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:53,431
Okay, well, my job is
to write down the rules.

1425
01:22:53,565 --> 01:22:55,400
I don't... want
to get challenged.

1426
01:22:55,533 --> 01:23:01,606
Jennifer, you should make the choices
in regards to weapons and rules.

1427
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:03,109
We will fight naked.

1428
01:23:03,675 --> 01:23:05,211
[laughs] What?

1429
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,678
If you want to back out now,

1430
01:23:06,811 --> 01:23:07,812
I guess you're just gonna
get banished forever.

1431
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:09,447
Hey, I don't want to back out.

1432
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,617
I just think naked
is a stupid outfit.

1433
01:23:13,718 --> 01:23:15,654
I don't want to hurt
you that bad.

1434
01:23:17,522 --> 01:23:18,924
Yes, you do.

1435
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:26,032
Okay. I guess tomorrow
we will fight naked,

1436
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:27,400
and I will knock you out

1437
01:23:27,866 --> 01:23:29,268
and then make sure
you're safe

1438
01:23:29,402 --> 01:23:30,735
when you're unconscious.

1439
01:23:31,304 --> 01:23:33,672
And then I'll leave you in a
wheelbarrow in the middle of town.

1440
01:23:33,805 --> 01:23:36,309
Great, except you're gonna be the one
that's gonna be in the wheelbarrow.

1441
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,877
Okay, so let's get back to the point.
We're gonna fight naked

1442
01:23:39,011 --> 01:23:40,845
except for Wallendorf
red high-heel shoes,

1443
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,514
which will be
duct-taped to our feet.

1444
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:45,351
And the fight will be
tomorrow at high noon.

1445
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:46,918
[laughs] I agree.

1446
01:23:48,887 --> 01:23:49,788
[exhales]

1447
01:24:19,251 --> 01:24:21,988
I suppose love and gold
are somewhat similar.

1448
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:27,926
There's always murder involved
when the other one is on the line.

1449
01:24:30,296 --> 01:24:32,098
[electronic music]

1450
01:24:46,379 --> 01:24:48,447
[breathing deeply]

1451
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:50,216
[Jennifer]
How's it going?

1452
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,952
Um, I'm fine.

1453
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:58,790
I always eat a steak
before a fight or a heist.

1454
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:01,093
It's the only time
I eat red meat.

1455
01:25:01,826 --> 01:25:03,195
Yeah, make sense.

1456
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:04,696
[sighs softly]

1457
01:25:07,299 --> 01:25:08,533
[chuckles]

1458
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:09,935
[sighs]

1459
01:25:21,447 --> 01:25:24,682
Would you consider

1460
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:29,221
fooling around with me
tonight before the fight?

1461
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:30,588
[laughs]

1462
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:36,162
Crazier and crazier, Jennifer.

1463
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:39,664
Was that, like, your last wish?

1464
01:25:40,132 --> 01:25:43,635
Fool around before I beat
you up and banish you forever?

1465
01:25:47,073 --> 01:25:48,107
Yes.

1466
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:52,577
I don't normally
fool around with girls.

1467
01:25:53,412 --> 01:25:55,613
But if it's
the famous and infamous

1468
01:25:55,747 --> 01:25:58,084
Jennifer Wallendorf's
last wish, then...

1469
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:03,888
I'll do it. I might need an
extra glass of wine or two first.

1470
01:26:04,323 --> 01:26:08,693
You're playing it cool,
but I know you want to.

1471
01:26:11,464 --> 01:26:15,267
[whimsical music]

1472
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:32,884
[grunts softly]

1473
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,068
Do you wanna play a game?

1474
01:26:50,302 --> 01:26:51,237
Sure,

1475
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:52,737
whatever you want.

1476
01:26:52,871 --> 01:26:54,473
[chuckles]

1477
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:55,840
Okay.

1478
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:02,714
This game is called...

1479
01:27:05,884 --> 01:27:07,286
put daddy in the room.

1480
01:27:20,132 --> 01:27:25,137
[crowd chanting]
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1481
01:27:29,707 --> 01:27:32,077
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1482
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:34,346
Wait, wait, wait.
It's past noon.

1483
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,316
Let's go check her room.

1484
01:27:38,716 --> 01:27:42,454
[crowd]
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1485
01:27:50,828 --> 01:27:52,097
[gasps]

1486
01:27:55,367 --> 01:27:56,468
No.

1487
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:59,605
[lively music]

1488
01:27:59,737 --> 01:28:01,106
[woman]
Cut her down.

1489
01:28:12,151 --> 01:28:14,786
[footsteps approaching]

1490
01:28:16,655 --> 01:28:18,157
[music fades out]

1491
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:25,164
Hey, pumpkin.

1492
01:28:26,065 --> 01:28:27,466
Told you not to call me that.

1493
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:28,968
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1494
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:30,603
It's just an old habit.

1495
01:28:31,604 --> 01:28:34,406
When you were a baby,
you were such a little pumpkin.

1496
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,275
That's okay.

1497
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:38,978
I'm not a pumpkin anymore.

1498
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:44,782
And you are
a megalo-narcissist.

1499
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:46,218
Shit.

1500
01:28:47,653 --> 01:28:49,887
I don't even know what
a megalo-narcissist is.

1501
01:28:50,022 --> 01:28:51,823
It's someone like you.

1502
01:28:52,658 --> 01:28:54,693
- Mm-hmm.
- You've made what,

1503
01:28:54,826 --> 01:28:56,928
half the world
dependent on you, Dad?

1504
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,965
You're like a boy band,

1505
01:29:00,599 --> 01:29:02,167
corporate kingpin.

1506
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:06,272
A pop singer with rhythm,

1507
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:09,141
but no soul.

1508
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:12,444
What kind of language
is this, pumpkin?

1509
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:16,048
You playing a game with me?

1510
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:20,785
I know there's no
red shoes, Dad.

1511
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:23,788
You're gathering people's
personal information,

1512
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:25,357
storing it in your supercomputer

1513
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:28,460
and then selling it off
to the highest bidder.

1514
01:29:31,964 --> 01:29:33,265
You're a wizard...

1515
01:29:35,067 --> 01:29:37,569
turning people
into frogs just for fun.

1516
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:40,205
But you're nobody.

1517
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:46,378
You are absolutely nobody.

1518
01:29:46,512 --> 01:29:48,013
My, my, my.

1519
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:51,216
I guess my little girl
has grown up.

1520
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:55,054
No more reason to call you
pumpkin, is there, Jennifer?

1521
01:29:55,754 --> 01:29:57,389
There's no red shoes.

1522
01:29:58,157 --> 01:30:00,192
It's a house of cards,

1523
01:30:01,826 --> 01:30:03,128
smoke and mirrors.

1524
01:30:04,463 --> 01:30:05,431
Well, Dad.

1525
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:08,567
When you live in a house
made of cards,

1526
01:30:10,436 --> 01:30:12,037
you shouldn't play with fire.

1527
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:15,407
I'm initiating
the congratulations game.

1528
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,575
[scoffs]

1529
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:20,646
You can't initiate
the congratulations game.

1530
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:22,314
Yes, I can.

1531
01:30:22,448 --> 01:30:24,583
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I really can.

1532
01:30:24,717 --> 01:30:27,286
No, you cannot initiate
the congratulations game.

1533
01:30:27,419 --> 01:30:28,886
I'm the only one
that can do that.

1534
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:30,322
It's encrypted.

1535
01:30:30,756 --> 01:30:35,127
Voice, facial,
retina recognition software.

1536
01:30:36,128 --> 01:30:38,097
It is my most protected program.

1537
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:41,500
[Jennifer] <i>How many of your super
fans do you want me to kill, Dad?</i>

1538
01:30:41,934 --> 01:30:44,336
A hundred thousand? Maybe more.

1539
01:30:45,437 --> 01:30:46,572
Pumpkin.

1540
01:30:47,606 --> 01:30:51,577
It is impossible for you to
initiate the congratulations game.

1541
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,278
[beep]

1542
01:30:54,446 --> 01:30:57,483
[upbeat music]

1543
01:30:57,616 --> 01:30:59,385
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1544
01:31:02,121 --> 01:31:03,888

1545
01:31:04,723 --> 01:31:05,923
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1546
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:10,562
- Hello.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:13,565
[phone ringing]

1548
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:15,900
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1549
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,871
[baby crying]

1550
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:20,439
[upbeat music]

1551
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:23,342
[phone vibrates]

1552
01:31:24,977 --> 01:31:26,512
- Hello?
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

1553
01:31:26,645 --> 01:31:29,982
You just won a five-star trip
to the moon in a body bag.

1554
01:31:30,949 --> 01:31:32,917
[dramatic music sting]

1555
01:31:33,986 --> 01:31:36,155
[whimsical music]

1556
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:06,151
[footsteps approaching]

1557
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:07,719
Sweetheart.

1558
01:32:09,688 --> 01:32:10,989
What are you doing?

1559
01:32:20,132 --> 01:32:21,500
You stole my gold?

1560
01:32:21,633 --> 01:32:23,001
No, I didn't.

1561
01:32:23,569 --> 01:32:24,570
Chad did.

1562
01:32:26,538 --> 01:32:27,439
[scoffs]

1563
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:29,875
That's all my fault.

1564
01:32:30,275 --> 01:32:31,577
I should have known.

1565
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:33,679
<i>You should have known
but you didn't.</i>

1566
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:36,682

01:32:42,921 --> 01:32:44,223
Of course it was Chad.

1570
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:46,291
How did you know there
was gold inside?

1571
01:32:46,425 --> 01:32:47,893
And how did you know
where to find the truck?

1572
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:50,462
Well, Chad took me to the truck,

1573
01:32:50,596 --> 01:32:52,297
and then he took
this picture of me,

1574
01:32:52,431 --> 01:32:53,432
and then he kissed me,

1575
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:54,968
and said he wanted to marry me,

1576
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,069
and that he was gonna
take me away

1577
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:58,470
from all of this
with the gold,

1578
01:32:58,604 --> 01:32:59,939
and we'd go wherever I wanted,

1579

Instead of going to my room?

1582
01:33:07,779 --> 01:33:10,449
I came here to show
you the picture

1583
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:13,385

you what happened.

1584

and bring him here?
