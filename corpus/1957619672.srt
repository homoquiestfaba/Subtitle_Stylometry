1
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,862
(smooth jazz music)

2
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,195
(gun fires)

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,218
(footsteps thudding)

4
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,051
- John!

5
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,568
(door knocking)

6
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:19,401
John.

7
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,379
(door knocking)

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,423
John.

9
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:22,256
- Roy who is it?

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,089
- George, open up.

11
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,130
- Jesus Christ, George.

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,317
- Where's your brother?

13
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:28,964
- He's at the movies, what
the hell happened to you?

14
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:31,817
- Game sold out, it's a set up.

15
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:32,960
Go and warn him.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,353
- A set up?
- Warn him, go, go, go.

17
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:42,308
(suspenseful music)

18
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:29,976
- (gasps) Ron!

19
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,680
- FBI!

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,215
- Why no!

21
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:39,048
(gun firing)

22
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:40,534
(screaming)

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,784
(groaning)

24
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:53,672
(suspenseful music)

25
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,422
(crowd shouting)

26
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,219
- They shot John Dillinger.

27
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,219
(suspenseful music)

28
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,712
- It's John Dillinger.

29
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,265
- Two long years Dillinger.

30
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:29,171
(gun fires)

31
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:33,258
(melancholy music)

32
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:22,913
(suspenseful jazz music)

33
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,061
(alarm buzzes)

34
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,144
- So good to see you again sir.

35
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,607
- One reporter?

36
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,480
- 'Fraid so sir.

37
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,308
- Jack Barnett, Associated Press.

38
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,920
You mind if I ask you a
few questions Mr. Capone?

39
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,910
- Not much of a reception Cecil.

40
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,930
- [Cecil] Not like former times.

41
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,900
- Country seems to have a short memory.

42
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,733
- [Jack] Well in case
you haven't heard sir

43
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,140
there's a depression going on

44
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,210
and a war breaking out overseas.

45
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,230
- I'm Al Capone, I made the depression,

46
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,310
I fought my own wars.

47
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,709
I was the king of Chicago
before you were in diapers.

48
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,953
- It ain't the same out here anymore sir.

49
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,030
- What ain't the same?

50
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,150
- Things have changed.

51
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,591
- Oh things have changed?

52
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,900
What people don't like their broads, huh?

53
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,480
They don't like their hooch?

54
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,313
The don't like the ponies?

55
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,433
I tell you something young man,

56
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,532
if you had the balls to
half the life I've lived

57
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:00,365
you learn one thing about people.

58
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:01,240
People don't change.

59
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,800
They're always willing to pay good money

60
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,420
to have that dirty laundry done for 'em.

61
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,583
- Somebody els is taking
out the cleaning now.

62
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,220
- You think I'm forgot?

63
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,053
- No sir, I don't.

64
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,460
- No, no, you think I'm washed up.

65
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,920
You think some pissant taxman
with little green visors

66
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
brought down the king of Chicago?

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,005
- No Mr. Capone.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm Al Capone, you hear, I'm Al Capone.

69
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,970
- Mr. Capone--
- I pick my teeth

70
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,014
with a little shits like you.

71
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:36,390
- He's not worth it sir.

72
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,217
Please sir, it's beneath your dignity sir.

73
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,263
- Yeah you're right.

74
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,083
I don't have to do this.

75
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,260
Let somebody else do it.

76
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:56,679
You do it.

77
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,762
- Indeed sir.

78
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:05,573
- It's true what they say,
about the syphilis I mean?

79
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,100
- Oh I don't think Mr.
Capone would take very kindly

80
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,628
to the repeating that fact sir.

81
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:14,024
- No sir, I think you're right.

82
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:16,691
(ominous music)

83
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:40,560
- What do you think of Florida Cecil?

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,710
- Florida's lovely sir.

85
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,379
It's not Chicago.

86
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,183
- Huh, that's for damn sure.

87
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,010
I'm having nightmares thinking of that,

88
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,350
that half pint thief Gazzo
sitting on my throne.

89
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,250
Chicago's my town.

90
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,530
- You're not thinking of
returning are you sir?

91
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,970
- I've done enough thinking
back there in that rat hole.

92
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,570
Now it's time to do something
about that imposter.

93
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,770
- Is that advisable sir?

94
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,860
Our funds are rather depleted I'm afraid.

95
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,740
- Don't worry about it, I got a plan.

96
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,433
And when Al Capone has a plan,

97
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:17,390
Lou Gazzo better worry.

98
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,140
(peaceful music)

99
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:46,845
- Be right back.

100
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:17,182
(ominous music)

101
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,045
(sighs)

102
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,878
(peaceful music)

103
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:40,889
- [Sam] Mom, mom, look what daddy got!

104
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:44,885
He bought you some chocolates.

105
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,385
- My, my aren't you good boys.

106
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,226
What's the occasion John?

107
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,190
- Nothing special.

108
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,350
- Got some mail?

109
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,463
- [John] Yeah, what's for dinner?

110
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,820
- Chicken.

111
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,653
- Smells good.

112
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:06,398
You do too.

113
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:13,481
(ominous music)

114
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,623
- Do you have to?

115
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,403
- I gave this man my word.

116
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,903
- You gave me your word too.

117
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,180
- Look I have to return something

118
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,203
that I've been safekeeping
for someone for a long time.

119
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,310
Don't worry, nobody will get hurt.

120
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,110
- That's not what I'm worried about.

121
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,753
- Abi.

122
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,233
You know I have a past.

123
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,707
Maybe it's time you heard the whole story?

124
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:24,540
- No.

125
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,373
We agreed.

126
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,533
The past is the past.

127
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,893
For both of us.

128
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:36,471
(smooth jazz music)

129
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,932
(patrons chattering)

130
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,030
- [John] Hello Eli.

131
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:12,363
- Look at you, the dead man lives.

132
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,300
People still don't believe
I ran with a legend.

133
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,117
- Let's get this over with.

134
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,728
You can count it.

135
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,830
- No, anybody else but you

136
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,420
I wouldn't even see this.

137
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,520
- That was your share.

138
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,420
- What'd you do with yours?

139
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,340
Got the girl out of her
pickle and bought a farm?

140
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,933
At least that's what I heard from George.

141
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,657
Can't believe the great
John Dillinger's a farm--

142
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:48,490
- No.

143
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,130
The name is John Dalton

144
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,820
and if I hear anything else from you again

145
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,570
I'll cut your tongue out.

146
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,653
- You're right, moms the word.

147
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,190
- I'll see you around Eli.

148
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,023
- [Eli] Stay.

149
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,370
- [Waitress] You alright?

150
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,290
- How about some pie?

151
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,253
- No thanks, nothing.

152
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,786
That postman over there
is wearing wingtips.

153
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:23,782
- Yeah.

154
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:24,615
- Yeah.

155
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:30,697
- Well, wait to you see
the racks I'm gonna buy.

156
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,167
- The guys not a postman is he?

157
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,780
- He's a fed.

158
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,532
John I was just gonna tell you that.

159
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,854
- Oh yeah.

160
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:48,055
I knew it was a big mistake, coming here.

161
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,860
Has he got any company?

162
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,010
- The cook by the door.

163
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,340
- You traded me in.

164
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,493
- John, it wasn't like that.

165
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,013
It was the chair or this.

166
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,833
These two feds pulled the strings.

167
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:11,950
They're um, they know about you.

168
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,580
Just didn't know where to find you.

169
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,093
- They sent just two guys after me?

170
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,483
It don't quite add up.

171
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,323
- They ain't really feds.

172
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,093
They was but,

173
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,870
but they're trying to get reinstated.

174
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,883
Get some glory.

175
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,050
John I wouldn't have given you up

176
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,633
if it wasn't for the chair.

177
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,860
And I'm still not.

178
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,990
Feel under the table.

179
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,000
You taught me good John,
you taught me good.

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,313
- I taught you how to betray me and them.

181
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:05,773
- I didn't have a choice John.

182
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,823
- A man's always got a choice Eli,

183
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,760
and you ain't gonna like mine.

184
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:18,156
(screaming)

185
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:18,989
- Eli!

186
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,193
- Now hold it.

187
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,026
- Nobody move!

188
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,080
- You ain't gonna get away with this Eli.

189
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,109
- I'll kill her, I swear.
- No, no.

190
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,249
- Go ahead.

191
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:32,249
- I mean it.

192
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:34,357
- So do I.

193
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:35,340
- Eli.

194
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,786
(groaning)

195
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:39,286
(guns firing)

196
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,794
(glass smashes)

197
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,200
- Get down.

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,033
(gun fires)

199
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,164
(suspenseful music)

200
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,488
(guns firing)

201
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,821
- It's not real, I just got a fake one!

202
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,090
- Hey, hey, hey slow down will you.

203
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,340
- What?
- Slide over,

204
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,587
I'm just gonna borrow it.

205
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,911
Hang on honey.

206
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,911
(suspenseful music)

207
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,638
- I don't suppose that's the police?

208
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:26,471
- The FBI.

209
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:29,764
(gun firing)

210
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,420
(squeaks)

211
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:42,065
- You better hang on babe.

212
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:45,065
(suspenseful music)

213
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,147
(gun fires)

214
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,293
- Get this heap up closer, come on.

215
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,210
(suspenseful music)

216
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,797
(screams)

217
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,054
- Oh shit!

218
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:06,887
(screaming)

219
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,637
(metal crashing)

220
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:23,894
(suspenseful jazz music)

221
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,831
(groaning)

222
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,411
We almost had him!

223
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,828
- This is not over Dillinger!

224
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:04,423
- This'll be fine for me.

225
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,916
And thanks for letting me borrow the car.

226
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,543
- You know I'm a big girl now,

227
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,133
I don't have to be home by dark.

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,833
- I do.

229
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:21,886
Thanks again.

230
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:39,085
(distant screaming)

231
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,632
(ominous music)

232
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,199
Abigail!

233
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,329
Abigail, honey.

234
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:03,616
Anyone home?

235
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:04,449
Abi?

236
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:06,284
Sam?

237
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,316
Abigail!

238
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:17,396
Sam!

239
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,879
(ominous music)

240
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,863
(train horn blaring)

241
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:46,696
(train chugging)

242
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:01,779
(ominous music)

243
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,370
- I'm sorry sir.

244
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,550
I'm afraid these gentleman
will need to frisk you.

245
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,383
- I'm not armed.

246
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,650
- Oh it's for your own
protection, I assure you sir.

247
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,330
There's a frightening number of firearms

248
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,530
on the premises already.

249
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,100
- Nobody's gonna search me.

250
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,683
- Gentlemen.

251
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:54,923
(groaning)

252
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:02,433
(speaking in foreign language)

253
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,660
- Oh dear.

254
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,460
- I was returning it to your boss.

255
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,843
- I'm sure you were sir.

256
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,518
- (speaks in foreign language) gentlemen.

257
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:15,435
(speaking in foreign language)

258
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:20,400
This way sir.

259
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,100
Please don't be alarmed
at his demeanor sir,

260
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,470
he's been rather ill lately
and he's not quite himself.

261
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,230
- My family in there?

262
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,180
- Not at the moment sir,
but I expect them shortly.

263
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,620
In the meantime I'm sure there's things

264
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,420
you and Mr. Capone wish to speak of.

265
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:45,616
(ominous music)

266
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,113
He's waiting for you sir.

267
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,655
(balls clacking)

268
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,861
(groaning)

269
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:26,611
- Yes, look come on.

270
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,476
You don't look like a
man who robbed 57 banks.

271
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,740
- You don't look like
the kingpin of Chicago.

272
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,633
- But I was.

273
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,109
And I will be again.

274
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,500
Just like you I'm back from the dead.

275
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,363
Except it wasn't you who
died, was it Big John?

276
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,140
I mean how could anyone not recognize

277
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,853
the great, the legendary John Dillinger?

278
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,520
Even the stupid feds couldn't
make a mistake like that.

279
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,453
Unless,

280
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:22,550
unless the dead body was close,
very close, like a brother.

281
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:28,273
- It should have been me.

282
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'd give anything to switch it all back.

283
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,743
- Yeah I know John, I know.

284
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,763
Sometimes you'd give
anything to stay alive.

285
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:47,930
And sometimes you just want to die.

286
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,980
Know what I don't get,

287
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,560
is are the feds so stupid
they still don't know

288
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,460
or they just get tired of chasing you?

289
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,500
- I never went back to find out.

290
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,720
- I bet they're just stupid.

291
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,507
Oh, I know they're stupid.

292
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,060
Let me show you something.

293
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,143
(laughs)

294
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,830
I got something here you should see.

295
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,830
This is a picture of J.
Edgar Hoover in a dress.

296
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,453
This is why they can't
identify dead bodies.

297
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,730
- Yeah but you can
hardly make out the face.

298
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,870
- Of course not,

299
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,113
you think if I had his face
I would have done any time?

300
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:38,665
(laughing)

301
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:44,700
- (clears throat) Mr. Capone.

302
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,840
- Hmm.

303
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,993
- May I ask what it is you wat from me?

304
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,435
- There was a time I
wouldn't need your help.

305
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,490
I wouldn't need anybody.

306
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,910
I'd walk right in, I'd
take what belongs to me

307
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,830
in broad daylight.

308
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,160
Nobody would have touched me.

309
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,220
But I can't.

310
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:02,940
Not right now.

311
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,883
Not right yet.

312
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,323
So I sent for the best.

313
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,730
I want you to get something for me.

314
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,410
- With all due respect sir,

315
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,820
I don't run errands for anybody.

316
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
- Yeah, but you do rob banks.

317
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,810
- I used to, I'm a farmer now.

318
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,450
- I'm not asking to steal,

319
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,493
I'm just asking to bring
back what belongs to me.

320
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,000
And I'll pay you handsomely for it.

321
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:36,542
- Well if it's so simple,
why bother with me?

322
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,600
(speaking in foreign language)

323
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
- Now we're talking.

324
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,730
Let's have a little drink.

325
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,453
A little something special.

326
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,650
I think maybe we could be friends.

327
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,253
- [John] Oh yeah.

328
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:51,086
- Yeah.

329
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,293
I like to work with the best,

330
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,723
and I like to drink the best.

331
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,673
20 year old scotch.

332
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,203
That's right, 20 years.

333
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:08,519
What were doing 20 years ago Dillinger?

334
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,872
- Nothing I probably
shouldn't have been doing.

335
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:14,300
- (laughs) My whole life.

336
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,133
- So I hear.

337
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,243
No offense.

338
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,010
- All right I'll make it quick.

339
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,820
I got about 15 million dollars stashed

340
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,410
in a private bank Chicago and
I want you go get it for me.

341
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,763
Take it out, bring it
back, I'll give you 10%.

342
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,490
- 15 million dollars?

343
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,323
- About.

344
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,220
- No bank I ever hit had that much money.

345
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,293
- So you can see why I need
someone talented and dependable.

346
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,910
- Someone with a family.

347
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,703
- We got no choice.

348
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,770
It's fate, you and me working together.

349
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,833
It had to happen.

350
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,313
Fate.

351
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:58,436
(ominous music)

352
00:26:58,436 --> 00:26:59,269
- Dad.

353
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,180
- Sam.

354
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,343
- Nothing like family
John, nothing like family.

355
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,337
- [John] You said you
didn't care who I was.

356
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,163
- I didn't know you were John Dillinger.

357
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,450
- I tried to tell you.

358
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,900
- Well you should have tried harder.

359
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,110
- Do you want to leave?

360
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,090
- I don't think that's possible right now.

361
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,010
We can't go anywhere without his thugs.

362
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,594
- No, no, I mean,

363
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:25,063
you want to break up with me?

364
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,823
- I knew you had a past.

365
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,853
I guess I thought it'd just stay there,

366
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,910
- I tried to tell you.

367
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,993
- It's so overwhelming, here
we are guests of Al Capone.

368
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
- [John] I never saw the guy in my life,

369
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,410
I swear to God honey.

370
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,140
- You shouldn't swear.

371
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,973
- I'm sorry.

372
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,753
- What does he want John?

373
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:15,680
- You know, just some business deal.

374
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,050
Don't worry, I haven't said yes yet.

375
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,060
- He won't take no for an answer.

376
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,960
- That's why he kidnapped you and Sam,

377
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,810
but I might be able to figure out a way

378
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,643
to get us out of here.

379
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:33,049
(ominous music)

380
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:06,214
(speaking in foreign language)

381
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:08,502
(groaning)

382
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:11,502
(suspenseful music)

383
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,661
(gun fires)

384
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:31,909
- What's the problem here?

385
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:32,949
- Nothing, no problem.

386
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:34,557
- (speaks in foreign
language) What's the problem?

387
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:35,916
(speaking in foreign language)

388
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,474
- [Guard] No problem, Sir Al Capone.

389
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,557
- This, this is my guest.

390
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:44,850
This, this, this is Al Capone's guest.

391
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,713
What are you stupid?

392
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,480
You insult my guests.

393
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,963
You insult Al Capone, you
think you can do that?

394
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:51,794
(speaking in foreign language)

395
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:53,833
- I can buy your stinking island.

396
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,166
(gun fires)

397
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:02,703
Oh now look, I got to go change.

398
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,963
Listen, here's your hat Mr. Dillinger.

399
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,570
Excuse me, I don't think they're
gonna bother you anymore.

400
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:21,278
(ominous music)

401
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,080
- I strongly recommend

402
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,303
you do not walk the garden
again sir, unescorted.

403
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:38,286
(distant shouting)

404
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:48,526
- Weiss, Weiss is going down.

405
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:50,116
What are you telling me?

406
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,890
He's the one that made them
all look Swiss cheese ain't he?

407
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,723
Ain't he?

408
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:55,963
- Who's he talking about?

409
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,887
- Hymie Weiss sir.

410
00:30:58,785 --> 00:30:59,618
- He's dead ain't he?

411
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,852
- Not to Mr. Capone sir.

412
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:04,402
There's a great deal my
employer refuses to accept.

413
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,952
- How'd you like to be the one,

414
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:08,834
huh, resting on the floor huh?

415
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,742
Well that's crap and it's gonna be that

416
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,180
because Thompson's in his place.

417
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,060
Yeah.

418
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,173
You should just sit down and shut up.

419
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,563
Wanna sit down?

420
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,330
- So it's true he really is gone.

421
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,220
- Oh if you could have
seen him before sir.

422
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,890
He hasn't always been this way you know.

423
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,505
It's taken rather a
toll on him I'm afraid.

424
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:30,510
- What has?

425
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,792
- He picked up a nail from
a prostitute years ago sir.

426
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,140
- What about penicillin?

427
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,227
- Oh refuses to take a
needle sir, deathly afraid.

428
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:41,190
In fact I think it's the only
thing he's afraid of sir.

429
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,813
- Maybe there's some justice after all.

430
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:50,283
- No just another form of vengeance.

431
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:04,420
- I heard a shot.

432
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,190
- It was just wanted Capone's
mugs blowing off steam.

433
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,023
- You're bleeding.

434
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:07,910
- I'm all right.

435
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,991
- I got so worried when
you didn't come back.

436
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:11,160
- I'm sorry Abigail.

437
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,557
There's no way out.

438
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:17,965
You and Sam are gonna have
to stay here for a while.

439
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:21,465
(suspenseful jazz music)

440
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,235
- Thank you sir.

441
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:12,222
(peaceful music)

442
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:27,127
- Hello.

443
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,422
- Yes sir.

444
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,930
- You got a suite for Mr. John Dalton

445
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,700
and my associate Mr. Baumgartner.

446
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,477
- Yes sir, and are you in
Chicago on business Mr. Dalton?

447
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:38,623
- That's right I am.

448
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,393
- Room 404 and your
luggage will be right up.

449
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,570
- Got a light?

450
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,550
- I'm sorry I don't smoke.

451
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,210
- [Cecil] May I sir?

452
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,013
- Oh, here you go.

453
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,800
- Are you visiting Chicago?

454
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,623
- Yeah, business, sales.

455
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,403
- Me too.

456
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,780
Maybe we could get
together, exchange samples.

457
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,613
- Maybe so.

458
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:50,936
(ominous music)

459
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,542
(gun clicking)

460
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,323
I wanna case that bank right away.

461
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,940
Find out if there's any way
to get in there at night

462
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,090
so we don't draw any
unnecessary attention.

463
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,660
- I'll gladly show you now sir.

464
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,130
- Thanks.

465
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,963
Will you stop?

466
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:33,796
- Sorry sir.

467
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,693
This way sir.

468
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,920
Just a moment sir.

469
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,820
- What's going on Cecil?

470
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,770
- Bear with me sir.

471
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,653
- After you.

472
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,553
- This way sir.

473
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,860
Would you mind sir.

474
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:28,171
(suspenseful music)

475
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:34,667
(groaning)

476
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,250
Mind your head sir.

477
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,784
(people chattering distantly)

478
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,435
Oh dear.

479
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:50,268
- What is it?

480
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:51,101
- Shh.

481
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:55,697
(suspenseful music)

482
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,610
What was all this talk about a bank?

483
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,732
- I was speaking metaphorically sir,

484
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:19,028
it's rather a fault of mine I'm afraid.

485
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,628
- You got a lot of faults Cecil.

486
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,540
It's a bank all right, the mobs bank.

487
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,393
You got any more surprises for me?

488
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
- Can we go now sir?

489
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:44,546
(people chattering distantly)

490
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,810
- Ready for a swim Bobo?

491
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:51,728
Let's see.

492
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:53,640
(metal taps)

493
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,313
Oh, sounds like you're ready to me.

494
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,443
- Am I right or wrong,
that mug is Lou Gazzo?

495
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,450
- Yes sir.

496
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,180
- Mr. Gazzo I--

497
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,600
- What?

498
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,807
What's the matter?

499
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,883
Look, you're all hot and sweaty.

500
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,120
Don't you think a nice swim in
the lake will cool you down?

501
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,571
- But I don't want to die like that.

502
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,404
- Like what?

503
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,640
Sinking into 400 feet of water.

504
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,913
Wet, cold, dark.

505
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,620
Clinging to your last breath

506
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,520
'til your insides are gonna explode,

507
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,617
you don't want to die like that huh?

508
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,630
Alright.

509
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,142
Alright, then let's--

510
00:38:40,142 --> 00:38:40,975
- Boss!

511
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,693
- Let's see you die like a man.

512
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:47,752
(suspenseful music)

513
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,923
Go on.

514
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,363
No, no, no.

515
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,973
I said like a man.

516
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,721
Don't you want to take the
guy who did this with you?

517
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,343
Now you shoot me and Italo
makes up to shoot you,

518
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:09,176
nice and fast.

519
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,500
What are you waiting for?

520
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:19,430
- I don't want to shoot you Lou.

521
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,773
I could never hurt you.

522
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,143
I love you Lou.

523
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,807
- You do huh?

524
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,470
(sobbing)

525
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,679
- Look alright, alright,
alright, alright, alright,

526
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,029
come on, come on, hey, hey.

527
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,889
Take it easy alright.

528
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:41,972
Take it easy.

529
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:46,478
(suspenseful music)

530
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:47,561
Take it easy.

531
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:54,661
You alright?

532
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:55,744
Take it easy.

533
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,776
Come on give it to me.

534
00:39:58,776 --> 00:39:59,629
What?

535
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,223
You didn't think it was loaded did you?

536
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:02,056
(laughing)

537
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,690
- That was good one, that was good one.

538
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,523
(laughing)

539
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:08,636
- Of course not Lou,
you're smarter than that.

540
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:09,534
(laughing)

541
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,370
(gun fires)

542
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,203
(suspenseful music)

543
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,330
- Go ahead fella's, don't worry Bobo,

544
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,400
I appreciate what you've done

545
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,330
and I ain't gonna throw
you in Lake Michigan.

546
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,230
'Cause I don't want to scare the fish.

547
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,997
Yeah I like fish, especially
in Hollandaise sauce huh?

548
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:27,760
(laughing)

549
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,904
But I don't like you.

550
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:30,624
(gun fires)

551
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:33,624
(suspenseful music)

552
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,473
- Alright.

553
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,473
Clean him up.

554
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,020
- I'll go first sir, make sure it's clear.

555
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,853
- Okay.

556
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,728
- Hey what are you doing?

557
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:15,140
(coughs)

558
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,752
Hey I know you.

559
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:19,570
- Uh, I don't think so sir.

560
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,480
- I never forget a face.

561
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,330
What's your name?

562
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,140
- Henry and this is my
first trip to Chicago,

563
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,570
so I'm quite sure that we've never met.

564
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,713
- Oh yeah, well what are you doing here?

565
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,023
- Staying here.

566
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,653
- In the linen closet?

567
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,190
I know what you're up to,
you're stealing towels.

568
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,280
Now get out of here.

569
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,033
Don't let me catch you again.

570
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,767
Hasty (laughs).

571
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,792
(door knocking)

572
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,653
- Oh.

573
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,090
- That was very close,

574
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,590
but I don't think he recognized you.

575
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,640
- I'll take that sir.

576
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:19,170
- You want a drink?

577
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,170
- Oh yes please sir.

578
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,800
- So why didn't you tell me

579
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,910
you worked for Capone when
he lived here at the hotel?

580
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,743
- Sorry sir.

581
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,650
I've been in Mr. Capone's
service for some time now sir.

582
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,120
I managed his estate in Florida

583
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,410
while he was away in prison sir.

584
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,970
- Why?

585
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,320
- [Cecil] Sir?

586
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,620
- I mean why would someone like you

587
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,370
end up working for a guy like that?

588
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,163
- Gambling sir.

589
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,000
- [John] You lost a wager?

590
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,703
- Oh no sir, I was the wager.

591
00:42:56,806 --> 00:43:00,260
- Somehow I think I understand
how you must have felt.

592
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,250
Here you go.

593
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,630
- Thank you sir.

594
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,030
- So what am I supposed to do down there?

595
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,968
Rob Gazzo's vault.

596
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:06,920
- (laughs) No sir.

597
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,172
The money's not in Mr. Gazzo's vault.

598
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:10,530
- No?
- No sir.

599
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,140
- Then where is it?

600
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,400
- Mr. Capone didn't like banks
or believe in vaults sir.

601
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,950
Perhaps due to gentlemen
like yourself sir.

602
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:18,783
- Bank robbers.

603
00:43:18,783 --> 00:43:19,970
- Yes sir.

604
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,400
No, prior to going to prison sir,

605
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,680
he took the money
downstairs to the basement

606
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,523
and sealed it up in an alcove sir.

607
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,350
- I see.

608
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,050
And since then Gazzo has moved
his operation down there.

609
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,883
- It would appear so sir.

610
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:34,050
- But he doesn't know
anything about this money?

611
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,260
- Oh, I shouldn't think so sir.

612
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,484
The wall appears to be intact.

613
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,317
- I see.

614
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,640
This isn't what I bargained for.

615
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,170
- What you intend to do sir?

616
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,956
- I intend to contact your boss

617
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:51,390
and tell him to find another
dead man to pull off this job.

618
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,690
- Speak to him by all means sir.

619
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,757
- Yes operator.

620
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:55,458
Hold it please.

621
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,291
What?

622
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,323
- Hotel operators tend to eavesdrop sir.

623
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,520
- Never mind miss, thank you.

624
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,780
- Thank you sir.

625
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,490
Might I suggest a call
box in the foyer sir?

626
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,770
- You might.

627
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,603
- Thank you sir.

628
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:13,047
- "It gets curiouser and curiouser."

629
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,530
- Lewis Carroll sir

630
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:25,298
(ominous music)

631
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,553
This way sir.

632
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,139
- [Al] Is everything alright?

633
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,177
- Well no sir, everything is not alright.

634
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:56,818
You didn't say anything about the mob.

635
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,300
- [Al] Ah, that's exactly why it'll work.

636
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,490
They'll never expect anyone to try.

637
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,210
- Look, uh, Mr. Capone, uh,

638
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,105
these guys are like a
small army you understand

639
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,930
and no matter how much
talent you think I have,

640
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,240
I'm still only one man.

641
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,300
- Relax, you got Cecil.

642
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,060
- All right one man with a butler.

643
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,410
But either way sir,

644
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,280
this just ain't gonna work.

645
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,238
- If you need help, you need help.

646
00:45:20,238 --> 00:45:22,338
Of course they get paid out of your share.

647
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,693
Stop worrying John, nobody can hurt you.

648
00:45:26,983 --> 00:45:27,983
You're already dead.

649
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,623
- Hello.

650
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,320
Oh, I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting ma'am,

651
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,870
but there are some empty booths.

652
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,033
- Oh I know I wanted yours.

653
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,730
- Then by all means, be my guest.

654
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,970
- It'd be my pleasure.

655
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,553
- [John] Pleasure is entirely mine.

656
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,870
(clears throat)

657
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,310
- Shall I pack the bags sir?

658
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,143
- I think not.

659
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,699
We're gonna need some more men.

660
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:13,115
(ominous music)

661
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:42,130
- Mr. Capone.

662
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:46,851
Mr. Capone.

663
00:46:53,548 --> 00:46:54,465
Mr. Capone.

664
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,467
(groaning)

665
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,443
It's Abigail, Mr. Capone.

666
00:47:08,796 --> 00:47:09,629
- Hey.

667
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,340
What do you want?

668
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,860
(clears throat) What do you want?

669
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,720
- I've led a hard life.

670
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,033
I've made some mistakes,

671
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,200
but I don't want my
son to suffer for them.

672
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,780
Let him go, let me send
him to my sister's house.

673
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,630
You can keep me prisoner if you want,

674
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,281
but please just let him.

675
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:38,404
(glass rattles)

676
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:39,430
- Hey no, no.

677
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,110
Hey, I got people to do that.

678
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,193
Sit down, please.

679
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,947
You're a prisoner huh?

680
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,053
You've been in a real jail little lady?

681
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,943
Forget about it.

682
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,160
Oh you think this is a prison, well it is.

683
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,423
Not for you.

684
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,600
Pardon me, but I'm the prisoner.

685
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,100
I'm a prisoner in my own home.

686
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,410
- Let my son go.

687
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,693
Keep me but let him go, or I'll shoot.

688
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,590
- I don't want your son,

689
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,395
and I don't want you.

690
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,270
I just want to smell the
fear on their fingers

691
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,480
when I shake their hands.

692
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,543
- I'll shoot.

693
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,223
I will.

694
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,363
No.

695
00:48:58,204 --> 00:49:00,371
(sobbing)

696
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,273
- Hey, shh, shh.

697
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:06,680
No, no, no, no, Mrs.
Dillinger please don't cry.

698
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,143
Hey, don't cry.

699
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,820
Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed.

700
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,439
That's it.

701
00:49:14,439 --> 00:49:16,606
(sobbing)

702
00:49:32,992 --> 00:49:33,909
- Hey, hey.

703
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,573
Some big Buick just pulled up.

704
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,160
- So what?

705
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,617
Some poor slob died and
can't afford a hearse.

706
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:46,943
(ominous music)

707
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:00,739
- That's him.

708
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,330
- I'll be damned, our boy
just walked in the front door

709
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,810
like he was gonna confess.

710
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,363
- Yeah and losers don't
confess to nothing.

711
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,013
- Excuse me sir.

712
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,790
When is the next penitence service?

713
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,840
I'd like to get some things off my chest.

714
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,970
- We don't take kindly
to sinners around here.

715
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,752
- Then I think we're both
in the wrong place George.

716
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:42,122
- John!

717
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:42,980
(laughing)

718
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,836
John!

719
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,688
(peaceful music)

720
00:50:45,688 --> 00:50:46,542
How are ya?

721
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,975
- I'm good kid, how about yourself?

722
00:50:47,975 --> 00:50:49,010
- Great.

723
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,050
- What the hell are you doing here?

724
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,050
- I'm the custodian.

725
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,643
- George what happened to your eye?

726
00:50:54,643 --> 00:50:56,433
- Oh, rough night way back.

727
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:01,360
- You finding any wooden
nickels under the pews?

728
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,640
- This joint is closed.

729
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,400
The preacher here runs up
with the choir director.

730
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,128
I'm running the joint.

731
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:09,378
(laughing)

732
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:12,650
- Not a bad cover kid.

733
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:13,505
- [George] It would have been great

734
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:15,680
when we were knocking
down those banks huh John?

735
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,000
- Which reminds me,

736
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,523
can you take a few days off
from your service to the Lord?

737
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,637
- I just clean for Him,
I don't sing His songs.

738
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:25,530
- Well I got an offer for you,

739
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,203
but I don't feel comfortable
talking about it around here.

740
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,460
- Let's step outside.

741
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,240
- What do you think?

742
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,130
Let's go in.

743
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,403
- No, let's sit tight, see what happens.

744
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,893
Churches give me the creeps anyway.

745
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,753
- Hmm, me too.

746
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,690
I always hated Sunday school,

747
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,160
I never could remember a thing.

748
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,190
- It won't be easy of
course, but that's the deal.

749
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,090
So what do you say George, you want in?

750
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,400
- Of course I want in.

751
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,233
- What's the problem?

752
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:05,620
- I don't think I can handle Thompson,

753
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,103
you know I got a nephew,

754
00:52:07,103 --> 00:52:10,250
he's a spunky kid but he's dependable.

755
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,720
I can pay him out of my cut of the loot.

756
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,553
- Wait, what did he do?

757
00:52:13,553 --> 00:52:15,913
Did he pay you go along
with this daydream?

758
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,147
- I don't know what he's been telling you,

759
00:52:18,147 --> 00:52:21,150
but it's true we did run with Dillinger.

760
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,960
For a while anyway.

761
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,793
- Uncle George?

762
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:24,626
- Uncle George.

763
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:25,850
- He's blind as a bat.

764
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,023
- He wasn't blind then.

765
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,120
- No, he's a straight owl.

766
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,953
Even my momma trusts him.

767
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,640
He gets all wound up by pitch pennies,

768
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,700
you gonna tell me that he used
to run with John Dillinger?

769
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,740
- Yeah.
- The John Dillinger?

770
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,614
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:39,600
Yeah, I'm Al Capone's nephew.

772
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,140
- Well nephew or not,

773
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,740
how would you like to learn
how to handle some scat?

774
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:47,823
- Scat?

775
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,523
That's a Tommy gun.

776
00:52:49,523 --> 00:52:50,356
- Right.

777
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,410
- Oh boy would I.

778
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,213
- Good, let's go then.

779
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,210
- I told you.

780
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,143
Didn't I tell you?

781
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,400
The old gang is a mighty
hard bond to break,

782
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,203
especially when you're flat broke.

783
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:15,449
(laughs)

784
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,313
Let's move.

785
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:26,112
(gun fires)

786
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,318
- What the hell's going on here?

787
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:32,600
(gun firing)

788
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,793
- Whoa momma, this baby kicks right.

789
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,700
- As you have just learned,

790
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,900
when fired this weapon
pulls up and to the right.

791
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,650
So in order to steady it,
use your shoulder like so.

792
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,060
Grab the front, look down the barrel,

793
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,740
spread your feet like a prizefighter.

794
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,573
That's better.

795
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,440
Here's a full load.

796
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,750
- Uh, just to clarify sir,

797
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,000
is the object they hit the
bottle or leave it standing?

798
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,793
- Hey why don't you go shine
it someplace else limey.

799
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,000
Who cares for that stiff anyway?

800
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,833
- Al Capone.

801
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,378
He's one of Big Al's best men.

802
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:08,687
- Is that right?

803
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:10,620
How is Uncle Al anyway?

804
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,070
- Feeling ill I'm afraid.

805
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,670
He couldn't make the trip,

806
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,130
so I doubt you'll have the opportunity

807
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,680
to renew your acquaintanceship.

808
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,210
- That's a pity, that's a damn pity.

809
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,390
All right.

810
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,393
Anyway, this here, this is for Uncle Al.

811
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,520
(gun firing)

812
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,530
- Maybe we should have taken 'em

813
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,650
before they unpacked all the heat.

814
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,640
- Hold off, it'd be one
thing to catch Dillinger.

815
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,340
It would be another to
catch him in the act.

816
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,948
Especially after all these years right?

817
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:39,781
(gun firing)

818
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,614
- What about Jake?

819
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:42,770
- [George] Oh, he's in the army.

820
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,603
- And Matt?

821
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,163
- Jail.

822
00:54:45,163 --> 00:54:46,193
- And Phil?

823
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:47,913
- He's dead.

824
00:54:48,873 --> 00:54:50,963
- I'm sorry to hear that.

825
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,340
Where's Jeff?

826
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,300
- [George] Oh he married a doll.

827
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,323
Five kids.

828
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,610
- [John] It's not possible,
it's only been five years.

829
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,953
- [George] Well he's a happy man.

830
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:05,370
(gun firing)

831
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,230
- [John] What about Caplain?

832
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,060
- Would you use him again?

833
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,455
- If I had to.

834
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,400
- Good thing he's dead.

835
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,233
- It figures.

836
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,610
That means it's just the four of us then.

837
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,727
- Golly, you got a one-eyed Jack here,

838
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:24,490
you got a butler, a baby, and a ghost.

839
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,913
- How do you reload this thing?

840
00:55:27,174 --> 00:55:28,790
- I'll tell you what son,

841
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:29,940
when we get ready to pull the job,

842
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,770
you make sure you aim that
weapon at the three of us.

843
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,620
That way we'll all feel safe.

844
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,560
- You know what just because
you can get Tommy gun

845
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,610
does not mean that you knew
John Dillinger alright?

846
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,460
Anybody can get ahold of a Tommy gun.

847
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:43,323
- He's right.

848
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,730
- No more lessons for today son.

849
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:50,530
(laughing)

850
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,363
- What?

851
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,398
- Ah, Hoover's gonna have a fit.

852
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:58,720
- That's the point isn't it?

853
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,957
- This is a whole new ballgame now.

854
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:06,522
(ominous music)

855
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:20,470
- Shh.

856
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,045
Let her sleep, she needs it.

857
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,213
Do you like ice cream?

858
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,863
Me too.

859
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,603
I like vanilla, plain vanilla.

860
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,030
But you can have chocolate if you want.

861
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:42,425
- Okay.

862
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:45,213
- Yeah, come on.

863
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:48,943
Come on.

864
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,960
- [John] I figure we need
at least 15 to 20 minutes

865
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,120
on the inside, the problem
is how to get inside.

866
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,300
What's wrong Cecil?

867
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,070
- [Cecil] It's time I was
making a telephone call sir.

868
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,013
- Phone in the back.

869
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,280
- Beg your pardon sir,
but I feel rather awkward

870
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,030
speaking to Mr. Capone in a church.

871
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,630
- I understand, there's a
phone booth on the corner.

872
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,060
- Thank you.

873
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,043
- Be careful Cecil.

874
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:22,347
- You sure that blokes on the level?

875
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:24,760
- He's 100% Jake, don't worry.

876
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,910
Go on, what do you say?

877
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:30,732
- I think we should go in
through the loading dock.

878
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,090
- No, we go in the back way

879
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,050
they'll have time to wake
up and spread the word.

880
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,450
- Not if we blast 'em first.

881
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,080
- You ever killed anyone son?

882
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,530
- No sir, I have not.

883
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,183
- You don't want to, ever.

884
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,497
It ain't too late if you want out.

885
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:49,840
- No, I ain't afraid.

886
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,357
I mean George knows, I don't
know what he told you about me

887
00:57:51,357 --> 00:57:53,360
but I've seen my share of trouble.

888
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,373
- Son, go back and finish
your work on the junction box.

889
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,450
- You guys, you don't need
my my help here for nothing?

890
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:00,377
- No thanks.

891
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,880
- See I was thinking if we
go in through the attic--

892
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,030
- Let John figure out
how to pull this job.

893
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,463
Hey what about Eli?

894
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,223
- Eli is most definitely
dead, I was there.

895
00:58:22,555 --> 00:58:26,309
(electrical buzzing)

896
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:27,448
What's he doing?

897
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:29,148
- He's messing with the wrong box.

898
00:58:30,576 --> 00:58:32,273
We don't have a prayer do we John?

899
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:35,935
(ominous music)

900
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,940
- Good evening sir, it's Cecil calling.

901
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,179
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,

902
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:48,012
would you give me a minute?

903
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:50,290
Yeah I'm being entertained.

904
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,174
- Being detained sir?

905
00:58:52,174 --> 00:58:53,030
For what?

906
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,732
- No, entertained.

907
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:55,813
I got the girls, it's Friday night.

908
00:58:55,813 --> 00:58:56,733
Here take this.

909
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,653
Now listen, on the support.

910
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:01,616
(laughing) Watch it, yeah.

911
00:59:01,616 --> 00:59:03,570
Now once get the job done.

912
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,170
(laughing)

913
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,857
I want you to take 'em all out.

914
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,960
- I think you're pulling my leg sir.

915
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,910
I've never fired a gun in my life.

916
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,283
- You take Dillinger out first.

917
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,414
(gun firing)

918
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:19,294
(screaming)

919
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:20,460
(glass smashes)

920
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,430
- Surely you can't mean me sir?

921
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,980
It's Cecil sir.

922
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,791
Cecil, your gentleman's gentleman.

923
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,723
You can't expect--

924
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:29,040
- Calm down Cecil, you work for me,

925
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
you're gonna get dirty sometimes.

926
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,193
But you can always take a shower after.

927
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,010
Listen, if you don't do
it, I'll get somebody else.

928
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,674
For you and him.

929
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,761
(gun firing)

930
00:59:38,761 --> 00:59:40,095
(glass smashing)

931
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:41,550
Do I make myself clear?

932
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,383
Answer me.

933
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,220
- Yes, it's perfectly clear sir.

934
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:52,999
- Hey.

935
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,869
You're not gonna believe this.

936
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:56,820
- What?

937
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,721
- You're not gonna believe who that is.

938
00:59:58,721 --> 00:59:59,856
- Who?

939
00:59:59,856 --> 01:00:02,340
- Al Capone's butler.

940
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,760
Dillinger and Capone are working together.

941
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,206
- Dillinger and Capone.

942
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:10,039
- Yeah.

943
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,455
It's just getting better and better.

944
01:00:13,455 --> 01:00:17,596
- (laughs) I'm telling you,
I'm gonna be Attorney General.

945
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:19,800
- Wait a minute, you
know they used to say.

946
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,645
- What?

947
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:23,470
- They used to say that
if Ness had a run for it,

948
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,890
he would have been elected you President.

949
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,611
- You vote for me, I'll
vote for you, yeah.

950
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:30,861
(laughing)

951
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,760
- Well I got that fixed.

952
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,593
- So do I.

953
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,440
We're going right in
through the front door.

954
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,700
I always like going right
in through the front door,

955
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,560
didn't you George?

956
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,750
- I guess.

957
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,020
What about the mob?

958
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,310
- Don't worry, those mugs are
gonna let us waltz right in.

959
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,190
They're gonna beg us to come in.

960
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,076
They might even thank us when we leave.

961
01:00:52,076 --> 01:00:55,493
(suspenseful jazz music)

962
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,243
- Here we go again.

963
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,200
Five will get you, 10 they're packing.

964
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,343
- That's a chump bet.

965
01:01:45,212 --> 01:01:46,830
(door knocking)

966
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,760
- That's them.

967
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,841
- Should I get that sir?

968
01:01:48,841 --> 01:01:49,674
- Get it.

969
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:59,022
- All here, a piece of doom
but we finally got 'em.

970
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:00,430
- Let's have a look.

971
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,730
- Problem is we could only get three.

972
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,130
- They'll have to do.

973
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,113
Cecil, I'm gonna give you a torch.

974
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:09,368
What about the explosives?

975
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:10,201
- Jake.

976
01:02:10,201 --> 01:02:11,034
- All right now remember,

977
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:11,867
we're not gonna blow up the building.

978
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:13,000
We're just gonna knock out the power.

979
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,660
- Be just like that job in Terre Haute.

980
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,560
- That'd be swell.

981
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,000
- All right lads, eyes up.

982
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,610
Now you know that Cecil
and I have to lay low.

983
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,710
They mark our mugs or if we open our yaps.

984
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,420
So it's gonna be up to you
guys to do all the talking

985
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,630
and get us in that door.

986
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,940
If you can't pull this off
we don't get the first base.

987
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,080
But you can do it,

988
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,000
as long as you keep shining
these lights in their eyes

989
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,833
while you're talking.

990
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,440
George you're the foreman,
Billy you're the engineer.

991
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,030
I want you to study those blueprints

992
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,461
so you can at least sound like

993
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:40,500
you know what the hell
you're talking about.

994
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,100
Cecil, you're in charge of the car.

995
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,380
- Fueled and ready sir.

996
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,710
- All right, gentlemen we move tonight.

997
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,340
I figure if everything goes well,

998
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,490
we can get in and out
without firing a shot.

999
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,300
But God forbid if anything goes wrong,

1000
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,560
or for any reason we have to separate

1001
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,310
we all meet up at your Church, George.

1002
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,143
That's about it.

1003
01:02:57,143 --> 01:02:58,230
Any questions?

1004
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,340
- Uh.

1005
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,750
- [John] Cecil?

1006
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,900
- Something for butterflies sir?

1007
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,760
- Don't worry kid, you'll be all right.

1008
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,210
We'll make a bank robber out of you yet.

1009
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,720
Gentlemen, let's get into costume.

1010
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,950
Cecil.
- Thank you sir.

1011
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,560
- Billy.

1012
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,393
George.

1013
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,633
- Give me two.

1014
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:20,883
(coughing)

1015
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,787
No, hey who the hell
taught you how to deal?

1016
01:03:24,787 --> 01:03:25,620
- Your mother.

1017
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,593
- My mother.

1018
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:28,426
- Yeah.

1019
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:30,270
- Hey, hey he knew my mother.

1020
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,670
- Well I know your father.

1021
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,503
- Don't talk about my father.

1022
01:03:32,503 --> 01:03:34,300
- Look, I know both your families
all right and I regret it.

1023
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,600
Can we play please over here?

1024
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,433
Alright.

1025
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,266
Two please.

1026
01:03:37,266 --> 01:03:38,758
- Raise.

1027
01:03:38,758 --> 01:03:41,758
(suspenseful music)

1028
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,296
- They're moving.

1029
01:04:09,296 --> 01:04:10,213
- Let's go.

1030
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:17,512
(flame crackling)

1031
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:22,762
(explosion booms)

1032
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,196
(electrical buzzing)

1033
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:29,049
- What the hell is that?

1034
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:31,650
- What the hell?
- What is that?

1035
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,900
(groaning)

1036
01:04:37,009 --> 01:04:39,205
- What the hell was that?

1037
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:41,443
- What do you you run this
thing on, bathtub gin?

1038
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,195
- Hey, hey.

1039
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:47,130
- What, what?

1040
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,363
- All the lights are out.

1041
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:53,359
- Alright we'll take care
of this in 5 minutes.

1042
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,211
Good evening.

1043
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:55,437
- Elevator's broken.

1044
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,714
Everything is down.

1045
01:04:56,714 --> 01:04:58,132
- We came to turn the fuse on.

1046
01:04:58,132 --> 01:05:02,150
- No ma'am please remain calm,
it's just a power outage.

1047
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,410
- [Billy] Yeah we gotta
get to the junction box,

1048
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,913
it's up on the roof.

1049
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:06,583
- The stairs.

1050
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,734
Yes of course I'll compensate you.

1051
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:12,360
As a matter of fact we've got
a repair crew here right now.

1052
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,836
- [Guard] Yeah but you
gotta fix the elevators,

1053
01:05:13,836 --> 01:05:15,006
that's the whole idea of being here.

1054
01:05:15,006 --> 01:05:16,188
- Oh no, that's the
trip, we're the lights.

1055
01:05:16,188 --> 01:05:17,021
We gotta get down to basement.

1056
01:05:17,021 --> 01:05:19,940
- Can't you read
"Authorized Personnel Only".

1057
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,670
- All I know is, I was
sent here from the City,

1058
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,654
we're the Public Works, we
came over to turn the juice.

1059
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:24,487
(phone ringing)

1060
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,320
- Front desk?

1061
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,474
Oh yes Mr. Gazzo, we're working on it.

1062
01:05:28,474 --> 01:05:30,104
- That's up to you, you known.

1063
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:30,937
We can down to the breakers

1064
01:05:30,937 --> 01:05:32,770
and get this place lit
up in 15 minutes time.

1065
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,673
- Let 'em in, let 'em in.

1066
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:38,884
- I guess you're authorized, go ahead.

1067
01:05:38,884 --> 01:05:39,759
- Okay great, come on.

1068
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:40,720
- [Receptionist] Yes Mr. Grazzo,

1069
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,770
they're taking care of it now Mr. Grazzo.

1070
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:47,235
(suspenseful music)

1071
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:01,704
- [George] There's a short here.

1072
01:06:01,704 --> 01:06:03,691
I know there's a short somewhere here.

1073
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:04,550
It's gotta be in this door here.

1074
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,090
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you?

1075
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,759
- We're from the power company.

1076
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:08,712
- What have you got back there?

1077
01:06:08,712 --> 01:06:09,545
- That's none of your business.

1078
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:10,378
- No the hell do you say.

1079
01:06:10,378 --> 01:06:11,211
Do you know because that's
where your problem is

1080
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:13,003
and that is where your junction box is.

1081
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:15,128
- We'll get your juice back on for you.

1082
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:16,517
- You can't go back there.

1083
01:06:16,517 --> 01:06:17,820
- You know what, that's fine by me pal.

1084
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,620
I'm gonna tell you what
I told that guy upstairs.

1085
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,320
Dispatch called us, go to Lex first.

1086
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,290
We came to Lex first.

1087
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,103
- Tyrell, to come here
and turn the power on.

1088
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:26,130
- I do not know what is with
you people but I do know

1089
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,540
we've got 15 buildings up there,

1090
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,070
people are screaming give me
the power, give me the power,

1091
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:29,903
give me the power.

1092
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:30,736
So you don't have a
problem go over to Drake

1093
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,050
and set them up, do you understand me?

1094
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,360
Okay you can go buy yourself some candles,

1095
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,894
in fact that's what we're gonna.

1096
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:36,793
We're gonna go over to Drake
and get them all set up.

1097
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,044
- Take it easy kid, you're
getting carried away.

1098
01:06:40,044 --> 01:06:41,399
- Hold on, hold on.

1099
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:42,232
Excuse me gentleman.

1100
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:43,065
Excuse me boys.

1101
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:47,600
Mr. G wants the lights on right now, okay?

1102
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,119
So you gotta let 'em in.

1103
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,495
Just let 'em in okay, let 'em in.

1104
01:06:52,495 --> 01:06:53,353
- [George] Good?

1105
01:06:53,353 --> 01:06:57,060
- No wait, whatever you see
back there, you didn't see.

1106
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:00,070
It's none of your
business, you understand?

1107
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:00,903
- Scouts honor.

1108
01:07:03,642 --> 01:07:07,400
(suspenseful music)

1109
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,657
All right, here we are.

1110
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,723
X marks the spot, right here boys.

1111
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,720
Get those blueprints up here.

1112
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,760
- Whoa, whoa, that's just the wall.

1113
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,260
- No, there's a sub
regulator buried in here.

1114
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,290
It was built back in 19--
- Back in 1932.

1115
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,450
- [George] Yes before they remodeled.

1116
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,763
- Okay come on guys, let's get to work.

1117
01:07:28,763 --> 01:07:29,596
We've got to get over to Drake.

1118
01:07:29,596 --> 01:07:31,230
- [George] Yes to the boss.

1119
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,430
- He's young enough to be your grandson.

1120
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:34,130
- At least he went to high school.

1121
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:36,940
- [Lou] What up?

1122
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,200
- They're working on it boss,
it must have been the storm.

1123
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,624
- Oh yeah, we heard the thunder.

1124
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,060
- Hey, you gonna talk about the weather

1125
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,407
or you gonna play some cards tonight?

1126
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:44,400
- I'm trying to play cards.
- Well then play cards here.

1127
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,450
- I'm trying.
- Alright then two in.

1128
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,320
Let's do a little raise.

1129
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,563
- [Gambler] Oh pairs not
gonna do enough this time.

1130
01:07:50,563 --> 01:07:51,396
- You're right, that's right

1131
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:53,190
because I got a little trips with kings.

1132
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,023
(laughing)

1133
01:07:54,023 --> 01:07:55,110
Hey, hey my fruits are in.

1134
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,403
- Red flush, I fold.

1135
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:59,447
(laughing)

1136
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:00,280
(suspenseful music)

1137
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,109
- Where you want me to start Mr. Green?

1138
01:08:02,109 --> 01:08:02,970
About here.

1139
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,274
- Ah check.

1140
01:08:04,274 --> 01:08:07,090
- Wait, wait, what's he doing?

1141
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,697
- Transformer buried
there, we got to get to it.

1142
01:08:08,697 --> 01:08:10,100
- I thought you said regulator.

1143
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,280
- Uh, same thing.

1144
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,113
- Except for the ampage,

1145
01:08:13,113 --> 01:08:14,370
it's a whole different
story the regulator.

1146
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,786
- Yeah but don't worry about it.

1147
01:08:16,786 --> 01:08:17,619
- Excuse me sir, you'll want to try

1148
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:18,594
and keep your head clear.

1149
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,011
- Catch the dust.

1150
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,946
(suspenseful music)

1151
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:26,196
(slurping)

1152
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:29,713
- What are you doing?

1153
01:08:29,713 --> 01:08:32,103
What are you doing?

1154
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:32,936
Come on, go wash your hands,

1155
01:08:32,936 --> 01:08:34,683
you're gonna screw up the cards.

1156
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,783
Get a fat load of that guy.

1157
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,220
There it is.

1158
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,843
Hey Jim, brush that off will ya.

1159
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,843
What do you want from me, this guy?

1160
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,720
- Hey, Capone's butler.

1161
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,100
That kitty mouse.

1162
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,458
I, I caught him the other
day, pinching towels.

1163
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,970
- Here in the Lex?

1164
01:08:58,970 --> 01:08:59,970
- [Sal] Yeah I knew, I knew him.

1165
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,410
- Come on, Capone's
butler, get out of here.

1166
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,900
- [Sal] I never forget a face.

1167
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,030
- What was that guy's name?

1168
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,239
Cyrus?

1169
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,443
- No, no, no, no.

1170
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,958
Wait a minute, Cecil.

1171
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,980
- (laughs) Yeah right, so
what would Capone's butler

1172
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,150
be doing stealing towels?

1173
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,010
- Capone is a has been come on.

1174
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,833
- [Sal] He said he was
a guest and he got lost.

1175
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,612
- What are you talking about?

1176
01:09:19,612 --> 01:09:20,660
Capone is (speaks in foreign language).

1177
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,550
That guy he's got syphilis so bad

1178
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:23,490
he don't know what from down.

1179
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,170
- Yeah and I thought the
butler stayed with him,

1180
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,490
he's running that place
for him in Florida.

1181
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,420
- Well he did, he did.

1182
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,510
- So?
- So?

1183
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:29,510
- Hey wait a minute.

1184
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:31,960
The lights.

1185
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,200
Come on everybody.

1186
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,210
Down to the basement, right now.

1187
01:09:38,156 --> 01:09:40,547
(suspenseful music)

1188
01:09:40,547 --> 01:09:43,380
(hammers banging)

1189
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,863
- Holy smokes.

1190
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:05,240
- [John] Come on lads, get back on duty.

1191
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,073
Watch that door.

1192
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:15,463
- [Gangster] Stop 'em!

1193
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:16,463
It's a hoax.

1194
01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:21,174
(guns firing)

1195
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:33,440
- Get down, stay down, stay down.

1196
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:36,955
(suspenseful music)

1197
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:39,538
(guns firing)

1198
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,030
Is there another way out of this room?

1199
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,317
- I'm afraid not sir.

1200
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:48,108
- I got him Uncle George, I got him.

1201
01:10:48,108 --> 01:10:50,608
(guns firing)

1202
01:10:58,182 --> 01:11:00,432
(groaning)

1203
01:11:03,183 --> 01:11:06,266
(suspenseful music)

1204
01:11:09,249 --> 01:11:10,166
- John, go.

1205
01:11:14,142 --> 01:11:16,131
- Wake up kid, come on.

1206
01:11:16,131 --> 01:11:17,414
(gun fires)

1207
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:18,343
(groaning)

1208
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:20,676
(gun fires)

1209
01:11:22,523 --> 01:11:25,023
(guns firing)

1210
01:11:45,194 --> 01:11:48,194
(suspenseful music)

1211
01:11:50,117 --> 01:11:50,950
- Boss?

1212
01:11:52,844 --> 01:11:55,761
(flames crackling)

1213
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,932
(glass smashes)

1214
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:05,400
(screaming)

1215
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,981
(suspenseful music)

1216
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:10,731
(flames crackle)

1217
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,300
- [John] Go, go!

1218
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:33,009
(explosion booms)

1219
01:12:34,798 --> 01:12:35,631
Cecil.

1220
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:41,087
- You fucks, this is for Al Capone.

1221
01:12:41,087 --> 01:12:43,587
(guns firing)

1222
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:54,009
(groaning)

1223
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:54,842
- George!

1224
01:12:57,035 --> 01:12:59,452
(gun firing)

1225
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,087
(groaning)

1226
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:08,629
Cecil, let's go.

1227
01:13:09,741 --> 01:13:11,324
Come on, get going.

1228
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,559
(engine revving)

1229
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:27,344
How you doing kid?

1230
01:13:28,232 --> 01:13:29,653
- I'm scared.

1231
01:13:29,653 --> 01:13:31,009
- I can't see nothing.

1232
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:32,463
Cecil, give me that torch will you?

1233
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,190
Oh Christ, pull over Cec.

1234
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,638
- You think that's wise sir?

1235
01:13:41,638 --> 01:13:43,163
- Pull over dammit, I need your help.

1236
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,136
Okay kid, you're gonna have to hold this.

1237
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:47,060
- Alright hold it right there.

1238
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:47,893
This might hurt.

1239
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:49,620
- No, I can't feel nothing.

1240
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,760
- That ain't necessarily good.

1241
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,593
Come on Cec.

1242
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,510
- Would you mind stepping
out of the car please sir.

1243
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,730
- What are you talking about?

1244
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,520
- I deeply regret this sir,

1245
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,220
I must return to the
service of my first master.

1246
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,139
- What the hells the matter with you?

1247
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:04,972
The kid needs our help.

1248
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:06,550
- These are Mr. Capone's instructions sir.

1249
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,383
- To hell with Mr. Capone.

1250
01:14:07,383 --> 01:14:10,400
You're working for me 'til I
say different you understand?

1251
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,220
Now you got two choices.

1252
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,020
You get your ass back here
and help me stop the bleeding

1253
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,903
or you can pull the goddamn trigger.

1254
01:14:19,448 --> 01:14:24,448
Sorry son, you'll be alright.

1255
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,253
Easy, easy.

1256
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,463
- [Cecil] Will these do sir?

1257
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,760
- Where'd they come from?

1258
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,880
- Mr. Capone always
insisted upon fresh linen

1259
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,464
when he dined in the car sir.

1260
01:14:37,464 --> 01:14:39,197
- La dee da.

1261
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:40,030
- May I sir?

1262
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,460
I'm not altogether unfamiliar
with this sort of thing.

1263
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,403
- Be my guest.

1264
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,087
- [Cecil] Just pressure please sir.

1265
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:47,920
- Alright.

1266
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:53,280
- Sorry for betraying
your trust back there,

1267
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,173
but I had no choice.

1268
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:59,053
- I understand about the
choices Capone gives people.

1269
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:03,087
Hang on son, hang on.

1270
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,334
- I feel it.

1271
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:10,160
- How can I ever make it up to you sir?

1272
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,820
- You already have.

1273
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,130
- You guys really do
know Capone don't you?

1274
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:20,253
- Yes unfortunately.

1275
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,837
(moaning)

1276
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,780
- You get any feeling back?

1277
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,800
- [Billy] I can feel it.

1278
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,122
- Okay.

1279
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,850
- You'll be dancing on this before long.

1280
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,803
- [Billy] Thank you.

1281
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:33,708
- You try and stay still okay.

1282
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,050
Alright come on let's go.

1283
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,903
- No sir, like you I fear I'm dead.

1284
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:47,107
- Oh right, Capone would never
let you forget it would he?

1285
01:15:47,107 --> 01:15:47,957
- I fear not sir.

1286
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:56,660
- You make the best of a second chance.

1287
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:03,996
Good luck Mr. Baumgartner.

1288
01:16:03,996 --> 01:16:05,357
- Thank you sir.

1289
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:08,107
(peaceful music)

1290
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:28,899
(birds tweeting)

1291
01:16:32,493 --> 01:16:34,380
- Yeah, yeah we got the bleeding stopped

1292
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,992
but the slugs in deep.

1293
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,743
All right we'll be there
in 20 minutes, thanks doc.

1294
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:42,880
What's the count Billy?

1295
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,970
- I got 14 and a half million dollars.

1296
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:48,660
- All right, Capone is
expecting 13 and a half

1297
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,150
and that's what I intend to give.

1298
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,140
That leaves us with a million.

1299
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:52,973
No thanks.

1300
01:16:55,017 --> 01:16:57,698
- But George says I get like five grand.

1301
01:16:57,698 --> 01:16:59,387
- Well he didn't think you'd believe it,

1302
01:16:59,387 --> 01:17:01,727
but the fact is he was getting half

1303
01:17:01,727 --> 01:17:03,623
and he was gonna split it with you.

1304
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:09,740
- Wait, I get 100, I get $250,000?

1305
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,563
- No you get his whole share.

1306
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,970
- I get a half a million bucks?

1307
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,020
- Yeah, and do yourself a favor kid.

1308
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:19,853
Retire.

1309
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,560
- I got, I gotta know.

1310
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:28,621
Did you and uncle George,

1311
01:17:28,621 --> 01:17:31,020
did you really run with John Dillinger?

1312
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,700
- Yeah so what?

1313
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,992
- What was that man like, John Dillinger?

1314
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:37,880
- That man is dead Billy
and you'll be dead too

1315
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,360
if you think this kind
of life has any future.

1316
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,010
Now let's move the doc's waiting.

1317
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:44,010
Come on.

1318
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:44,843
Up.

1319
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:47,094
(groaning)

1320
01:17:47,094 --> 01:17:48,130
There you are.

1321
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,730
You stay put, I'll get the door.

1322
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,190
Feel all right?

1323
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,030
- Yeah.
- Okay, be right back.

1324
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:58,493
- Hey, hey, can I keep this?

1325
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,043
Like a souvenir?

1326
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,393
- Sure why not.

1327
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,140
- Hey, I did good right.

1328
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,650
I mean, I did good.

1329
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,893
- Yeah Billy, you did real good.

1330
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,703
- Look at me, I'm like a gangsta now.

1331
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,941
Top my world ma, just like the movies.

1332
01:18:19,941 --> 01:18:22,358
(gun firing)

1333
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:26,456
(groaning)

1334
01:18:28,612 --> 01:18:29,945
- Federal Agents.

1335
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:30,778
Reach.

1336
01:18:32,552 --> 01:18:33,385
Reach.

1337
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,853
- Man said reach.

1338
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,040
- You packing?

1339
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,290
- No.

1340
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,220
- Come here.

1341
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,053
Come on.

1342
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,567
Turn around.

1343
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:49,143
He's clean.

1344
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,450
- At long last, we're gonna get our due.

1345
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:57,600
Hoover's gonna have to
eat some big croney.

1346
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:03,838
- Well, well, well we
finally meet the mug himself.

1347
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,143
John Dillinger.

1348
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,265
- My name is John Dalton.

1349
01:19:11,265 --> 01:19:14,050
- (laughs) Yeah, you go ahead

1350
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,600
and play your little game Dillinger.

1351
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,760
We know the truth.

1352
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,520
- Yeah, you see, we knew
the man killed in front of

1353
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,250
the Biograph Theater, not John Dillinger.

1354
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,957
- Yeah, we just couldn't
prove it that's all.

1355
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:25,133
- And you still can't.

1356
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:29,100
- Are you trying to tell me
that I can't prove who you are?

1357
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,173
- Maybe, maybe not.

1358
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,100
Say do you mind if I have a smoke?

1359
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,303
Kind of calm my nerves.

1360
01:19:37,153 --> 01:19:39,140
- In a Church?

1361
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,290
- Could be my last one.

1362
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,380
- Sure.

1363
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,213
- Thanks.

1364
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:56,493
- Hey well Gil, look in here.

1365
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,500
- Hey, my, my.

1366
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,360
Looks like we caught up with
you at just the right time,

1367
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,193
doesn't it?

1368
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,067
- What do we got here?

1369
01:20:08,067 --> 01:20:10,403
- 14 and a half a million.

1370
01:20:13,402 --> 01:20:15,002
- It's the missing Capone money.

1371
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,123
So we get all this and the
real John Dillinger too.

1372
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,653
This is real interesting.

1373
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,533
You, uh, thinking about
the same thing I am Gil?

1374
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,862
- Yes I am Frank.

1375
01:20:31,862 --> 01:20:34,279
(gun firing)

1376
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:40,289
(suspenseful music)

1377
01:20:40,289 --> 01:20:42,622
(groaning)

1378
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,513
- We're in Church.

1379
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:58,070
- Well as you can see,
I'm a little tore up here.

1380
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,510
- Yeah, how's that?

1381
01:21:01,432 --> 01:21:02,540
- You see on one hand

1382
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,980
I could not only be the man
who brought in Dillinger,

1383
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,690
but I could be the man
who brought in Dillinger

1384
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,910
with Capone's hidden stash.

1385
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:15,117
Saying I could be a hero.

1386
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:16,709
And the other.

1387
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:19,593
(laughs) I could be very rich.

1388
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,963
- I'll make that easy kid,

1389
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:24,858
you're gonna have to make a choice.

1390
01:21:24,858 --> 01:21:26,617
- How you figure huh?

1391
01:21:28,407 --> 01:21:30,533
'Cause I got the money and I got the gun.

1392
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,863
- I got this.

1393
01:21:35,898 --> 01:21:37,170
- What are you doing?

1394
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,980
- I toss it and the money's gone,

1395
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,430
or you catch it and I'm gone.

1396
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:46,900
Either way you're gonna
have to make a choice.

1397
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,690
You can't have both.

1398
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:49,523
- Oh you.

1399
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,733
- Come on kid, not much time left.

1400
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,060
- No you wouldn't do that.

1401
01:21:58,233 --> 01:21:59,540
- Hey you like baseball?

1402
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,750
- What?

1403
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,658
- Baseball.

1404
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:02,683
You like to play baseball?

1405
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,120
- I love baseball.

1406
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,041
- Yeah, me too.

1407
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:07,874
Catch.

1408
01:22:10,484 --> 01:22:13,282
(explosion booms)

1409
01:22:13,282 --> 01:22:17,865
(operatic singing in foreign language)

1410
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:45,911
- I've got a problem.

1411
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,003
I got a problem.

1412
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:56,963
Well I got a good man,
and I got a lot of money.

1413
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:04,240
The man's meant me no
harm, but it's my money

1414
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,603
and I gotta make a choice, I gotta.

1415
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:14,531
(suspenseful music)

1416
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:19,150
Yeah, yeah you're right.

1417
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,273
It's the money.

1418
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,433
The money makes it go.

1419
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:25,993
The money makes me king.

1420
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,893
You know that's why we get along.

1421
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:33,463
Yeah you can't trust anybody
or anything but the money.

1422
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:36,426
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1423
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:37,890
Hey I'm talking to you huh.

1424
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,277
Turn around.

1425
01:23:39,277 --> 01:23:40,950
(gun fires)

1426
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:41,900
That's for nothing.

1427
01:23:44,724 --> 01:23:46,141
Get me the woman!

1428
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:48,400
Get me the woman.

1429
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:53,604
(suspenseful music)

1430
01:24:03,778 --> 01:24:06,028
(groaning)

1431
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,452
- Your prayers are answered son.

1432
01:24:22,452 --> 01:24:23,452
- Dad.
- Shh.

1433
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,250
- We're getting out of
here, where's your mother?

1434
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,840
- She's down the hall.

1435
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,110
- Is there a guard at this door?

1436
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:31,893
- No, he's around the corner.

1437
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,850
- You think you can get
him to turn his back to me?

1438
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,230
Okay.
- Alright.

1439
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:40,633
- Be careful.
- Yes dad.

1440
01:24:50,545 --> 01:24:51,690
(speaking in foreign language)

1441
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:52,849
- Getting ice cream.

1442
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:57,000
(speaking in foreign language)

1443
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,650
- [Abigail] You wanted to see me?

1444
01:25:00,741 --> 01:25:02,433
- Yeah listen Kitty,

1445
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,580
clean up that mess.

1446
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,923
I made a mess.

1447
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm sorry boo, I thought he
was taking my money I had to.

1448
01:25:24,442 --> 01:25:26,942
- It's okay, I'll clean it up.

1449
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,023
- It's okay?

1450
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,810
What do you mean it's okay?

1451
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,393
You two-timing slut.

1452
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:40,913
You've been pulling his
bell-rope, huh Kitty?

1453
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,800
You're supposed to belong to me.

1454
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,100
- Mr. Capone, I'm not Kitty, I'm Abigail.

1455
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,732
- You liar.

1456
01:25:47,732 --> 01:25:48,650
(gun fires)

1457
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,817
(screams)

1458
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:59,222
It's beautiful how a gun can
clean up all your messes.

1459
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:01,720
Kitty you ain't dead?

1460
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:08,200
Here Kitty.

1461
01:26:10,516 --> 01:26:13,531
Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

1462
01:26:13,531 --> 01:26:14,596
Here.

1463
01:26:14,596 --> 01:26:16,596
- Stay here, don't move.

1464
01:26:25,405 --> 01:26:27,905
(guns firing)

1465
01:26:30,373 --> 01:26:32,623
(groaning)

1466
01:26:35,216 --> 01:26:36,071
(suspenseful music)

1467
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:36,904
- Weiss.

1468
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:39,149
In my own home!

1469
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:43,533
I'm in here Weiss.

1470
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:47,041
(guns firing)

1471
01:26:50,224 --> 01:26:52,891
(glass smashes)

1472
01:26:54,332 --> 01:26:55,165
Yeah.

1473
01:26:58,211 --> 01:26:59,435
Let me get it.

1474
01:26:59,435 --> 01:27:00,984
(gun firing)

1475
01:27:00,984 --> 01:27:03,651
(glass smashes)

1476
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,983
- Cecil, is that you Cecil?

1477
01:27:25,352 --> 01:27:27,230
Did you get Weiss?

1478
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:28,303
How'd he get away?

1479
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,263
- I'm afraid he's got away sir.

1480
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,100
- That's alright, that's good.

1481
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:37,973
He'll be back.

1482
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,343
It's like old times.

1483
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,220
I'm back on top Cecil, I am back on top.

1484
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:51,000
I can always tell when the
blood flows and it ain't mine.

1485
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,573
I am back on top.

1486
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,019
To the king of Chicago.

1487
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,103
Maybe we'll go to Florida for the winter.

1488
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:09,057
Treat the boys to some Cuban
nookie and some spiced rum huh?

1489
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:18,393
Do I have reading glasses Cecil?

1490
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:19,993
I can't see a damn thing.

1491
01:28:22,424 --> 01:28:25,091
(ominous music)

1492
01:29:01,928 --> 01:29:05,011
Oh Cecil, make the plans for Florida.

1493
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,633
- Very well sir, I shall
make all the arrangements.

1494
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:17,179
- Sam.

1495
01:29:17,179 --> 01:29:18,500
No, honey.

1496
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,840
- Sam what do you think you're doing?

1497
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,100
- He was gonna kill my mom.

1498
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,517
- Wait a second, think about it.

1499
01:29:24,717 --> 01:29:25,853
Now look at that man.

1500
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:29,250
If you pull that trigger
you'll be killing yourself son,

1501
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,203
not Al Capone.

1502
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:33,520
- But he was gonna kill my mom.

1503
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:37,430
- I could take that gun away from you,

1504
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:38,997
but this has to be your choice.

1505
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:43,535
(gun clicks)

1506
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:44,368
Sam.

1507
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:47,912
Atta boy.

1508
01:29:49,034 --> 01:29:49,867
Atta boy.

1509
01:29:59,637 --> 01:30:04,220
(operatic singing in foreign language)

1510
01:30:14,136 --> 01:30:17,136
(suspenseful music)

1511
01:30:47,804 --> 01:30:50,554
(peaceful music)

1512
01:31:14,721 --> 01:31:18,138
(suspenseful jazz music)

1513
01:33:14,274 --> 01:33:17,274
(melancholy music)
