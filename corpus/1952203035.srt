TO DO WITH THAT.

661
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,871
THIS HAS TO DO WITH
THE STAGGERING SPEED AT
WHICH OUR NATION'S MORALS...

662
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,375
ARE SPIRALING
OUT OF CONTROL.
JUST STICK TO MY SCRIPT.

663
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,344
OR MORE SIMPLY PUT,
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG.

664
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,780
WHAT ADAM FISHER DID
WAS WRONG.

665
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:04,288
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
WE PUNISHED SUCH BEHAVIOR
WITH APPROPRIATE MEASURES.

666
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,791
UNFORTUNATELY,
CASTRATION HAS BEEN DEEMED
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.

667
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:11,745
THEREFORE, I INTEND
TO SEEK THE HARSHEST
POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT...

668
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,249
UNDER COMMON
"CRIMINAL CODDLING" LAWS.

669
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,252
THAT IS 40 YEARS
IN THE STATE
PENITENTIARY.

670

DOWN THE RIVER.

VOTE STONE.

00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,763
AND I MEAN BUSINESS.

GONNA COST ME?

I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER...

00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,843
TO MAKE SURE THAT ADAM
DOESN'T GO TO PRISON.

WAS KNOCK UP THIS

WE'RE OVERREACTING HERE?

YES!

I HAVE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT,

704

MR. CLOPPERMAN,
YOU'RE DOING
THE QUESTIONING.

1153
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,325
I KNOW THAT.

1154
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,743
WE DIDN'T!

1155
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,562
WE-- WE DIDN'T.
THAT'S RIGHT.

1156
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:38,997
THE COURT ORDERED US
TO BE PARTED,

1157
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,999
AND WE CAN NO LONGER
SEE EACH OTHER.

1158
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,886
OUR TRUE LOVE WAS... SQUASHED.

01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,873
- QUASHED.
- YEAH. QUASHED.

HAVE YOU SEEN G.A.G.
SINCE THE COURT
TORE YOU APART?

EITHER YES OR NO.

1164
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,873
NO...

1165
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:05,874

"TREALLY"?

1167

YOUR ANSWER--
"TREALLY" MEANS "NO"!

1168
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,515
JUST ONE WORD.

1169
01:14:19,505 --> 01:14:21,940
NO.

BUT...

1171
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:28,347
BUT, WELL, I JUST
WANT TO SAY THAT...

1172
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:30,849
I KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE THE LAWS,

1173
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,351
THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS AND ALL,

1174
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:37,189
AND I'M USUALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT NOT BREAKING THEM.

1175
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,641
LOOK, WHAT I MEAN IS,

1176
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,977
I GUESS I KINDA SCREWED UP,

1177
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,480
AND... I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1178
01:14:46,365 --> 01:14:49,368
WHEN MIKE MUBORN
BLEW UP THE CHEMISTRY LAB
TRYING TO BUILD DYNAMITE,

1179
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:52,371
AND ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS PICK UP TRASH.

1180
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:56,842
SO I THINK IT'D BE
A LITTLE UNFAIR IF GET
LOCKED AWAY FOR 20 TO 40.

1181
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,277
DON'T YOU?

ABSOLUTELY.

1184

THAT SHE IS PREGNANT
WITH YOUR BABY.

SUPPORT THAT CHILD?

1186
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,210
YES. YES, I WILL.

1187

OF YOU, ADAM.

MR. CLOPPERMAN'S

COMMITTED THE ACT
THREE TIMES WITH G.A.G...

BEFORE SHE REACHED
THE AGE OF 16,

1198
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,420
YOU MUST FIND HIM GUILTY.

[ Amber ]
OKAY, SO MY BOYFRIEND KNOCKED UP
AN UNDERAGED GIRL TWICE.

1200

DOES THAT MEAN HE HAS TO SPEND
MY CHILDBEARING YEARS
BEHIND BARS?

1201
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,887
I PRAYED THAT THE JURY
WOULD SEE BEYOND THE HYPE,

THE SENSATIONALISM,
THE CHEAP, TAWDRY DETAILS
OF ADAM'S INDISCRETION...
