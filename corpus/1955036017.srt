[soft piano music plays]

2
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,182
[Tom] I love being a stand-up comedian.

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,978
It's the best job in the world.

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,523
And I love being an L.A. comic.

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,607
Bam!

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,942
Alfred the assassin.

7
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:29,488
As a comic, what you're supposed to do
is live your life and report it.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,323
[woman] Anytime I do
something nice for you,

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,617
- you shit on me!
- When is that?!

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,994
I love the whole process.

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,453
[woman] You have a little dick.

12
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,372
Writing. Performing.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,876
Figuring out how to make a joke work.

14
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,169
It's the best.

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,757
But most of all,
I love meeting the people of this city.

16
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,052
- They always inspire me.
- [shouting] Hey!

17
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,763
Tom Segura!

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:58,183
Bite me in my ass, man! Aah!

19
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,685
You have to do it!

20
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,189
I love them.
They have nothing but admiration for me.

00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,774
[speaks foreign language]

22
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,276
Yeah, after work we can do whatever, man.

[speaks foreign language]

24
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,907
I just know there's no stopping us.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,617
Hey! Who this fat-ass nigger right here?

26
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,911
What's up, fat boy?

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,915
- 'Sup?
- Making a food show, bitch?

28
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,416
- No.
- You should.

29
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,377
Bam! 'Cause you fat as fuck!

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,629
This fat motherfucker right here, man.

31
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,715
- You got pancake titties.
- You do!

32
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,550
Fuck this city.
I'm re-shooting this thing.

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,843
Eat a dick, Paul Blart.

34
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,595
This fat motherfucker, man.

35
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,811
[man]
Ladies and Gentlemen, Tom Segura!

36
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:46,356

37
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,464
[music continues]

38
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,176
[Tom] What up?

39
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,806
Thank you! Thank you, guys.

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,891
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,979
It's great to be in Seattle.

42
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,897
- [crowd roars]
- Yes.

43
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,654
One of my favorite places,
and I am fucking falling apart.

44
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,530
All right, um...

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,784
I hate who I'm becoming, socially.

46
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,995
Like, all my social interactions,

47
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,081
I'm disintegrating into somebody
I want to punch in the mouth.

48
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,877
Like, I start weather chats
with people all the time now,

49
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,504
like, ugh.

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,508
I got off the plane here, and the guy
that picks me up at the airport,

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,845
I was like, "It rains a lot here, huh?"

52
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,262
[laughter]

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,558
And I swear,
there's another voice in my head going,

54
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,727
"You're a piece of shit
for this conversation."

55
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,104
[laughter]

56
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,026
What's the guy supposed to say?
He's in the car and he's like, "Yeah..."

57
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,694
[laughter]

58
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,612
"...it does.

59
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,198
And you're a real piece of shit for this,
just so you know."

60
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,245
I wanted to abort,
I wanted to get out of it, but I couldn't.

61
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,248
Like, "I'm from Southern California,
we sure could use it."

62
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,376
- [chuckles]
- [laughter]

63
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,174
And he was like,
"I'll run us off the fucking road.

64
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,093
I'll kill us both,
I swear to God I will."

65
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,554
God forbid I meet
a tall person now, like--

66
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,305
If you're over six-four,

67
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,018
there's no way I'm not addressing it.
I'm gonna be like,

68
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,854
- "Wow, you're tall."
- [laughter]

69
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,024
"Do you like basketball?
Yeah? Is that your thing?

70
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,109
I have a friend that's tall."

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,279
Dude, you just told a grown man
you have a fucking friend that's tall.

72
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,826
Like, what's next? "My dad's super strong?

73
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,246
- I bet he's stronger than your dad."
- [laughter]

74
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,330
Ugh.

75
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,709
It's better than
my dad's actual small talk,

76
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,046
which is awkwardly racial small talk.

77
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,758
It's not racist, but it involves race.
Um...

78
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,763
Like, we're at a restaurant and, you know,
the server walks up and she's Asian.

79
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,225
- My dad will be like, "You Chinese?"
- [laughter]

80
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,853
And she's like, "No, I'm Korean."

81
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,897
"Oh, I was in Vietnam."

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,274
- And I'm like...
- [laughter]

83
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,984
"What are you doing?"

84
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,530
"What? I was." "I know.
What does that have to do with anything?"

85
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,284
Then he goes, "Lot fewer of them
when I left, if you know what I mean."

86
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,994
- I'm like, "Oh, man."
- [laughter]

87
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,372
[whistles] Well...

88
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,168
"Yeah, it was two Diet Cokes,
we're gonna wrap it up pretty quick."

89
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,589
Dude, if he meets a black guy,
shut it the fuck down, okay?

90
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,550
'Cause, it's gonna get weird. Like...

91
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,096
Dude, I see it. A black guy starts
talking to us and my dad'll be like...

92
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,806
[laughter]

93
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,349
I can see it in his eyes,
like a clock's ticking down.

94
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,728
And I'm like, "How weird are you
about to be with him?"

95
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:15,232
He looks like a dog, when you show a dog
a treat and you're like, "Sit still."

96
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,775
And the dog's like...

97
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,026
[laughter]

98
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,906
"I work with a black guy!"

99
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,700
- Ohh. Ohh.
- [laughter]

100
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,328
Oh, man.

101
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,456
"Yeah, Carl.
You know him? I don't know...

102
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,750
Thought you knew each other.
I don't know.

103
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,170
I don't know him.
He works in the building."

104
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,297
You're like, "Fuck."

105
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,757
Jesus.

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,095
Speaking of dads, I'm gonna be a dad.
Isn't that crazy?

107
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,722
[crowd cheers]

108
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,806
I know. Well...

109
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,271
You know, not my fucking problem.
You know what I mean? Um...

110
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,439
- [laughter]
- That's your kid. So...

111
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,442
No, I'm gonna stick around.
I wanna see what it looks and stuff.

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,321
- [laughter]
- Just for a second. But...

113
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,407
So crazy, man.
All I did was, I didn't pull out.

114
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,493
- And then...
- [laughter]

115
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,829
Now I'm gonna be a dad. So nuts.

116
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,542
Isn't that crazy? As a man, all you do
is you dump inside of a girl and then...

117
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,005
there's life? That's a pretty crude way
of putting that. I'm sorry. But...

118
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,422
that's what happens.

119
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,011
Let's just talk about how good
that feels. I...

120
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,929
[laughter]

121
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,974
Dude, I've been pulling out for years.

122
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,311
And no comp-- No orgasm--
You don't have an org--

123
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,605
and you're like, "Oh, that sucks."
Like, it's still--

124
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,817
It feels great.
But when you leave it in?

125
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,777
Dude.

126
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,363
[laughter]

127
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,824
Here's all I'm saying.

128
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,286
If you're a pull-out guy,
next time? Don't.

129
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,871
[laughter]

130
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,917
Even if she tells you to.
Be like, "I forgot."

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,085
[laughter]

132
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,419
And she'll whine about it.

133
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,589
[whines]

134
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,258
"What if I'm pregnant?

135
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,968
My career!"

136
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,764
And you'll be like,
"Is law school on hold? All right.

137
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,475
Pretty sure you can cut hair with a gut."

138
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,977
[mixed laughter]

139
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,814
Guys! I'm joking. I'm joking.

140
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,024
[laughter]

141
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,651
- [crowd cheers]
- Joke.

142
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,656
- I'm not joking. But...
- [laughter]

143
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,618
God, it feels so good!

144
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:37,332
I can't even-- I can't even describe
how much better it feels.

145
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,877
The best I've come up with is,
remember when you were a kid,

146
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,463
and the first time you tried
something with melted cheese,

147
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,716
- and you were like, "What the fuck?"
- [laughter]

148
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,386
"This is the same thing?"
And they're like, "Same shit."

149
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,346
And you're like, "This is amazing!

150
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,099
I can have this whenever I want?"
"Mm-hm. Whenever you want.

151
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,269
Just eight, ten seconds
and it's your world, man."

152
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,728
You're like, "Oh, my God!"

153
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,689
- It's like that, but down here.
- [laughter]

154
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,027
Feels so good.

155
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,948
Ohh. Here's what a piece of shit I am.

156
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,074
I...

157
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,077
I have been fantasizing a lot

158
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,038
about people asking me

159
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,250
how I lost the weight
that I haven't lost yet.

160
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,085
[laughter]

161
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,046
And, like, I just have so many answers.

162
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,589
Like, I really enjoy doing--

163
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,759
In my head, I'm like,
"Dude, it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle."

164
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,552
[laughter]

165
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,721
"Just gotta make smarter choices, man.

166
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,434
I mean, drink more water.
Look at me, I've never felt better.

167
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,103
I have so much energy.
If I can do it, you can do it."

168
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,064
And then I eat chocolate soufflé,
as I have--

169
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,359
- [imitates chewing sounds]
- [laughter]

170
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,529
Like, "Well, next year I'll probably
be ready for this conversation."

171
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,239
Fucking asshole.

172
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,619
I don't even want to, like, lose weight
to live long or be healthy.

173
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,873
I don't. I just want to be able
to make fun of fat people again.

174
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,624
[laughter]

175
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,085
And know for sure
that they're fatter than me.

176
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,588
'Cause, like, sometimes--
Now I'm like anybody,

177
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,050
I'll be like, "Look at this
fat fucking asshole."

178
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,093
And someone'll be like,
"You're fatter."

179
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,263
And I'm like, "Oh. Really?"
And they're like, "By a lot!"

180
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,806
[laughter]

181
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,102
"You should want his body."
And I'm like, "Ah, fuck, man."

182
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,650
Since I'm gonna have a kid,
I don't want to be the fat dad.

183
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,697
Remember when we were
in elementary school, in like fifth grade?

184
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,700
You're like, "Hey,
look at Billy's fat fuckin' dad."

185
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,035
[laughter]

186
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,038
[chortles] "Fuckin'..."

187
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,293
"Just fuckin' batter him up tonight
and eat him, huh, Billy's dad?"

188
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,669
Just don't want to be that guy.

189
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,047
I got a trainer.

190
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,467
They gave me a trainer.
That's a better way of saying that.

191
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:57,097
I joined a gym, and they go,
"Do you want a free training session?"

192
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,849
I was like, "Okay.
What does it normally cost?"

193
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,768
And they're like, "Like $900."

194
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,895
I was like, "Wow, that's a great deal.
That's awesome."

195
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,188
[crowd chuckles]

196
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,733
The first session is a bait session.
It's ridiculous.

197
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,402
The guy's like, "Stand up."

198
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,363
Like, "Okay." He's like,
"Wow, you're a very powerful athlete."

199
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,906
[laughter]

200
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,492
"Were you pro before?"

201
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,953
I'm like, "Okay, yes. I think I was."

202
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,459
He goes, "You look like it. Your muscle
fibers look really great." I'm like...

203
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,588
He's like, "Want to do this all the time?"
I'm like, "Yeah. Absolutely.

204
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,048
This is a good boost for me.
I like this a lot."

205
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,303
Second session, way different
than the first session.

206
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,179
Second session, I'm doing burpies.

207
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,308
Like, you jump on the ground
then you jump onto a wooden block.

208
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,436
I'm running through sand pushing a sled.

209
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,314
"And I go, is this SEAL school?
What are we doing right now?"

210
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,815
[laughter]

211
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,527
In the middle of this workout,
my trainer goes "Stop!"

212
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,112
And I said, "Thank you."

213
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,197
[laughter]

214
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,074
He goes, "Know why I told you to stop?"

215
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,286
And I go, "Yeah, so you don't
have to give me CPR, I think."

216
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,496
[laughter]

217
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,165
And he goes, "No. The Holy Spirit."

218
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,250
"What?"

219
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,876
[laughter]

220
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,714
And he goes, "The Holy Spirit
told me to tell you to stop."

221
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,383
And I go...

222
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,885
"What...

223
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,181
did I sign up for? What the fuck is this?"

224
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,393
And he goes,
"Do you believe in Jesus Christ?"

225
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,686
And I said, "Is He gonna
make me do push-ups?"

226
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,439
[laughter]

227
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,277
And that right there,
he got really mad at that. Like...

228
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,238
really upset.
He was like, "It's not all jokes!"

229
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,782
"I said one thing.
I can't say one thing? All right."

230
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,412
And he tells me to take the big plate,
the 45-pound plate.

231
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,332
"Hold it over your head
and run down to the pier and back."

232
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,750
And the pier's, like,
three-quarters of a mile.

233
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,294
And I go, "Nope."

234
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,795
[laughter]

235
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,172
"Not doing that."

236
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,300
He's like, "You're quitting?
You're quitting on me?"

237
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,136
And I go, "No,
I'm not quitting, it's just that...

238
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,721
the Holy Spirit..."

239
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
[laughter]

240
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,601
"...it talks to me, too.

241
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,229
And it said there's no way
I'm gonna make this run

242
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,856
without throwing up
and people laughing at me.

243
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,818
So, I'm gonna get a peanut butter
protein shake. I'm out, man."

244
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,237
And I took off.

245
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,073
I'm not doing that shit.

246
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,825
I'm not making fun of you
if you're religious.

247
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,703
I think that's great. Any faith.

248
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,163
Christian, Muslim, Jew, what--

249
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,375
If you're a Scientologist,
you can go fuck yourself. But...

250
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,544
- [crowd cheers]
- Yeah.

251
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,924
Because it's not old.

252
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,551
It's gotta be old.

253
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,428
[crowd chuckles]

254
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,847
It's fair to say there's some times
I don't want to hear about it.

255
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,641
You know? Like working out?

256
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,560
Um... Getting high.

257
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,229
That's a bummer.

258
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,483
Right? Like, when there's
pills and cash and tits out and...

259
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,738
someone's like, "Have you thought
about accepting the Lord into your life?"

260
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,407
And you're like,
"I'm trying to make bad decisions.

261
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,033
Why are you doing this to me?"

262
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,203
That and pre-sex.

263
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,913
That is the worst.

264
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,998
During sex, as-salamu alaykum.

265
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,752
- Anything goes. But...
- [laughter]

266
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,920
Pre-sex? Like, right before,
and the girl's like,

267
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,215
"Oh! What if God's watching us?"

268
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,799
And you're like, "What?!"

269
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,385
[laughter]

270
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,429
"'What if God is watching us?'

271
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,306
Of course He's watching us!

272
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,850
He sees everything and this is
hands-down His favorite shit!"

273
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,770
[laughter]

274
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,354
[crowd cheering]

275
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,522
Yeah.

276
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,279
"Quit being a baby, put another knuckle
in there and let's give Him a show!"

277
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,863
[laughter]

278
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,535
[chuckles]

279
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,122
[laughter]

280
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,376
Digit play, it's fun. Get into it. But...

281
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,253
let's be clear about this, guys.

282
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,422
We're not gonna agree on everything. Okay?

283
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,758
But we should agree on this.

284
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,095
If you bring a baby
into a movie theater,

285
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,347
you're a piece of shit.

286
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,723
[crowd cheering]

287
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,224
Yup.

288
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,065
If your reason for doing it
is you couldn't get a babysitter,

289
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,444
well, then,
you don't get to go to the movies.

290
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,987
That's how that works.

291
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,490
It happened to me in back-to-back movies,

292
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,368
which statistically
I did not think was possible.

293
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,412
First movie, I'm in there five minutes.

294
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,791
I'm watching the movie and I hear,
"Waaah."

295
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,292
"What?"

296
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,502
I turn,

297
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,840
and in the row behind me
there's a mother, a father and a baby.

298
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,385
Not a child,
which I think is an important distinction.

299
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,556
It's a baby. I'm like, "All right,
these people are insane. Um...

300
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,182
I'll just ignore this."

301
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,811
Turn back, 30 seconds later,
"Waah."

302
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,771
I'm like,
"Well, now I have to say something."

303
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,231
Now...

304
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,482
I'm polite.

305
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,026
So I turn and I go, "Excuse me,

306
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,278
are you stabbing your baby right now?"

307
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,739
[laughter]

308
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,032
"'Cause it sounds like it."

309
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,328
And the dad goes...
[heavy accent] "No, I love the baby."

310
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,288
- You picture him, okay?
- [laughter]

311
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,791
"I love him. Pero...

312
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,042
no.

313
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,377
It's my baby."

314
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,425
And I said, "Well, could you?
'Cause I'm trying to watch this movie."

315
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,510
[laughter]

316
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,720
"And...

317
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,138
your baby's ruining it."

318
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,058
He's like, "No, no puedo." So...

319
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,935
[laughter]

320
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,104
I get up, I go to the lobby,

321
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,815
I see the manager
of the theater and I go, "Hey!

322
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,402
There's a fucking baby in there...

323
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,071
being a baby right now."

324
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,033
And the manager goes,
"Some people suck."

325
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,036
And he walked away.

326
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,583
That is the best customer service line
I've ever heard in my life.

327
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,042
Hands down.

328
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,878
[cheers and applause]

329
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,715
You can't even get mad!

330
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,384
If you're in a restaurant,
been waiting on your food, like,

331
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,887
"Where the fuck is my food?
I've been here half an hour!"

332
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,972
And the manager's like,
"Some people suck." Like,

333
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,602
"Oh yeah. Some people suck.
I didn't think about it. My bad.

334
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,895
Sorry about that."

335
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,105
I left. I left.

336
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,399
The next day, I go back to the movies.

337
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,193
I should point out I saw
a different movie.

338
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,904
It was also a different baby.

339
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,282
It's not the same family
standing out front

340
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,328
and then they see me and they're like,
"Oh, there he is. Let's go inside...

341
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,955
and ruin this for him again."

342
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,126
This time I am way further into the movie.

343
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,462
I'm emotionally invested in this movie.

344
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,880
I like the movie.

345
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:50,635
And then, out of nowhere, I hear,
"Waah."

346
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,054
This time, I swear to you, I audibly go,

347
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,348
"Nuh-uh."

348
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,475
[laughter]

349
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,395
And now, other people get involved.

350
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,483
You know when you can hear
somebody's age in their voice?

351
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,028
Like, I can't see shit.
It's a dark theater.

352
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,700
I just hear a guy go,
"Either make it quiet or get it out!"

353
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,702
[laughter]

354
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,499
That guy's 140 years old!

355
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,417
[laughter]

356
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,128
Like, I could hear
that he'd never hugged his children.

357
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,172
- I could hear it in his voice.
- [laughter]

358
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,931
This time,
the mother of the baby goes,

359
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,017
"Shut up."

360
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,770
- And I was like, "Oh shit!" Like...
- [laughter]

361
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,104
"We have a situation."

362
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:50,361
And then a third person goes, "Shh."

363
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,698
[laughter]

364
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,618
What are you doing?
"Shush" is passive-aggressive.

365
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,496
She said, "Shut up."
Just go straight to "fuck you!"

366
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,998
What are you doing?

367
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,337
But now... I wanted to be
the hero and save the movie.

368
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,423
I felt a tremendous sense of injustice.

369
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,593
Like, all these movies
are being ruined by babies, but...

370
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:18,097
I didn't realize I was too angry
in that moment to um, what is it?

371
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,808
Speak English words in a sentence.

372
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,603
You know when you get real rage,
like-- [barks]

373
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,521
- Like, just...
- [crowd chuckles]

374
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,898
"Dude..."

375
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,649
- [barks] Like...
- [laughter]

376
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,610
[growls]

377
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,321
Like, you feel it,
your throat dries out, and-- aah!

378
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,200
So I stood up in the theater
with the best intentions and I went...

379
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,038
"Why is everybody
not in the adult movie?!"

380
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,761
- Like none of it made sense.
- [laughter]

381
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,837
Everybody's like, "Who's that fucking guy?
What's his problem?"

382
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,466
I was...

383
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,636
I was trying to say,
"Let's be civilized adults."

384
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,722
But instead I went "adult movie."

385
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,642
"Porn's on now.

386
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,603
Cover your baby's eyes."

387
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,980
[laughter]

388
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,985
The next thing,
I see a white T-shirt pop up

389
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,028
and I'm like,
"Well, there's the dad."

390
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,698
[laughter]

391
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,366
Some of you got it. And...

392
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,788
He looked around, like,
"Who's talking shit?"

393
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,206
And I was like, "I'm talking shit, bitch."

394
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,543
I didn't say it,
but he knew what was up. But then...

395
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,295
[laughter]

396
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,922
I went out the exit immediately

397
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,383
cause I'm not getting my ass kicked
over The Lego Movie, so I left.

398
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,097
[cheering]

399
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,276
You guys,
are you ever just

400
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,779
tired of being alive?

401
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,664
- Know what I mean? Like...
- [crowd chuckles]

402
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,534
I'm not suicidal.

403
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:06,288
I just feel like I've done a lot
and I've seen a lot. And now I'm like,

404
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,000
- "Let's wrap this shit up. Like..."
- [laughter]

405
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,961
Right? Like, how many
fucking days are there?

406
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,629
[laughter]

407
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,427
I want to skip a grade. Remember...

408
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,514
elementary school, and you get
to the first day of,

409
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,308
whatever, third grade,
and you're like, "Where's Brian?"

410
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,229
They're like, "He skipped."
"Excuse me? How?"

411
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,858
They're like, "He can add like
a motherfucker. I don't know. He just...

412
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,694
- Four, eight, twelve. He gets it."
- [laughter]

413
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,783
And then you go, "I want to skip."
And they're like-- [chuckling]

414
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,327
"Don't even think about that.
Think about other shit."

415
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,706
I'd love to skip in real life.

416
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,167
That would be the best program,
if they were like,

417
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,128
"If you kill it this year,
you have the best year,

418
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,297
at the end of the year, a magical fairy

419
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,551
or government official
will come to your house...

420
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,137
and they go, 'You crushed it this year.'"

421
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,140
- And you're like, "I know."
- [crowd chuckles]

422
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,744
Then they're like, "Now you can skip
as many years as you want."

423
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,478
I'd be like, "What the fuck?!

424
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,731
Really?" "Mm-hmm.
How many do you want to skip?"

425
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,815
"Thirty?"

426
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,401
Just land at retirement.

427
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,737
I don't wanna live
much longer than that anyways.

428
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,031
Seventy. Maybe 71. You know?

429
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,910
Seventy so I can be "officially old"
and experience old guy stuff,

430
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,413
like people talking to me like I'm a pet,
and, um...

431
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
[laughter]

432
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,293
You ever see that? When they're like,
"Hey, hey. How you doing?

433
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,296
You're so good.
Would you like me to get you anything?"

434
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,134
Like, "Yeah. Put some water in my bowl.
What the fuck is this shit?" Like...

435
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,551
[laughter]

436
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,222
But I don't want
to live much longer than that.

437
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,891
I mean, I hear people in conversation go,

438
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,684
"I want to live to be a hundred."

439
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,936
Really?

440
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,604
Have you seen 80?

441
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,316
I mean,
my dad has a friend that's 87.

442
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,194
- He looks like a goblin. Okay?
- [laughter]

443
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,864
He is terrifying to look at.

444
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,824
And he knows it.

445
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,327
He's like, "I'm coming around the corner.
Don't look at me." He knows it.

446
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,788
- [laughter]
- It's scary.

447
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,834
Here's how much it sucks to be that old.

448
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,587
When he was 84,
he stopped taking his heart medication.

449
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,092
And I go, "Why did you do that?"
And he goes, "I don't want to be here."

450
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,177
[laughter]

451
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,472
If you see him now,
you're like, "How you doing?"

452
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,058
- "Unfortunately, alive."
- [laughter]

453
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,227
"But He won't take me."

454
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,104
[laughter]

455
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,731
The only thing I have
going for me with that old stuff

456
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,358
is that I will be the best old guy.

457
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,945
I already know it.
Like, I have their personality.

458
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,613
I'm anti-social as shit.

459
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,283
I don't want to do anything. Like...

460
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:51,078
whenever anybody says to me, "Hey, man.
Do you wanna go check out the--"

461
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:55,749
I go, "No to the rest of your sentence.
Whatever it is, I don't want to do it."

462
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,169
I don't want to meet new people.

463
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,379
Not one more, as long as I live,
for the rest of my life.

464
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,673
That's the same as old people.

465
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,009
Try it if you want.
Be like, "Hey, Grandpa!

466
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,845
I want you to meet Steve."
And he'll go, "Fuck Steve."

467
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,722
[laughter]

468
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,432
"I know everybody I need to know.

469
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,560
Gonna watch my shows."
[blows raspberry]

470
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,394
[laughter]

471
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,480
Know what I really want?
I want to be that old--

472
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,192
I don't know if it's an age,
it's just a way of being old.

473
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,693
There's a certain level of old

474
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,363
where you get yelled at
for trying to be helpful.

475
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,366
That looks awesome.

476
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,245
Know what I mean? When an old guy's like,
"I'm gonna take out the trash."

477
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,622
And someone's like,
"Are you out of your fucking mind?

478
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,625
Your spine'll snap. Sit down!"

479
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,545
- "Okay."
- [laughter]

480
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,922
"I tried. I'm sorry."

481
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,216
[laughter]

482
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,424
That looks amazing.

483
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,472
I really want that old guy confidence
that I see...

484
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,434
in the locker room.
Yeah. That's another thing.

485
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,770
[laughter]

486
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,274
Dude. Another thing I've noticed
since joining the gym,

487
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,858
there's two types of guys:

488
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,154
Guys that are 65 and older,
and then guys that cover their dicks.

489
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,282
Because old guys...

490
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,532
do not.

491
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,618
It's crazy!

492
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,996
The first few days,
I thought it was peacocking.

493
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,497
Like showing off, you know?

494
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,999
'Cause I saw some fucking hammers

495
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,752
where you walk in
and you're like, "Whoa, yeah!"

496
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,087
[laughter]

497
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,381
"I wouldn't wear pants either.
Nice work, pal."

498
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,966
[laughter]

499
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,387
But then, like the third day,
I saw a guy,

500
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,681
he had just like the cutest little thing.

501
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:35,891
[laughter]

502
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,810
And he was just like
all on the--

503
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,479
He was like,
"Oil prices are crazy right now."

504
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,898
[laughter]

505
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,777
I'm like, "Dude, you have a little grain
of rice. You don't give a shit?"

506
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,904
He didn't. He didn't care.

507
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,864
I want that confidence.

508
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,075
I don't even know how it's attainable.

509
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,287
Like, if I know anyone's gonna see it,
I'm gonna... you know?

510
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,748
[laughter]

511
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,625
Give it a smack.

512
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,085
[laughter]

513
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,340
And then you go, "Huh. There's an inch."

514
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,175
[laughter]

515
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,430
Let's not act like I'm the only
self-fluff er in the room, okay?

516
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,516
Dude.

517
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,356
Ladies, if you've ever
received a dick-pic before, um,

518
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,733
here's some secret intel:
That's not the first shot.

519
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,027
[laughter]

520
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,780
Pretty much goes like this: Click.

521
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,408
- "Fuck that." And then...
- [laughter]

522
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,372
"Oh, yeah, that's me.
That's all me right there. That's me."

523
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,211
God, sweating my fucking balls off.

524
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,837
Like a preacher. Amen.

525
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,423
- All right. So...
- [laughter]

526
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,758
Ha!

527
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,055
This is a very-- I think this--

528
00:25:56,138 --> 00:26:00,726
Pretty girls. Pretty town. A lot
of good-looking girls in this town. Um...

529
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,728
I noticed, stylistically,

530
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,605
I feel like a lot of girls here
have nose rings,

531
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,234
and I have to tell you, I fucking dig it.

532
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,693
Yeah.

533
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,017
I like a girl with a nose ring.

534
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,155
I think it says something.
I think it says,

535
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:17,493
- "I have other piercings, and..."
- [crowd chuckling]

536
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,787
- "...you can see them."
- [laughter]

537
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,332
"As soon as I get this hemp bra off."

538
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,042
- But...
- [laughter]

539
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,296
Eyebrow ring, that's another level.

540
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,923
That is a statement.

541
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,218
And that statement is:
"Fisting is my first base."

542
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,389
Like, those chicks
are fuckin' down. Am I right?

543
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,516
- [crowd cheering]
- Yeah.

544
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,352
Oh, yeah.

545
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,020
Some of you-- No?
I'm seeing disappointment

546
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,980
in some people's faces, for sure.

547
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,233
Yeah. Some people are like, "Mm-mm."

548
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,193
[laughter]

549
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,153
"Didn't sign up for this shit. No, sir."

550
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,950
And the rest of you are like,
"But... But, Tom!

551
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,163
What about tongue rings?
What about tongue rings, Tom?"

552
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,249
What about them?!

553
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,792
[laughter]

554
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,960
Tools of the trade.

555
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,381
Did Rembrandt not have a paintbrush?

556
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,509
[laughter]

557
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,472
Who is Beethoven without his piano?

558
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:24,351
That girl has a tongue ring 'cause
her mouth is a homing device for cocks!

559
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,479
[laughter]

560
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,232
You leave her alone!

561
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,527
Or just show her your dick.
There's a pretty good chance

562
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,322
she's gonna lap that shit up.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

563
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,739
[laughter]

564
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,577
Don't get upset.
It's silly. It's a silly joke.

565
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,247
Look, I'm not a misogynistic pig.

566
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,501
I think women should judge men
equally and harshly.

567
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,835
You know what never fails?

568
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,379
Judge men based on what they drive.

569
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,880
Ladies...

570
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,134
if a guy picks you up
in a minivan,

571
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,760
he is telling you,

572
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:03,098
"Why have sex when we can collect
all the Angry Birds stuffed animals?"

573
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,642
[laughter]

574
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,773
Full-size van. Whoa.

575
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,733
[laughter]

576
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,901
That's more like,

577
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,695
"You wanna go out?
Well, you're coming."

578
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,906
[laughter]

579
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,993
Kidnapping joke, yeah?

580
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,873
Now, ladies, if a guy picks you up
in a Honda and it's lowered,

581
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,250
real low, low... to the ground...

582
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,213
and there's some
cool blue lights underneath it,

583
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,341
that says, "When we get
to this restaurant, get whatever you want.

584
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,843
My mom's got this.
Don't worry about it. I got it. Yeah."

585
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,970
- [laughter]
- "Yeah."

586
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,057
"Yeah, she gave me tip money. Yeah!"

587
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,227
Oh, man.

588
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,063
I was in, uh, London...

589
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,856
Canada.

590
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,359
- Um, they have one.
- [crowd chuckles]

591
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,735
And...

592
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,945
Doesn't that kinda bother you?
A little bit?

593
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:03,283
When a barely city is like,
"Let's name it after an awesome city."

594
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,870
- [laughter]
- [snickers]

595
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,831
And they have the nerve to ask you,
"How do you like London?"

596
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,043
"The real one, or this turd
you put in a dress? Because..."

597
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,503
[laughter]

598
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:18,131
Like, the fucking balls
on Paris, Tennessee,

599
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,343
to name their city Paris?

600
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,513
And then they built a mini Eiffel Tower?

601
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,973
Like you're gonna walk around confused,

602
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,143
like, "Well, bonjour!
I don't even know where I'm at!"

603
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,312
[laughter, cheering]

604
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,485
"Can I get me a 'crassant?'"
[chortles]

605
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,028
[laughter]

606
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,073
Fuck Paris, Tennessee.

607
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,746
So, we're leaving...

608
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,123
London, Ontario, Canada--

609
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,458
bothers me just to say it.

610
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,086
And we're headed back to Toronto,

611
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,132
and we pass by a strip club named Beef.

612
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,050
- Now...
- [crowd chuckles]

613
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,762
Yeah, your hearing is working just fine.

614
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,472
[laughter]

615
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,266
There's a strip club named Beef! I mean...

616
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:14,354
can you even wrap your head around
the confidence a young lady has to have

617
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,441
just to audition at Beef?

618
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,779
Just to be like, "I know they're hiring
at Diamonds, but I'm more of a Beef girl."

619
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,739
- Like, that is...
- [laughter]

620
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,867
It's such an aggressive name,
even for a casual conversation.

621
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,911
To be like, "Oh, you strip?"

622
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,705
"Where do you strip at?"
"Beef."

623
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,290
[laughter]

624
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,042
- "Jesus."
- [laughter]

625
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,963
"What goes on there?"
"Pretty intense shit, actually.

626
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,925
We recommend you start
your night at a different strip club

627
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:48,096
and graduate to Beef.
You start here, we'll wreck your life."

628
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,182
Like, "All right. God."

629
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,850
Fuckin' Beef is the name--

630
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,645
Fart is a better name for a strip club.

631
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,441
If somebody was like,
"You wanna go to a strip club?

632
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:02,110
It's called Fart." I'd be like,
"No, I don't want to go there."

633
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,238
"There's another one called Beef."
"All right, let's check out Fart."

634
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,990
[laughter]

635
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,074
"See where that ends up."

636
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,457
I feel like...

637
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:19,670
the worst part, honestly,
of traveling in our country

638
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,672
is that there's no surprises.

639
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,299
I swear to you, I travel every week,

640
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,760
and it's really a disappointment.

641
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:31,097
Every place is exactly
what I thought it was going to be.

642
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,683
You know?
I can prove it to you.

643
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,894
Picture a place you've never been to
in this country. Picture it.

644
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,270
That's exactly how it is.

645
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,772
[laughter]

646
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,525
What are the people like, you wonder?

647
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,443
What do you think they're like?

648
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,611
That's right.

649
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,029
[laughter]

650
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,741
It's-- I swear to you!

651
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,118
Go to San Francisco.
They're like, "Ah, we're offended."

652
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,620
And you're like, "Yep."

653
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,497
[laughter]

654
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,623
"I know."

655
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
Texas? I don't think the people of Texas

656
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,589
necessarily want
to execute retarded people,

657
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,093
but I think they're like, "You know what?
This is Texas. So... whoo!"

658
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,595
[laughter]

659
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,432
"That's how we do it around here, brother.
A little boot scoot boop!

660
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,183
See you later, dumdum.
All right."

661
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,852
[laughter]

662
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,815
They've done it multiple times!

663
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,067
They keep doing it.

664
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,404
"I'm sowwy."
"Yeah, me too."

665
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,823
[laughter]

666
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:30,990
Crazy.

667
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,622
The Midwest?
I mean, don't you feel like

668
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,124
we could draw a circle
around the Midwest and be like,

669
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,460
- "Do we need this?"
- [laughter]

670
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,714
Except for wherever you're from.
That place is fucking awesome.

671
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,677
The Northeast,
shady fucking people in shady cities.

672
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,220
That's all they are. Just shady.

673
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,474
Just fucking all those places.
Jersey, Philly, Balti-- they're all...

674
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,560
- [chortles]
- [laughter]

675
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,979
"How you doing?"
"Not now, thank you very much."

676
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,564
[laughter]

677
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,859
"Can I help you with something?"
"Nope. Never in my life."

678
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,072
The one quality I do love
about Northeastern people, though,

679
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,785
you could be in an argument with them
and be like, "You're a fucking asshole."

680
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:18,079
- And they're like, "Thank you."
- [laughter]

681
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,707
"My dad's an asshole, and so am I.
It's kind of a thing."

682
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,711
Then what? You head, uh...

683
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,087
you head on down south.

684
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,589
[chuckles]

685
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,341
[laughter]

686
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,551
[Southern accent]
Where "God don't make no junk."

687
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,845
[snickers]

688
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,597
That's a real expression, by the way:

689
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,141
"God don't make no junk."

690
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,352
They say it a lot.
I lived there for a while.

691
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,272
They say it to people who are
complaining about their own situation.

692
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,692
So essentially, it's a pick-me-up. Right?

693
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,820
Like, some lady might go,
"I ain't purty!"

694
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,239
[laughter]

695
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,950
"And I ain't no good."

696
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,703
[crowd chuckling]

697
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,498
"No one's ever gonna love me."
[moans]

698
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,836
And someone'll go,
"Don't you talk that mess."

699
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,922
[crowd chuckles]

700
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:13,552
"Don't you say that, Sally--
Billy Bob-- Sandra. Don't you say that."

701
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,012
[laughter]

702
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,724
"God don't make no junk."

703
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,855
I always want to interrupt and be like,
"I'd like to politely disagree!"

704
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,232
[laughter]

705
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,442
"I think He was nodding off
when He made you."

706
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,194
[laughter]

707
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:35,114
"While your sunken eyes
and protruding underbite are charming..."

708
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,701
[laughter]

709
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,791
"...that map of white trash is not sending
a lot of lead to the pencil. You're right!

710
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,294
You're gonna die alone,
bah-bah-bah-Nascar-fart-beer."

711
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,630
[laughter, cheers]

712
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,675
"You big box of stupid."

713
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,010
[laughter]

714
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,514
Here's great travel advice, okay?

715
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,976
Do not take the red-eye.

716
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,728
If you don't know what that is,

717
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,355
it's amazing
that you made it this far in life.

718
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,068
It's when you fly overnight

719
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,987
from the West Coast
to the Eastern time zone.

720
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,864
Some people love that flight.

721
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,909
And those people are sociopaths.

722
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,369
- Because... here's why.
- [laughter]

723
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,831
You land and your body's like,
"Well, it's 3:30 in the morning.

724
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,709
I guess we're going to sleep."
And then the world goes...

725
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,169
- "Uh... nope!"
- [laughter]

726
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,506
"6:30, dickhead!
Get ready to do stuff."

727
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,050
And then you cry for days.

728
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,678
Last one I ever went on,
I boarded with my wife.

729
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,264
We get on, she looks
at our boarding passes, she goes,

730
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,350
"We're not sitting next to each other."
And I go, "Okay."

731
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,978
[laughter]

732
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,065
I don't know.

733
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,109
She goes,
"You don't wanna switch seats?"

734
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,777
And I go, "Not really."

735
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,278
[laughter]

736
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,073
And she goes, "Why not?"
I said, "'Cause we don't have to."

737
00:35:58,782 --> 00:35:59,783
She goes, "What does that mean?"

738
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,328
I said, "Well, there's only two people
that have to sit next to each other,

739
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,955
and they're up front."

740
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,833
[laughter, applause]

741
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,961
"We can sit anywhere."

742
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,090
She goes, "You're gonna ask
people to move."

743
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,343
And I was like,
"Great. Should be a real treat."

744
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,428
That's always fun, right?
"You all settled in?

745
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,556
- Want to stand the fuck up now?" Great.
- [laughter]

746
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,850
So...

747
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,479
we're both window seats.
We need an aisle to move.

748
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,025
So I go to the guy sitting next to her,
and this guy is old.

749
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,736
I don't know how old,
but it doesn't look good.

750
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,238
He's... he's drooling... [grunts]

751
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,533
...he's got rubber where
there used to be bones--

752
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,742
Put it this way:

753
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,496
- It's his last flight. All right? So...
- [laughter]

754
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,999
After this one, no más.

755
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,083
[crowd chuckles]

756
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,045
So I go, "Excuse me, Gandalf.
Do you think that..."

757
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,713
[laughter]

758
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,799
"...you could move
so I can sit next to my wife?"

759
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,259
And he goes, "Move?"

760
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,554
"Mm-hmm."

761
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,639
He goes, "You move."

762
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,933
- "Yep."
- [crowd chuckles]

763
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,103
"I'll move here,
and then you move there."

764
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,439
And he goes, "You can't see a meniscus...

765
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,484
[gibberish]

766
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,404
...I won't be able
to stretch out as much.

767
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,075
[mumbling] I can't stretch.
I gotta sit by the aisle access

768
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,493
and stretch it out there
so it's built up more.

769
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,496
It'll be seven, eight times more
if I sit over there."

770
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,083
And I go, "Are you reading me
a fucking novel about this?"

771
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,168
[laughter]

772
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,794
"Jesus, just say no!

773
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,840
And I hope you lose your leg."
And then I turned around.

774
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,800
Well, he was a dick.

775
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:41,927
He was.

776
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,262
Was he old? Yes.

777
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,181
Was he disabled? Severely.

778
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,974
[laughter]

779
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:53,271
Disabled people have to earn their
cool points just like the rest of us.

780
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:58,068
I'm so exhausted of the idea
that everybody with a disability

781
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,779
is automatically an angel on earth.

782
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,072
They're not.

783
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,657
They're people, and you should
treat them like people.

784
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,245
But you don't. You patronize
the shit out of them. Yeah.

785
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,288
- I know you do.
- [applause]

786
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:16,294
Of course. There's so many uncomfortably
silent guilty faces in here right now.

787
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,879
[laughter]

788
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,549
Yeah. You know when you're at work
and fucking Sam rolls up?

789
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,803
[laughter]

790
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,263
It's always Sam.

791
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:29,266
You don't go, "Hey, Sam."

792
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,767
You go, "Hai, Sahm."

793
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,393
[laughter]

794
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,603
And he's like, "Hi."

795
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,814
And you go, "How was your weekend?"

796
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,857
[laughter]

797
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,943
He's like, "It was good."

798
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,820
"Well, that's good!"

799
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,324
And he's like, "You know I'm not
retarded right? I just can't stand up.

800
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,201
You're a fucking asshole."

801
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,745
[crowd laughs, cheers]

802
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,294
Some of them are cool.
Some of them are dicks.

803
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,838
I was walking into a building
not two weeks ago.

804
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:04,467
I open the door. Ten steps back,
I notice a guy's coming up with no arms.

805
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,303
You know what I do? I hold the door.

806
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,430
And when he gets up, he goes,
"I don't need you to do that shit."

807
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,640
And I go...

808
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,350
[laughter]

809
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,604
- "All right."
- [cheering]

810
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,149
"Okay, Stumpy. Um...

811
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,193
let's watch you bite
that handle for an hour.

812
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,278
- That'll be a fun fucking show."
- [laughter]

813
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,032
Fuck that guy.

814
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,825
Absolutely fuck him. So...

815
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,245
Midnight on this flight,
the lights come on,

816
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,913
and that's too early, right?

817
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,709
That's too early for the red-eye.
I panic. I think we're dying. So...

818
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,337
I see the attendant, I go,
"Hey, what the fuck's happening?"

819
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,755
She goes, "There's a medical
emergency in the back.

820
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,550
Are you a doctor?"
And I go, "Look at me."

821
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,177
[laughter]

822
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,179
"You think I'm a doctor?"

823
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,931
And she goes, "Are any of you?"
And we go, "No."

824
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,060
I said, "I think we just established
that none of us are doctors.

825
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,687
How about you kill those lights
so we can go back to sleep?"

826
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,231
[laughter]

827
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,358
And she goes, "Well, he needs help."

828
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,318
And I go, "Well, we're not doctors.

829
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,864
We could stand around him for a while,
If you think that'll help."

830
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,159
"Yeah, he's fucked up."

831
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,827
[laughter]

832
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,080
"Huh?

833
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,040
Comedian."

834
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,167
[laughter]

835
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,668
"Mostly stories.

836
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,756
Hang in there."
I don't fucking know. So...

837
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,093
half an hour later, lights are still on,
and I go, "What are we doing?"

838
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,387
And she goes,
"I think we're gonna divert."

839
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,056
And I go, "Divert?

840
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,849
Does that mean
we're gonna dump fuel?"

841
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:40,272
Have you ever asked somebody something
so profoundly stupid to them

842
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,608
that they have to physically regroup
before they answer your question?

843
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,068
[laughter]

844
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,987
Like, she went to answer,
and then she went, "Huh."

845
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,781
[laughter]

846
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,789
Like her brain was like,
control-alt-delete, rebooted...

847
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,791
[laughter]

848
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,753
...and she goes, "Divert doesn't mean
dump fuel, you dumb shit."

849
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,173
And I was like,
"I know, I was just playing. Gah."

850
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,301
[laughter]

851
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,386
She said, "We're gonna land
at the nearest airport.

852
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,472
We'll get him off and we'll get him help.
Then we'll continue."

853
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,016
And I go, "You gotta be shitting me."

854
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,310
And she goes, "No."

855
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,061
And I said, "Well, what if he's dead?"

856
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,105
And she goes, "What?"

857
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,275
- And I go, "If he's dead..."
- [laughter]

858
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,027
"...we're not just gonna land
to drop off some luggage, right?

859
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,862
We're gonna keep going."

860
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,739
And she goes, "I guess so."

861
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,325
[laughter]

862
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,827
And I said, "Well, in that case,
I am a doctor."

863
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,662
[laughter]

864
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,414
"And I'm gonna need a pillow. Stat."

865
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,082
[laughter]

866
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,961
[cheers and applause]

867
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,926
And then, I fucking killed a guy.
On a plane.

868
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,219
[laughter]

869
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,263
It was the most fun
I've ever had in my life.

870
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,598
Um...

871
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,768
Bikes! I get, like...

872
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,355
verbal tics, you know?
I don't have Tourette's.

873
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,523
I wish I did. It looks fun. But...

874
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,486
I'll just yell shit.
It's like a hook on a catchy song,

875
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,988
except it's just stuff that I watch,
and then...

876
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,115
"Bikes!" I just yell it, you know.

877
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,660
Over and over. Only like
two or three million times. But...

878
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,080
I'm obsessed with the show
Scared Straight. Um...

879
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,793
If you've never seen it,
it's tremendous.

880
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,877
Here's what they do.

881
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,882
In the show, they take kids,
middle school and high school kids

882
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,011
that are getting in trouble a lot,
and they send them to jail for a day.

883
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,056
And the idea is that jail
will scare the fuck out of the kid,

884
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,932
and then he'll get his life together.

885
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:43,561
Hence, Scared Straight.
It's tremendous.

886
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,064
I'm obsessed with one episode.

887
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,900
- It aired once.
- [crowd chuckles]

888
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,360
In 1999.

889
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,154
Here's what's great.

890
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:57,616
It aired uncensored, which is bananas.

891
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:03,664
And... in this episode
they did not send the kids to jail,

892
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,790
like they normally do.

893
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,170
Instead, they sent them
to a maximum security penitentiary.

894
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,256
[crowd chuckles]

895
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,382
Prison.

896
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:17,178
And those prisoners
verbally assaulted these kids

897
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,556
into crying a lot.

898
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,599
[laughter]

899
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:26,020
And it's the funniest shit
I have ever seen in my life.

900
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,067
First of all,
don't feel, like, too bad for--

901
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,818
these kids are super badass.

902
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:35,696
They're not like,
spitting spitballs in class and--

903
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,157
They're fucking stabbing other kids.

904
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,784
They're badass kids. Okay?

905
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,245
And they show up
to this thing with attitude.

906
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,123
They walk in, they're like,
"What's up? I run sixth grade.

907
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,417
- I ain't scared of you, man. Like..."
- [laughter]

908
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,501
"You can't scare me."

909
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,088
And they're greeted
by a guy named Crazy Chris.

910
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,091
Chris has scars on his face,

911
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,469
and the screen freezes.

912
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,556
And it says, "Chris killed six people,
and he's doing a double life sentence."

913
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,516
Like, this dude is so bad

914
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,352
that when he dies and he's reincarnated,

915
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,605
that guy is doing life in prison also.

916
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,482
[laughter]

917
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,276
So this is a bad motherfucker right here.

918
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,028
The kids are like squatting around,

919
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,574
and Chris is like,
"Hey. My name's Crazy Chris.

920
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,244
And from now on,
you will see me in your nightmares."

921
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,455
And the kids are like,
"What the fuck?" Like...

922
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,791
"I'm 12. Don't talk to me like that.
Man, that's crazy."

923
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:32,462
And he goes, "If I ever see you again,
I'll take a bite out of each of you."

924
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,466
And they're like, "All right.
We're reformed now. Thank you very much."

925
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,384
Jesus. But they can't leave.

926
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:43,181
The next guy comes up to them
and he goes, "Hold mah pocket!

927
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,851
- Hold mah pocket!"
- [crowd chuckles]

928
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,687
And he makes kids walk around
holding the inside of his pocket.

929
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,149
You understand?
So he walks, and then they're like--

930
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,775
[nervous chuckle]

931
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,237
I don't know what you know about prison,

932
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,532
but if you're holding
onto another dude's pocket,

933
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,535
- it's gonna be a rough day. All right?
- [laughter]

934
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,704
Not only is this guy
making kids hold his--

935
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,667
he's talking ridiculous shit

936
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,544
to middle schoolers.

937
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,087
He's like, "I'mma make you
suck my dick for breakfast!"

938
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,839
[laughter]

939
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,800
"Every mornin'."
And the kids are like... [groaning]

940
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,844
[laughter]

941
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,929
"I hate breakfast! Ugh!"

942
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,140
[laughter]

943
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,767
Funny shit like that.

944
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,355
So...

945
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,606
[chortles]

946
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,026
He's like,
"I'mma mush your motherfucking face!"

947
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,819
And the kid's like-- [whimpering]

948
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,072
It's so fucking funny. Ah...

949
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,324
[crowd chuckling]

950
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,161
There's one exchange where this dude,
he pulls a kid out of line.

951
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,623
The kid's, like, 13. He weighs,
I don't know, a hundred pounds?

952
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,375
And he has a bowl cut.

953
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,669
Okay? He has a bowl cut.

954
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,961
[laughter]

955
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,338
In prison.

956
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,174
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

957
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,260
It's parted in the middle.

958
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,722
The prisoner goes, "Why you here?"

959
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,683
And the kid's like...
"Ugh. Stealing."

960
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,602
And he goes, "The fuck you took?"

961
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,607
[laughter]

962
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,858
And the kids goes, "B... Bikes."

963
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,319
And he goes, "Bikes!"

964
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,405
And that's why I yell "bikes"
all the time.

965
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,573
[laughter]

966
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,575
[cheers and applause]

967
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,875
You should see me
when we drive by a bike store.

968
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,378
- Holy shit.
- [laughter]

969
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:40,465
I'll be driving. I'll be like, "Ahh..."

970
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:45,177
- And my wife, she's pretty over it. Um...
- [laughter]

971
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,901
She'll go, like, "You get one." I'm like,

972
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,557
"All right, I'm gonna
make this shit count."

973
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,143
So, I'll pull over,
roll down the window,

974
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,730
and I wait till I see somebody
checking out one of the sidewalk displays,

975
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,356
like with all the bikes out there,

976
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,817
and when they find one they like
and they're like, "I like this one,"

977
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,572
I'll go, "Bikes!"
And they're like, "What the fuck?!"

978
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:07,074
And I go, "Stop selling drugs!"
And I drive off.

979
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,452
[laughter]

980
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,578
That's right.

981
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,122
[cheers and applause]

982
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,543
Super fun. You should do it.

983
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:19,754
Ah, man.

984
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,007
So, my wife is the coolest, actually.
She's the best.

985
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,803
And, uh, she--
we've been together ten years.

986
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,887
And women will actually ask me, sometimes,

987
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,932
they'll be like, "Ten years?
That's a pretty good run.

988
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,477
What's the secret?
Is there a secret?"

989
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,021
And I want to tell you that there is.

990
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,733
And ladies,
the key to your man's heart

991
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,778
is through his... taint.

992
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,780
Now, if you don't know,

993
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,282
the taint is that little strip of land

994
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,993
between a man's balls and his butthole.

995
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,578
[cheers and applause]

996
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,251
Also known as the Devil's Driveway.

997
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,212
- Now...
- [laughter]

998
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,758
...some of you are like,
"I don't want to go there.

999
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,053
That sounds scary."

1000
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,680
Well, yeah.

1001
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,056
[laughter]

1002
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,058
Your man's perineum,

1003
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,395
that's like the Incan ruins of his body.

1004
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,524
And just like Machu Picchu,
its a little out of the way.

1005
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,859
[laughter]

1006
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,445
But once you get there,
the rewards are oh, so glorious.

1007
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,616
Ladies, I just gave you
top secret clearance. Okay?

1008
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,202
Um, welcome to Area 51.

1009
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,665
Yeah. I never want to hear
another woman complain,

1010
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,042
"I can't get a guy to call me back."

1011
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,338
Well, take a vibrator,
press it against his chode,

1012
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,258
and you will have
to shut down a cell tower

1013
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,219
because that man
is gonna harass you. All right?

1014
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,388
[laughter, applause]

1015
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,766
[cheering]

1016
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,809
Yeah.

1017
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,437
After you make him shiver.

1018
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,230
[laughter]

1019
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,067
Don't be an asshole
and put it on high speed the first time.

1020
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,028
You'll send him to the emergency room.
But... Ease into it.

1021
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,197
One, two, three. He'll be like, all right!

1022
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,866
[laughter]

1023
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:21,041
[sighs] I'm not piling on you for
not doing enough, if you're a woman.

1024
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,335
Guys are the worst.
Absolutely.

1025
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,338
Every guy friend of mine
that complains about a sex thing,

1026
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,590
it's always the same stupid shit.

1027
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,552
They'll be like, "You know,
like, I liked her, but she's not slutty.

1028
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,087
She didn't do anything slutty."

1029
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,183
I'm like, "Huh. You tell her
what you like?" "Unh-unh."

1030
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,812
I'm like, "Oh.
Well, you weird silent fuck."

1031
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,147
[laughter]

1032
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,023
"You gotta tell her.
If she likes you, she'll do it.

1033
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,026
Gotta tell her, 'Put on a clown suit
and peg me.' Or whatever you like."

1034
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,904
[laughter]

1035
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,949
I'll tell you my favorite.
I don't give a shit.

1036
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,451
I love the medical genre.

1037
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,828
That is my favorite.

1038
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:00,289
I love those pornos
where the guy goes in the doctor's office.

1039
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,374
He's like, "Oh, my back hurts."

1040
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,629
The nurse is like, "That's 'cause your
big stupid balls are full. Get over here."

1041
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,172
[laughter]

1042
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,465
I love that.

1043
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:15,387
I love it, I told my wife,
and now we have scrubs.

1044
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,933
[laughter, cheers]

1045
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,435
Everybody likes it. Don't act like--
whenever you--

1046
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,772
If you're a guy and you see a nurse,
you always are like...

1047
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,942
"Maybe she'll suck it."
Like that. Like, you always...

1048
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,736
Even if you see a nurse walking around,
you're like, "Hey.

1049
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,571
What? No,
I didn't say anything. I was just..."

1050
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,030
[laughter]

1051
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,826
"Do you? Okay, no, you don't? Okay.

1052
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,369
No, I feel fine. Thank you."

1053
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,121
It's the best. I love--

1054
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,040
I love, though, on the medical pornos,
those scenes,

1055
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,086
they always end with letting you know
how he's doing medically.

1056
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,631
Like the guy goes, "Uhhh.

1057
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,133
My back feels better."
You're like, "Oh, wow."

1058
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,301
[laughter]

1059
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,638
"We were all worried
about your third lumbar. So, that's good."

1060
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,517
Crazy, and I swear, this is true,

1061
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,227
as much as I love that shit,

1062
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:08,357
I have never in my life
seen a smaller version of my own dick

1063
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,921
than when I'm in the doctor's office.

1064
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,611
Like, it gets so small,

1065
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,321
and it leans to the left.

1066
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,448
So my dick is like, "What did you say?"

1067
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,367
[laughter]

1068
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,076
"Hmm?

1069
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,662
Should I be here, Dad?"

1070
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,043
You ever yell at it?
You're like, "What the fuck?!

1071
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,420
Monday we were hitting thigh,
and today you're like,

1072
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,257
- 'I want to stay in bed and read. So...'"
- [laughter]

1073
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,260
"'You go out.
I'm gonna draw a bath. Bye.'"

1074
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,262
And you'll be like,
"You stupid little dick!"

1075
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,808
They have porno suggestions.
Isn't that weird too?

1076
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,269
Like you watch a scene,
It's like, "You might also like..."

1077
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,854
And you're like, "What?"

1078
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,066
And then its like some weird sh--
It's like,

1079
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,944
"Sis is mad at her brother
for not leaving,

1080
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:57,448
so she blows him."
And you're like, "Ugh! Gross.

1081
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,575
All right, I'm gonna see
what it looks like."

1082
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,369
They're not really related.

1083
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,919
That scene is so stupid cause they always
call each other Bro and Sis,

1084
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,089
like any fucking people
on the planet do that.

1085
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,425
The girl's like, "Bro! My friends
are coming over. Get outta here."

1086
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,470
He's like, "No way, Sis. Not leaving."

1087
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,597
"Come on! What'll it take?"

1088
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,474
"Boop. Right there.
That's what it'll take."

1089
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,810
"Okay." And you're like, "All right.

1090
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,895
It's not a good premise,
but I'll watch it."

1091
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,354
[laughter]

1092
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,903
[sighs] Let me ask you this.

1093
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,196
If you're white,

1094
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,159
aren't you a little tired of being
blamed for every racial injustice?

1095
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,913
- Like, doesn't part of you...
- [man] Yeah!

1096
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:46,998
[blows raspberry]

1097
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,916
[laughter]

1098
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,003
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good. So...

1099
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,838
[laughter]

1100
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,007
People are like, "What the fuck?"

1101
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,592
No! That's what I'm saying! Like...

1102
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,054
Don't you kinda want to tell, like,
the other people,

1103
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:05,057
"Why doesn't your group
get their shit together, and then

1104
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:09,103
you can ascend to the top and then
you can oppress other people."

1105
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,646
[mixed laughter]

1106
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,232
Not as many claps on that one.
Well, uh...

1107
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,610
[laughter, applause]

1108
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,905
Oops.

1109
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,740
[crowd chuckles]

1110
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,492
Here's all I'm saying. Okay?

1111
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,704
Every race is racist. Okay?

1112
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:30,541
We're the best at it,
but every race is racist.

1113
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,834
Who's super racist?

1114
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,294
Asians. Right? Yeah, you guys are...

1115
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,006
You're nodding. Like, "You know
goddamn right I am. Of course."

1116
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,927
You don't know about it?
There's a hierarchy to the whole thing.

1117
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,722
Here's how it works.
Japanese, they're number one,

1118
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,349
which is weird 'cause
their genitals are blurry.

1119
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,193
- But they're number one. Right?
- [laughter]

1120
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,021
Then...

1121
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,732
[crowd cheering]

1122
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,862
Chinese and Koreans are right there.

1123
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,657
And everybody else
who's, like, tan, like...

1124
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,409
[laughter]

1125
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,786
Vietnamese and Filipino, they're like--

1126
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,496
[spits] "Fuck you!"

1127
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,998
[laughter]

1128
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,833
True or not?

1129
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,543
Yeah.

1130
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,629
Don't you feel better about everything
right now? Like...

1131
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,464
What's your ethnic background?

1132
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,426
You're Chinese? That's number two.
That's almost at the top.

1133
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,345
That's great.

1134
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,099
That's gotta feel good, right?

1135
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,976
Who did you, like--

1136
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,771
Who did your parents talk
the most shit about, growing up?

1137
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,857
Wait. Were you raised
in an Asian household,

1138
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,777
or are you one of those,
"That's cute, lets get one of those"?

1139
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,528
[laughter]

1140
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,865
'Cause that's a legit question.

1141
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,206
Asian? So who'd your parents talk the most
shit about growing up, racially?

1142
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,999
- Be honest. Huh?
- [man] Japanese.

1143
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,086
- Japanese! Fuckin'... All right, so...
- [laughter]

1144
00:54:58,254 --> 00:54:59,964
Do you hate Japanese people?

1145
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,549
No? They fucking hate you.
A lot.

1146
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,260
[laughter]

1147
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,139
You know they do. Uh...

1148
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,892
What do your parents say about them?
What's the shit that they talk?

1149
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,936
[man] They wanted me to marry one.

1150
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,437
They wanted you to marry one?

1151
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,940
[man continues indistinctly]

1152
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,942
They wanted her to do whatever you want.

1153
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,988
- Are your parents Saudi or...?
- [laughter]

1154
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,201
Can I get this fucking straight
for a second?

1155
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,956
Your parents were like,
"We want our beautiful Chinese boy

1156
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,750
to marry a Japanese girl

1157
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,920
so that 'she'll do whatever you want'"?

1158
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,880
- Meaning they're submissive?
- [man] Yes.

1159
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,967
Yeah. All right. So who's this fucking
lady sitting next to you?

1160
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,516
What's she all about?

1161
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,643
Hey! Don't fucking answer. It's his world.

1162
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,062
- What is-- What is, uh...
- [roaring laughter]

1163
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,149
Ask him if you can answer.

1164
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,942
[laughter]

1165
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,239
She's Chinese? Damn!

1166
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,158
[laughter]

1167
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,203
Do you know-- [laughs]

1168
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,538
Do you know how I found out
about Asian racism?

1169
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,082
This is how I found out about it.
I had no idea.

1170
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,417
I'm shooting a commercial in L.A.,

1171
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,087
and they fly in a Japanese director, okay?

1172
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,631
- Uhhh. Grunts, everything. So...
- [laughter]

1173
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,634
Yeah. So I was like,
"Do you have indigestion?"

1174
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,303
He was, "Uhh. No."

1175
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,056
We're shooting the commercial,
and between takes,

1176
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,350
there's a Filipino production assistant.

1177
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,019
So, he come up and talks to us
and he walks away.

1178
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,938
And when he walks away,
I see the Japanese director

1179
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,691
give him a very dismissive look, like...

1180
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,073
And I go, "Hey! I saw that, with my eyes.
What was that all about?"

1181
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,991
I go, "You don't like him?"
And he goes...

1182
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,619
And I go, "Why not?"
And he goes...

1183
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,289
[laughter]

1184
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:58,916
Did you catch it? It was really fast.

1185
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,542
[laughter]

1186
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,671
He basically said, "I don't like him
'cause I don't like his skin color."

1187
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,383
And he did it with this little gesture.

1188
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,844
And I was like, "Holy shit!

1189
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,181
That's fucking brilliant.
How did I not think of that?"

1190
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,017
You don't have to worry about people
hearing you and getting hit.

1191
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,936
Just make a little thing
and move it along. Like...

1192
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,854
[laughter]

1193
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:24,858
Don't act like you're not gonna use that
five fucking times this week.

1194
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,610
[applause]

1195
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:33,491
When you're in your favorite restaurant
and "they" come in, you're like...

1196
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,952
[laughter]

1197
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,787
"Let's take it to go. Thanks a lot."

1198
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,414
[laughter]

1199
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,836
Oh, guys. Thank you for having jobs.

1200
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,298
Um... I'm assuming you do.

1201
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:51,509
I don't fucking know. You're here.
Maybe you robbed somebody. But...

1202
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:55,472
I was just thinking about how long
it's been since I've had a job,

1203
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,435
and how I absolutely could not
get one right now.

1204
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,479
If I went into a place and gave them
my résumé, they'd be like,

1205
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,691
"What's with this 13-year gap
on here, man?"

1206
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,486
And I'd be like, "What's with all
the questions, dude? Chill out."

1207
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,908
I mean, if I had to get a job,
I think I would just go for a job

1208
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,494
where no one knows
what the fuck I'm talking about,

1209
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,247
so I could just make shit up. Because...

1210
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,665
There's a few of those.

1211
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,669
Like, the spokesman
for an arson investigation. Um...

1212
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,173
Arson means fire, by the way.
I'm seeing a lot of blank faces. And...

1213
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,882
[laughter]

1214
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,592
You can see them online.

1215
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,387
Like, a guy comes out to a podium,

1216
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,473
and there's a mic
and there's news people around.

1217
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:40,225
There's a burned down building
behind, and he's just like--

1218
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,145
"Hey. That shit burned down."

1219
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,272
[laughter]

1220
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,316
"Could you tell us a little more?"

1221
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,486
He's like, "What?" Totally aggravated.
"What do you wanna know?"

1222
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,988
"How did it start?"
"It was a match."

1223
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,368
And they go, "How do you know?"
"We found it."

1224
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:02,664
"It." Like it's one. There's other
matches and he's like, "Mm-mmm."

1225
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,748
"This one."

1226
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,419
They go,
"How do you know that's the match?"

1227
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:10,047
"Just complicated fire shit.
You wouldn't understand."

1228
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,842
Thing is, man,

1229
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,971
I miss zero part of having a day job.

1230
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,890
That's the truth. I miss zero part.

1231
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,267
The only part I still miss

1232
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:25,729
is spreading rumors and gossip
about people that work there.

1233
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,191
That's the fucking best.

1234
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,568
It is! I remember.

1235
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,320
Going to work sucks.

1236
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,447
That's universal. I mean, shit!

1237
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,324
Most of you will have it on Monday.

1238
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:40,285
Fuckin'-- the alarm goes off,
and you go, "Motherfucker!"

1239
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,246
[laughter]

1240
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,626
"Today's gonna suck!"

1241
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,003
[laughter]

1242
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,967
"But I'm gonna talk shit about Amanda
when I get there." And then that...

1243
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,636
raises your spirit right?

1244
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,099
You think about that in the shower.
"I'm gonna ruin Amanda's day today."

1245
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,683
[laughter]

1246
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,769
"This is for you, Amanda. Aahh."

1247
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:12,859
The fucked-up thing is people
making you feel badly for enjoying that.

1248
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,446
You shouldn't feel badly
for enjoying gossip.

1249
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,323
It's 100 percent normal
and natural to

1250
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:22,286
because it's definitely
an extension of childhood.

1251
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:26,373
Because all of us, when we were kids,
and all kids now,

1252
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:30,877
for a certain period of time,
the worst storytellers ever, okay?

1253
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:33,713
You don't know shit
about editing information,

1254
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,133
enhancing things,
keeping people's interest.

1255
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,510
You don't have to have a kid to
know about this.

1256
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:40,929
Talk to any kid. A friends kid.
A niece, a nephew.

1257
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,057
It's when you go to a kid, you go like,
"Hey, were you outside?"

1258
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,892
And they go, "Yeah!" And you're like,

1259
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,146
"Why don't you dial that back?
That was crazy. Okay?"

1260
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,316
And then you ask one question, like,
"How was that?" And they go,

1261
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,944
"I have-- When--
When Jeanette came by,

1262
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,947
she-- she didn't--
she brought the yellow cup that--

1263
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:02,159
she didn't want to kick the ball back,
but I said, can--

1264
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,536
'Cause Brian's cup is red,

1265
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,332
that if you-- if you--
if you don't have it now,

1266
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,834
then you don't have to bring the blue--

1267
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,212
'Cause the blue one
that Jane had was with her.

1268
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:15,880
I said, 'If you don't have it,

1269
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:19,092
you can-- you can use mine now,
but then...

1270
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,386
then next it's my turn.'"

1271
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,888
You go, "That was a great fucking story.
Thank you."

1272
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,266
[laughter, applause]

1273
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:31,980
Je-sus!

1274
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,607
[laughter]

1275
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,903
And then kids accidentally tell
their first good story.

1276
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,323
They don't mean to, it's an accident.

1277
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,033
That's why it leaves an impact.

1278
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,035
'Cause you go, "Were you at the park?"

1279
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,578
And they go, "Yeah."

1280
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,121
And you go, "How was that?"

1281
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,040
And they go, "I saw Uncle Jeff,

1282
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:54,378
and he had a lady sitting on his lap.
But it wasn't Aunt Maria."

1283
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,753
And you're like, "What?"

1284
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,589
[laughter]

1285
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:04,262
And the kid's like, "Shit, I've never seen
that fucking face before!"

1286
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:10,268
And you're like, "That's a good story.
Go find more stories like that."

1287
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,062
[laughter]

1288
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,813
That's burned into your psyche.

1289
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,525
That's why you go to work,
you see your coworker,

1290
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,235
you're like, "Hey, I got some juice."

1291
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,613
And they're like, "Is it gonna negatively
impact somebody's life?"

1292
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,615
[chortles] "Yeah." And they're like,

1293
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,742
"Fucking hook that shit up!"

1294
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,869
[cheers and applause]

1295
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,916
I've spread so many fucking rumors.

1296
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:38,338
My favorite part about rumors,
nobody verifies shit.

1297
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,298
Somebody says something once
and you're like,

1298
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,926
"Cool, I'll roll with that forever.
Thanks, man."

1299
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,472
"Are you gonna fact check that?"
"Why? You said it out loud.

1300
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:51,017
I don't have to check anything out.
It's now a fact. So, whatever."

1301
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:56,147
It's a seed, right?
You ever a part of one that just grows?

1302
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:59,067
I remember years ago,
I'm watching a movie with my dad.

1303
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,569
In the middle of the movie,

1304
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,780
the actor, Tommy Lee Jones,
appears onscreen.

1305
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,282
Great actor. Oscar winner.

1306
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,620
Unprompted, my dad turns to me
and he goes, "Did you know he was gay?"

1307
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,539
And I was like, "No."

1308
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:14,874
"Yeah."

1309
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,793
[laughter]

1310
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,796
Now, it doesn't matter, and I don't care.

1311
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,257
But I decided I would tell

1312
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,010
everyone I ever met
for the rest of my life

1313
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,722
that Tommy Lee Jones is gay.

1314
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,767
I told a lot of people.

1315
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,728
Like, from The Fugitive
through No Country for Old Men.

1316
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,481
- I told everybody.
- [laughter]

1317
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,943
Until one day I told somebody
and he goes, "No, he isn't."

1318
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,196
And I was like, "Yeah, he is."

1319
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,031
And he goes, "How do you know that?"

1320
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,950
And I said, "My dad told me."

1321
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,369
[laughter]

1322
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,246
"What? Your dad fuck him
or something?"

1323
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,790
[laughter]

1324
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,333
I was like, "I don't think so."

1325
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,170
Then he goes, "I've known him 40 years.

1326
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,757
I know his wife and kids. I knew him
when he was single. He is not gay."

1327
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,593
And I go, "What is happening right now?"

1328
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,178
[laughter]

1329
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,847
And I called my dad immediately.

1330
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:14,058
And I was like, "Dad!

1331
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:19,731
I just got confirmation
that Tommy Lee Jones isn't gay."

1332
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,942
And my dad goes,
"Oh, I thought he was."

1333
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,153
[laughter]

1334
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:29,324
"Is that the end of your investigation?
Are you fucking serious?

1335
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,703
Why did you tell me that?"
He goes, "I don't know."

1336
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,580
I said, "Did somebody tell you?"
He goes, "I can't remember."

1337
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:41,252
I said, "Have you been telling everybody
for 15 years that Tommy Lee Jones is gay?"

1338
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,338
And he goes, "Yep."

1339
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:47,091
I go, "Don't you think we should stop?"
He goes, "Now we should."

1340
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,260
[laughter]

1341
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,762
Just made that shit up.

1342
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,599
This is not made-up.
I'll tell you this, man.

1343
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,310
[sighs] Not too long ago,

1344
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,938
I met former heavyweight
champion of the world

1345
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,316
Iron Mike Tyson. And...

1346
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,610
[cheers and applause]

1347
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,826
It completely changed my perspective
on a famous person,

1348
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,537
'cause I thought I knew famous people.

1349
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,081
Friends of mine on TV and movies,

1350
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,125
they are dog shit next to Mike Tyson.

1351
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:25,922
Think about how-- he is famous
the way an ex-president is famous,

1352
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,843
in that he can't go anywhere in the world
without everyone knowing who he is.

1353
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,847
You can take him to the Philippines,
you can take him to Siberia,

1354
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,015
you can take him to Namibia
and people would be like,

1355
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,561
[smacking] "Mike Tyson."
Everybody knows Mike Tyson.

1356
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,106
That's a perfect impression,
by the way. So...

1357
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:47,694
we're on an afternoon flight
from L.A. to Pittsburgh.

1358
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:50,906
He is sitting across the aisle
one row back.

1359
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,616
He's right there.

1360
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:56,077
It takes an extra hour
to board the flight. Why?

1361
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,457
Because every passenger that boards
sees him, and they're like,

1362
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,334
"Get the fuck out of here."

1363
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,796
And they shit their pants.

1364
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,506
And he's super nice.
He shakes everyone's hand.

1365
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,259
Flight attendants are telling people,
"Go to your seat."

1366
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,887
- And they're like, "Nope."
- [laughter]

1367
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,221
"Talking to him."

1368
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,057
"We're not asking you,
we're telling you."

1369
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,685
"I don't give a shit.
I'm not going anywhere."

1370
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:23,855
It takes forever. We leave late.
I don't say anything.

1371
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:26,065
About half an hour's left in the flight,

1372
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,277
and then I tell myself,
"You have to say something.

1373
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,070
You're never going to run into him again."

1374
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,783
So I get up, walk over to his seat
and I go, "I'm sorry to bother you.

1375
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,828
I grew up watching all of your fights,
and I'm a big fan."

1376
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,663
And he goes, "Thank you."

1377
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:40,831
[laughter]

1378
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,792
I said, "I'm just curious,
why are you going to Pittsburgh?"

1379
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,878
He goes, "I'm promoting a fight.
What about you?"

1380
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:49,798
I said, "I'm a comedian.
I'm going to do shows."

1381
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,257
And he goes-- [giggles]

1382
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,928
"You're a comedian?"

1383
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,053
I go, "Yeah."

1384
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,722
He said, "Where's your show?"

1385
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,934
I said "It's a comedy club
called the Pittsburgh Improv."

1386
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,477
And he goes, "Where's that?"

1387
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,939
- And I go, "I have no fucking idea."
- [laughter]

1388
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,483
And he goes, "Is your show tonight?"
And I go, "No.

1389
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,277
It's eleven o'clock at night
and we're on a plane."

1390
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,154
[laughter]

1391
01:07:17,993 --> 01:07:19,619
"We're in the sky right now, Mike."

1392
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,748
He goes, "Well, when's your show?"

1393
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,709
And I go, "Tomorrow."

1394
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,084
And he goes, "Where?"

1395
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,838
And I go,
"Still at the Pittsburgh Improv."

1396
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,216
He goes, "How do I find it?"

1397
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,387
I go, "I don't fucking know.
Google it."

1398
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,348
Then it hits me, like, two seconds later

1399
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,727
how batshit crazy it is of me

1400
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,103
to tell him to like, Google it.

1401
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,147
- You know? Like...
- [laughter]

1402
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,942
"You figure it out, fuckface!"

1403
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:52,235
[laughter]

1404
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,029
Am I out of my mind? So...

1405
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,032
I grab a DVD out of my bag,
I give it to him.

1406
01:07:57,114 --> 01:08:00,535
I go, "It has my name on it, just
type it in. It'll show you where I'm at."

1407
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,705
He goes, "Thank you."
I go, "That's cool. I met Tyson."

1408
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,291
Ten seconds later,
I'm sitting in my seat and I hear,

1409
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,002
"Tom?"

1410
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,795
[laughter]

1411
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,926
"Yes, Mike Tyson?"

1412
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,721
He goes,
"Were you on television recently?"

1413
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,848
And I go, "Mm-mmm."

1414
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,683
He goes, "Are you sure?"

1415
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,393
And I go, "Yeah, I think so."

1416
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,103
And he goes, "Nothing?"

1417
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,606
And I go, "I mean, I'm on Netflix."

1418
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,983
And he goes, "I fucking love Netflix."

1419
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,818
[laughter]

1420
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:35,904
"Okay."

1421
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,698
He goes, "What's your favorite show
on Netflix, Tom?"

1422
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,867
I go, "Are we really doing this right now?

1423
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,495
Like, shouting across the aisle?"

1424
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,873
"I like House of Cards, man!" Like...

1425
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,708
[laughter]

1426
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,543
It feels crazy, okay?

1427
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,879
So, I'm super nervous.
I don't know what to say--

1428
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,757
I'm like, "I don't know.
I watched Breaking Bad on Netflix."

1429
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,843
And he goes,
"My wife likes Breaking Bad."

1430
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,554
But he said it like,
"You like shit my wife likes."

1431
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,847
And I was like, "Ugh."

1432
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:06,684
Then his eyes light up like saucers,
and he's like,

1433
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,062
"Oh! You like Sons of Anarchy?"

1434
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,815
And I know it's a great show.
There's a lot of great shows.

1435
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,025
I can't see every show.
I've never seen it.

1436
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:17,612
Do you ever lie?
Like a child to an adult?

1437
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,490
'Cause you think they'll like you more
if you like the same thing?

1438
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,994
Well, I saw that face and I go,
"It's my favorite show of all time."

1439
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,620
[laughter]

1440
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,792
And he's like, "It's the shit!"

1441
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,962
And I was like, "Oh, I know.
That one episode? That's my favorite."

1442
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:38,133
And then he gives me
a fist bump across the aisle, right?

1443
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,843
Is this not registering to you?

1444
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,804
I get a Mike Tyson fist bump.

1445
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,015
[crowd cheers]

1446
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,640
Yeah.

1447
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:53,272
I can feel his powers
transferring from his hand into mine.

1448
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,026
I'm like, "Oh, shit." That's crazy, right?

1449
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,486
I'm so happy.

1450
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,279
And then a few seconds later,

1451
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,699
I feel a bear paw on my shoulder.

1452
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:06,285
And I turn,
and Tyson is standing above me.

1453
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:09,330
- I'm like, "Jesus Christ!"
- [laughter]

1454
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:15,086
Immediately he leans down and he whispers
in my ear so nobody else can hear,

1455
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:18,882
and he goes,
"I've been watching a lot of Netflix."

1456
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,426
- That's it. That's all he said.
- [laughter]

1457
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,517
Dude, I never thought
that sentence could be terrifying.

1458
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,019
[laughter]

1459
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:37,108
And now he's just looking at me like,
"Now you say something, bitch."

1460
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:38,902
Ya know?

1461
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,822
I was like, "I never turn it off.
It's the best." I don't know what to say.

1462
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,866
He goes, "Now I recognize you."

1463
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,242
And I go, "What?"

1464
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,078
And he holds up the DVD.

1465
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:50,496
And I go, "I just gave that to you."

1466
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,542
And he goes,
"It's the same picture that's on Netflix."

1467
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,878
And I go, "Oh, yeah.
That's the same picture."

1468
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,421
He goes, "I know who you are."

1469
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,131
I go, "That's crazy."

1470
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:01,816
And he goes,
"Give me your phone number."

1471
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,509
And I go, "What?!"

1472
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,805
I give him my number, we land.

1473
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,349
I fucking run off the plane. Okay?

1474
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,310
It's like...
too much weird shit for one day.

1475
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,313
The next day,

1476
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:21,652
I'm sitting in my hotel room,
and I get a text message from Mike Tyson.

1477
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,616
[cheers and applause]

1478
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,495
You know what it says?

1479
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,998
- "Where's your show?"
- [laughter]

1480
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,836
And I go, "The Pittsburgh Improv."

1481
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,255
"Where's that?"

1482
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,799
I fucking Google it.

1483
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,260
[laughter]

1484
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:47,971
I send it to him, and the phone rings.

1485
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,098
"Hey, Tom."

1486
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,226
And I go, "'Sup, Champ?"

1487
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,107
[cheers and applause]

1488
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,114
He goes, "We're coming
to your show tonight, brother."

1489
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,950
And I go, "That's fucking crazy!"

1490
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,244
He goes, "Yeah, we wanna watch you
do your work."

1491
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,870
And I go, "Well, I'm honored."

1492
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:15,414
And he goes, "It's all love."

1493
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,292
[laughter]

1494
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,255
I know what he's saying.
I know the expression.

1495
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,716
And I just want to reciprocate,
but I-- I don't know what to do.

1496
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,886
And I'm super nervous,
and I just go, "I love you."

1497
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,888
[laughter]

1498
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:38,729
And he goes, "Mmm, good luck
at your show." And he hangs up the phone.

1499
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,940
Seattle, you're the best.
Thank you so much.

1500
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,693
- Thank you very much.
- [cheers and applause]

1501
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,153
Appreciate it. Thank you.

1502
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,991
[up-tempo music playing]
