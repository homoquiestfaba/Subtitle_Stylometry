He could be a suspect!

711
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,223
<i>Hey.</i>

712
00:51:09,806 --> 00:51:10,889
Hey.

713
00:51:12,056 --> 00:51:15,223
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

714
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:17,722
How you been?

715
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:21,764
Yeah, I've been okay.

716
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:24,473
<i>I was just...</i>

717
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:28,348
I was just headed back upstairs.

718
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:30,098
Well...

719
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:32,847
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

720
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,306
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

721
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,973
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

722

<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

723
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,764
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

724
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:55,931

731

I lost you in there.

732
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:12,931
Yeah, I gotta go.

733

00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:28,722
I hope, uh...

739
00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:34,722

[Batman] What do you know about

759
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:06,681
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

760
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,472
Yeah, sure, there was.

761
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,014
That's the rat we're looking for.

762
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,806
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

763
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:20,389
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

764
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:21,931
Where are you getting this?

765
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:24,889
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

766
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:27,140
Gil's very nervous.

767
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:30,639
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

768
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,597
I worked that case.

769
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:34,639
Riddler's not after you.

770
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:35,639
How do you know?

771
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:37,431
You're not corrupt.

772
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:40,014
Colson's dirty?

773
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,389
Maybe I, uh...

774
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:51,389
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

775
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:54,764
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

776
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:57,305
Who knows how many people it touches.

777
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,597
Politicians. Police. The courts.

778
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:03,597
It could tear the whole city apart.

779
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:06,056
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

780
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,431
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

- [Alfred] Pretty.

794
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:32,347
She a new friend of yours?

795
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,140
I'm not so sure.

796
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:40,472
Looks like you upset her.

797
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,764
Shall I take this as a good sign?

798
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:44,848
What?

799
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:45,848
Your attire.

800
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:48,056
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

801
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

802
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,889
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

803
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:55,514
Riddler might not be able to resist.

804
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:57,056
Oh, that reminds me.

805
00:56:58,223 --> 00:57:02,181
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

806
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:04,223
The one from the rat maze.

807
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,723
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

808
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,931
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

809
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:13,264
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

810
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,306
[Bruce] <i>Rata Alada?</i>

811
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:16,597
"Rat with wings"?

812
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:19,181
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

813
00:57:19,264 --> 00:57:20,514
Yeah.

814
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:23,098
A stool pigeon.

815
00:57:23,347 --> 00:57:24,973
Where are your cufflinks?

816
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:26,015
I couldn't find them.

817
00:57:27,472 --> 00:57:29,431
Well, you can't go out like that.

818
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,306
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

819
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:38,264
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

Hey, watch it, fellas.

841
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,472
You got the prince of the city there.

843
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:44,181
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,723
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

845
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:48,431
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

846
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:50,514
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

847
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:52,806
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

848
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:54,890
Wow. Is that right?

849
00:59:54,973 --> 00:59:57,015
His father saved my life.

850
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:01,181
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

851
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:05,890
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

852

Operated right on the dining room table.

Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

I remember your face.

855
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:22,097
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

856
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,598
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

857
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,514
"Hippocratic oath."

858
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:31,264
That's good.

01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:38,181
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

886
01:01:38,264 --> 01:01:40,931
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

887
01:01:41,014 --> 01:01:42,347
Will you walk with me?

Mr. Wayne.

891
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:53,931
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

892
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,348
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

893
01:01:56,431 --> 01:01:58,848
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

894
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,389
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

895
01:02:01,972 --> 01:02:03,264
Thank you.

01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:05,139
[Bella] My God.

897
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:09,473
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

898
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:11,181
I want to continue this.

899
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:16,264
Excuse me.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

Can I talk to you?

[Mackenzie] What?

905
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,097
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

906
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,222
Christ, not again.

907
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:35,389
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

908

You got people looking for him, Jim?

[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

910
01:02:42,765 --> 01:02:43,681
[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

911
01:02:43,765 --> 01:02:44,972
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

Please.

He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

956

He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

I'm so sorry.

Looks like a combination lock.

Can't we just cut it off?

960
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:10,389
Not if you want to keep your head.

"Unmask"?

01:07:45,806 --> 01:07:46,806

997
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:23,806
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

- "Justice."
- Huh?

1010
01:08:55,139 --> 01:08:56,181
The answer's "justice."

1011

Oh, God. "Bribes"?

- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1027

I get a monthly payment

What cases?

1029

- [Batman] The rat.

The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

- He's gonna kill you.

I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

If I go out this way, it's just me.

1044

But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

- People are watching.
- What people?

1047

than you could ever imagine.

[Martinez]
Who do you think he is under there?

1059
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:00,056
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1060
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,140
[Martinez] I want to see.

1061
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:03,681
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1062
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,889
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1063
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,430
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1064
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:11,722
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1065
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:12,973
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1066
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:16,681
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1067
01:11:16,764 --> 01:11:18,430
Relax, God damn it!

1068
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:20,014
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1069
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,973
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1070
01:11:24,056 --> 01:11:26,472
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1071
01:11:26,556 --> 01:11:27,973
Maybe it's on yours.

1072
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,472
What'd you say?

1073
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:32,140
He would rather die than talk.

1074
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,223
What was he afraid of?

1075
01:11:34,973 --> 01:11:36,056
You?

1076

[menacing music playing]

1077
01:11:43,181 --> 01:11:44,597
You son of a bitch.

1078
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:48,181
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1079
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:49,973
You could be an accessory to murder.

1080
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,056
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1081
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,848
[officers clamoring]

1082
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,056
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1083
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,140
Back off! Back off!

1084
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:58,514
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1085
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:00,681
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1086
01:12:00,764 --> 01:12:03,556
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1087
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:05,681
[breathing heavily]

1088
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:07,764
You too now?

1089
01:12:07,848 --> 01:12:10,389
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1090
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:13,056
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1091
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,389
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1092
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:19,681
Okay, give him the room.

1093
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:36,597
Two minutes.

1094
01:12:48,347 --> 01:12:49,931
You listen to me.

1095
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,514
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1096
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:57,140
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1097
01:12:57,223 --> 01:12:58,889
Well, you punched me in the face.

1098
01:12:59,973 --> 01:13:01,056
[Batman scoffs]

1099
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,431
Take this key.

1100
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:07,098
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1101
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,848
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1102
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:13,140
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

1103

[suspenseful music playing]

1104
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:18,889
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1105
01:13:22,305 --> 01:13:25,015
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1106
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:28,015
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1107
01:13:28,931 --> 01:13:31,556
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1108
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:36,223
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1109
01:13:40,806 --> 01:13:42,306
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1110
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:43,889
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1111
01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:46,347

1119

[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1120
01:15:12,389 --> 01:15:13,598
I did.

1121
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:17,056
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1122
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:19,180
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1123
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,389
I only trust you.

1124
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:22,806
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1125
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:26,264
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1126
01:15:27,015 --> 01:15:28,139
You think Penguin's the rat?

1127
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:31,264
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1128
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:33,306
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1129
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:34,723
DA was a regular too.

1130
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:38,306
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1131
01:15:39,389 --> 01:15:40,598
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

1132
01:15:40,681 --> 01:15:41,639
The what?

1133
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:43,180
Riddler's latest.

1134
01:15:43,264 --> 01:15:44,973
The cipher in the maze.

1135
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:47,556
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1136
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:50,764
A penguin's got wings too.

1137
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:54,723
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1138
01:15:54,806 --> 01:15:56,472
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1139
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:59,764
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1140
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:03,015
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

The recycling plant.

[Batman] <i>I'm here.</i>

1151

- [Penguin] How you doing?
- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1152
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,973
[Penguin] Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

It's a drug lab. Drops.

This is a buy.

1157
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:13,264
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1158
01:17:13,347 --> 01:17:14,514
Or they never shut it down at all.

1159

[Gordon] <i>What are you saying?</i>

1160
01:17:15,556 --> 01:17:18,681
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

the rat, so you killed her.

would do to me

- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1423

Your friend got involved

1424

She didn't know any better.

1425

explained it to her.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1427
01:37:35,306 --> 01:37:36,806
It means your choices have consequences.

1429
01:37:39,348 --> 01:37:42,056
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

- What?

1431

You don't know

1435

Falcone owes me that money.

- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1437

Oh, really? Why's that?

1438
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:01,973
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1439
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:03,806
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1440
01:38:03,889 --> 01:38:04,889
would owe you anything.

1441
01:38:04,973 --> 01:38:07,306

Because he's my father!

1442

My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1443
01:38:20,722 --> 01:38:22,014
Just like Anni.

1444
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:26,722
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1445
01:38:28,806 --> 01:38:30,140
To the club?

1446
01:38:31,056 --> 01:38:32,056
Yeah.

1447
01:38:34,764 --> 01:38:37,639
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1448
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:39,848
Used to see him there.

1449
01:38:40,597 --> 01:38:42,597
He scared the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:44,556 --> 01:38:48,014
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1451
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:52,389
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1452
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:58,098
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1453
01:38:58,764 --> 01:39:00,265
Strangled.

1454
01:39:00,681 --> 01:39:04,140
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1455
01:39:06,014 --> 01:39:08,098
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1456
01:39:08,181 --> 01:39:10,347
and he didn't say a thing.

1457
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:13,973
Couldn't even look at me.

1458
01:39:17,722 --> 01:39:19,472
He owes me that money.

1459
01:39:21,265 --> 01:39:22,681
I'm sorry.

1460
01:39:23,806 --> 01:39:24,973
For what I said.

1461
01:39:26,347 --> 01:39:27,764
Oh, it's all right.

to go after these creeps.

1577
01:45:55,514 --> 01:45:57,348
But you'd be surprised

1578
01:45:57,431 --> 01:45:59,806
what even a good man like him

1579
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:02,473
is capable of in the right situation.

1580
01:46:04,723 --> 01:46:06,181
Do me a favor.

1581
01:46:06,514 --> 01:46:08,556
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1582
01:46:09,264 --> 01:46:10,848
This reporter

1583
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:13,264
was a lowlife.

1584
01:46:13,348 --> 01:46:14,806
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1585
01:46:16,431 --> 01:46:18,056
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1586
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:22,056
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1587
01:46:23,473 --> 01:46:26,972
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1588
01:46:27,056 --> 01:46:29,389
that your father would be in my pocket,

1589
01:46:30,139 --> 01:46:31,139
forever.

1590
01:46:31,806 --> 01:46:33,848
He would have done anything

1591
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,097
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1592
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:37,514
You understand?

1593
01:46:38,723 --> 01:46:43,264
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1594
01:46:43,348 --> 01:46:45,389
Do I know it for a fact?

1595
01:46:47,806 --> 01:46:49,889
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1596
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,556
This is what you wanted, huh?

1597
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,056
This little conversation here?

1598
01:46:56,556 --> 01:46:57,972
[exhales ruefully]

1599
01:46:58,473 --> 01:47:00,640
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1600
01:47:03,264 --> 01:47:05,389
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1601
01:47:08,848 --> 01:47:10,930
[melancholy music playing]

1602
01:47:55,014 --> 01:47:56,972
[EKG machine beeping]

1603
01:48:00,431 --> 01:48:02,097
[inhales sharply]

1604
01:48:07,348 --> 01:48:09,097
[rain pattering]

1605
01:48:11,889 --> 01:48:12,972
[sighs]

1606
01:48:14,723 --> 01:48:16,014
You lied to me...

1607
01:48:18,847 --> 01:48:20,473
my whole life.

1608
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,681
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1609
01:48:30,765 --> 01:48:34,056
He told me what he did for my father.

1610
01:48:38,056 --> 01:48:39,556
About Salvatore Maroni.

1611
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:44,264
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1612
01:48:44,348 --> 01:48:46,097
Had my father killed.

1613
01:48:48,556 --> 01:48:50,764
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1614
01:48:53,515 --> 01:48:58,056
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1615
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:00,473
believing that he was a good man.

1616
01:49:00,556 --> 01:49:02,139
He was a good man.

1617
01:49:03,306 --> 01:49:05,014
You listen to me.

1618
01:49:05,097 --> 01:49:08,515
Your father was a good man.

1619
01:49:12,139 --> 01:49:14,056
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1620
01:49:14,139 --> 01:49:16,056
He had a man killed.

1621
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:17,223
Why?

1622
01:49:18,389 --> 01:49:21,640
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1623
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:23,972
His political aspirations?

1624
01:49:24,056 --> 01:49:27,598
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1625
01:49:30,181 --> 01:49:31,722
He was protecting your mother.

1626
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:36,223
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1627
01:49:36,306 --> 01:49:38,431
He cared about her,

1628
01:49:38,515 --> 01:49:39,806
and you,

1629
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:42,806
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1630
01:49:42,889 --> 01:49:46,348
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1631
01:49:47,223 --> 01:49:50,556
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1632
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,764
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1633
01:49:53,847 --> 01:49:55,681
That's who Falcone is.

1634
01:49:57,931 --> 01:50:00,139
And that was your father's mistake.

1635
01:50:00,223 --> 01:50:02,264
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1636
01:50:02,348 --> 01:50:05,098
your father was distraught.

1637
01:50:05,972 --> 01:50:09,181
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1638
01:50:09,264 --> 01:50:11,431
that he would confess everything.

1639
01:50:12,931 --> 01:50:14,931
And that night,

1640
01:50:15,014 --> 01:50:18,931
your father and your mother were killed.

1641
01:50:21,348 --> 01:50:23,515
[soft music playing]

1642
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:26,181
It was Falcone?

1643
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,139
[smacks lips]

1644
01:50:32,223 --> 01:50:34,348
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1645
01:50:39,056 --> 01:50:42,598
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1646
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:45,431
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1647
01:50:45,515 --> 01:50:50,722
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1648
01:50:52,473 --> 01:50:56,348
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1649
01:50:57,014 --> 01:50:58,806
I know you always blamed yourself.

1650
01:50:58,889 --> 01:51:01,431
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1651
01:51:03,598 --> 01:51:05,889
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1652
01:51:07,306 --> 01:51:09,680
but I didn't know how to help.

1653
01:51:09,764 --> 01:51:12,264
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1654
01:51:13,639 --> 01:51:16,306
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1655
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,223
You needed a father.

1656
01:51:20,181 --> 01:51:22,598
And all you had was me.

1657
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:26,181
I'm sorry.

1658
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:29,847
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1659
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:37,722
God.

1660
01:51:40,764 --> 01:51:45,181
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1661
01:51:47,889 --> 01:51:50,014
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1662
01:51:56,431 --> 01:51:57,681
I mean,

1663
01:51:58,889 --> 01:52:01,014
I'm not afraid to die.

1664
01:52:02,764 --> 01:52:05,139
I realize now there's something

1665
01:52:06,264 --> 01:52:08,139
I haven't got past.

1666
01:52:09,056 --> 01:52:10,806
This fear...

1667
01:52:13,264 --> 01:52:16,223
of ever going through any of that again.

1668
01:52:20,473 --> 01:52:22,681
Of losing somebody I care about.

1669
01:52:24,014 --> 01:52:26,306
[soft music continues]

1670
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,306
[soft dramatic music playing]

1671
01:52:55,306 --> 01:52:56,973
[engine revving]

1672
01:53:13,223 --> 01:53:14,181
Hey.

1673
01:53:14,265 --> 01:53:17,014
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1674
01:53:17,098 --> 01:53:19,014
I thought it was you.

1675
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:24,555
[both grunting]

1676
01:53:31,931 --> 01:53:33,473
- I found him!
- I see that.

1677
01:53:33,556 --> 01:53:35,056
He had my shit and my phone.

1678
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:36,348
She left a message
the night they took her.

1679
01:53:36,431 --> 01:53:37,348
She called me...

1680
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:39,139
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1681
01:53:39,223 --> 01:53:40,514
She got my gun!

1682
01:53:40,764 --> 01:53:41,764
[grunts]

1683
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:43,556
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1684
01:53:45,098 --> 01:53:47,639
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1685
01:53:52,223 --> 01:53:54,306
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1686
01:53:56,265 --> 01:53:57,931
[Kenzie on recording]
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1687
01:53:58,056 --> 01:54:00,223
- [Annika whimpering]
- <i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1688
01:54:00,306 --> 01:54:02,390
[Falcone] <i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1689
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:03,806
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1690
01:54:03,889 --> 01:54:05,597
[Kenzie] <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1691
01:54:05,681 --> 01:54:06,722
[Annika, tearfully]
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1692
01:54:06,806 --> 01:54:08,098
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1693
01:54:08,181 --> 01:54:10,848
[Falcone]
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1694
01:54:12,722 --> 01:54:14,764
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1695
01:54:15,472 --> 01:54:18,014
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- [Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1696
01:54:18,098 --> 01:54:21,014
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1697
01:54:21,098 --> 01:54:23,806
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1698
01:54:24,348 --> 01:54:26,348
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1699
01:54:27,056 --> 01:54:29,931
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1700
01:54:30,014 --> 01:54:32,722
[Annika] <i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1701
01:54:32,806 --> 01:54:34,931
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1702
01:54:35,014 --> 01:54:38,139
[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1703
01:54:38,973 --> 01:54:41,514
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1704
01:54:42,597 --> 01:54:43,931
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1705
01:54:44,722 --> 01:54:48,265
[Annika] <i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1706
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:49,973
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1707
01:54:50,056 --> 01:54:52,014
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1708
01:54:52,098 --> 01:54:53,390
<i>The deal.</i>

1709
01:54:53,472 --> 01:54:58,390
[Annika] <i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1710
01:54:58,472 --> 01:55:01,181
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1711
01:55:01,265 --> 01:55:03,639
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1712
01:55:03,722 --> 01:55:04,848
[Falcone] <i>Right.</i>

1713
01:55:05,597 --> 01:55:06,973
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1714
01:55:07,931 --> 01:55:10,098
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1715
01:55:12,181 --> 01:55:13,931
- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1716
01:55:14,889 --> 01:55:16,389
- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1717
01:55:17,764 --> 01:55:19,098
- [Falcone] <i>Just take it easy.</i>
- [Annika choking]

1718
01:55:19,181 --> 01:55:20,722
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1719
01:55:20,806 --> 01:55:23,848
[Falcone] <i>Take it easy.</i>

1720
01:55:25,973 --> 01:55:27,389
[recording stops]

1721
01:55:33,056 --> 01:55:34,348
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1722
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:40,889
A falcon has wings too.

1723
01:55:41,223 --> 01:55:43,056
Falcone is the rat?

1724
01:55:54,014 --> 01:55:57,181
Falcone works for you guys?

1725
01:55:57,848 --> 01:56:00,389
The mayor? The DA?

1726
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,472
No.

1727
01:56:04,806 --> 01:56:06,306
[breathing shakily]

1728
01:56:07,556 --> 01:56:08,848
We work for him.

1729
01:56:09,848 --> 01:56:11,098
Everybody does.

1730
01:56:11,181 --> 01:56:12,181
How?

1731
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:13,848
Through Renewal.

1732
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,014
Renewal is everything.

1733
01:56:16,098 --> 01:56:17,431
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1734
01:56:18,014 --> 01:56:21,723
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1735
01:56:21,806 --> 01:56:25,389
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1736
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:28,848
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1737
01:56:28,931 --> 01:56:31,014
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1738
01:56:31,098 --> 01:56:32,806
Everybody got a piece.

1739
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:34,723
But Falcone wanted more.

1740
01:56:36,514 --> 01:56:39,723
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1741
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:43,472
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1742
01:56:43,848 --> 01:56:46,556
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1743
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:49,098
then install them all as his puppets.

1744
01:56:49,181 --> 01:56:51,723
You think this goddamn election matters?

1745
01:56:53,347 --> 01:56:55,265
Falcone's the mayor.

1746
01:56:56,223 --> 01:56:58,723
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1747
01:56:58,806 --> 01:57:00,181
Come on, Vengeance.

1748
01:57:00,889 --> 01:57:02,723
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1749
01:57:03,431 --> 01:57:05,056
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1750
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:05,973
No!

We'll get him.

- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1754
01:57:11,264 --> 01:57:12,389
He owns the city!

1755
01:57:12,472 --> 01:57:13,723
Cross that line...

1756
01:57:14,514 --> 01:57:15,806

1757

Listen to me.

1758

She won't get out of there alive.

1764

we may never find the Riddler.

1765
01:57:50,389 --> 01:57:51,389
I have to stop her.

1766

Don't you mean "we"?

1767
01:57:53,848 --> 01:57:55,389
I gotta do this my way.

1768

And then what?

1769
01:57:57,597 --> 01:57:58,973

I'd like to come up?

01:58:39,472 --> 01:58:40,931
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1775
01:58:41,556 --> 01:58:42,889

I could talk to you for a minute?

Absolutely.

And I know
that you're a very important man.

1789

I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1790

I'm beginning to...

- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1796

Mr. Falcone?

1797

Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1798
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:01,097
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

[officer] Police! Hands up!

1924
02:09:00,139 --> 02:09:03,639
[Gordon] He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1925
02:09:03,764 --> 02:09:05,473
[tense music continues]

1926
02:09:12,889 --> 02:09:13,931
[stool creaking]

1927
02:09:22,764 --> 02:09:24,681
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1928
02:09:27,639 --> 02:09:28,931
[Martinez] Stay still!

1929
02:09:29,014 --> 02:09:30,014
Now!

1930
02:09:32,056 --> 02:09:33,473
[handcuffs clicking]

1931
02:09:36,931 --> 02:09:38,555
[tense music continues]

1932
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,431
[Martinez] Which one is you?

1933
02:10:00,514 --> 02:10:02,014
[laughs gleefully] You tell me.

1934
02:10:02,847 --> 02:10:04,306
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1935
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:09,139
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1936
02:10:09,556 --> 02:10:11,306
[eerie music playing]

1937
02:10:17,722 --> 02:10:19,223
[siren wailing in distance]

1938
02:10:23,639 --> 02:10:26,556
[newscaster] <i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1941
02:10:31,973 --> 02:10:33,014
Hey.

1942
02:10:36,139 --> 02:10:37,681
[suspenseful music playing]

1943
02:10:57,431 --> 02:10:59,139
What are all these diaries?

1944
02:10:59,223 --> 02:11:01,639
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1945
02:11:01,722 --> 02:11:05,265
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1946
02:11:05,348 --> 02:11:06,889
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1947
02:11:06,973 --> 02:11:09,265
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1948
02:11:09,348 --> 02:11:11,181
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1949
02:11:11,265 --> 02:11:13,681
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1950
02:11:13,764 --> 02:11:15,514
What about chain of evidence?

1951
02:11:16,348 --> 02:11:17,556
You should see this.

1952
02:11:23,514 --> 02:11:25,014
He's wearing gloves.

1953
02:11:26,472 --> 02:11:28,722
"Friday, July 16th.

1954
02:11:28,806 --> 02:11:32,514
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1955
02:11:32,848 --> 02:11:35,889
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1956
02:11:35,973 --> 02:11:37,390
But then, today, I saw it.

1957
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:41,597
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1958
02:11:42,931 --> 02:11:44,722
'Renewal.'

1959
02:11:44,806 --> 02:11:49,223
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1960
02:11:49,306 --> 02:11:52,430
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1961
02:11:52,514 --> 02:11:55,848
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1962
02:11:55,931 --> 02:11:58,389
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1963
02:11:58,472 --> 02:12:01,472
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1964
02:12:02,597 --> 02:12:04,430
- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

1965
02:12:04,514 --> 02:12:06,348
really understand,

1966
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:08,722
you can't just give them the answers.

1967
02:12:08,806 --> 02:12:10,265
You have to confront them,

1968
02:12:10,348 --> 02:12:12,764
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1969
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:15,014
just like they tortured me.

1970
02:12:15,098 --> 02:12:17,889
I know now what I must become."

1971
02:12:20,848 --> 02:12:22,181
Jesus.

[bat screeching]

1973
02:12:28,265 --> 02:12:30,223
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1974
02:12:30,764 --> 02:12:32,265
This one's not a rat.

1975
02:12:32,681 --> 02:12:34,681
- [rat continues squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

1976
02:12:38,889 --> 02:12:39,931
[screeching violently]

1977
02:12:48,889 --> 02:12:50,014
[Gordon] What is that?

1978
02:12:52,722 --> 02:12:54,223
[bat screeching frantically]

1979
02:13:21,597 --> 02:13:22,806
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1980
02:13:22,889 --> 02:13:24,265
Is it a chisel?

1981
02:13:24,347 --> 02:13:25,806
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1982
02:13:25,889 --> 02:13:27,265
He killed Mitchell with it.

1983
02:13:27,931 --> 02:13:30,806
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1984
02:13:39,389 --> 02:13:41,389
"My confession"?

1985
02:13:41,472 --> 02:13:44,347
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1986
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:45,806
This isn't over.

1987
02:13:45,889 --> 02:13:48,305
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1988
02:13:48,723 --> 02:13:50,931
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1989
02:13:51,305 --> 02:13:52,597
[typing]

1990
02:13:59,015 --> 02:14:01,223
His final post was last night.

1991
02:14:01,305 --> 02:14:04,514
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1992
02:14:04,597 --> 02:14:07,597
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1993
02:14:07,723 --> 02:14:11,140
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1994
02:14:11,639 --> 02:14:13,223
[ominous music playing]

1995
02:14:22,472 --> 02:14:25,015
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1996
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,347
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1997
02:14:29,181 --> 02:14:30,806
I think I'm his last target.

1998
02:14:33,389 --> 02:14:34,472
You?

1999
02:14:34,848 --> 02:14:36,889
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

2000
02:14:37,431 --> 02:14:38,806
What is?

2001
02:14:39,264 --> 02:14:40,681
The Batman.

2002
02:14:40,931 --> 02:14:42,098
[cell phone ringing]

2003
02:14:46,056 --> 02:14:47,222
Yeah?

2004
02:14:58,514 --> 02:14:59,723
Right.

2005
02:15:02,598 --> 02:15:06,556
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2006
02:15:14,015 --> 02:15:15,514
You're a good cop.

2007
02:15:40,098 --> 02:15:42,472
[over speaker]
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

2008
02:15:43,222 --> 02:15:45,056
[Batman] <i>What do you want from me?</i>

2009
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:46,681
[Riddler] "Want"?

2010
02:15:47,264 --> 02:15:50,890
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

2011
02:15:52,098 --> 02:15:53,431
<i>For this moment.</i>

2012
02:15:54,472 --> 02:15:57,472
I've been invisible my whole life.

2013
02:15:58,556 --> 02:16:01,180
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

2014
02:16:02,723 --> 02:16:05,139
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

2015
02:16:05,222 --> 02:16:07,056
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

2016
02:16:17,431 --> 02:16:19,389
<i>Bruce...</i>

2017
02:16:22,264 --> 02:16:24,098
<i>Wayne.</i>

2018
02:16:26,472 --> 02:16:30,222
[slowly] Bruce...

2019
02:16:31,639 --> 02:16:34,514
<i>Wayne.</i>

2020
02:16:40,264 --> 02:16:41,306
[exhales deeply]

2021
02:16:45,764 --> 02:16:48,181
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

2022
02:16:50,764 --> 02:16:54,139
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

2023
02:16:54,222 --> 02:16:56,598
<i>made all those promises.</i>

2024
02:16:59,056 --> 02:17:03,306
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

2025
02:17:03,848 --> 02:17:07,389
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

2026
02:17:07,473 --> 02:17:11,139
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

2027
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:13,264
<i>Orphan.</i>

2028
02:17:18,931 --> 02:17:24,055
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

2029
02:17:25,347 --> 02:17:29,973
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

2030
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,181
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

2031
02:17:34,806 --> 02:17:37,473
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2032
02:17:37,848 --> 02:17:40,431
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

2033
02:17:41,723 --> 02:17:45,765
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

2034
02:17:47,473 --> 02:17:52,139
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

2035
02:17:53,306 --> 02:17:56,473
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

2036
02:17:56,556 --> 02:17:58,848
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

2037
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:02,723
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

2038
02:18:04,014 --> 02:18:05,264
[smacks lips]

2039
02:18:05,639 --> 02:18:08,806
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

2040
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:11,806
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

2041
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,890
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

2042
02:18:14,347 --> 02:18:16,389
<i>Bruce...</i>

2043
02:18:17,431 --> 02:18:19,347
<i>Wayne.</i>

2044
02:18:23,014 --> 02:18:26,097
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

2045
02:18:29,514 --> 02:18:32,639
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

2046
02:18:34,097 --> 02:18:37,972
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

2047
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:42,306
<i>God.</i>

2048
02:18:43,306 --> 02:18:44,598
<i>Look at you.</i>

2049
02:18:46,264 --> 02:18:48,723
Your mask is amazing.

2050
02:18:48,806 --> 02:18:51,723
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2051
02:18:51,806 --> 02:18:52,890
Ain't it funny?

2052
02:18:52,972 --> 02:18:57,389
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

2053
02:18:58,848 --> 02:19:00,890
<i>You and I both know</i>

2054
02:19:01,848 --> 02:19:04,347
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2055
02:19:04,431 --> 02:19:08,056
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2056
02:19:08,139 --> 02:19:09,681
<i>No shame,</i>

2057
02:19:10,598 --> 02:19:11,598
<i>no limits.</i>

2058
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:13,348
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

2059
02:19:14,222 --> 02:19:15,222
<i>What do you mean?</i>

2060
02:19:15,306 --> 02:19:17,014
<i>All those cards.</i>

2061
02:19:17,097 --> 02:19:18,306
<i>I told you,</i>

2062
02:19:19,014 --> 02:19:20,930
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

2063
02:19:21,014 --> 02:19:23,222
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

2064
02:19:23,306 --> 02:19:24,765
<i>What did we just do?</i>

2065
02:19:24,848 --> 02:19:26,848
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

2066
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:28,097
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

2067
02:19:28,181 --> 02:19:29,181
<i>We're not a team.</i>

2068
02:19:29,264 --> 02:19:31,765
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2069
02:19:31,848 --> 02:19:34,264
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

2070
02:19:34,348 --> 02:19:37,514
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

2071
02:19:37,598 --> 02:19:39,222
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2072
02:19:39,306 --> 02:19:40,514
You gave me that.

2073
02:19:40,598 --> 02:19:41,723
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

2074
02:19:41,806 --> 02:19:44,389
You showed me what was possible.

2075
02:19:44,473 --> 02:19:49,348
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

2076
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:50,972
<i>You inspired me.</i>

2077
02:19:51,056 --> 02:19:52,556
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

2078
02:19:53,681 --> 02:19:54,765
<i>What?</i>

2079
02:19:54,848 --> 02:19:57,014
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

2080
02:19:57,097 --> 02:19:58,473
<i>How can you say that?</i>

2081
02:19:58,556 --> 02:20:00,056
You think you'll be remembered?

2082
02:20:00,139 --> 02:20:01,806
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

2083
02:20:02,306 --> 02:20:04,056
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

2084
02:20:04,139 --> 02:20:05,806
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

2085
02:20:05,889 --> 02:20:06,930
<i>No, no!</i>

2086
02:20:07,014 --> 02:20:07,930
<i>A nobody!</i>

2087
02:20:09,723 --> 02:20:11,514
<i>No!</i>

2088
02:20:13,431 --> 02:20:15,806
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2089
02:20:16,056 --> 02:20:18,640
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

2090
02:20:19,598 --> 02:20:23,222
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2091
02:20:23,306 --> 02:20:25,930
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

2092
02:20:26,930 --> 02:20:28,930
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

2093
02:20:29,306 --> 02:20:32,598
