everyone is.

665

he's as bad as they come.

Fuck if I know.

673
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:16,717
But what I do know is,

674
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,884
if he doesn't know
who you are yet,

675
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:20,084

678
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,717
He's got him at
a nursing home downtown.

679
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,784
That's not much.

680
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:31,750
I wouldn't worry

a bit weary of this life.

700
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,151
I think, if he had his way,
he'd probably walk away.

But, um, can we afford it?

719
00:48:48,617 --> 00:48:51,650
I guess the real question is:
Can we afford not to?

720
00:48:51,684 --> 00:48:54,750
- Well, that would be wonderful.
- Yeah.

721
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:57,750
