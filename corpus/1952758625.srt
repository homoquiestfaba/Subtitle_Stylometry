00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,568
Hey, sleeping beauty!

4
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:54,290
It's time to get up!

5
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,147
You told if I wanted to wake you at 7.00
and it is now almost 7.30

6
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,967
That's impossible!

7
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,885
I just want to to bed!
It's not so long ago!

8
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,947
Pratically!

9
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:09,232
You have worked again.

10
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,244
Why do you sleep
in bed today?

11
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:18,639
I can not do, these pieces
do I have to show have ex ...

12
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,573
I have to decorate the house,
for the party tonight.

13
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:26,950
Now you paint 20 hours a day
and already one month!

14
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,344
You can't burn out!

15
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:33,092
It would surprise me
if you still get your party!

16
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,906
I wanna make it to the party!

17
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:43,047
This is all have to calm down
after the opening, I swear!

18
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:48,625
Then I relax and sleep a purely month.

19
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,715
You've worked so hard for this.

20
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:56,354
I am very proud of you, Adrian!

21
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,558
Really, really pretty!

22
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,061
Thanks!

23
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,926
The coffee done, I have to go!

24
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:03,825
A kiss?!

25
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,575
Okay!

26
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,138
I wish you a really good day!

27
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,919
They will!
- Call me!

28
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,319
You look good!
- Thank you!

29
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,162
Let's take a break!

30
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,668
Perfect!

31
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:25,137
Absolutely perfect!

32
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,144
Do you want me to take away all contracts?

33
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:07,317
Yeah, sorry ...

34
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,766
Hello?
- Hey! It's me baby!

35
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,460
Hey! Hold on a second!

36
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,597
-Sure. - I want you to these folders
The meeting notes are viewing ...

37
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:21,457
and then makes copies of it on my desk.
I need your advice, thank you Victor!

38
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,799
Hi! Here I am again!

39
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,712
Is that bad time?
- Yes, so you know kind?

40
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,252
How are you?
- Good, good!

41
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:31,831
Penelope will come to some pieces
to view the exhibition.

42
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,527
Is everything okay with you?

43
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:40,864
Yeah, yes, sure!

44
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:44,070
Ok! I'm sorry honey,
but I'm very busy.

45
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,286
It's all right, well ... I love you!

46
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,418
I love you too!
By!

47
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:30,634
What are you doing? Your time in killing
before you can drink?

48
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,821
Michelle told me she wanted
to clean up all the leafs today.

49
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:36,903
She said it had to be done today.

50
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:40,855
Do you see how many
fucking leafs still on the trees?

51
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:44,513
Mmm, that's a good point!
And what she said?

52
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:46,541
"Today"!

53
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,979
Did you already meet the new neighbors?

54
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,652
No, I haven't seen them yet!

55
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,858
Well, I do not!

56
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,108
It is a little weird, huh?

57
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:01,452
Mmm, maybe he is a privy guy!

58
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,607
I can not better keep in time!

59
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:06,254
What?

60
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:11,894
I just walked into my deck,
there was a shadow on the window ...

61
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:15,221
Somebody is watching on me!

62
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:22,125
And that light, it's on all the time,
day and night!

63
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,769
Maybe it's some psycho with an ax!

64
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,987
Yes, that was funny!

65
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,643
I'm gonna scare
there's a nice tall fence.

66
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,364
You get to paranoiiede dude!

67
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:45,322
I see you later!

68
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:48,050
I hope it can stop an ax proof!

69
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,973
Remember that you have insurance
rights that covers everything!

70
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,483
Our policy does not cover
international shipping.

71
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,334
Call me,
when it's done!

72
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:58,522
Penelope! You look beautiful!
- Do not lie to me my boy!

73
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:03,191
Everything goes according to schedule?
- Yes, everything is going on this plan!

74
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:08,644
So, you come tonight?
- Yeah! I took my costume in this morning.

75
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,487
Great!
- Should I bring anything?

76
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:15,833
Yes! Just you and your sense of humor!
- And my talent for a confrontational interview?

77
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,707
Yes, that too!

78
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,429
What is this?

79
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,674
No, do not do that does not
belong to the collection ...

80
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:33,268
This I have never seen
anything this from you!

81
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:35,301
The ... it is ...

82
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:36,894
It's desperate!

83
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:39,972
No ... it's inconceivable!

84
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,084
Where did you come from?

85
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,679
It's one of those images in my head.
I can shake...

86
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,700
So I painted it.

87
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,009
It comes from the dark a side ...

88
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,369
You're any convergial,
as they speak!

89
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:58,293
There is a uitting of aggression in it!

90
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:01,798
Adrian, this is really perfect!

91
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:04,088
This should definitely this one!

92
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,190
Really?
- Absolutely!

93
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,002
The people will love this!

94
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:12,278
Do not misunderstand me, your paintings,
people gonna get female forms perfection ...

95
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:19,215
This is explosive... This is awful ...
It's brilliant!

96
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,778
We'll show tonight!
And we'll get the reactions!

97
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,297
No, no we do not!

98
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,012
What time does the party?

99
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,249
Why, you want to be late again as usual?

100
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,782
Silly boy, you know I do not take
keeping with self-pity.

101
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,502
We have said around 8!

102
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:35,971
See you around at 9!

103
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,941
Chao!

104
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,424
Yeah!

105
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:55,536
What you wear on a
masquerade ball anyway?

106
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:58,410
It's more got wear

107
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,258
Oh, got great masquerade!
Great! Here is my close it!

108
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,491
I had not think to work!
- And the ladies?

109
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,661
James, I told you that
there are no women tonight.

110
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:14,555
That's well! Is your dance card is full?
Promise me you will dance a foxtrot!

111
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:17,556
James, I got a thousand things,
I hang up phone now, right?

112
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,602
Say no more, Martha Stewart!

113
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,606
What are you looking at!
What are you lookin at!

114
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,534
You will find this funny?!

115
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:24,968
Come on! Let's play a game!

116
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,303
Come on!

117
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,522
I'm waiting for you!

118
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:40,242
Stay fuck of away from me!

119
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:43,462
Did you hear me?
Go away from me!

120
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:32,765
My favorite drawing.

121
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,623
I don't want to lose!

122
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,372
Turn that thing off!
- What?

123
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,703
Put fucking that thing off!

124
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,695
You're a stupid idiot, James!

125
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,477
I had my video camera because ...

126
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:18,251
you look  like you fart shit
in that ridiculous swimming trunks.

127
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,438
Why would I do that?

128
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:25,597
You thought it was that psychopathic
next door, huh? Yeah!

129
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,308
That's great!

130
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,563
I wanna borrow this from you, right?

131
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,661
Yes! I hope you catch
your balls cut off for this.

132
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:36,109
Hold that dot!
What have you done with your hand?

133
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,910
I cut it a painting.

134
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,099
You cut it painting?

135
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,711
If you come for a beer from your bathtub!

136
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:47,686
No I can't.  I'm busy.

137
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,163
Hot tubbing is "busy"?

138
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:53,600
I was taking a break,
until you came to interrupt me!

139
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:59,718
Thanks for your apology!

140
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:04,188
Are you sure you not come over?
I mean, it's almost beer o'clock!

141
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:06,355
No I can. I got a model sitting for me.

142
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,322
One ... model?

143
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:11,932
Yes, a model!

144
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,134
No, I didn't say a model.

145
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:17,907
Okay!

146
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:19,340
Go home!

147
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,379
Auf Wiedersehen!

148
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,383
Hello?

149
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,759
Hey baby! It's me again!

150
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:45,008
Hey, how are you?

151
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:49,009
I wanted to make sure you're all right?
- I've never been so stressed before!

152
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,885
No, no, that's not what I mean, You know ...
I just want to make sure you're all right!

153
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,795
You mean, I'm alive or dead?

154
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:06,578
Is not that a little strange to me mid-
calls on the day if I still breathing?

155
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:12,440
Yes, I know, I just
a bad... one of a bad feeling all day...

156
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,831
And I ... I just be alive happy
you were home!

157
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,642
Okay, now that makes me
feared out!

158
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:24,725
It's nothing just ...
drive safe, okay?

159
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:29,067
Just to stop it! Don't tell the paid!

160
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,801
Mr. Wolfare for you on Line 2!

161
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,798
I have to take this!

162
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:37,166
All right! Be careful, okay?

163
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,017
Stop it! I will!

164
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,643
I love you, Adrian!
You know that, right?

165
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,707
I love you too, baby!

166
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,010
Hey Adrian, I just want to ...

167
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:29,564
Oh ... Hello!

168
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,840
Hello!

169
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:34,825
Eee, What?

170
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:36,562
I'll just want to say "hello"!

171
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:39,092
And ... You can use a little break!

172
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,720
Get out!

173
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,436
And I want you to know that
I'm done with your chainsaw.

174
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,753
Fucking things is awsome!

175
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:54,928
I've put back in ...

176
00:23:56,594 --> 00:24:00,127

177
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,348

00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,690

179
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,409
Goodbye!

180
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:09,144

181
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,503
Just go home!

182
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:12,909
Are you sure you do not need
extra pair of eyes?

183
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,283
I just want to help!
You do not get it!

184
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,643
James, I have a biggest show
in my life next week and ...

185
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:20,362

186
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:23,117
Is your work?
That is real top work, buddy!

187
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:27,008
I mean, I swear It's all right!
You got to think that is work ...

188
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,307
James okay!
My work is a tribute to women.

189
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:34,022
On the women!
Who do fuck are you?

190
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:35,928
Are you sure you do not need a break?

191
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:40,059
- We will drink like fishes tonight!
- Now, go home!

192
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,874
Go to Michelle, think Michelle!

193
00:24:43,874 --> 00:24:45,960
I do!

194
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:58,795
Okay, my offer stills on!

195
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:07,370
Apologize for that ...

196
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,779
James, knows not what he does!

197
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,855
How we know what chars!

198
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:16,299
My again?

199
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,528
Just off hair.

200
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:24,498
Just I have you did talk about your work
and that you're personal?

201
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:30,441
I find you sit and continue to ask about
myself real every thing you know!

202
00:25:31,193 --> 00:25:35,063
You could always work as a nude ...
Or something like even to thank you!

203
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:40,158
That's a good idea ... but ...

204
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:44,865
You know, okay!

205
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:50,128
So I see you a very bored colors,
Sorry about?

206
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,409
So I see it in the world, I guess!

207
00:25:56,148 --> 00:25:59,848
My training is realism that
most artists begin as ...

208
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,662
Eventually, you still find yourself.

209
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:11,229
I indicate here a phisical form
but my aim is to go deeper ...

210
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:18,335
every color and others is a
closer to closer to the soul.

211
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:21,435
Is it like an aura?

212
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:27,032
An aura is ... an energy fields!

213
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,730
But I see this is more
person is real character ...

214
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:37,559
for life, for faith ...

215
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:42,518
It's hard to explain.

216
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:48,078
You're saying a psychic, mister?
Who is come in handy!

217
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:52,013
Yeah, you just want to know
lottery numbers play on, huh?

218
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:53,919
Oh yeah of course!

219
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:04,194
So feed in see so much a lot of person..
does not take a look guess your life?

220
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,795
It is not exactly precise!

221
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,954
Okay, we're ready for today.

222
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,703
You did great today!
Really great!

223
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:28,112

00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:30,736
So, have you come tonight?

225
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:33,944

00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:57,057
Well, I see you later, OK?

228
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,360
Hey, baby!

229
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,643
What's wrong?

230
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:05,599
I don't know, it must be really hard
you're feeling about me all day to...

231
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,917
..painted naked women, and giving
the model even huggs she drive way!

232
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,492
What are you talking about?
I've always painted women!

233
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,413
You've been silly!

234
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:18,740
Am I?

235
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,550
Yeah, you are!
- It's just...

236
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:27,826
I have a very sellings of day!
Then you call me and take me off ...

237
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,571
it almost ended in a horrible accident.

238
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,146
What happened?

239
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:38,076
Stupid! I leave the office, walked
to the garage and I hear a sound...

240
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:41,936
...then I drive away so over,
some poor guy.

241
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,735
I thought I was followed
prophecy, you know!

242
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:51,329
Had I but not so feared out,
it was none of that happened.

243
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:02,949

244
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:08,865
What have you do?

245
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,608
Ah, just a paper curl.

246
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:16,802
Getting better with you

247
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,342

249
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:31,297
Not only that!

250
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:36,054
Oh, not alone!
- You want to have me get out of here!

251
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:52,491

252
00:30:55,243 --> 00:30:58,181

255
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,664

256
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,986

Of course. The reggiseur is at work!

259
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,768
He is not consistent, isn't it?

260
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:08,012

261

Hello!

268
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:42,028
Okay, who wants a drink?

269
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:44,809
Some Wine!

270
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,717
Mmm ... beer!

271
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,542
You read my mind!

272
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:54,418
Hey cool, I did not know
what in this.

273
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,965
The color TV was in it..
What will it be, 50 years ago...

274
00:32:56,965 --> 00:33:01,066
my husband finds it exciting
that filmed black and white!

275
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,984
Only we know that the colors
black and white do not exist.

276
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,481
What are you talking about?

277
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:11,644
Only delicious wine!

278
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:13,708
Thank you! That's the reality!

279
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:20,582
OK, it's definitly too early to be talking
philosophy at this pointed on this evening!

280
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:30,221
Ok, I proposed to toast two great
friends, a great party ...

281
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:32,469

No!

289
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:13,939
Put it away!

290
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:16,168
Is a camera shy, and not you!

291
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:19,190
Why don't you say until the
party is more interesting?

292
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,814
How is your movie going?

293
00:35:02,712 --> 00:35:06,208
It's just a matter of time before
everyone begins to shuffl.

294
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,968
....gets interesting all together!

295
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:14,219
Poor James, how about a beer?

296
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:16,365
Huh buddy?

300
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:40,632
James, are you okay?

301
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:42,475
It would you get
walking on my session effect ...

302
00:35:42,576 --> 00:35:46,572
Adrián! We have a problem!
Somebody call an ambulance?!

303
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,990
Probably they were making
love in the grass ...

304
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,042
and leaving one of the guests
have not seen them at the movement.

305
00:35:58,478 --> 00:35:59,953
Do you know the driver?

306
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:02,842
No, it's a friend of a friend.

307
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:04,183
It's getting be in many troubles?

308
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:06,326

Those people gonna be all right?
- Yeah, it looks like so!

314
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,499
What a horrible accident said!

315
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:26,369
Maybe they are victims
of their own karma!

316
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,840
You're saying,
it's their own fault?

317
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,766
No, it was their punishment!

318
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:33,998
Whatever you up there,
Comes back area!

319
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:39,246
Here we go! The Guru,
is here and his light shines on us!

320
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:40,825
Do you have compression?

321
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:45,032
I'm just saying,
I don't believe in accidence in life!

322
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:48,376
But technically! Did they happen
on your property or mine?

323
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:52,302
'Cause I really don't want to explain
to my insurance company.

324
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:55,442
Isn't that a big in sensitive?

325
00:36:55,442 --> 00:37:00,644
I see here it practicallities!
I don't want to lose our house!

326
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:03,118
Take it easy!

327
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:11,020
Anyway, that definitly killed my boss!
And now I play to catch up. ...

00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:23,943
You okay?

329
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:27,942
Yeah! Do you remember that feeling
I called this morning...

330
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:31,224
...with the idea that
something was gonna happen?

331
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,850
Yes! You thought it was me!
- I know but, maybe it was this.

332
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,697
Maybe I misjudged whole thing.

333
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:46,746
Adrian, You want so badly to believe
that some kind of a shaman that ...

334
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:52,613
you make this crazy lips
in your mind you connect...

335
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:56,903
...facts nothing to do with
each other what so ever.

336
00:37:56,904 --> 00:38:05,234
Now, we have a party in your honor,
and I want us to enjoy it together.

337
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:07,265
Okay!

338

343
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:38,586
Really nice to meet you!

344
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:42,004
Isis?! That is incredible unusual name!

345
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:45,927
She was the Egyptian
goddess of fertility..

346
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:47,592
Wow ....

347
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:51,929
Has Adrián you ever painted?
You are courteous!

348
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:54,405
No, I haven't had such luck!

349
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,056
Surely, you're not
so shy pose one?

350
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,744
I'm not ashamed of my body,
what you mean.

351
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:09,072
Adrián but reveals far more
than the physical form.

352
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:14,009
And then summary,
the artists are suppose...

353
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,009
...to be conveyors of the soul,
aren't they?

354
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:24,539
You are make it seem
so romantic, glorious,

355
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,839
but in order to convey
with lies you must...

356
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,722
...in a soul you must first

357
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:33,730
...confront it
which can be dangerous!

358
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,466
It's like opening Pandora's box!

359
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:45,572
But you are sure to be a create
your imagination?

360
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:51,029
Absolutely! but the imagination
a double edge of sword.

361
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:54,263
So, what's your passion?

362
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:57,485
I'm very wonder in Greek tragedies ...

363
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:00,703
And there's so much
you can learn from them about...

364
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:09,655
human nature, relationships,
love, faith ...

365
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,078
even law ...

366
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,927
The characters are
quite compaling ...

367
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:22,504
...they're fault and beautiful
and sure enough, like Anfitrite!

368
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:24,581
Sorry, Anfitrite?

369
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:29,786
Goddess of the sea!
Sea represents our emotions.

370
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:34,322
Submerged emotions cause
the most waves, right?

371
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:39,880
I like the way you put that.

372
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:45,616
Anfitrite, the husband of Poseidon,
had several love affairs. So ...

373
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:49,834
She became jealous
and angry ...

374
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:56,289
Ah, a woman scorned
is that your relationship with her?

375
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,608
I intrigues
by the idea how ...

376
00:42:01,608 --> 00:42:05,801
...to love wants to tainted condemn
can each people reject.

377
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:11,234
If you think about it,
sex is the setter of almost ...

378
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:13,636
...every human dramas!

379
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:16,065
...even the greatest conquest of history ...

380
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,811
...contain the first principles
of sexual conquest.

381
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:31,407
Unfortunately, I must make my round.
- Sure!

382
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:40,340
Ok, who's next?

383
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:45,046
Adrián! Come over here!

384
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:54,058
Andrew, You'll find
this was not bad, huh?

385
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:05,545
It goes like this, I'm gonna
turn 10 cards face down...

386
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,393
Look one over.
You had tell me ...

387
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:12,113
What the next one is
higher or lower!

388
00:43:12,113 --> 00:43:14,641
Did you do it right?
You move on the next card.

389
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:18,471
If not this is all you!

390
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,128
Ok, the first card!

391
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:23,533
Higher!
Lower!

392
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,723
Beginners luck?!

393
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:33,267
lower. Thank you!

394
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:37,583
Higher.

395
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:40,752
Uhm ... Lower.

396
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,646
Higher.

397
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,869
Lower.

398
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:50,277
Lower.

399
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:56,994
The last card. Remember, if you fuck in
now all we back beginning..

400
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:05,712
Uhm .... ho ... lower.

401
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,048
Separating it out man!

402
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,776
All good! Lucky bastard!

403
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,012
Let's go back.

404
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,684
You must see this!

405
00:44:22,432 --> 00:44:23,934
Lower.

406
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:27,058
Lower.

407
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:30,984
Higher.

408
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:39,762
Higher.

409
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,140
King!

410
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:06,204
This is ridiculous!

411
00:45:06,924 --> 00:45:08,705
It is a fucking drinking day!

412
00:45:09,242 --> 00:45:12,004
Let's up the drinks!
To everybody cheers!

413
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:57,504
This picture shows Adrián
a totally different style.

414
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:02,687
He exudes value with his paintbrush
In an aggressive art ...

415
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:05,034
Now comes the true
artist to his right ...

416
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:07,243
There you are!

417
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:08,643
Here I am!

418
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:13,304
Everybody is saying this painting
must be in your show.

419
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:19,196
Really! - Absolutely,
they all want your...

420
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:25,087
...gallery showing in New York city!

421
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:26,229
Wow!

422
00:46:26,229 --> 00:46:27,729
Do not be modest!

423
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:30,993
This is a very provocative piece.

424
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,775
What was your inspiration
for this one?

425
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:36,925
I do not know ...
I really do not know,

426
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,327
Because challenging of that time!

427
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:43,029
In challenging, what exactly?

428
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:45,574
Some inmates of Hades?

429
00:46:45,574 --> 00:46:49,498
No, Hades is the God of Death
This was previously a private devil.

430
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:53,781
Let me show you just another piece.

431
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:10,563
Private demon!

432
00:47:12,472 --> 00:47:14,067
You don't agree?

433
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:19,506
No, I do not subscribe
in the concept of hell.

434
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:23,348
Oh yes, I don't believe
that they exist?

435
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:26,784
If a actuel place?
No!

436
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:33,050
Hell to me is more of ...
devolution of the mind.

437
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:40,123
Well, I was raised Catholic,
which means hell has a zipcode.

438
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:45,338
Anyway! Good work!

439
00:47:45,818 --> 00:47:47,870
Thanks!

440
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,000
Congratulations!

441
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:37,110
Sorry, I thought
nobody was in there.

442
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,807
You leave me dead scared!

443
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,198
What are you doing here?

444
00:49:47,198 --> 00:49:49,347
Come on!

445
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:02,747
What were you doing there?

446
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:04,513
I was looking ...

447
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,225
To what, where were you looking for?

448
00:50:07,102 --> 00:50:09,101
I was looking for you!

449
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:12,532
I'm right here!

450
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:16,003
Do not worry, I'm here!

451
00:50:18,427 --> 00:50:22,539
Come watch them play false,
you should come and watch?!

452
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,194
Stop it! You must stop! Hold on!

453
00:50:36,835 --> 00:50:38,479
Stop it!

454
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,436
Just a second!

455
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:52,351
Are you all right?

456
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,606
Yes, just I need a couple
of minute to be alone.

457
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,046
Why don't you tell me?

458
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,993
It's nothing.

459
00:51:13,672 --> 00:51:15,250
Adrián!

460
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,949
Stop to isolating yourself!

461
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:27,225
My God, you so tormented!

462
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:29,802
Next you say that?

463
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:35,515
Your painting is screaming face!

464
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:41,141
You attach too much importance to.

465
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,868
Am I?

466
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:52,699
I can see it in your work ...

467
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,059
Therefore you are such
a talented artist.

468
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,262
What do you see?

469
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:06,644
Can you see
my tortured soul?

470
00:52:09,674 --> 00:52:13,113
That's just bullshit!
It's a fucking cliche!

471
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:19,714
I think you're just afraid of me
because I see so much about you ...

472
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,304
Maybe too much!

473
00:52:40,585 --> 00:52:42,633
Adrian, what's wrong?

474
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:44,239
Adrian, what's wrong?

475
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:45,943
There are many people out there.

476
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:50,745
So what? What if
whole the world will hear us!

477
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:38,261
- Stop!
- What?

478
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:43,986
Come here, Adrian!

479
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:22,606
Flash what?
James has completly hammered!

480
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:24,557
Really? He would never does that!

481
00:54:24,557 --> 00:54:27,048
I'm gonna go before
it gets anymore damage.

482
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:28,585
Did you  had a good time?

483
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:29,609
Having a blast!

484
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:30,948
Great!

485
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:32,374
Where is our great artist?

486
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,905
Hey, Picasso!

487
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:42,001
Let us take another round,
on me!

488
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:43,983
No, no!

489
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:48,595
Wait, wait!
This is my best buddy ...

490
00:54:48,595 --> 00:54:51,193
I want to toast to our friendship!

491
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,532
You toast it yourself to a press...

492
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:57,970
Must you ruin everything now?

493
00:54:58,569 --> 00:55:00,422
But, this is my friend!

494
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:03,097
And what is your love?

495
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,460
I've just met her!

496
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,323
Forget it!

497
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:18,036
Do you remember me a favor?
Be a girl and give us another beer?!

498
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:20,761
Are you fucking mind?

499
00:55:21,848 --> 00:55:24,037
My God, okay, let's go!

500
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:25,466
We will, I'm sorry!

501
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:28,338
It's okay, he's just drunk.

502
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:32,325
That excuse is really old!

503
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:34,061
Don't listen to these women...

504
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:36,830
...the party is not over yet.

505
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:39,350
It is all mine, it's all on me!

506
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:42,915
Bye, my friends!

507
00:58:37,538 --> 00:58:39,008
Hey, baby!

508
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,728
What's going on?

509
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:48,046
Is there anyone upstairs?

510
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,510
No, everyone is gone.

511
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,777
What are you doing with that thing?

512
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:57,500
I have found my painting!

513
00:58:58,189 --> 00:58:59,528
What painting?

514
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:02,747
The screaming face ...

515
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,465
He has laid there.

516
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:10,436
- Don't do that!
- Sorry

517
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:18,451
What would you put that to down?

518
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:26,588
What do you make you
so suffered about?

519
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:30,183
They can know who did that!

520
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:31,775
Who?

521
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:34,902
Our new neighbors!

522
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:38,362
They've invited himself
to our party!

523
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:44,029
Where you so soon to old lady
home to snoop around area?

524
00:59:47,265 --> 00:59:48,876
What old lady?

525
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:51,235
The widow Levine?

526
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:54,031
Do you know who lives there?

527
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:59,896
Yeah, she has given an invitation
last week to get to know ...

528
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:04,018
and I've been with her,
she had baked best cookies.

529
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:13,505
It doesn't make sense!
There were two men boots at the back door!

530
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:16,992
Maybe she has a caretaker?!

531
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:24,366
Maybe they watch at me
all the time?!

532
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:26,911
What are you talking about?

533
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:31,087
This morning, somebody
had spied me house next door...

534
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:38,935
I saw a shadow in the window ... All day
long plays on a cat and mouse game with me ...

535
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,546
All day long fucking with me!

536
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:46,127
And then tonight at the party he decide
he is gonna by the firecare...

537
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:49,065
and wearing this mask, it lead back me!
All day long!

538
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:58,065
Eventually goes up my studio and
leave the mask there for me the fun.

539
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:04,662
So as magic caretaker
is talking you?

540
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,623
Adrián, really! Really, honey!

541
01:01:14,996 --> 01:01:18,194
I'm not paranoid,
this time okay?

542
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:26,256
That glass, behind you, I had a vision
that falled in crashing a thousand pieces ...

543
01:01:26,256 --> 01:01:28,610
I know It's connected...

544
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:34,260
Really, it's connected all
the things I've seen today..

545
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:38,531
Adrián, Adrián baby, come here!

546
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:43,734
You've worked so hard!

547
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:49,846
I've been long day,
I fell on day?

548
01:01:50,034 --> 01:01:53,534
I just calm down a little.

549
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:04,000
I think maybe you wish
to go upstairs and...

550
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:08,660
...and pick up to love
under the showers?!

551
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,580
Take off my garter?!

552
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:19,328
What?

553
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:24,314
Take off my girdle?!

554
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:41,418
See?

555
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,834
Nothing happened!

556
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,427
I expect you about 2 minutes.

557
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:56,178
2 minutes!

558
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,683
What the hell!

559
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,956
I'm sorry baby ...
- What?

560
01:04:58,392 --> 01:04:59,795
I got to heard something!

561
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:02,058
This is getting out of hand, Adrian!

562
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:03,935
We just need to talk about it!

563
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:08,013
I'm sorry, everything is fine, baby!

564
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:28,675
I'm worried about you.

565
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:30,940
I'm really sorry, baby!

566
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:37,002
What need you gonna
like a crazy person?

567
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,022
It looks like a nervous prick down,
or something.

568
01:05:40,022 --> 01:05:42,003
I'm fine, baby! I'm fine!

569
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:47,057
You should try to get some sleep.
I'm worried about you!

570
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:49,338
Give me a minute?

571
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:54,070
Okay, I'm going to bed already,
I am exhausted!

572
01:07:54,357 --> 01:07:55,478
Adrián?! Oh, my God!

573
01:07:57,475 --> 01:07:58,711
Pull out the mask?

574
01:07:59,707 --> 01:08:01,895
No, don't! Don't!
- Don't move, fucker! Don't move!

575
01:08:14,117 --> 01:08:15,601
Oh, Fucking, it's James!

576
01:08:16,585 --> 01:08:18,231
Oh, no! No!
- James! James!

577
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,279
Oh, my God!

578
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:20,966
Don't go!
- Hey, buddy! Buddy!

579
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,307
Don't go!

580
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,780
James, no, no, no!

581
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,642
Is he okay?
- No!

582
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:26,925
Oh fuck!

583
01:08:26,925 --> 01:08:30,297
James, James,
come on man!

584
01:08:31,464 --> 01:08:34,745
James! come on,
James, come on!

585
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:37,981
He's dead, honey!
- Do not say that he is dead!

586
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,393
Don't tell me that
he's dead!

587
01:08:39,393 --> 01:08:41,078
Is he dead?
-Yes!

588
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:44,433
Fuck! Fuck!

589
01:08:46,764 --> 01:08:48,831
What was he doing here?

590
01:08:49,846 --> 01:08:54,021
I don't know, he came through the door
with that fucking mask!

591
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:57,957
What a fucking stupid joke! You fucking
asshole! Adrian, oh my God, Adrian!

592
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:05,883
But darn it, I knew it was him,
he came through that door!

593
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,895
We should call the police!

594
01:09:13,895 --> 01:09:17,677
No, we can not call the police!
Are you fucking crazy?

595
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:19,887
Why not?
- What is gonna take they'll think?

596
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:22,455
What is getting him fucking shot'em!
- It was self defense!

597
01:09:22,455 --> 01:09:27,177
Self-defense? He had no fucking weapon!
- It was an intruder, that we couldn't know!

598
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:33,149
I gave him a shot fucking guy!
- I know sweetheart, but he had this mask on!

599
01:09:32,813 --> 01:09:34,329
Forget that mask!

600
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:37,672
Honey, we need to call the cops!

601
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,234
We gotta give here the body!

602
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:40,999
What?

603
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:42,881
We have to get ready
out his body...

604
01:09:42,881 --> 01:09:44,833
No ones will believe us ...

605
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:47,892
Our lives will break out!
- Why would they not believe us?

606
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:52,098
Think about it, I've shot him!
I've shot him without a reason!

607
01:09:52,098 --> 01:09:58,272
But we couldn't know yet, just tell the
truth! Why can not we just tell the truth?

608
01:09:58,272 --> 01:10:00,868
Stop, stop talking!
You histerische now!

609
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:03,893
We have to get ready
out of the body!

610
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:07,843
I can't!

611
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:09,419
It is the only chance, baby!

612
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:10,325
I can't do this!

613
01:10:10,325 --> 01:10:12,986
It is our only chance, help me?
- No!

614
01:10:12,986 --> 01:10:14,748
Help me!
- No!

615
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:20,313
I swear to God, this is our only chance.
Help me now?!

616
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,550
I can't!

617
01:10:31,438 --> 01:10:36,330
Oh, my God, look at all that blood out!
What should we do?

618
01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:40,759
It's okay sweetheart!
- What should we do, baby?

619
01:10:41,163 --> 01:10:44,163
Honey, let me think ... Fuck!

620
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:53,707
I'm getting for something we wrap him,
We get to take him some far away ...

621
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:57,618
and buried him. Noones will ever find him.
This never happened!

622
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:59,786
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

623
01:11:03,115 --> 01:11:05,444
Ok baby, Everything is all right!

624
01:11:31,828 --> 01:11:32,821
Good evening, sir!

625
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,758
How's going on officer?
How can I help you?

626
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:37,581
Some of the neighbors report,
they were heard the gunshots!

627
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,986
Gun shots?

628
01:11:41,508 --> 01:11:43,042
When was it?

629
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:44,759
By half hour ago!

630
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,956
This is our second called on
to address this evening, is that Mr. Jones?

631
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:52,083
Yes, there was an accident earlier.

632
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:55,200
You think you heard strange
what belong to the neighbors?

633
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,300
No, nothing!

634
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:01,054
So you had some people over tonight,
is there anybody out of here?

635
01:12:01,054 --> 01:12:04,972
No, they are all went home.

636
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:08,022
According to the called we got
where shots and a scream come ...

637
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:12,327
...from this direction,
You didn't hear anything like that?

638
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:15,495
No, I guess I was asleep.

639
01:12:15,866 --> 01:12:17,790
You're home alone, sir?

640
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:21,200
No. My wife is upstairs.

641
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,743
May I have her a few questions?

642
01:12:23,743 --> 01:12:28,526
No, ... What I'm saying that ...
She is sleeping right now.

643
01:12:28,526 --> 01:12:30,555
She had a heavy sleeper?

644
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:37,153
Oh, to tell you the truth. She has
lot of drink earlier, and sleeping of...

645
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,153
now she sleeps like a log!

646
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:42,031
You know what... There are always a few
high school kids across the field over there...

647
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:45,404
And they are drunk,
setting of fires crackers...

648
01:12:45,846 --> 01:12:47,645
There will be something to do about it.

649
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:49,530
It could be, but I still ask her
a few questions ...

650
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,201
...just be sure that
everything is allright!

651
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,624
I think it is not a good idea,
they ... as I said it ...

652
01:13:00,598 --> 01:13:02,221
Adrian?

653
01:13:03,437 --> 01:13:05,345
Are you Mrs. Jones?

654
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:06,815
Yes!

655
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,532
Hey, baby, did we wake you?

656
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:14,148
Mam, your husband said you were sleeping.
- Yeah, I was!

657
01:13:14,148 --> 01:13:18,743
Did you happening hear unusual tonight,
any loud noises?

658
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:23,659
No ... I was just woken up and asked
wondering where my husband was!

659
01:13:24,973 --> 01:13:30,627
Well, it looks that everything is
allright here. I'm sorry about the fox.

660
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:33,379
You're safe now!

661
01:13:41,995 --> 01:13:45,584
It was good!
What did he say!

662
01:13:45,584 --> 01:13:47,045
Now go upstairs...

663
01:13:47,045 --> 01:13:50,694
...we have the body...

664
01:13:50,695 --> 01:13:52,997
...clean up before
he comes back.

665
01:13:53,092 --> 01:13:54,094
What? ... What?

666
01:13:54,094 --> 01:13:56,228
What about Michael?

667
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:58,313
Fuck!

668
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:02,231
Oh, God, what if they're heard anything?
Or what they saw and called the cop ...

669
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:06,469
Baby, she was here now,
she has not hear anything.

670
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:09,188
We gonna hurry now, okay?!

671
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:12,263
What have we gonna say to her?

672
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,971
We have gonna say anything!

673
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:16,840
Nothing?

674
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,825
Nothing, right my baby?

675
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:24,140
I dare not to look at her!
Forget that now but baby ...

676
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:28,625
Hey baby, we think about it
right now. I love you!

677
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:31,092
I love you so much but,
we can't think about that.

678
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:34,288
We just have to plan
and nobody can see us.

679
01:14:34,732 --> 01:14:36,266
What do we gonna do?

680
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,643
Let's go upstairs.

681
01:14:39,318 --> 01:14:41,235
Right! So think the plan!

682
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:43,673
Okay, go now!
I love you, baby!

683
01:14:43,936 --> 01:14:46,228
- I love you baby!
- I love you baby! I love you!

684
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,861
Get up baby!

685
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:13,039
We have lost a lot of time,
I know the cops are coming back.

686
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,677
Right?

687
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:19,674
Grab the gun and
put it on the dressior!

688
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:34,417
1, 2, 3, now!

689
01:15:43,431 --> 01:15:46,267
Wait! ... Okay!

690
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:22,867
The car is still there?
- We go to the garage!

691
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:24,366
Why we go to the garage?

692
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:26,459
We make sure that
he has nothing to identifier.

693
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:28,902
Trust me! Come on!

694
01:17:06,512 --> 01:17:08,185
What is that for?

695
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:14,187
We got to eliminate everything
what he can identifier.

696
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:16,690
What do you mean?

697
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:23,334
-  Oh, no, no, no!
- Baby!

698
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:28,333
If they find the body,
they can uses fingerprints ...

699
01:17:28,334 --> 01:17:32,129
...and teeth in order to be able
to identifier. It just has to be done!

700
01:17:32,129 --> 01:17:35,940
No! No! Don't do that, this is James!
- It just has to be done!

701
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,815
If we fuck on this, then,
It just has to be done!

702
01:17:38,815 --> 01:17:41,098
James, you can't do this!
This is James! You can't do this!

703
01:17:41,098 --> 01:17:44,474
He's dead already!
He's dead already!

704
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:47,194
Stop! Stop and
think for a second!

705
01:17:48,332 --> 01:17:50,019
Give me the fucking pliers!

706
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:52,865
No, no!
There must be better way!

707
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:59,527
We get a place where we dig a deep hole!
So deep that no one will ever find this!

708
01:18:00,162 --> 01:18:01,571
Give me the fucking pliers!

709
01:18:01,571 --> 01:18:02,915
We can't do this, no!

710
01:18:02,915 --> 01:18:06,169
Which gonna be done, Illiana!

711
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:16,134
You are ouster
fucking mind! Hear it!

712
01:18:17,714 --> 01:18:21,134
Would you listen?!

713
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:29,597
It's me! Adrián! It's me!
Oh, my God!

714
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:13,628
Say something dirty!

715
01:20:13,628 --> 01:20:16,020
What the fuck is this?

716
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:22,278
How you like my tongue
in your thigh caressing!

717
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:45,311
Fuck!

718
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:53,096
Sorry, I didn't know
there was someone in there.

719
01:20:55,127 --> 01:20:57,034
That was Adrian!
- No!

720
01:21:08,284 --> 01:21:10,517
What did you fucking do it?

721
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:29,625
Oh, my God, you're ...
What happened?

722
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:53,104
Should we not tell him?
- What happened to us?

723
01:22:53,104 --> 01:22:58,898
Now, tomorrow, next week, it's never a good time?
- Adrian, what has happened to us?

724
01:22:58,898 --> 01:23:02,669
Please, tell me!

725
01:23:05,366 --> 01:23:07,525
He will destroy it.

726
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:10,266
I know!

727
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:18,331
No! Neeeee ...
- I'm not sure I tolerate this any longer!

728
01:23:40,499 --> 01:23:41,721
Babe ... Babe?

729
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:56,555
Isis!

730
01:23:56,555 --> 01:23:59,094
Isis, babe?

731
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:01,220
Who did this?

732
01:24:03,531 --> 01:24:05,307
What's going on?
Baby, baby ...

733
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:09,015
Isis?

734
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:19,425
What is this?

735
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,877
What the hell is going on?

736
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:34,062
What are you doing, James?
- Gutten tag! Do your speech!

737
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:38,755
No! Okay, congratulations Adrian!
Stop!

738
01:24:39,996 --> 01:24:41,893
Is it chocolate?
- Yes!

739
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:45,017
Just be still!
Keep you really chocolate?

740
01:24:49,141 --> 01:24:52,068
How's Adrian?

741
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,954
Well, he tries it right!

742
01:24:56,954 --> 01:24:58,924
But he is even better!

743
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:00,724
Oh, he! He ... what?
- He is sometimes ...

744
01:25:05,322 --> 01:25:09,209
Sorry, I didn't know
there was someone inside!

745
01:25:10,096 --> 01:25:12,803
That was Adrian!

746
01:25:12,803 --> 01:25:15,147
Great God!

747
01:25:15,147 --> 01:25:17,676
Stop! Immediately betrays
the surprise yet.

748
01:25:29,337 --> 01:25:31,413
I'm really proud of you, Adrian!

749
01:25:31,413 --> 01:25:32,712
I'm really proud of you!

750
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,327
Squeeze my neck!

751
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:36,866
Hold me baby!

752
01:25:38,514 --> 01:25:42,226
You are ouster fucking mind!
Listen to yourself!

753
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:45,690
It's me! It's me!

754
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,989
Get out of my head! Get out!

755
01:26:17,179 --> 01:26:19,138
You trying to destroy me now?

756
01:26:19,823 --> 01:26:21,900
Where the fuck do you look for?

757
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:25,947
We want?

758
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:27,764
I know what you are ...

759
01:26:28,232 --> 01:26:30,732
Why are you doing this to me?

760
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:36,160
Okay, I think you're right!

761
01:26:52,675 --> 01:26:53,923
Welcome home!

762
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:49,996
He could never forget you!

763
01:29:08,087 --> 01:29:11,060
What the hell did
you do to him?

764
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,401
He was not!

765
01:29:13,401 --> 01:29:16,091
We were so young!

766
01:29:16,608 --> 01:29:18,699
He was so intensely busy and ...

767
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:24,387
I never really knew if he had feelings
had for me, so I broke it out ...

768
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:29,395
Years I have had no touch with him ...

769
01:29:29,395 --> 01:29:31,778
I did not even know he was married.

770
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:36,314
It's gonna be all right, baby!

771
01:29:37,262 --> 01:29:39,645
Is it's all my fault?

772
01:29:39,645 --> 01:29:42,942
Adrian was a very sick man, Illiana!

773
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:45,530
Everyone close to something
was wrong with him...

774
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,594
...including Isis!

775
01:29:49,691 --> 01:29:53,626
He had such smooth sweets!

776
01:29:53,626 --> 01:29:56,532
He was at illusion times!

777
01:29:57,737 --> 01:30:02,568
Obviously who is fabulous anyone fault.

778
01:30:05,135 --> 01:30:08,538
What if ... Maybe ...
maybe I have caused

779
01:30:08,538 --> 01:30:12,443
I loved his attention, maybe ...
I liked the way he treated me, maybe ...

780
01:30:12,443 --> 01:30:13,776
Do you have deceived him?

781
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:15,911
No!

782
01:30:16,819 --> 01:30:18,843
I was saying not so,
I saw many people, but ...

783
01:30:18,843 --> 01:30:20,630
he knew it, I told him all!

784
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:25,165
He wanted something from me what
I could not give!

785
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:29,312
I thought so ... Desperate!

786
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:34,158
We've all hurt anyone
done in love.

787
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:37,499
You were so young! What has happened
is not your fault!

788
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:43,324
Adrian had his own devil ...

789
01:30:43,324 --> 01:30:49,294
and it died with him.
