1
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,034
Where am I?

2
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,838
And what am I wearing?

3
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:38,205
Ruby, you got it?

4
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,214
Got it!

5
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,149
Uh... Why does it
look like that?

6
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,157
What are those things?

7
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,126
Grimm!

8
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:04,231
Hmm?

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,503
Are you okay? Anything hurt?

10
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,007
Shoot! Since when can
Grimm shoot laser beams?

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,310
Be right back, new kid!

12
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,378
I don't think
I'm in Kansas anymore.

13
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:26,754
Whoa...

14
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,959
Welp, that didn't work.

15
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,225
I'll take care of it!

16
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,532
Hmm.

17
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,770
Huh? Uh...

18
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,611
Uh... Are you all right?

19
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,980
I'm usually much stronger
than this.

20
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,681
They're headed for Beacon!

21
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,086
Beacon?

22
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,588
It's our school.

23
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:03,223
Or... it was?

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,226
Uh... What's your semblance?

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,529
Uh...

26
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,534
You know, like,
your... special power?

27
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,637
I know what it is
where I'm from.

28
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,539
Here... only one way
to find out.

29
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,306
Hmm.

30
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,620
Huh?

31
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,601
Huh?

32
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,042
Something's messed
with my powers!

33
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,209
Don't worry, I got you!

34
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:01,516
By the way, I'm Ruby!
And that's my sister, Yang!

35
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,862
I'm fine.

36
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,098
Got any special tricks to
beating monsters on your world?

37
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:19,232
"Your world"?

38
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,674
Duck!

39
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,482
Uh... Thanks for that.

40
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,185
That was nothing.

41
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,121
I should be able
to do more with my...

42
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,656
What did you call it?
Semblance?

43
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,526
It looks like Earth's sun.

44
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,863
Except it feels... different.

45
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,966
Earth is... your world?

46
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,570
Because you're from
a different world.

47
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,638
Because that's a thing.

48
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,273
Well that would explain...

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,676
a few things.

50
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,511
- Um...
- What's your name, kid?

51
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:07,815
Just call me...
Superman.

52
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,955
-Yeah... no.
-Ugh!

53
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,357
Do you have
a, uh, regular name?

54
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,028
Uh... Yeah. Just...
Just call me Clark.

55
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,396
Where am I?

56
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,466
This... is Remnant.

57
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,337
So...
how did you get here, Clark?

58
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,440
I don't remember anything.

59
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,009
Just images...

60
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:38,946
I was fighting something
with my friends... as an adult?

61
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,281
Are you sure you
didn't hit your head?

62
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,984
Something is wrong.

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,054
These Grimm... You said
they don't shoot lasers?

64
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,321
Not usually.

65
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,124
But they also
don't usually absorb

66
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,059
all the dust we shoot at them.

67
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,360
It's my fault.

68
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,428
I messed up your world
by being here.

69
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,831
I have to fix it.

70
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,767
Whenever anything
gets... weird,

71
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,937
you can bet there's one person
who knows what's going on.

72
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:05,907
Ozpin.

73
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,553
Sorry, Mom. What did you say?

74
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,454
I was asking how your studies
have been.

75
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,726
I worry about you.

76
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,696
What you and your friends
are doing...

77
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,631
You are all just children.

78
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,600
But I'm not a child, Mom.

79
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,102
I haven't been one for a while.

80
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,804
That's exactly what worries me.

81
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,473
I'm glad you're on break
from Beacon.

82
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,110
But you and your friends...

83
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,247
you're against so much danger.

84
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:48,516
I'll always come back
to you, Mom.

85
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:56,356
Rolf?

86
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:00,928
What's going on?

87
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,763
Chieftain Ghira
has us on high alert

88
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,364
since Sienna Khan's death.

89
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,068
Sienna? But... That...

90
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,838
<i>I was once</i>
<i>a member of the White Fang.</i>

91
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,106
The guards
down at the docks

92
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,473
were doing the rounds

93
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,142
and found
a suspicious character.

94
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,577
Has she said anything?

95
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:17,845
She...

96
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,355
has some questions.

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,123
Impressive.

98
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,691
How's this for an answer?

99
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,662
I don't want to cause harm.

100
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,998
I just asked to be taken
to their leader.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,468
Are you a Faunus?

102
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,070
-Uh...
-You know...

103
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:48,142
Faunus. Humans with,
like, a tail or wings or...

104
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,845
Who are you?

105
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:54,916
I am Diana,
Princess of the Amazons...

106
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,050
Can you help me?

107
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,623
A princess.
From another world.

108
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,059
And no memory of
how you got here?

109
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,595
I see flashes.

110
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:11,464
In them, I'm an adult
but I don't feel like that.

111
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,900
I feel like I'm 16.

112
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,535
That doesn't
make any sense.

113
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,704
No kidding.

114
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,073
What I do know is...

115
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,441
the longer I'm away
from my world,

116
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,443
the more people will get hurt.

117
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,979
I have to return.

118
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,882
Maybe my team can help you.
Let me call Yang.

119
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,119
Blake, the CCT at Atlas
has been down for a while,

120
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,955
don't you remember?

121
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:34,989
I...

122
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,458
I don't.

123
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,028
In that case, we go to Beacon.

124
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,700
I don't know what any of those
words mean.

125
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,869
The CCT is our Cross
Continental Transmit System,

126
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,772
it's how the kingdoms
of our world communicate.

127
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,541
But if that's not working,

128
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,043
then Ozpin is our
next best option.

129
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,780
Why isn't the CCT fixed yet?

130
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,415
What are they doing,
having a party?

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,719
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>you're having a party.</i>

132
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,620
Father, you're acting
like it doesn't matter

133
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,356
that the communication system
is down!

134
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:12,960
Weiss, you can handle
being away from your friends

135
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,161
for a few months.

136
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,430
You know something is wrong
but, as usual,

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,000
you won't sacrifice the dust
needed to help people!

138
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,136
It's not my job to fix the CCT.

139
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,539
If not us, then who?

140
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,742
Uh...

141
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,777
-Uh, what was I saying before?
-Ugh!

142
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,680
Did you see
the size of that suit?

143
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,949
Yes.

144
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,630
Wha--

145
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,706
Someone's disappointed
this isn't a costume party.

146
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,347
"Nero fiddled
while Rome burned."

147
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:07,748
Uh...

148
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,283
I saw your outburst
with your dad.

149
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,684
Can't say I blame you.

150
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,353
The rich are the same
in every universe,

151
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,822
chronically ignorant
to the plights of others.

152
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,894
I'm not one for parties,
either.

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,064
I usually try to find some
secret room to hole up in.

154
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,366
- You ever tried it?
- Mm... a dust lab

155
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,235
wouldn't be at the top
of my preferred hiding places.

156
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,705
Dust? Huh.

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,378
Like specific dust,
or just... general dust?

158
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,346
Schnees deal in general dust.

159
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,850
Can't allow ourselves to limit
the natural energy sources
we can use.

160
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,985
Of course.

161
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,122
Because dust
is an energy source.

162
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,592
Right.

163
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,830
I thought I knew
all the upper class families.

164
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,666
At least the ones
that have access to labs.

165
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,368
I'm from a little further out.

166
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,004
Mistral? Vacuo?

167
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,072
Sure.

168
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,343
Long way from home.

169
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,013
Bruce. Bruce Wayne.

170
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,749
Ever been to Mistral?

171
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,221
<i>Hey, you can hide out</i>
<i>back in the cargo hold.</i>

172
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,022
I'm not sure.

173
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,391
What do you remember?

174
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,394
<i>We are friends. Family.</i>

175
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,697
Mm, Bruce Wayne, you said?

176
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,731
Thief!

177
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,667
Someone stole my lab key!

178
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,006
I did tell you I liked to hide
in secret rooms at parties.

179
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:42,710
Weiss. Wait! I need your help.

180
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,912
I don't help common thieves.

181
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,180
Something is wrong

182
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:48,082
and I think
I may know what it is.

183
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,851
Your memories. You're having
a hard time connecting to them.

184
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,687
They're like soup
in your brain, right?

185
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,791
Please.

186
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:01,695
We'll find them, sir.

187
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,230
Here's your thief!

188
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,769
Weiss, listen!
I'm not from Vacuo!

189
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,138
Or Mistral!
Or from Remnant at all!

190
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,073
I have to get to a lab
to figure out

191
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,376
- what brought me here
so I can go back!

192
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's new.

193
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,390
A Faunus!

194
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,727
Whoa!

195
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:10,331
Oh, come on!
How does Clark do this?

196
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,372
Ugh!

197
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,407
He must work
for the White Fang.

198
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:25,212
But a terrorist organization
will not scare the Schnees.

199
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,480
Take him away.

200
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,683
White Fang?

201
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,184
Weiss, you know I'm right!

202
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,686
You know we're out of place!

203
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,964
How are you not tired?

204
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,866
We ran the whole way!

205
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,670
Yeah. I guess
it's my semblance?

206
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,739
As long as
I'm not in the shade.

207
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,608
You said it's the...
The physical...

208
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,309
something of my something?

209
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:58,879
Physical manifestation
of your aura.

210
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,149
Auras. Right.
Basically, your soul.

211
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,119
Got it. I think.

212
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:09,189
Does this place feel sort of...
empty to you guys?

213
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,392
We didn't run into anyone
on the way here.

214
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,359
You're right,

215
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,696
but Ozpin
will have the answers.

216
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,130
He always does.

217
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,402
Yang?

218
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,804
Blake!

219
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,240
You got pulled
into this weirdness, too?

220
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,743
Guess we all had the same idea.

221
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,878
-Wonder Woman?
-Superman!

222
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:34,716
Superman?

223
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,217
Yeah, we just call him Clark.

224
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,853
This is my friend, Diana.

225
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,590
Diana, this is Ruby and Yang.

226
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:43,857
And this is Blake.

227
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,392
Do we know if the others
are here?

228
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,062
You're the first familiar face
that I've seen.

229
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,599
Well, mostly familiar.

230
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,736
We weren't teenagers
before this, right?

231
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,171
Well, uh, what do you remember?

232
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,240
Just... flashes.

233
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,678
We were fighting something.

234
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:07,649
Something... mechanical.
And big.

235
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,883
That's all I remember since
waking up in Menagerie.

236
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,587
Wait. You were in Menagerie?

237
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:15,690
Isn't that, like, a long trip?

238
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:17,458
When did you guys
get to Beacon?

239
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,928
It felt like we set out
this morning.

240
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:22,797
<i>So, here I am.</i>

241
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,265
<i>A criminal hiding</i>
<i>in plain view.</i>

242
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,434
<i>All with the help of</i>
<i>a little black...</i>

243
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:33,240
This is... This is all wrong.

244
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,219
Beacon...

245
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,187
It fell.

246
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,924
Guys... this isn't right.

247
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,193
That could explain
why we're teens.

248
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,063
Maybe... Did we do this?

249
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,168
Students!

250
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,038
Ozpin?

251
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,440
Do you know what's going on?

252
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:08,976
The Grimm are acting
really weird!

253
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,911
They shoot lasers!

254
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,514
You shouldn't be here.

255
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:17,050
<i>Professor Ozpin?</i>
<i>Is that you?</i>

256
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,654
Neither should you.

257
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:24,358
Uh, is changing into
a small boy his semblance?

258
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,931
No, I...
I don't think so.

259
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,000
Ozpin died.

260
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,537
Then reincarnated as Oscar.

261
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:38,472
Tell us what's going on?
Where are our friends?

262
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,744
Whoo... She is...
very strong.

263
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:43,745
And?

264
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,045
Just an observation.

265
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,183
But you were just...

266
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,852
You five
should be in training.

267
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,188
There's been a report of Grimm
on the edge of town.

268
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,023
Come with me.

269
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,728
That was weird.

270
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,129
Should we follow him?

271
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,898
We need to get things
back to normal

272
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,700
as soon as possible.

273
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,034
Hmm.

274
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,537
Hmm?

275
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,743
Oh. Ah.

276
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,110
Uh...

277
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,513
Miss Cruz?

278
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,618
So, our aura-soul thing

279
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:28,388
controls our
semblance-power thing. Right?

280
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,559
Correct. More or less.

281
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:35,095
What if we can't connect
to our semblance?

282
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,899
It may take some time,
but you'll get there.

283
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:41,870
Now, who can tell me about
the different kinds of dust?

284
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,939
There are a bunch
of different colors.

285
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,574
They're in all the weapons.

286
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,309
Yes. But, what color dust

287
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,913
coordinates with
which energy source?

288
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,183
Red, fire. Yellow, electricity.
et cetera, et cetera.

289
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,122
Something smells different.

290
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,423
And how did you know all that?

291
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,827
You'd know
the answers, too,

292
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,094
if you paid attention.

293
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,531
Hmm... I don't know.

294
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,032
Why are we
learning kids' stuff?

295
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,502
-Beats me.
-This is weird, right?

296
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,336
It feels like something's off.

297
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,172
Something's
definitely sideways.

298
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,677
The tech here feels weird.
Hollow.

299
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,144
You've adjusted quickly.

300
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,313
Just a little while ago
you were freaking out.

301
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,148
What, you haven't learned
how to adapt

302
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,518
thanks to childhood trauma?

303
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,121
Well,

304
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:37,124
it seems you all have
more important things

305
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,594
to talk about
than your lessons.

306
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,261
In that case...

307
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,350
Sorry, Nora!

308
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,556
Mari, use your power!

309
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:11,726
Oh! Do you mean my semblance
or my dust?

310
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:15,530
I'm still not sure
what the difference is.

311
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:19,132
My necklace
is gone, remember?

312
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,268
Hey, Jessica, how you doing?

313
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:25,205
Come on... Come on!

314
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,576
She's been better.

315
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,616
Here, use my machine!

316
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,620
I don't want to use
your machine,

317
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:41,589
I want to use my necklace
to summon eagle's flight!

318
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,591
Hyah!

319
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,292
Oh.

320
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:47,862
Ha-ha!

321
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,703
Huh?

322
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:06,279
Barry!

323
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,414
He's fine.

324
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,150
He's in pain!

325
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,928
Could really use Superman
right about now.

326
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,397
Come on, guys.

327
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,165
Voted for Homecoming King yet?

328
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,006
Uh...

329
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:35,510
Remember, students, that
there are Grimm in the forest.

330
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,578
This is really freaking me out.

331
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:40,615
It's like he's not really here.

332
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,482
Any idea what happened to him?

333
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,318
My mom said
some weird stuff, too.

334
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,287
I didn't think anything
of it, but--

335
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,589
What is going on?

336
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:50,925
Wha--

337
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,493
Hey! Where did Ozpin go?

338
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,430
Or, wait, was it Oscar?
No, that's wrong, right?

339
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,701
Oscar isn't old enough
to look like Ozpin. I think.

340
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,003
How old is he?

341
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,206
In normal years or possessed-
by-an-ancient-immortal years?

342
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,376
Is that like dog years?

343
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,912
That must be them.

344
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,950
Yes!

345
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,284
-Uh...
-Vixen!

346
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,419
I'm so happy to see you two.

347
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:22,924
Ugh. I hated being a teen
the first time around.

348
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,660
- How long have you been here?
 -Uh...

349
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,530
Three days? No. This morning?

350
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:31,331
It's hard to tell. You?

351
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:35,002
I feel like it's only been
since this morning.

352
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,771
I just want to get back home.

353
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,740
And back to normal.

354
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:41,075
We've made some friends
who should be able to help.

355
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:44,579
Justice League,
meet Ruby, Yang, and Blake.

356
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,379
And these are our friends.

357
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,315
Jaune, Nora and Ren.

358
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,417
-Oh. So, we don't
have to kill them?
-Mm.

359
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,819
I'd like to see you try.

360
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:54,522
I would not! Nobody
needs to do any killing.

361
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,657
So, you guys
aren't from here either?

362
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:59,093
Well, from what Diana and I
have pieced together,

363
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,429
we were fighting
some large mech...

364
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,933
with no memory of anything
until showing up here.

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,401
Well,
that's a dead end then, right?

366
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,138
Flash and I have been
trying to remember

367
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,673
so we can figure out
how to send ourselves back.

368
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,778
The tech here hasn't been
particularly helpful. Brainiac?

369
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:20,347
Maybe Vandal Savage,
if it's a time travel thing?

370
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,885
What about that one guy...
um... Kilg%re?

371
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,319
That the lunatic who wants to
take over the world?

372
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,655
You said it before,

373
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,422
Kilg%re is a delusional
electrical wire

374
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,691
short of a full panel.

375
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:32,827
But is the question:
who did this?

376
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:36,296
Or is it: why are we
someplace called Remnant?

377
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,132
If this really is Remnant.

378
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,399
We'll find out.

379
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,003
But we aren't all together yet.

380
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,672
Mm.

381
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,874
Where's Batman?

382
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,559
Wow.

383
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,739
Hmm?

384
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:33,087
Okay.
Too much too fast. Noted.

385
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:35,857
- So...
- Huh?

386
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:38,458
I take it the bat costume
was yours?

387
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,028
You believe me.

388
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,331
I did some digging around,

389
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,299
and I think
you're onto something.

390
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,034
About your memories fraying?

391
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,904
How do you know that?

392
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:51,105
A hunch.

393
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:54,308
If I can get a look at
what makes up your world

394
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,010
and your dust,

395
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:59,080
I might be able to figure out
what's going on.

396
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,848
That's what I was trying to do
at the party.

397
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,049
Ah, yes.

398
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,119
Stealing the keys to the lab.

399
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,955
There are easier ways
to break in, you know.

400
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:10,591
Hmm. Or out.

401
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,939
I was waiting for you.

402
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,275
I had a feeling
you'd want answers, too.

403
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,576
Ugh.

404
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,079
The lab is this way.

405
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,292
Where could he be?

406
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:47,828
Sorry, I can't believe
you have a teammate
named Bat Man.

407
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:51,498
Now is that better or worse
than a teammate named Superman?

408
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,567
- Right?
- Focus.

409
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:55,468
He could be anywhere.

410
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:58,673
And Remnant is a big place.

411
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:00,508
Yang and I found Clark.

412
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:03,311
Diana woke up on
Menagerie near Blake.

413
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:04,745
And the rest, well--

414
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,981
They were in the dorms
next to ours.

415
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,482
We only noticed when
we heard Jessica crying.

416
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,386
I wasn't crying!

417
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,155
Hey, it's okay.

418
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,525
You were a little though.

419
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:19,560
I was trying to find my ring!

420
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,696
Yeah, and my necklace
is gone, too.

421
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,232
- So, we've all been dropped near members of your teams...
-  -Huh?

422
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:29,770
Has anyone heard from Weiss?

423
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:32,807
I tried calling her,
but there was no answer--

424
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,442
Communication
isn't working.

425
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:35,776
Do you think that's connected?

426
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,611
What runs
the communication system?

427
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:38,713
Dust.

428
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,248
It runs everything.

429
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:44,585
The Grimm we saw in the forest
was absorbing it.

430
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:47,989
- Do you think it could
be using dust for its energy?

431
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:49,991
Batman would know.

432
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:51,759
Where would Weiss be?

433
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,227
Well, if Blake was in Menagerie

434
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:56,230
and Yang and I were
in the woods by Beacon,

435
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:59,133
then Weiss might be in Atlas.

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,069
You probably
don't need me, right?

437
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:03,804
Jessica, what's going on?

438
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:07,208
I've been trying to tap into
my semblance thing

439
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,143
this whole time,

440
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,978
but I need my ring.

441
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:13,414
It's got to be
on this world somewhere.

442
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:16,951
- Jessica,
we don't have time to--
- Ring?

443
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:19,620
A bright green
with a weird design?

444
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:22,490
I've seen it.
It's in Ozpin's office.

445
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,291
- Why don't we--
<i>- Jaune?</i>

446
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,596
<i>Jaune? Jaune?</i>

447
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,798
Jaune?

448
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,067
There are 12 of us.

449
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,669
We don't all need
to go looking for Bruce.

450
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:38,272
Okay, so Lantern
can go get her ring back

451
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,508
while we look for Batman.

452
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,409
-What?
-Well, we could--

453
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:43,512
Hold on. I'm not following
someone into battle

454
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,212
who's never been
on Remnant before.

455
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,480
Me neither.

456
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,882
You can't just
barge into our world

457
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:50,284
like you know
what you're doing.

458
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,787
Sorry. They do this.

459
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,221
Blondie has a point.

460
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,923
Their world, their rules.

461
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,191
Even if their rules involve

462
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:59,060
figuring out
this semblance thing.

463
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,761
Hey, all right, even those
of us that are from here

464
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:03,097
can have a hard time with it.

465
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,666
There's another thing
we haven't talked about.

466
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,635
The Grimm in the forest.

467
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,236
We've fought monsters before.

468
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:12,706
I don't know what you have
on your world, but Grimm...

469
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:16,310
they're soulless creatures
with only one purpose:

470
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,878
to destroy humanity.

471
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:20,848
I've never seen anything
like them before.

472
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:23,217
We need to figure out
how to get back, now.

473
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,718
I think we all need to--

474
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,120
We aren't going without Bruce.

475
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,355
-Why are you calling the shots?
-No wait--

476
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,490
I need to get my ring.

477
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:31,292
We should be able to--

478
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,626
Hey!

479
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,362
We should split up.

480
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,865
One group goes with Jessica
to get her ring back,

481
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,500
one group looks for Bruce,

482
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:43,003
the rest of us are going to
check out these weird Grimm.

483
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,706
They might shed some light
on what's going on.

484
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:48,042
Or at least, how to get back.

485
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,247
That's exactly
what I was trying to say.

486
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:54,482
I'll head to the forest.

487
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,716
I'll take Diana to Atlas.

488
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:57,017
Uh, me, too.

489
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,855
I'll go with Ruby
to track down Grimm.

490
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,356
All right, sticking with you,
Blue Boy.

491
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,858
I'll go, too.

492
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:06,327
If there's Grimm to smash,
I want to smash them!

493
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,729
Cyborg, want to stay behind
with Lantern?

494
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:09,864
Hack into their computers?

495
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,066
Eh, I already tried that.
No luck.

496
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,969
Just some weird numbers
over and over again.

497
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:16,637
I volunteer for the creepy
monster mission

498
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,339
in the woods with Nora!

499
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,373
Me, too.

500
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:23,744
Um... I...

501
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:25,212
I don't want to go alone.

502
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,848
I'll go with you.

503
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,118
Vixen?

504
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,487
Ah, why not?

505
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:36,991
Always love following you
into certain death, Supes.

506
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,693
Good luck, everyone.

507
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:43,864
So,
your home is called Gotham?

508
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:47,301
And on your world,
you're an adult?

509
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,270
I don't...

510
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,406
The evidence suggests
that was the case.

511
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:55,976
But I feel like I'm a teenager.
It's weird.

512
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:58,746
I didn't have the chance
to be a teen before.

513
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,214
I don't like it.

514
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:03,817
So, uh, where's this lab?

515
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,620
Just around here.

516
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:14,128
-Grimm.
-They don't look very friendly.

517
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,997
The lab. It should be
right there.

518
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:21,268
-I'll distract them, you--
-Wait.

519
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:24,004
Are you really
telling me how to fight Grimm?

520
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,041
They're illusions.

521
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:28,809
This isn't your world.

522
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,179
The lab's behind them, hidden.

523
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:34,683
Someone doesn't want us
getting in there.

524
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,418
Well, have I got news for them.

525
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,332
Figure out
how to shut them down!

526
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,942
Weiss! Stop using the dust!

527
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,144
-They're feeding off of it!
-Huh?

528
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,720
I thought you said
they were illusions!

529
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:13,387
They're good illusions!

530
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:15,456
Deadly illusions. Got it.

531
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,609
Any luck with the door?

532
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,011
There's an electrical current
preventing anyone
from getting in.

533
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,513
I found a weakness,

534
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,515
but I need something small
enough to cut through.

535
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:43,050
Hmm.

536
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,424
Hurry!

537
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,335
Huh?

538
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:17,418
You know, it's a shame
you're not from Remnant.

539
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,420
It feels like you belong.

540
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,131
I feel ridiculous.

541
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:34,268
What? You don't like
being back in high school?

542
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:36,771
I don't like having
an actual tail.

543
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,673
Oh, come on. It suits you!

544
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,874
Well, you're not the one
who keeps sitting on it.

545
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:47,682
Can I help you with something?

546
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:50,884
I've noticed you're
really great with weapons.

547
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:54,021
And since we aren't around
a lot of electronics out here,

548
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,191
I was thinking...
I might not be a lot of help.

549
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,360
Could you show me
a couple tricks?

550
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,295
We're all
a little busy here.

551
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:04,766
Ren, I can answer for myself.

552
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,535
No, Nora,
I know, but--

553
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:08,803
And I thought
this was going to be

554
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,337
a boring monster hunt.

555
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,074
Ooh! Sorry about that.

556
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,276
-Hey, man, I'm not trying to--
-Not trying to what?

557
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:19,113
You know, this is the most
you've said to me
this whole time.

558
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,447
I don't say much to anyone!

559
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,716
Guys...

560
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:23,050
Look I already work
with a strong, silent type

561
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,151
that looks down on everyone.

562
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,285
And you're no Batman.

563
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,555
Okay, everyone, calm down.

564
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:28,723
And you're not my dad.

565
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,725
Well, you're acting like a kid.

566
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,192
No, I'm not.

567
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,461
I'm trying to figure out
how to avoid certain doom.

568
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:35,963
That's not what kids do.

569
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,197
That's what we do.

570
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,299
We have to protect everyone.

571
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,268
And take care of each other.

572
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,170
And who are you, pipsqueak?

573
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,539
- Hey!
- Cyborg!

574
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:47,441
I...

575
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,547
Yeah. That sucked. I know.

576
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,618
I just hate
not feeling... useful.

577
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,987
I'm gonna... scout.

578
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,156
Clear my head.

579
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:05,760
You okay?

580
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:09,163
I've been doing this leader
thing for a while now and...

581
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:11,298
And sometimes it's...

582
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,969
Sometimes it's just so...

583
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,144
I know what you mean.

584
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:27,214
Like, everything you do
is the end of the world.

585
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,584
And nothing can stop it.

586
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,386
Just so you know,
that doesn't go away.

587
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,221
Even when you're a grown-up.

588
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,829
Ah, I'm sorry, it's...

589
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:44,164
It's hard to take you seriously
when you're Yang's age.

590
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,634
Yeah.

591
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,001
Uh...

592
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,104
Hey, we have a problem!

593
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,442
Hmm.

594
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,416
Find anything?

595
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,051
She said it was on the desk,

596
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:07,054
but I've looked over
the whole thing. Twice.

597
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,723
Oh, this would be
so much easier

598
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,658
if I actually had my ring.

599
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,292
I could just scan the desk.

600
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,528
This piece of jewelry

601
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,262
is really important
to you, huh?

602
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,832
Oh, it's not
just a piece of jewelry.

603
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,399
It's... It's my strength,

604
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,503
it's the thing
that keeps me together,

605
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:25,305
and without it... Without it...

606
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:28,877
Hey, hey! I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

607
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,945
Do you think that's why
you haven't been able

608
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,412
to access your semblance?

609
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,825
I've been there.

610
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,593
How'd you access it?

611
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:47,862
Uh...

612
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:50,364
A friend believed in me.

613
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,001
That's all?

614
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,334
Try it out.

615
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,471
Fine.

616
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,810
Doing floor time. Cool.

617
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,081
It's also okay
if it doesn't happen.

618
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,884
What? You said
you believed in me!

619
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:11,385
I do, Jessica,

620
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,754
but you're putting
a lot of pressure on yourself.

621
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,690
You're no less of a person
if you can't.

622
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,399
- <i>Jessica?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

623
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,070
<i>Did it work?</i>

624
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,474
My ring?

625
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:39,279
I can hear you.
Did I go anywhere?

626
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:42,984
No, you're still on the floor.

627
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:44,652
-What's going on?
-I...

628
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,788
I don't know. I...

629
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,824
It's a white room. No windows.

630
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,459
No doors. And I can't get out.

631
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,796
I... I don't like
being trapped.

632
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,301
What? What is that?

633
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:04,606
It feels different.

634
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:05,640
It's my semblance.

635
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:08,475
I help enhance...
whatever yours is.

636
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:10,812
Try again.

637
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,218
Ugh, I can't.

638
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:22,122
I have the ring,
but it's not working!

639
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,659
Okay.

640
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,260
Talk to me about it.

641
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,129
What does it feel like
when it works?

642
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,133
I used to...

643
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,738
I used to not want it.

644
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,707
I didn't feel like
I deserved it.

645
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:42,409
It's a symbol of power
on my world,

646
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,813
but it's also supposed to be
a symbol of belonging.

647
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,183
And I always wanted to belong,
so badly,

648
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,252
to fit into my skin.

649
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,122
And yet here I was,

650
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:56,591
forever different
than my friends.

651
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,394
Because the ring
brought experiences

652
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,396
that they could never imagine,

653
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:05,667
that they'll never
have to live through, but...

654
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,301
But I never want them
to live through.

655
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:12,674
But at least, with the ring,

656
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,543
I always felt like
I had control.

657
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:19,113
I could construct
whatever I wanted,

658
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,648
whatever I could imagine,

659
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,551
even if everything
was out of my hands.

660
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:27,055
And somehow in the in-between,

661
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,456
everything got all quiet.

662
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,660
I could find myself.

663
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,629
Oh, you changed the room!

664
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,398
What are you doing here?

665
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:41,234
This was Ozpin's office,
but now it's that white space!

666
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:47,207
Or we were never
in Ozpin's office.

667
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,844
Or on Remnant at all.

668
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,946
This is where
we've been all along.

669
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,082
Your ring, it...

670
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:56,316
It sounds like it gets
to the truth of things.

671
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,418
The truth of you.

672
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:01,956
I bet... I bet that's what
your semblance does, too.

673
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,390
With or without the ring.

674
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:06,460
We aren't in your world!
Or mine!

675
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:08,730
This is all an illusion!

676
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,366
Ugh! There's no door!

677
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,537
I can't get out!

678
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:19,473
Unless that's an illusion, too.

679
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,809
And if this guy's
an illusion...

680
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,712
What are you doing?

681
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:25,947
Hold on!

682
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:29,917
Jessica, is it--

683
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:37,257
<i>Stop... Stop...</i>

684
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:39,861
Pyrrha!

685
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,764
Stop... Stop...

686
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:55,710
Okay... that
definitely felt like real pain.

687
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,180
We have to tell the others.

688
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,548
If we are in an illusion,

689
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:02,382
then we were all
brought here by someone

690
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,384
that can transfer
our consciousness.

691
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,354
And whoever brought us here...

692
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,690
must be controlling this place.

693
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:35,550
Ow!

694
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,588
So... How's it going?

695
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,024
Just swell.

696
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,528
It's different than home.

697
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:50,631
There, I don't have to
imagine gauntlets to fly,

698
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,834
or a lasso for strength.

699
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,368
Those are powers
you have on your world?

700
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,638
And they just... happen?

701
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,807
They come
from different places.

702
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,409
Mine are a gift from the gods.

703
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:05,980
Superman's come from the sun,
more or less.

704
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,916
Each of us learned how to
save the world on our own.

705
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,686
At least you guys
learned together.

706
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:14,454
Who's flying the ship?

707
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:16,023
Autopilot.

708
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,192
I set the proximity alert
for when we get near Atlas.

709
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,127
What about Grimm? Can they fly?

710
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:23,598
Some can. The alert
will sound for them, too.

711
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:26,067
Grimm are attracted
to negative emotions,

712
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:30,504
and something tells me we might
have a lot of those right now.

713
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,439
You have to stay focused.

714
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:33,941
All the time.

715
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,810
Hmm. Just about.

716
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,351
Everything okay?

717
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,587
It's nice here. With you guys.

718
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:49,489
I like my team.
I really do. But...

719
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,060
they don't understand.

720
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:54,996
That happens with teams.

721
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,099
Yang and I didn't exactly
get along at first.

722
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:59,133
But now...

723
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,904
No. I grew up like a warrior.

724
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,806
On an island
with other warriors.

725
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:09,143
We trained together,
fought together.

726
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:10,912
Like us.

727
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,081
Yeah.

728
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,750
But my teammates, they...

729
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:18,286
They didn't grow up like I did.

730
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:21,522
They don't always understand
what being a warrior means.

731
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,925
They sound lucky.

732
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,060
They've never had to worry
they were going to die

733
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:27,762
just from going to school.

734
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,196
To train like your life

735
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:32,066
or, worse, your friends' lives
depend on it.

736
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,768
To have to live
with the fact that

737
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:36,637
there's a real chance
you're going to lose them.

738
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,707
They had a childhood.

739
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:41,842
Blake...

740
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,181
What was that?

741
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,859
Grimm!

742
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,394
Let's see what they're after.

743
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,862
Yang, open the hatch!

744
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,598
Are you really doing
what I think you're doing?

745
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:08,169
You heard Diana,
we're warriors!

746
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:29,957
Whoa. Okay! Easy. Easy.

747
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,793
All right.

748
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:40,935
Blake!

749
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:52,546
It's absorbing the dust!

750
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:27,882
Pitch the ship!

751
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,885
Trust me!

752
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:56,777
Nice job!

753
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,086
We're still in the school?

754
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:08,389
Jaune... Trapped!
We're trapped!

755
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:09,824
<i>Jaune?</i>

756
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,959
Ugh! Who could be
doing this to us?

757
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,894
- <i>Jaune?</i>
- Shh.

758
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,362
<i>Is that you?</i>

759
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:18,265
Do you hear her?

760
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:22,002
Jaune, someone
is controlling this space.

761
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,370
Whatever you're hearing...

762
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:25,773
It's not real.

763
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:31,212
Of course it's not real.
She's gone.

764
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,649
<i>Really, Jaune?</i>

765
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:39,220
- She?
- You can't be here.

766
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,888
Who do you think
you're hearing?

767
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:43,057
I know this isn't real.
I saw the white room.

768
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:50,865
I could really use a dose
of reality right now, Jess.

769
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,867
Can you take control
of this hallway?

770
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:02,109
- I'm trying-- I...
- I...

771
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:06,947
<i>Let me.</i>
<i>I can help. Just ask.</i>

772
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,684
Fine! Pyrrha, help us!

773
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,722
What was that?

774
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,772
You guys have dragons?

775
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,242
Not normally!
And it's a Wyvern!

776
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:35,976
Uh...

777
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:39,680
So... what do we do?

778
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:41,248
We fight!

779
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,151
You heard her.

780
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:51,358
Ah!

781
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,189
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

782
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:35,302
Clark!

783
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:44,945
Nora!

784
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:47,481
I've got her!

785
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,151
I can take care of myself!

786
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,323
I'm okay.

787
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,428
See what's up with Barry.

788
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:04,865
Anyone see what happened
to Flash?

789
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,033
Wait, what happened--

790
00:46:07,736 --> 00:46:09,069
Pay attention!

791
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,675
Flash? Flash! He's hurt!

792
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:14,875
Do Grimm carry poison?

793
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,343
Not this one!

794
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,444
What's going on with him?

795
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:19,079
I don't know!
It's like he went down

796
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:20,781
as soon as we started
attacking the dragon!

797
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:24,084
Ruby! How do we stop this thing
before it hurts anyone else?

798
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:27,888
I... The last time
I fought it I--

799
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:38,700
Ruby?

800
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,000
Something's not right.

801
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:43,304
It doesn't feel like
a normal Grimm.

802
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,172
Okay, plan B.

803
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,208
Nora and Cyborg!
You create an electrical charge

804
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:49,943
strong enough that
Nora can absorb it

805
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,746
and take this thing down.

806
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,113
We'll clear a path!

807
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:57,351
Hey, before. I didn't mean

808
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:59,019
you couldn't take care
of yourself. That's not--

809
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,854
-Hold my hand.
-What?

810
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:17,137
Count of three. One... two...

811
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:18,839
-three!
-Three!

812
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:36,323
Good job, you guys.

813
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,392
I'm sorry that I just... I--

814
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:50,871
Uh, that's not
supposed to happen.

815
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,845
This lab...

816
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,178
it has everything.

817
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,647
More than normal.

818
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:02,116
It isn't usually set up
like a command center.

819
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:04,284
So the Grimm
are feeding off energy

820
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,120
like it's their personal
power source

821
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,622
and they protect this place

822
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,957
that's not normally set up
like a command center.

823
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:11,959
But why?

824
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,561
There. That should show us

825
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:17,464
when the energy vampire
Grimm show up.

826
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:18,767
How'd you manage that?

827
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,968
The Grimm outside lent a hand.

828
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:23,404
It's strange.

829
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,973
Usually Grimm completely
dissolve when they're killed.

830
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,842
Something's changed the rules.

831
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,243
Hmm.

832
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,378
With any luck,

833
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:34,047
my friends are fighting
against one of these Grimm

834
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,949
and we'll be able
to track them down.

835
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,484
What makes you think
there's anyone else

836
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:39,052
from our worlds here?

837
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,455
Maybe it's just you and me.

838
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:46,427
You know, if you can't
find your way back,

839
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,362
you could always stay
on my world.

840
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:52,132
You could belong in Remnant.

841
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:57,705
Another dead end.

842
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:59,139
Wow, it looks...

843
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,210
...just like I remember it.

844
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,182
I didn't realize how much
I missed this place.

845
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:10,552
How much it...

846
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,555
- reminds me of--
- Jaune?

847
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,064
Jaune.

848
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:26,300
What?

849
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,379
Pyrrha, you can't...
You can't be here.

850
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:42,082
You're not real,
none of this is real.

851
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:46,286
I am real, Jaune. I promise.

852
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:50,224
I will explain everything,
but we've got to go.

853
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,928
Jaune,
we need to tell our teams

854
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,229
what we've found.

855
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:57,932
Pyrrha...

856
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,768
She's been helping
this whole time!

857
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,369
I've heard her over and over,

858
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:04,839
and then she showed us
the door when I called her!

859
00:50:04,906 --> 00:50:06,073
But--

860
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,307
You can't use
your power, right?

861
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:10,377
So... what are
our other options?

862
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,683
Okay. Let's go.

863
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,017
Follow me.

864
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:20,622
There's a shortcut we can take.

865
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:36,638
Hurry! Your friends
are in danger!

866
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,072
You're... You're not
coming with us?

867
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,745
You cannot be allowed

868
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:46,046
to tell the Justice League.

869
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:48,282
Pyrrha? Pyrrha, no!

870
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,150
Pyrrha!

871
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,507
Huh?

872
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:15,810
You sure nothing
like this happened before?

873
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,746
Is your memory glitching?

874
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:21,549
I think we would remember
if we'd seen a Grimm reboot,

875
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:23,952
let alone split into
a whole other Grimm!

876
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:32,527
Good job, Nora!

877
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:34,461
What now, Ruby?

878
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,564
Right, uh... Now, uh now...

879
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,165
See if anything that
we've thrown at the Wyvern

880
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:39,567
has slowed it down at all!

881
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,005
You're not the boss of us.
We aren't kids.

882
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:45,540
You are kids!

883
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:46,507
So are you.

884
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,145
Ruby, I don't mean to overstep,

885
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:54,549
but I've had experiences
leading a team.

886
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:57,150
-So have I!
-Clearly not enough.

887
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,688
- Ruby, I--
- I had it.

888
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:02,389
You just had to
give me a minute--

889
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:04,358
Sometimes you don't
have a minute!

890
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:07,862
It's my fault that we're here.

891
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,162
I think I froze.

892
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,633
<i>And my team...</i>

893
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:13,768
We're stuck here because of me.

894
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,370
Watch out!

895
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,644
<i>Flash. Flash!</i>

896
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,812
Are you okay?

897
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:27,447
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

898
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:30,484
I do know I'm not much
use to you guys.

899
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:32,720
We need to talk.

900
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:36,024
Nora!

901
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:42,396
No!

902
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:45,399
The Grimm are swarming!

903
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,335
Ruby! Lookout!

904
00:52:56,077 --> 00:52:57,411
Why aren't you working?

905
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:59,647
Weiss, look at this.

906
00:53:01,616 --> 00:53:03,017
There's a program
that's running

907
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:04,451
on your communication system.

908
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,621
Think that's why
it's not working?

909
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:09,857
Huh? I've seen that
sequence before.

910
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:12,827
I saw it when I was trying
to track the rest of my team.

911
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:15,262
I didn't think
anything of it, but--

912
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:16,731
It's on every system.

913
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:20,267
It's the only program running.

914
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,003
Which means
if we can alter it...

915
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,572
We'll be able to take control
of whatever this is.

916
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:28,776
Hmm.

917
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,414
Huh?

918
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:38,519
These guys again?
Don't use dust!

919
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:41,055
What am I supposed to do,
spit on them?

920
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:42,289
Hmm.

921
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,863
Ah!

922
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,931
Bruce!

923
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,935
There are
too many of them!

924
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:31,172
Hmm?

925
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:41,749
So...

926
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:45,753
what'd I miss?

927
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,721
Help us!

928
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,625
Please! Pyrrha!

929
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,527
She wasn't real, Jaune.

930
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,730
You know that.

931
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:58,766
None of this is real.

932
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:00,735
And now...

933
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:03,938
we're gonna die.

934
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,307
Gah!

935
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:09,010
I shouldn't have trusted her.

936
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,346
I'm sorry.

937
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:15,348
She seemed important to you.

938
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,652
She is.

939
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:21,689
Was.

940
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:24,324
I'm sorry you lost her.

941
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,927
It was a long time ago.

942
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:30,397
Time is only
one part of grief.

943
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:39,740
Jaune, the walls.

944
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:40,775
I see them.

945
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:43,511
Jaune!
Jaune!

946
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:44,846
You can get us out of this.

947
00:55:46,881 --> 00:55:48,683
No. No, I can't!

948
00:55:48,749 --> 00:55:51,619
I can't tap into my power here.

949
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:53,321
I thought
I was over my anxiety,

950
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:55,323
I... I thought
I had dealt with it!

951
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:57,525
Hey! Sometimes
there are flare-ups.

952
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:58,693
It's normal to be afraid.

953
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:01,062
But you're more than your fear.

954
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:03,664
You are more than that ring!

955
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,467
<i>Run that by us</i>
<i>one more time?</i>

956
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:09,003
And speak slowly.

957
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,574
Imagine that it's been a long
day and I am very tired.

958
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:16,811
We aren't on Remnant.

959
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:20,548
Or their world.
We're... somewhere else.

960
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:24,285
Well, that explains my mom.
And Ozpin.

961
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:26,554
They're not... real.

962
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:28,890
They're like broken memories.

963
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:30,457
- My dad, too.
- Batman?

964
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:33,527
- We found a sequence.
- Bruce?

965
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:34,896
This is Diana. She's...

966
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:36,864
I didn't think
anyone else was here.

967
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,267
...his teammate.

968
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,702
But you probably
picked up on that.

969
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:44,972
You look... different.

970
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:47,575
This place is so strange.

971
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:49,043
I just want to go home.

972
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,581
You could still come with us.

973
00:56:53,648 --> 00:56:56,517
- To Remnant.
- I...

974
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:59,587
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

975
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,490
Diana, this is Weiss.

976
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:04,792
Hi, Weiss,
it's nice to meet you.

977
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,694
I've heard great things
about you.

978
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:10,798
Bruce, their world
isn't your home.

979
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:13,701
We should probably
get back to the others.

980
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:21,342
I have powers
on their world, Diana.

981
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:25,212
I never wanted powers.
I didn't think I needed them.

982
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,581
But on Remnant, I can help.

983
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:30,151
More than I could before.

984
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:33,220
But you do help.

985
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,722
You help on Earth.

986
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,657
You have your own kind
of powers--

987
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:39,794
Maybe with these abilities,
I can do more.

988
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:43,197
I can be like you.

989
00:57:44,999 --> 00:57:46,000
A warrior.

990
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:51,572
Finally!

991
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,908
You figure out
the sequence?

992
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,010
No. But I have
figured out a way

993
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:59,246
to track down these
weird dust-eating Grimm.

994
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:01,716
I've been trying to
work around the CCT.

995
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:04,285
It's like something shut
their whole system down

996
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:05,686
just to run their sequence

997
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,888
and prevent us
from contacting each other.

998
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:10,157
But I think I've finally--

999
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:15,763
A Wyvern
and a Leviathan.

1000
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,098
They'll be killed.

1001
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:19,133
We have to go. Right now.

1002
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:27,975
I know you can do this!

1003
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,511
I know you can get us
out of this, Jessica!

1004
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:33,714
You have to fight this.
For them!

1005
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:38,886
For myself.

1006
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:49,063
In brightest day,

1007
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,698
in blackest night,

1008
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:53,667
no evil shall escape my sight!

1009
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:56,137
Let those who worship
evil's might,

1010
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,772
beware my power...

1011
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,775
Green Lantern's light!

1012
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,252
How's everyone doing?

1013
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:15,923
Finally getting the hang
of this place!

1014
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:24,098
Everyone else?

1015
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,535
Well, could use a coffee break.
Ice cream? Caffeine IV --

1016
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,402
Is... Is that--

1017
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:29,603
Running out of steam.

1018
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:36,310
The Wyvern seem unlimited
in created Grimm.

1019
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:38,446
Is this what
Grimm are normally like?

1020
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:40,281
I mean, they seem weird.

1021
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:45,886
How's Nora?

1022
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:50,091
Let's finish this fight first.

1023
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:57,798
Looks like you guys
could use some help.

1024
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:02,203
- Weiss!
- Huh?

1025
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:04,772
I'm okay, Ruby.

1026
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:06,607
It'll take more than
a temporal displacement

1027
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,409
to keep me away from my team.

1028
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,144
Is that what this is?

1029
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,549
Where's Batman?

1030
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:17,318
Let's take these guys down.

1031
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,668
Lantern!

1032
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:35,870
We've been trying to
get to you!

1033
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:37,238
None of this is real!

1034
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:38,739
It's a virtual reality!

1035
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:40,341
I knew it!

1036
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:41,642
So, who's doing it?

1037
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:45,646
I may have that answer.

1038
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,114
Batman?

1039
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:49,049
So much cooler than I thought.

1040
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:52,621
It's good to see everyone.

1041
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:54,556
You have powers.

1042
01:00:54,623 --> 01:00:58,359
Yeah.
Got me some wings.

1043
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,727
As to who's doing this...

1044
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:03,632
Why don't you answer, Flash?

1045
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:06,667
That... That's why
you smell different.

1046
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,235
Where is my ring?

1047
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,505
Whoa.

1048
01:01:10,572 --> 01:01:13,007
What are you talking about?

1049
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:15,676
Running this world
would take a lot of energy,

1050
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:17,845
even with siphoning dust.

1051
01:01:18,547 --> 01:01:20,114
And Flash...

1052
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:23,284
you've been running slow.
Getting hurt.

1053
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,286
Because you're running
one equation

1054
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:28,088
through all the computers
on this world...

1055
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:33,093
Kilg%re!

1056
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:42,269
It makes sense.

1057
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:43,771
Every time we would
get close to answers,

1058
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:46,006
there would be
a new monster attack!

1059
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:48,309
He created all of this.

1060
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:50,911
What did you do to Barry?

1061
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:57,218
He's in here. Safe and sound.

1062
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,353
Been fun to run around
with you guys

1063
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,556
instead of from you
for a change!

1064
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:04,526
You all think you're so smart,

1065
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:06,093
but you didn't think twice

1066
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,963
about what was going on
with the Scarlet Speedster.

1067
01:02:12,499 --> 01:02:17,304
It was so easy to trip you up
and keep you guessing!

1068
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:19,974
You may think Brainiac
or Vandal Savage

1069
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,742
are smarter than me,

1070
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:25,746
but I have done
what they couldn't.

1071
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:29,817
I have trapped
the Justice League!

1072
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:32,987
And us! Your plan
doesn't make any sense.

1073
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,689
What kind of lame villain
are you?

1074
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:38,425
That's it! You didn't do this
on your own, did you, Kilg%re?

1075
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:41,061
Do you see anyone else here?

1076
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:48,002
I trapped you forever
in this digital world.

1077
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:51,038
I used their precious dust
to power it.

1078
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:56,810
Me, and no one else!

1079
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,622
Then why are you
still here?

1080
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:11,258
That's why you've been running
the sequence on all systems...

1081
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,431
You're trapped, too!

1082
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:24,872
I gave him the idea
to power this realm

1083
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:26,775
with dust from his world.

1084
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,245
This construct was useless
without me!

1085
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:35,449
But I required no payment
for my genius.

1086
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:40,154
I simply asked
to use this place.

1087
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,725
It was a perfect plan,

1088
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:46,126
bring my enemies
into this world,

1089
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:47,928
transform them into teens

1090
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,397
so they would be
at their most vulnerable,

1091
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:53,033
rife with hormones
and insecurities,

1092
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,739
while I watch as this world
ripped you apart!

1093
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,273
And he agreed,

1094
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,408
on the condition that
I trap his enemies as well.

1095
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,547
I digitally
transferred you all here

1096
01:04:05,613 --> 01:04:08,315
and watched you struggle
with all the emotions

1097
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:12,286
your adult selves ignore.
Or repress.

1098
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:14,988
It's been said
I am an electrical wire

1099
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:16,990
short of a full panel.

1100
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:19,993
But you all folded so easily.

1101
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:26,300
You, especially.

1102
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,370
A child pretending
to be a leader.

1103
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:32,507
Delicious.

1104
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,911
Don't listen to him, Ruby.

1105
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:40,914
Leadership isn't
about your age.

1106
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,249
It's about your heart.

1107
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:47,888
You will fail.

1108
01:04:48,857 --> 01:04:50,924
You will freeze.

1109
01:04:52,794 --> 01:04:55,229
But that's what
makes you alive.

1110
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,368
You don't have a way
out of this world

1111
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,705
because whoever
you worked with...

1112
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:05,507
they trapped you here.

1113
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:12,847
- Clark is right.
- Huh?

1114
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,017
I'd follow you into any battle.

1115
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,952
That's what
you got wrong, Kilg%re.

1116
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:22,557
That's what you don't get
about humans.

1117
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:25,025
We're stronger together.

1118
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:26,728
Whoever helped you

1119
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:28,262
- tricked you into doing
what they want.

1120
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,943
You're stuck with us.

1121
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:44,679
Weiss!

1122
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:50,350
Barry! Now!

1123
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:00,929
How did you know that
Barry was awake in there?

1124
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:03,230
I didn't. Until I noticed...

1125
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:08,101
Morse code?

1126
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:09,838
And they call me a boy scout.

1127
01:06:09,904 --> 01:06:11,539
How do we get rid of him?

1128
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:12,406
You can't!

1129
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:22,951
He flew into the Wyvern!

1130
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:25,219
Well, that was unexpected.

1131
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:28,489
I will destroy you!

1132
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:31,024
Vixen? Lantern?

1133
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:34,194
I think these belong to you.

1134
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,731
Glad I arrived just in time
for the final battle.

1135
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:38,700
Let's go.

1136
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:09,724
We're outnumbered!

1137
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,059
We could stand a chance

1138
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:12,961
if we take down Kilg%re
in the dragon!

1139
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:14,762
Wyvern.

1140
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,296
Yeah, well, the last time
we tried to take it down,
it replicated.

1141
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,397
Because Kilg%re
was with you.

1142
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:19,266
But now he's in it.

1143
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,035
And with Kilg%re
controlling it,

1144
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,436
we're banging our head

1145
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:24,606
against a very angry,
very gruesome wall!

1146
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:26,440
If someone could get us
close enough,

1147
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:28,308
Jaune and I
could deconstruct it!

1148
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,277
Take the Wyvern
and Kilg%re apart!

1149
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,581
I can try to open a path, but--

1150
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,550
There are too many Grimm.

1151
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:38,553
You got a plan, kid?

1152
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:44,826
I just might.

1153
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:27,702
Incoming!

1154
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:17,477
Pitiful!

1155
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:19,680
Think we gave them enough time?

1156
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:26,020
You got this, Lantern!

1157
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:28,488
She's right.

1158
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,893
So long as my friends
believe in me.

1159
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:38,900
What are you doing?
No. No!

1160
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:43,004
No!

1161
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:53,648
Good work!

1162
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,051
Hmm.

1163
01:11:57,118 --> 01:11:58,553
Hmm.

1164
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:01,856
Yeah. That's great and all,
but where's Kilg%re?

1165
01:12:01,923 --> 01:12:03,157
Gone.

1166
01:12:03,224 --> 01:12:05,526
His code isn't running through
the world anymore.

1167
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:06,727
Things feel better now.

1168
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:08,930
We didn't completely
destroy him?

1169
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:11,532
We'll track him
down on our world.

1170
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,067
I thought
he was trapped with us.

1171
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:16,704
Well, turns out Jess has
more power than she thought.

1172
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:20,541
That's great.
But how do we get back home?

1173
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:22,944
I think I might have a way.

1174
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,477
And then what?

1175
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:27,081
Are you going to go
with them, or us?

1176
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:31,686
I'm a warrior.

1177
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:33,821
No matter what world I'm in.

1178
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:43,898
Hey, I...
I wanted to...

1179
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:47,335
To say... thank you.

1180
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,238
To the both of you.
I respect you.

1181
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:53,574
There.
That should do it.

1182
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,109
Go ahead, Cyborg.

1183
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,879
It's been an honor.

1184
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:03,885
What he said.

1185
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,119
For me, too.

1186
01:13:06,254 --> 01:13:07,420
You were right.

1187
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,523
It's hard to grow up
under fire.

1188
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:13,294
I forget sometimes. I guess...

1189
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:15,963
I guess that's why we fight.

1190
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,933
It's not just because of
how we grew up.

1191
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,203
It's so no one else
has to grow up like us.

1192
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:25,673
And sometimes
it's just nice to kick ass.

1193
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:33,581
Lantern, you're up.

1194
01:13:58,639 --> 01:13:59,907
There it is.

1195
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,177
Home.

1196
01:14:03,244 --> 01:14:05,980
I don't know how long
I can hold it. Let's go.

1197
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:10,851
I'm sure it was great
meeting all of you.

1198
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:14,055
Sorry about the whole
possession thing.

1199
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,356
So long, gang.

1200
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,624
If you're ever
in the neighborhood,

1201
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,125
you know where to find us!

1202
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:42,650
You know you're still
a kid, right?

1203
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:44,352
Even if it's at heart.

1204
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:45,886
Well, Ruby Rose,

1205
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,955
I don't think it's so bad
being a kid.

1206
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:50,157
Age isn't what makes
a good leader, right?

1207
01:14:50,992 --> 01:14:52,059
Right.

1208
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,728
Thanks for the reminder.

1209
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,496
You're sure you got this?

1210
01:14:56,564 --> 01:14:58,032
I got it.

1211
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,433
Thank you.

1212
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:01,602
Likewise.

1213
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:04,071
All right, guys.
Not much longer.

1214
01:15:04,138 --> 01:15:05,272
Come on, Weiss.

1215
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:20,221
Ruby?

1216
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:21,455
Did anybody else

1217
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:25,459
just have a really
weird experience?

1218
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:29,663
It's, uh,
coming back to me.

1219
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:33,701
That wasn't the training
mission, was it?

1220
01:15:33,768 --> 01:15:35,870
Someone created it.

1221
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:39,206
Someone from our world.
