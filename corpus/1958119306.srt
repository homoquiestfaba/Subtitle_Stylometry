1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,728
- Hey

2
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,089
Hey

3
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,170
Hey

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,525
Hey

5
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,837
- Hello

6
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,545
Oh! Hi, Paul

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,086
- Paul?
- Benny?

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,229
- Yeah...

9
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,633
- How did you get in?

10
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,086
- I'm sorry. I tried to text you you a few times, hm...

11
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,932
Somebody downstairs just let me in.
- Hmm...

12
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:40,274
- I hope you don't mind.
- Right.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,728
-Sorry I missed your texts. Hmm...

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,137
- I'm... I'm Benny.

15
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,275
- Nice to meet you, Paul
- Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,824
- Hey, do you mind slipping your shoes for me?

17
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,054
- Oh, shit!
- Thank you

18
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,906
- Great place you got here by the way.

19
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,074
- Oh, thanks...sshh...

20
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:57,845
Sorry roommate's trying to sleep.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,155
- How can she sleep with this music?

22
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,266
Where can i put my bag?
- Oh cheers, fine.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,921
- Oh yeah, captain!

24
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,340
- Hey, hmm...

25
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,550
do you mind if I toss my phone on the charger?

26
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,260
- Yeah sure. Go for it.

27
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,980
- Wow, what a beautiful knife.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,278
Do you hand wash this?

29
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,322
- No. I don't cook.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,784
- That's a shame

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,297
- Can you just put that down, please? [coughing]

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,377
- Can I go to the bath... [giggling]
-[giggling]

33
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,103
I make you nervous?

34
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,782
- [coughing] A little bit.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
- Can I go to the bathroom?

36
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,987
- Yeah, if you like. Turn around the corner.

37
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,759
- Is this your room?

38
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:22,744
- Yeah

39
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,152
- Yeah

40
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:25,831
- I'll show you now

41
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,829
Oh, we don't need to lock the door

42
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,440
- So you want your roommate barging in on us?

43
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,736
- I'm not surprised that we're in your
bedroom already.

44
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,768
- What do you mean by that?

45
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,829
- Your advances were pretty strong online

46
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,358
That is unless your...

47
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:56,162
your courage is only reserved for the internet.

48
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,949
I'm only fucking with you

49
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,742
- Sorry

50
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,087
Wine was getting the better of me... earlier.

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,622
- Anything else?

52
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,777
- Yeah, it's all right. You don't mind, do you?

53
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,541
I was gonna put that away before you came.

54
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,009
Take those?
- No.

55
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,678
- Give me one sec.

56
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:58,693
[Loud music]

57
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,705
- I completely forgot. I'm so sorry-

58
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,998
- It's okay, just shh...

59
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,683
- He's just gonna kill us

60
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,727
He's just gonna kill us...
- Stay quiet.

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,618
Actually, can I have my glasses back ?

62
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,356
- Oh no, I love these.

63
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,991
- Yeah. I can't see.

64
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,578
- I know. I'm as blind as a bat right now.

65
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,032
- Yeah. Can i just get the fucking glasses back,
please? Thank you!

66
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,242
- Yeah.

67
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,146
- I thought maybe you've left.

68
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,816
- Hi, I'm Paul. It's nice to meet you.

69
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,694
- What's this?

70
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,092
I just figure we could start over

71
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:07,317
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Benny.

72
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,292
- No, you're supposed to say

73
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,328
Hi I'm Benny. It's nice to meet you too.

74
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:12,189
Let's do that again
- All right.

75
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,393
Hi, I'm Paul. It's nice to meet you.

76
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,314
- Benny

77
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,567
- You're supposed to say hi...
I'm Benny

78
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,837
it's nice to meet you
- Yeah, yeah

79
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,449
- So, where're you from Benny?

80
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,439
- Me? I'm from the south.

81
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,399
How about yourself?

82
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,122
- I'm from Yugoslavia

83
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,416
- Yugoslavia?
- Mmm...

84
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,127
- Is that still a place?

85
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,964
- Technically no

86
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,011
- Your parents're still over there?

87
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,138
- My parents?

88
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,016
Why do you ask?

89
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,703
I just wouldn't have guessed
you're from that part of the world

90
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,023
- Why?

91
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:24,709
- No disrespect. I just don't detect much of an accent

92
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,281
Maybe i don't know enough about it though.

93
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:32,017
- People change as much as they want to

94
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,036
just

95
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,812
depends on how badly they want
to get away from something.

96
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,667
- What were you getting away from?

97
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,022
- Your parents're okay with it?

98
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,340
- What's that?

99
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:47,900
- Having boys in your bedroom

100
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,432
- I don't know if they'll ever really
understand it, you know. But...

101
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,142
yeah, they're okay with it.

102
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,979
How about you?

103
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,357
- Oh my god, I love this movie

104
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,194
I can't believe you have this.

105
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,043
But why is it in a plastic wrap?

106
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:10,085
- Oh! It's because I actually haven't seen it.

107
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,916
- That's all?

108
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,911
Hold on. You own this but you haven't seen it?

109
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,122
- Yeah.
- What?

110
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,885
Dude...get to the bank

111
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,250
this is like you having an uncashed check.

112
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,521
It's only the most unexpected
love story of all time

113
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:28,374
- Of all time?
- Yeah

114
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,649
It's a love that survives in spite of it all.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,013
He made it a few years before

116
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,307
he died of a cocaine overdose.

117
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,266
I...

118
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,123
I can't believe you have this setting here.

119
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,443
- You're talking about your parents, I think.

120
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,363
- No. It's strange, isn't it?

121
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,323
- What's up?

122
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,169
- Do you ever think about what else
 is happening right now?

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,538
- What do you mean?

124
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,356
- Like what other things in the world are...

125
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:02,929
are happening at the same time,

126
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,429
same time as us in this room right now.

127
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,421
- Why does it matter?

128
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,691
- Oh, I don't know. I...

129
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,407
I guess it's just something to think about.

130
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,411
Like take for example our parents.

131
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,840
How old is your dad?

132
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,391
- Almost 60.

133
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,052
- Almost 60? Same as mine.

134
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,413
- They're so much alike

135
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,733
- You see, your dad was planning his 401k

136
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,599
and shopping for cruise lines with your mom.

137
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,029
At the same time, my dad
was planning his great escape.

138
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,005
And see, that's where I come from.

139
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,617
They were, they were managing their own unions

140
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,070
along with other unhappy dads

141
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,215
while the rest of the world was telling them no, no!

142
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,596
You have to adapt, you have to adapt, you have to adapt

143
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,749
You have to adapt, you have to adapt, you have to adapt

144
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,730
So they had this this pent up rage and this...

145
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,462
this this anger, this...

146
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,298
this, this piercing voice in the back of their head

147
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,003
 telling them to to take it out the last shout

148
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,511
 so every night they'd beat their wives

149
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,055
 and beat out their neighbors and
 can even hit their gay sons.

150
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:57,806
- Shh...
-What?

151
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:59,506
- My roommate's trying to sleep
- Oh

152
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,865
- That's fine. She might mind their own  business

153
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,063
- Excuse me

154
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:09,625
- Shit!... Hmm...
- Fuck

155
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,236
- Hmm... are you okay. You need some...

156
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,487
- I think I did too much blow

157
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,030
- Can I get you a towel?

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,183
- Uh yeah, just in that closet there

159
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,828
- Okay, whatever's on the ground
-  Sure, uh...

160
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,663
- What will this do?

161
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,161
- Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

162
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,868
- You're pretty lucky I'm here

163
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:26,935
- It's okay

164
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:32,313
- Relax, hey, okay, it's okay

165
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,738
- All right. I think it's stopping

166
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,146
- You need some help?
- No. I'm fine, thanks.

167
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,366
- You know, I used to get those all the time as a kid

168
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,403
- What the fuck are you doing?

169
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,840
- Having fun

170
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,342
Yeah,  hey!
- No, no, I...

171
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,745
I think we just need to brain check this.

172
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,210
Let's call it.

173
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,106
-  Hey seriously, if it's the nose thing I'm totally fine

174
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,241
- No...
- If it's the glass...

175
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,126
- It's not the nose thing, it' just...

176
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:53,089
I'm tired and I... think we got it with
the wrong foot,

177
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,769
 so let's just...let's just call the night.

178
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,175
- Oh come on. Pick another dvd

179
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,596
- Hey listen, listen...
- This one's still in its...

180
00:11:58,596 --> 00:11:59,723
- Like I said,

181
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,977
not tonight

182
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,555
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:12,941
What are you doing?

184
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,863
- I'm sorry,

185
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,532
but I have to be honest with you.

186
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,097
I really don't feel like leaving.

187
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,714
I'm so sorry. It's one of those things.

188
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,584
- What? Try again another time if you want

189
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,240
All right man, come on!

190
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,141
Come on!

191
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:45,918
All right man, take it easy.

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,935
- I'm sorry captain

193
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,107

194
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,294
- Oh... oh...

195
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,712
Stop

196
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,704
- Relax, you can handle it, captain.

197
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,751
- Okay, stop! Stop! Stop!

198
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,230
All right man. This is getting fucking weird. Just...

199
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,892
just go, all right?

200
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:31,766
- I thought we were having fun

201
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,291
- Paul, I know what's not getting through to you.

202
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,295
Please get the fuck out of my house

203
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,693
- Benny come on. It's freezing outside.

204
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,570
- I don't give a damn

205
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:44,108
Okay, look Paul

206
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,159
If you're not gonna go, I'm gonna call the fucking cops, all right?

207
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,220
I'm not gonna ask you again
- Hey, come on...

208
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:51,633
Don't do this.

209
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,959
Haven't you got it about this point?
I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,605
- All right. You know what?

211
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,775
- Hey

212
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,741
Hey

213
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,755
