1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Subject: Documentation
of inventions by Sid Lidz...

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,176
random samples, 1951-1962.

3
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,646
Test Number 75.
July 5, 1951.

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,218
Note: Bottle showed
excellent resistance...

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,219
to percussive impact from
1.1 kilogram stone. That's me talking.

6
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,425
Subject was next given bottle
to receive delivery of fluids. However...

7
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,096
My dad's an inventor by trade.

8
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,331
He believes in the purity
and power of science.

9
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,332
He would say there was nothing broken
that science couldn't fix.

10
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,213
Like the time he spent
an entire weekend...

11
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,214
making me a flying
purple people eater costume
without eye holes...

12
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,487
because he insisted
flying purple people eaters...

13
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,488
would have sensory antenna,
and not eyes.

14
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,093
...tested by Steven Lidz,
age seven.

15
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,494
Note: Subject was initially
pleased with the appearance
and performance of costume.

16
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,599
However, a minor slippage of mirror
within periscopic antenna...

17
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,903
obscured subject's
peripheral vision, resulting
in non-injury accident.

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,007
Thanks to Mom,
future development of
this prototype was abandoned.

19
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,792
Test Number 211, May 8, 1958.
Perpetual motion baby jumper.

20
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,865
Subject: Sandy Lidz,
age 22 months.

21
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,033
My dad believes
in documentation...

22
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,034
and recording the details
and progress of our lives.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,138
...resulted in
seizure of right fly wheel.
Subject was uninjured.

24
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,756
Test Number 175.
May 15, 1957.

25
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,162
Mild monsoon sprinkler system.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,731
Subject: Selma's rose garden

27
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,966
Note: Slow motion
macrophotography..

28
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,967
reveals even distribution
of droplets from watering heads.

29
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,104
Timed diurnal cycles should
produce significant increase
in plant growth.

30
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,108
Invention performed
according to specifications.
The gardener...

31
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,046
Even accidents
are important to document...

32
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,047
like when Mom got too close
to Dad's sprinkler system...

33
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,050
and Dad said he had recorded
a serendipitous phenomenon:

34
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,820
the similarity between
two American beauties...

35
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,124
- the red rose...
and my mom, Selma Lidz.

36
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,281
Test Number 319. May 5, 1962.
Domedary...

37
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,984
Dad said science
was the only heroic path.

38
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,086
Of course,
his brothers didn't agree.

39
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,087
Uncle Danny and Uncle Arthur
had their own paths.

40
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,157
But it annoyed Dad too much
to talk about them.

41
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:52,094
It was Mom who told me
a hero is anybody who finds
his own way through this life.

42
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,665
She told me this would be
the year I'd find mine.

43
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,737
Someday I'll invent a camera
that'll last more than 30 seconds.

44
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,909
Are your eyes closed?
Okay. Happy birthday, honey.

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,910
Okay, here we go.
Happy birthday.

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,818
A tent?

47
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,153
Now' the entire operation
is controlled by this remote...

48
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,154
which includes a surprise feature
which we'll discuss in a moment.

49
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,791
- But before surprise comes what?
- I have no idea.

50
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,161
Safety! In the event the remote
doesn't work which it will...

51
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,167
and you're trapped inside
and there's an emergency...

52
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,236
and you need
to evacuate immediately...

53
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,237
you can do so manually
through this entrance way all right?

54
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,042
Come over here.
Sit on the bed.

55
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,043
Selma... watch this!

56
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,346
- I thought I was getting
a Kodak Instamatic 500.
- Yeah, an Instamatic 500.

57
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,917
- Your dad had a brainstorm.
- I want to show you
the surprise feature.

58
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,389
- Go over to your dad.
- Do I have to?

59
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,390
Come on' Steven.
Come over here quick,
quick, quick! Come on in.

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,495
Watch!

61
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,496
Now, sit on the bed.
Hold on. Okay.
Ready?

62
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,033
Damn it! Why isn't
this thing working?
Get the light projector.

63
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,805
- The what?
- The light projector!
Right here. Come on, grab it.

64
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:11,303
That's it. Come on.
Just give it... Give it
a hard tap underneath.

65
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,067
Oh! Oh!

66
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:17,069
- Oh, damn. Sid.
- That's it. I blew
the whole house out.

67
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,801
Steven, begin
emergency evacuation.

68
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,435
# The other night #

69
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,735
# As I lay sleepin' #

70
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:35,602
# Ooh, I dreamed
I held you #

71
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,036
# Held you in my arms #

72
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,635
# Oh, but when I awoke
this mornin' #

73
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,936
# Found out I was mistaken #

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,503
# Do you know that
I hung my head #

75
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,702
# Hung my head and cried #

76
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,766
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

77
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,571
# You told me once, yeah
that you really loved me #

78
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:05,002
- # Don't eat the strawberries #
- # I want the strawberries
it's my birthday#

79
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,332
Whoo!

80
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,667
- Whoo!
- # Could ever come between #

81
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,135
Whoo! Yeah!

82
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,802
- # You left me # Whoo!
- # You left me #

83
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:19,170
- Hey, first batch, Sid!
- Dad, pancakes!

84
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:23,069
- # You have shattered #
- Steven, get the record.

85
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,334
It's gonna skip.

86
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,669
- # You are my sunshine #
- Excuse me. That should do it.

87
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:34,204
You know what Spinoza says:
The only graceful form
is that of the circle.

88
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:39,470
- Then again, he never met you.
Steven, turn out the lights.

89
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,168
All right,
here we go!

90
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:46,535
Blast off.
Ha-ha!

91
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,634
- There's Saturn.
- Yeah, there's Saturn.

92
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,368
See? look on the
frigidaire over there.

93
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,301
Wow!

94
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,436
Look at that shooting star.
It's kinda neat.

95
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,667
Look at all those!

96
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,568
Ooh, look at
the wishing star up there!

97
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,034
Oh, yeah.

98
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,867
- How was your day?
- It was pretty good. How was yours?

99
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,435
Yeah.

100
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,868
- Look, there's Venus.
- Where?

101
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,468
Right over there.

102
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:23,502
Daddy, how many stars
are there, anyways?

103
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:27,569
That's a stellar question.
But to be able to answer that...

104
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:30,801
- you have to know the highest number.
- What is the highest number?

105
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,603
Well, since time and space
are unbounded...

106
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,601
everything starts
with nothing.

107
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,169
Naturally, nothing begins
and nothing ends...

108
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,667
and nothing can be
created out of nothing.

109
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:46,703
As Socrates says,
"As for me, all I know
is that I'm nothing."

110
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,336
- Sid, just answer the question.
- I'm getting to it. First I'll
need to explain basic algebra.

111
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,437
Let's define the limit
that a function "F" approaches
at "X" equals "A"...

112
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,601
- Sid.
- Dad.

113
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,600
Infinity.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,803
I know you're
disappointed, but we'll get you
a camera next year, kiddo.

115
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,202
You have to admit,
you're the only kid on the block
with one of these.

116
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,900
Mom, is Dad
from another planet?

117
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,902
- Who told you that?
- The kids say it at school.

118
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,336
Oh! Well...
he could be.

119
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,734
Although if I were
from another planet...

120
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,635
I don't think
I'd choose Roseman Avenue
as my place to land.

121
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,934
Does it bother you
what they say?

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,336
Well, yeah.
I mean...

123
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,534
Listen,
you are getting older.

124
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,767
And it's probably time
that you know.

125
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,034
What?

126
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,600
- Your dad...
- Yeah?

127
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,268
- Your dad's a genius.
- A genius?

128
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,635
And most people
don't understand that.

129
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,202
So... you shouldn't care if
they laugh or say mean things,
you know?

130
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,468
- You should just be proud of him
like he's proud of you.
- He is?

131
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:57,101
Oh, God,
of course he is!

132
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,967
Give me a hug.
Good night, birthday boy. Mmm.

133
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:04,703
Sweet dreams.
Okay, let's see if this thing
really works.

134
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,634
- Wait. Hey, Mom?
- Yeah, what, baby?

135
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:13,769
Mom, remember when I told you
I was thinking of running
for class president?

136
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,136
- Sure I do!
-Well, I don't think I will now.

137
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,734
Why not? Gosh,
I thought that was
such a terrific idea.

138
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,203
- No one's gonna vote for me.
- Gosh, how do you know until
you give yourself a chance?

139
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,034
- You know, I mean,
we can make posters...
- No.

140
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,869
- And your dad, your dad
could write speeches.
- No, wait, what if I lose?

141
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,536
- I mean, I'll be humiliated?
- So what if you lose?
Who cares? Big deal.

142
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,568
Look at Adlai Stevenson.
He ran for president twice,
and he didn't win.

143
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,034
- Do you think he was embarrassed?
- Yes.

144
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:43,435
Oh. Well...

145
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,101
Look, kiddo, I'm sure
you'll work it out.

146
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:49,968
- Your hands smell good.
- Oh, thanks.

147
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:51,933
It's a new lotion I used.
It's Avon.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,970
It's a little more expensive
but what the hell?
Live dangerously, right?

149
00:09:57,232 --> 00:10:00,635
- I have pretty hands, don't you think?
- Yeah.

150
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:05,036
- Do I have your hands?
- I don't know. Let me see.

151
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,167
Hmm.

152
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,667
You know,
I think you do.

153
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,335
Mmm.

154
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
Good night, sweetie.

155
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:19,334
- Good night, Mom.
- Happy birthday.

156
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:30,002
Now the first thing
we have to do is make two lists.

157
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,802
One list you call
"possible ideas."

158
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,902
The other list,
"available materials."

159
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,901
Let's go!

160
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,235
For instance.
Possible ideas
for your election speech:

161
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:44,168
let's say,
benefits of integrating schools.

162
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:47,202
Available materials:
School buses
the national guard.

163
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,402
Number two. How about
winning the space race?

164
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,303
Possible idea:
School science olympics.

165
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,801
Now, available materials.
What would they be?
They would be what?

166
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,268
The NASA surplus electronics,
recycled jet parts...

167
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,269
- I don't know, Dad.
- What? What? Now, get...

168
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,536
Hey! What are you doing
with those? Stop playing.
It's not a toy.

169
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,968
No one at school
cares about that stuff.

170
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,068
What kid isn't interested
in space exploration?

171
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:13,901
- Well... none of them.
- I don't believe that.

172
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,935
What about
the Venus Mariner?
They're launching next fall.

173
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,668
It's going to take pictures
of a planet millions
of miles away.

174
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:22,734
It takes my breath away.
It's unbelievable
what great minds can do.

175
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,268
Steven, my papers!
Steven

176
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,202
- Steven, now come on.
- I'm sorry.

177
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,401
You know you're not supposed
to do that, Steven!

178
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:34,069
Steven,
you have no idea...

179
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,567
what an extraordinary time
you're living in.

180
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:40,469
- When I was your age, I went
to see the 1939 World's Fair.
- The 1939 World's Fair.

181
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:43,701
I told you the story.
All right. But it changed
the way I saw things.

182
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:48,236
It affected my entire life.
I saw the future,
a technotopian future.

183
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,302
There were these dioramas
of these gigantic buildings,
I don't know, 500 stories.

184
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:53,934
And all these monorails
that... vroom!

185
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:56,401
That ran around
200 miles an hour,
they transported people.

186
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:01,604
The frontiers of science
and medicine predicted
an end to all disease.

187
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,634
And how a man's life span
will soon be 100 years.

188
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,435
That's why I said everything
can always be broken down
into numbers.

189
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,570
I tell you that science,
pure science, will be earth's
ultimate salvation, right?

190
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,368
And all because of what
we can think of with this.

191
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:19,636
What's going on
down there?

192
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,967
- I... oh!
- Selma?

193
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,767
- Oh, God, Sid.
- Selma?

194
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,900
- I don't know what happened. I was...
- Okay, hold on to me.

195
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:28,001
- I was nauseous
and the room started spinning.
- Can you get up?

196
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:32,703
Steven, run downstairs
open the phone book to "F."
Look for Dr. Feldman's number.

197
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,267
Are you okay?
Call him quickly!

198
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,268
Are you all right?

199
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,535
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Can you focus?

200
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,335
- I'm just sick.
- Your hands feel cold.
Let me take your pulse.

201
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,769
Stop it!

202
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,900
Stop it!

203
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:54,169
What the...

204
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:58,300
- Daddy, Daddy?
- What?

205
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:01,035
This is no fun.
When's Mommy gonna wake up?

206
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:04,669
Soon, honey.
She needs sleep to get better.

207
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,700
Wait, we're not gonna
leave her here, are we?

208
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,167
No, she has to stay
for a little while.
She has to take some tests.

209
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,035
- We'll come back tomorrow.
- What's wrong with her?

210
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,135
She has a very bad cold,
okay? Now go.

211
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,670
- You guys go on. I'll be
right with you, okay?
- All right.

212
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,501
Hold the microphone higher.

213
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:59,668
The point is to have
the sound precisely
synchronized to the image.

214
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:03,102
Hi, Mark. Hi, Shirley.
Why don't you help me test it
by asking some questions?

215
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,068
All right, hey!
Hi!

216
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:08,167
Hi!

217
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,635
- You look 100% better.
- At least.

218
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,268
- 200%. Eat.
- A latke with some nice applesauce.

219
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,468
- Or maybe some applesauce?
A small dish.
- Well...

220
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:18,568
- I'll put it in a dessert bowl.
-Joanie, she doesn't want it.
What difference does it make?

221
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:23,203
Sandy, hurry up.
Uncle Melvin wants
to ask you a question.

222
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:28,404
Sandy, come on over here.
Come and give Uncle Melvin
a nice sweet kiss.

223
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,701
Sandy, tell Uncle Melvin
what's the highest number.

224
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:34,034
- Eleven?
- No. Remember,
Daddy told you the
highest number, I taught you?

225
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,502
- I don't know. Can I go get my dolly?
- Go right ahead.

226
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,901
- Bright kid you got there, Sidney.
- Yeah? What's the highest number?

227
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:44,402
Six thousand. You want
to know why? That's
what in my bank account.

228
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,937
Are you really
taking this with real sound
or synchronized sound?

229
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,569
- Yes. That's the way you do it.
- Hey, Dad?
It's Uncle Arthur.

230
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,266
Arthur.

231
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,769
Hi, Arthur. Hi.
How're you doin'?

232
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,134
- Oh, good. Hello, Sidney.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

233
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,534
Oh, good. I brought
something for you.

234
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,034
Oh, yeah?
Great.

235
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,635
- What is it?
- It's a series of leaves.

236
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:15,368
- Oh, with a stick through them, yeah.
- Yeah. To old 'em together.

237
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,902
Thanks.
Where's Danny?

238
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:35,603
- Hey, Danny.
What's goin' on?
-We were followed.

239
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:40,136
Arthur can vouch for this.
Two men in gray overcoats
and hats are on our tail.

240
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,435
But we were too quick
for them.

241
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,870
I specifically chose
a more difficult bus route
going in the opposite direction.

242
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,734
Then we got off near
Hancock Park. Shook 'em.

243
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,370
Oh, I'm sure everyone in
this room has been monitored!
Someone might even be bugged!

244
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:58,370
- Oh, if you can hear me,
just know that I'm on to you.
- Oh! Stop, please.

245
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,468
Oh, my God, Selma.
You look like death!

246
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:02,901
You have absolutely no color.
It's frightening.

247
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,301
Why don't you go
and get some air...

248
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,468
instead of sitting inside
with these phony,
miserable bastards?

249
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,134
- Sid!
- Danny!

250
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,267
- What is it with this schmuck
all the time?
- I heard that.

251
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,103
- Good!
- N-N-N-N-N-Now, let's not have a scene.

252
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,236
We're here for a nice visit.
So why don't we just have
a nice visit?

253
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:23,869
- Arthur, a latke.
- Oh, thank you.

254
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:26,901
Look, be careful!
She probably fried 'em
in hemlock.

255
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,234
Arthur...

256
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,735
did anybody ever tell you
you have a crackpot putz
for a brother?

257
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,334
- No.
-You are an unmarried
slave trader.

258
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,302
I work for a modeling
agency, you maniac.

259
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,668
And I happen to be seeing
someone at the moment.

260
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,633
Yes, an Eisenhower Nazi!

261
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,968
- Uh-oh.
- Eisenhower was one
of our finest presidents!

262
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:48,566
Here we go.

263
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,301
The man was a Jew-hater!
"I like Ike."

264
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,634
A secret gentile code
for "I hate kikes."

265
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,468
- Anyone with half a brain
would know that.
- That leaves you out.

266
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,400
I hardly think you should be
smoking a marijuana cigarette
in your condition.

267
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:01,268
- Marijuana? What?
- What? I am not!

268
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,202
- Oh, you don't think I know
slurred speech when I hear it?
- Oh, shoot!

269
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,668
Let's see now.
"Danny's coming over.
I need marijuana."

270
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,334
No, I thought, "Danny's
comin' over. I need a gun!"

271
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,400
Sid, could you put your camera
down and please come with me?

272
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:13,801
- Danny, do me a favor.
Please stop being so abrasive.
- Now, now, now, now...

273
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,768
let's not forget
we're a family,
for better or for worse.

274
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,601
In any family,
there are problems,
there are disagreements.

275
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,035
There are good people...
and there are demented schmucks
who are not welcome!

276
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,602
- You're a pox on the Jewish race.
- You are a pox period!

277
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:30,735
- I can't believe you called me a pox.
- Ohh!

278
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,270
Everybody, calm down. I'll start
the coffee. I'll get the cups
and cake and start the coffee.

279
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,903
Ioanie, why do
you have to say everything
six different ways?

280
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,235
You wanna make coffee,
go make coffee!
Say it once!

281
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,336
- Make the damn come!
- Stop yelling at her, Mel.

282
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,901
I found something for you.

283
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,969
- What is it?
- It's a special remedy
to get rid of your itching.

284
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:12,570
- You just rub it right on the area.
- I don't have any itching, Arthur.

285
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,035
Danny had mentioned
that something
was irritating you.

286
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:20,169
Something is irritating me.
If I rub it in Danny,
will he go away?

287
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:25,338
I'm not sure. Uh, eh...
you'd have to read the label
under "other uses."

288
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,568
It's very thoughtful, Arthur.
Thank you.

289
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,468
Could I have
the wrapping back?

290
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:49,001
"And when confronting problems
any class leader must face...

291
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:52,369
"I promise to show
the resilience of Adlai Stevenson...

292
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,235
who refused to take no
for an answer... twice."

293
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,868
Okay, this is
the conclusion.
Okay?

294
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,601
"And I pledge to do
my utmost to represent...

295
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:05,102
the interests of my fellow
classmates during these
dark and troubled times."

296
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,269
- What troubled times?
- Well, you know.

297
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,103
The Cold War.
The possibility of
a nuclear doomsday.

298
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,169
Don't you think, maybe,
you should lighten it up
just a little bit?

299
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,501
Oh, well, yeah.
Well, here, I have a joke,
okay?

300
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,834
Just tell me if you think
this is funny.
I think it is, really.

301
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,836
Okay, "In addition,
I hope to change cafeteria
restrictions...

302
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:30,403
thereby enforcing
every student's right
to due process of slaw!"

303
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,768
That's good!

304
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:35,935
You know, if you lose
the election, we could book you
on the Ed Sullivan Show.

305
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,434
Yeah, well, I-I better go,
'cause, you know,
I gotta get there.

306
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,969
Remember 2:00.
You should get there
by 1:30 for a good seat.

307
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,000
What's happening at 2:00?

308
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:46,402
Sid, my doctor's appointment's
not 'til 4:00, so I thought
maybe if I'm feeling better...

309
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,802
- Absolutely not.
It's out of the question.
- What?

310
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,235
Steven, your mother
has a doctor's appointment.
We don't want her overdoing it.

311
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,234
She's still very much
under the weather.

312
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,134
She's been resting for weeks!
You have to come.

313
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:59,635
- Oh, Sid.
- No.
- What about me?

314
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,069
You're the ones who told me
to do this, and now you're
not showing up. Just great.

315
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:07,669
And if there is one thing
that I learned from
Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy...

316
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:11,001
it's that
in spite of all the glamour
of running for office...

317
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,835
it is not
a popularity contest.

318
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,701
Which is why it doesn't bother
me when people say...

319
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:22,570
"But, Nancy Oppenheim
your initials are N.O."
Because I say Y.E.S.!

320
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:24,867
As you can tell,
I will represent...

321
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,602
this seventh grade class
to the best of my abilities...

322
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,666
and to honor our fine tradition
by insuring...

323
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:35,269
all of Herbert Hoover
junior high rules are enforced,
and enforced fairly.

324
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,169
Go H.H.J.H.!

325
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:49,138
I'd like to thank Nancy.
That was a well-written speech...

326
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,734
and well-executed.

327
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:55,405
And our next speaker
is Steven Lidz.

328
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,469
Are you all right?

329
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:14,472
Yeah... I'm fine.

330
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,102
Hello. My name is Steven Lidz.

331
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,870
- Um... many of you
don't know me very well.

332
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,203
I don't blame you
if you don't vote for me.
Thank you.

333
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,135
Thank you, Steven.

334
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,938
That was... concise,
and humble.

335
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:11,373
Right from the heart.
And our last speaker
is Ralph Crispi.

336
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,434
Yeah!

337
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:22,703
Thank you, Mrs. Kantruitz.

338
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:27,037
Now, I'm not just going
to stand here and make a
lot of promises like Nancy...

339
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:30,137
or let you off the hook
like Steven.

340
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,368
By the way, thanks, Steven.

341
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,904
- I'm just going to explain
why I'm the best choice.
- Excuse me.

342
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:39,271
Our class needs a strong,
powerful leader to ask...

343
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:42,070
not... what we can do
for Herbert Hoover...

344
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:46,506
but what Herbert Hoover can do for us!

345
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,605
You'll need someone
available and prepared
24 hours a day.

346
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,536
Not someone who's taking
time out for a cigarette
in the bathroom...

347
00:22:56,601 --> 00:23:00,271
or someone you can't
even understand when he talks.

348
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,869
You'll need someone
who's there looking after
your best interests.

349
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,236
- We need...
- fascist smear monger!

350
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,269
- Who said that?
- I did!

351
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,537
And I think that boy
is a Hitler-in-the-making.

352
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:14,303
- That's my son
you're talking about.
- Meet Hitler's father.

353
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:17,737
Who the hell is this nut?
And what is he doing
in this school?

354
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,036
Gentlemen, please.
This assembly
is for the students.

355
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:24,805
And it is their participation
we are seeking in this
democratic process.

356
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:27,237
How can you let some
snot-nosed, spoiled brat
like that get up there...

357
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,171
and soil the minds of
these children with slanderous
and humiliating insinuations?

358
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,636
- Where are the issues?
- This is outrageous!

359
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:37,437
- The issues?
- I demand the
immediate withdrawal...

360
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,470
of this junior Joe McCarthy's
name from the nominating ballot.

361
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:45,105
And I further demand
an immediate roll call for
a new ballot to be implemented.

362
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,402
Thank you, Mr. Chairman!

363
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,335
- Mom!
- Yes, baby?

364
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,168
- Hey, Mom?
- What, sweet?

365
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:56,105
Mom, did you know that Idaho
means Jew-hater in Cherokee?

366
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,736
- Who told you that?
- Uncle Danny.

367
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:03,472
He also says that there are
only eight trustworthy people
in the entire world.

368
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,003
There used to be 12,
but four got assassinated.

369
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,503
If I die, Danny, I swear
I'm taking you with me.

370
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:12,137
Hey, Mom, he also said that
he has 27 bona fide sources...

371
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,236
but he can't reveal who they are
because he took an oath.

372
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,602
Who took an oath?
What are you saying?

373
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,302
- Uncle Danny.
- Danny? You saw Danny today?

374
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,936
- Yeah, you brought him
to the assembly, remember?
- Oh, right.

375
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,737
Dad, you shoulda seen what
he did to Ralph. He called
him a fascist smear monger...

376
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:29,271
- And a Hitler in the making.
- Here, honey. It says it
should be ingested with food...

377
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:33,604
but I think if I pulverized
two tablets and dissolve them
into a low pH liquid...

378
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,935
it'll enter your bloodstream
more rapidly.

379
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,370
Selma, are you all right?

380
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:44,403
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

381
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,903
- Wh-Why don't I go get
some Chinese tonight?
- No, I can make something else.

382
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:51,237
- Maybe we're pushing.
- Okay? No, no.
I just got a little dizzy.

383
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,036
- I've been laying down too damn much!
- I thought we decided about this.

384
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,870
- What the hell difference does it make?
- What do you mean, what difference?

385
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,236
- Didn't you read about
the dangers of cigarettes?
- Yes. I read the article...

386
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,802
- and I rolled it up and I smoked it.
- Selma, I swear to God.

387
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,836
-Just leave me alone.
- Mom, what's going on?

388
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,402
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

389
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:08,169
Okay, let's go.

390
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:11,470
We're going out
to get some egg fooyung.

391
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,535
- I hate egg fooyung.
- I hate eggs.

392
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:17,805
Yeah, that's great.
We'll be back in five minutes.
Ten.

393
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:23,670
- But I don't like eggs.
- Oh, don't say that.

394
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:28,705
- We made them special.
We love eggs!
- Who's we?

395
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,102
They're good for us.
Builds muscle.

396
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:35,104
I can't eat them.
They look like snot.
Especially the left one.

397
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:39,704
Good morning, Mr. Lidz.
We're just throwing away
your daughter's breakfast.

398
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:43,237
She says it looks
like something
that came out of her nose.

399
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,736
- Who's we?
Daddy, do I have to eat these?

400
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:49,737
Dr. Feldman, hello, hello.
Thanks for calling back.

401
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,236
Who's she?

402
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,503
I'm sorry to bother you
again, but I was just
reading an article...

403
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:57,969
in the recent
Harvard Medical Journal
regarding blood testing...

404
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:01,737
for capsular sarcoma,
and it says...

405
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:04,436
Well, let me
just tell you.

406
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:08,037
Well, you might have missed
this article, hmm?

407
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:12,238
It says that 3%
of diagnosed ovarian cancers
can be benign...

408
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,202
- if the patient has a history of...
- Dad?

409
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,202
- Who's that lady?
- I know.

410
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:20,169
I know. Yes, I know hers
is not capsular...

411
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:23,403
but don't you think
it's worth checking,
just in case?

412
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:26,303
- Why not?
- Dad, who's that lady?

413
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:30,370
- Dad?
-Why the hell not?
Labs can make mistakes!

414
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:32,402
Dad?

415
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,402
Dr. Feldman, do not
talk to me like I'm
one of your patients.

416
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,535
I happen to be in the
business of experimentation...

417
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:40,738
and I damn well know
that not every test result
is exactly...

418
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:44,104
I'm not yelling!
I am not yelling!

419
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,202
I am... Hold on, hold on.
Steven, where're you going?

420
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:49,637
- T-To see Mom.
- No.

421
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,970
- You leave her alone.
She's resting.
- But...

422
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:56,537
I don't think a suggestion
to reevaluate the situation
is inappropriate.

423
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,870
- Well, perhaps another doctor
might feel differently.
- Dad? But, Dad...

424
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,636
Who's that lady in the kitchen?

425
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:05,802
Oh, that's Amelia.

426
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:09,137
She's gonna be taking care
of things around the house
until your mother feels better.

427
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,370
And I want you to stay out
of your mom's room.
She doesn't need you kids...

428
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:17,271
- bothering her all day
with every little problem.
- I'm not bothering her.

429
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:25,437
Stop it. Stop it!

430
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,769
She's vacuuming.

431
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:32,104
No, no, wait.
She stopped.

432
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,570
She's picking up something.

433
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,570
Okay, it's something shiny.
She put it in her pocket.

434
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:41,636
I think it's a quarter.
She found it, and she took it.

435
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,403
She found the quarter
and she took it.

436
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,969
Wait, she took it.
She, she's stealing.

437
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:49,436
I don't believe it!

438
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:54,105
That was my quarter when
I came home sick from school
and didn't use my milk money.

439
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:57,737
And sat down
and watched television,
and it fell outta my pocket.

440
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,503
- Quiet, she's gonna hear you.
- I was too sick to pick it up,
and then I forgot about it.

441
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,102
- We have to tell Dad.
- No, no, no.

442
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:07,771
- We have to!
- No, no. He'll never believe us.
We need documentation.

443
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,502
Hurry up, come on,
she's coming.

444
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,436
- I don't want to. How do you
know if she's here or not?
-Just drop it.

445
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,536
Drop it. I see her.
Just... come on, drop it.

446
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,870
She's picking it up.

447
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:43,504
Yes, we got her now.
Let's go.

448
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,269
Thanks for coming by.

449
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,437
I assure you, everything's
being done that can be done.

450
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,736
At this point,
I have no reason to
disagree with Dr. Feldman.

451
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,503
That's very... Yeah.

452
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:01,937
If he smiles at us,
she's getting better.

453
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,069
If he looks angry,
things are getting worse.

454
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:06,904
- Please call me. There's no charge.
- Thanks very much.

455
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:21,370
What if he looks
like he always looks?

456
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:18,504
Aah! Look, why don't
we study in our room?

457
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,203
Because my desk
isn't big enough,
and I have finals today.

458
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,036
Well, hurry up
and eat your breakfast
or you'll miss the bus.

459
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,236
The bus doesn't come
for half an hour.

460
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,703
- I can't eat these!
- Why not?

461
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:34,570
They look like doody cakes!
Mommy lets me make my own.

462
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:38,871
We're not making anything,
and you're not leaving the table
until you eat every bite.

463
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:42,003
All right, all right,
give me that!
All right, that's...

464
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:46,203
Young lady!
All right, all right!
All right!

465
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:50,104
Turn this... Oh! Oh!
Sandra! Sandy!

466
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:58,938
That's it!
Young lady, you clean up
this mess right now!

467
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:00,669
You're not our mother!
You just work here.

468
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,735
And once our father finds out
that you've been stealing...

469
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,769
- that won't be for long.
- Stealing?

470
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:09,305
- Yes, stealing.
- I've never stolen a nickel
in my life!

471
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,536
- It was a quarter.
- And I've got the proof
on film.

472
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,638
How... dare you!

473
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:22,573
I am doing the best I can
to try to keep this house
in order...

474
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:27,071
taking on much more
responsibility than was
first described to me!

475
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,137
And with no extra pay,
I might add.

476
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,102
I should think the two of you
could try to be
of a little more help...

477
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,102
what with your mother
dying upstairs.

478
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,868
What?

479
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:40,103
Well, I mean...
I...

480
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,168
She is not dying.

481
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,937
- I just think the two
of you could try to be...
- She's not dying.

482
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:49,571
- It's not too much to ask
for more cooperation from you.
- She's not dying.

483
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:53,337
You understand me?
Steven! Steven!

484
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,536
You open this door right now.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not playing.

485
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:00,071
- Steven Lidz!
- I'm scared. I'm scared.

486
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:04,272
- Shh, shh, quiet.
- Steven Lidz. Open this door, Steven.

487
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,936
Steven, immediately.
All right.

488
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,469
- I'll go check.
- No, don't.

489
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,503
- Yes.
- Don't go.

490
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:26,670
Aah! Help!

491
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,802
- No!
-You come outta there, both of you!

492
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:31,537
I want to talk to you
right now! Out!

493
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:35,204
- What did I tell you?
- I want to address
a few things with you.

494
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:39,136
Amelia just quit.

495
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,201
She was a bad lady.
She told a lie.

496
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:44,536
- What lie?
- She said Mommy's dying.

497
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,335
Mom?

498
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:54,804
Mom?

499
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:56,976
Hey, Lidz,
you too good to put your trash
out with everybody else?

500
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:59,940
I want the junk outta here!
Do you understand that?

501
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:03,275
I'll tell you what.
I'll call the fire department.

502
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:05,606
I'll call everybody
at city hall.

503
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:09,509
This is my building.
My building, Lidz.
You understand that?

504
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:14,810
You hear me in there?
I'm sick and tired of it.
I work hard!

505
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,641
You make me nuts!

506
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:24,541
I'll get them outta here.
I'll run them right the hell
outta here.

507
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,740
Uncle Arthur?

508
00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:54,107
Uncle Danny, please?

509
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,307
I never get any quiet
around here,
for crying out loud. Hey!

510
00:36:57,372 --> 00:37:01,509
- Hey, kid, get over here!
- Let me in!

511
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:04,608
- You're involved in this too, huh?
- Steven!

512
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:07,408
- What are you doing here?
- Let me in!

513
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:09,774
- All right, come on. Come on.
- Come here! Hey!

514
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,808
Ow! Ow!

515
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:14,573
- Come here!
- Uncle Danny!

516
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,740
What are you doin' there?
Hey, come over here! Hey!

517
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:20,975
- All right! All right!
- Hey! Hey, Lidz, open that door!

518
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:25,642
- Open that door! Look, you two.
- Barricade the door!

519
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:29,275
Use those books.
There's more at the end
of the hall. Hurry!

520
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,440
I'll be back!
You can rest assure
of that!

521
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:33,974
I will be back!

522
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:58,141
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?

523
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:33,874
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?

524
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,107
Whoa!

525
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:55,040
Uncle Danny?

526
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:57,340
Uncle Arthur?

527
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:59,607
Uncle Danny!

528
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,141
Uncle Arthur!

529
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:07,409
Hello?
Aaah!

530
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:16,308
Uncle Danny?
Uncle Arthur?

531
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:22,307
Hmm. You must
be hungry. Sit.

532
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:25,374
I couldn't find any books,
Uncle Danny.

533
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:28,107
Exactly.
They burned them.

534
00:39:28,171 --> 00:39:32,141
That's part of their plan.
Fascist bastards!

535
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:34,674
Boy, you have a lot
of newspapers.

536
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,342
Yeah, well, we've been busy.
We haven't had time
to read them.

537
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:42,107
Baruch ata adonai Elohainu
melech ha-olam...

538
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,873
- she-hakol nee-yah bidvaro.
- Amen.

539
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:48,575
Arthur, give me
a high bouncer.

540
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:50,873
So, you ran away, hmm?

541
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:53,941
You couldn't stand
the hypocrisy, could you?

542
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:56,441
Is that a good one?
It's got to be a good one.

543
00:39:56,505 --> 00:40:00,909
Yes! Arthur,
give this boy the high bouncer.

544
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:03,107
- He's earned it.
- What do I do?

545
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:05,907
- Go ahead.
- Here.

546
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,007
- Hit your head?
- Do it to him.

547
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,406
Do it again.

548
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:14,607
Oh-oh-oh!

549
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:21,408
On the table.
On the table. Here.
All right, here, look.

550
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:24,440
Heigh-ho!
You do it.

551
00:40:25,538 --> 00:40:27,673
High bouncers!

552
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:31,142
Okeydokey! Higher, higher!
Hundreds of high bouncers!

553
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:36,075
Ohh! Bull's-eye!

554
00:40:58,138 --> 00:41:01,341
People throw away a lot
of things that are good.

555
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:06,008
I mean, so here are, um...

556
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,908
some basic household items
that you might find
in anybody's house.

557
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:13,608
And over here are some other
items that you would find...

558
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:16,875
maybe only in
abandoned warehouses...

559
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:20,309
or in empty boxcars,
Or...

560
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:24,109
But who's to say that those
aren't homes to somebody?

561
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:28,307
Here's something.
I wanna show you something.

562
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:33,409
These are dreams
that I've had.

563
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:36,608
See, dreams are...
they're like memories.

564
00:41:36,672 --> 00:41:39,074
They're easy to lose.

565
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:42,975
- Then how do you keep track of' em?
- I file them alphabetically.

566
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:46,174
Is that Grandma fanny?

567
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,773
Yeah!

568
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,875
It's a shame
that you never met her.

569
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:56,575
- How'd she die?
- Influenza.

570
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:59,007
Really?

571
00:41:59,071 --> 00:42:01,573
Yes, yes.
I think this is going to work.

572
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:03,873
Steven, come here.
Come here!

573
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:07,375
- Stand there. Stand right there.
- Ohh!

574
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,506
Now if you hear Lindquist
or his accomplices...

575
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:13,475
you just get in the box,
play dumb like
you don't know anything.

576
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:15,706
- Who's Lindquist?
- Exactly.

577
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:17,507
Time for sleep.
Lights out.

578
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,975
Danny! Arthur!

579
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:25,508
It's Sid. Open the door.
Danny? Arthur?

580
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,307
Sid?

581
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:29,807
Why don't you get a phone
so people can call you
in an emergency?

582
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:31,873
Your question
is also your answer!

583
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:34,775
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

584
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:39,643
- Is Steven here?
- I don't want to go, Uncle Arthur.

585
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:42,174
I know, I know.
I don't want you to go.

586
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:45,708
- Please, open the door.
- Wait, wait.
I don't want to go.

587
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,741
I got you something.

588
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:51,207
-What is it?
- Open the door!

589
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:54,874
It's, um...
to put things in.

590
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,574
But not, not, um...

591
00:42:57,638 --> 00:42:59,706
not Cracker Jacks
or music...

592
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:03,175
'cause they already
got boxes for themselves.

593
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:06,074
It's for important things.

594
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:08,807
Things that you don't want
to disappear.

595
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:12,473
Where is he?

596
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,773
Hi, Dad.

597
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,376
- Get your things.
Let's go.
- This is it.

598
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:23,141
I can't believe you would do
this to your mother. She's been
up all night worried sick.

599
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:25,941
She insisted on coming out
which is not good for her!

600
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:29,442
- Mom's here?
- Yes, she's here. That's right.

601
00:43:29,505 --> 00:43:31,807
Wait a... Wait a minute.
I am talking to you.

602
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:41,273
What the hell
did you do?

603
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:45,475
What the hell
were you thinking?
Come here.

604
00:43:45,538 --> 00:43:48,407
I'm sorry, Mom.

605
00:43:49,572 --> 00:43:52,541
Come on, get in the car.

606
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:55,674
- I want to stay.
- What?

607
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:59,109
- I want to stay.
- No! Absolutely not.
There's no discussion here.

608
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:01,506
- It's, it's just until...
- Until what?

609
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,310
Until you get better.

610
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:14,739
Sid?

611
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,006
Well?

612
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:31,407
All right...
but just for a while.

613
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:34,007
Okay.

614
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:37,039
- You check the food.
- I will.

615
00:44:37,105 --> 00:44:38,739
- Check the beds.
- Okay.

616
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:40,606
- Check for rats.
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:43,474
You have my permission
not to listen to anything
they say.

618
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:46,173
You have to be a man.

619
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:51,576
Just pretend you're livin'
with Dopey and... Dopey.

620
00:44:51,638 --> 00:44:56,876
Steven, please don't ever,
ever do this again.

621
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,405
I won't.

622
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:07,174
Mom, what's influenza?

623
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,007
Influenza is...

624
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:14,975
It's a cold,
a very bad cold. Why?

625
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:21,075
I don't know.

626
00:45:28,113 --> 00:45:30,515
- Take care of him.
- Yeah, we will.

627
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:37,814
Mom!

628
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,613
Hey!

629
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,580
- Steven, hurry!
- Steven, Lindquist!

630
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:46,414
- Hey!
- Steven, come on, hurry!

631
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:50,115
- Lidz!
- Steven, hurry, run, run!
Take my hand.

632
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:52,813
- Let's settle this man-to-man.
Come back here, you cowards!
- Take my hand. Take my hand.

633
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:54,947
- In here, in here. Hurry!
- Come back here!

634
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:58,780
Lidz, come back here!
Get over here!

635
00:45:58,846 --> 00:46:02,015
We gotta
get away from Lindquist.
Hurry! Steven, run!

636
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,848
Up the stairs!
Up the stairs! Hurry!

637
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:08,482
- Ah, ah, run, Steven!
- Where's Uncle Arthur?

638
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:11,848
It's every man for himself!
Quick, there's no time!

639
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:17,780
Hey! Hey! Hey!

640
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:21,082
Run!

641
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,547
Hey!
I want to talk to you!

642
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:26,548
Come on!
Come on, Steven!

643
00:46:26,612 --> 00:46:29,281
Run!
Come on! Come on!

644
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:32,981
- Hey, get back here!
- Run. He's a beast.

645
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:35,615
The beast is coming!

646
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,681
- Lidz? Lidz!
- Here we go.

647
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:40,680
Come here, come here.
I wanna talk to you.

648
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:42,513
- No, no, no!
- I want to talk to you.

649
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:45,248
- Open this door!
- You hungry?

650
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,481
- Boy, you've got a lot of crackers.
- I had coupons.

651
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:52,882
Window?
Aaah!

652
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:56,897
Baruch ata adonai
Elohainu melech...

653
00:46:56,961 --> 00:47:02,333
ha-olam she-hakol
nee-yeh bidvaro. Amen.

654
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:08,998
- Where did Uncle Arthur go?
- Well, on Tuesdays and Fridays...

655
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,496
he escorts blind Mr. Clements
from across the hall
to the park.

656
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:15,196
Of course, he has his collecting.

657
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,629
Mr. Lidz, guess what?

658
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:21,998
- On Friday the 23rd, three weeks...
- Hey, wait, wait a minute.

659
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,364
There's a city inspector
coming to check for fire
hazards in your apartment.

660
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,163
And you know somethin'?
If all that junk
isn't outta here...

661
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:31,329
you and yours are gonna
be out in the street.

662
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:35,297
Out in the street!

663
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:38,464
I got you, Lidz.
Have yourself a great day.

664
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:41,863
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know, I don't know.
I've gotta think.

665
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:45,164
Make sure the doors are locked,
and see if you can rig up
some sort of alarm system.

666
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:48,096
Wait. Me?
I don't know anything
about alarm systems!

667
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,129
He's not going to get away
with this, I assure you.
Action must be taken.

668
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:55,965
An offensive plan.
He's made a big mistake if he
thinks I'm giving up so soon.

669
00:48:04,494 --> 00:48:07,396
Possible ideas.
Available...

670
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:12,966
ma... ter... i... als.

671
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,395
Yeah.

672
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:30,230
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

673
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:32,295
- These are good.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:35,697
- Mmm.
-They're good. Very good.

675
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,529
Have you arrived
at a plan yet?

676
00:48:39,594 --> 00:48:43,064
-Well, I'm, uh,
I'm gathering information.
- Excellent.

677
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,395
You keep me posted, hmm?

678
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:48,330
- Mmm-mmm.
- Umm-umm-umm.

679
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:50,629
And I flipped 'em over
when they got all bubbly...

680
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,297
and then I gave 'em to 'em,
and they came out great,
just like yours.

681
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:58,531
- They were so good, Mom.
Arthur ate 25.
- That's wonderful, honey.

682
00:48:58,594 --> 00:49:01,363
Uncle Danny loved 'em too,
but he thought they
might be bugged.

683
00:49:01,427 --> 00:49:04,463
- They want 'em everyday
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
-They do, do they?

684
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:07,229
Oh, I better go.

685
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:11,564
Uncle Danny says we can't use
one phone for too long or else
the conspirators can trace us.

686
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:14,062
- Who? Steven?
- I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

687
00:49:14,127 --> 00:49:17,330
Good-bye.

688
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:21,965
- Lindquist,
I got a package here.
- Relax, I'm comin'!

689
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:24,896
Jesus! For cryin'
out loud. I can't even
grab any rest around here.

690
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:28,064
Can't even watch a little TV,
for cryin' out loud.

691
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,795
- Hackman, tell
Mr. Denmarrand Mr. Vallechin...

692
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,997
that their packages
are finally here.
I gotta get this phone.

693
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,495
The phone is always ringin'.

694
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:11,330
Hello. Yeah, hey,
hiya, honey.

695
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:16,699
What? Right now?
I know, but, Ruby,
Truth or Consequences is on.

696
00:50:43,694 --> 00:50:45,662
Yeah, hello.

697
00:50:45,728 --> 00:50:47,996
Yeah, this is Lindquist.
Harvey Lindquist.

698
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,962
Congratulations! You just won
two great tickets...

699
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:55,030
to Truth or Consequences
on Friday the 23rd.

700
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,062
Can you make it?
Great.

701
00:50:57,127 --> 00:51:00,029
Phase one is complete.

702
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:05,764
Those idiots
are gonna make me late for
Truth or Consequences now.

703
00:51:05,828 --> 00:51:07,596
Damn!

704
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,662
- Mr. Lindquist?
- Yeah.

705
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:12,597
- I'm Mr. Marshall from
the city inspection department.
- Yeah.

706
00:51:12,661 --> 00:51:15,330
- I've come to see, uh...
- Yeah, the problem in 2-B. You're late.

707
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:17,429
All right, listen. It's up
at the top of the stairs.

708
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:20,230
You have permission to go
into there. If you have any
trouble with these clowns...

709
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:24,665
you just call the police.
2-B, top of the stairs.
You're late, get up there.

710
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,563
- Hello! You must be from the city?
- Yes.

711
00:51:50,627 --> 00:51:53,563
Well, yes, Mr. Marshall.

712
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:56,062
Well, we've been expecting you.
Do come in.

713
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:59,530
- May I take your hat?
- Did you have a difficult time
finding the place?

714
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,330
Would you like
a cup of coffee?
Sugar? Cream?

715
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:04,395
- And what happened?
- It was great.

716
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:07,030
- He was in and out in 20 minutes.
-Yeah. Let me.

717
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:11,932
I suggested he recommend
Mr. Harvey Lindquist for
mandatory psychiatric care.

718
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:16,699
And he said, get this...
he would think about it.

719
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:21,098
- Our Steven has a rare gift.
- Steven! Oh, yes, he does.

720
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,730
- Steven. Is that your real name?
- Yeah.

721
00:52:24,794 --> 00:52:27,730
All right, now hang up.
We've angered them.
There's gonna be repercussions.

722
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:33,763
Mommy! Mommy, look what
came in the mail today.

723
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:36,230
Oh, wow.
Let's see.

724
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:39,563
"Confidential
and personal."

725
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:42,730
Sandy, come over here.
I need you for a moment.

726
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:44,962
Okay.

727
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,995
Oh, my God!

728
00:52:51,728 --> 00:52:53,963
He's becoming one of them.

729
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:51,564
I station myself here
to catch all the lost balls
of the city...

730
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,628
that are washed down
the gutters and the sewers.

731
00:53:53,694 --> 00:53:55,862
Then what do you do with 'em?

732
00:53:55,928 --> 00:53:59,331
I save 'em.

733
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:03,564
- I don't trade the balls ever.
- Why not?

734
00:54:03,627 --> 00:54:07,130
Because they're special.

735
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:10,897
You know how...
how seashells hold
the sound of the ocean?

736
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:12,562
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:16,864
I think balls hold
the sounds of the children
who bounce them.

738
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:20,598
See, but...
it's very faint.

739
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:23,896
See?

740
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:28,396
I think only dogs
can hear it.

741
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:41,128
Uncle Arthur!

742
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,130
- Here I am.
- Hey, Uncle Arthur, look.

743
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:49,499
It's much easier with this.
The ball falls into the net,
and the water flows out.

744
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,230
Say, if there were two balls,
you wouldn't be able
to catch 'em regularly.

745
00:54:52,294 --> 00:54:54,029
You're a genius!

746
00:54:58,782 --> 00:55:00,517
Hey, Mom...

747
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:02,617
Uncle Danny said
the Lindquist solution
I thought of was genius.

748
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:06,052
We switched the numbers
on the door, completely
fooled the inspector.

749
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:09,751
- It was so great.
- Really, dear?
That just sounds wonderful.

750
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,450
- I am so glad you could
help your uncles.
- Me too.

751
00:55:12,515 --> 00:55:14,683
- Sid!
- Well, I have to hang up now.

752
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:18,318
Mr. Clements
is coming back. I'll
call back later, okay?

753
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,816
- I love you, Mom. Bye.
-Wha... Steven.

754
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:23,451
Steven? Steven.

755
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,617
Oh, God.
Sidney!

756
00:55:28,915 --> 00:55:30,883
- Steven.
- Hi, Dad.

757
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,884
- Hello, Sidney.
- What is this?

758
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:36,285
- Oh, electrical tape.
My glasses broke.
- You don't wear glasses.

759
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:39,517
- He's disguising himself.
- It's a minor precaution
in case of repercussions.

760
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:42,618
It's nothing
to worry about, Sid.
Now, come on.

761
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,883
What's in the bag?

762
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:57,451
Oh, it's a present
for Mommy.

763
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:02,385
It's a record of
one of her favorite songs,
"My Reverie."

764
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:07,518
- It's this old 79.
- You mean a 78.

765
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:09,750
No, this one's 79.
It's on the label.

766
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:11,917
Listen, Arthur, there's
no such thing as a 79.

767
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:14,818
Records are 33, 45
and 78 R.P.M.

768
00:56:14,882 --> 00:56:16,883
- Yeah, but this one's 79.
- It's faster.

769
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:18,483
- What do you mean, it's faster?
- It's a little faster.

770
00:56:18,548 --> 00:56:21,384
I'm telling you,
records don't go faster
than 78.

771
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,183
- Well, this one's 79. It says.
- Arthur!

772
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:27,118
Arthur, the turntable
determines the speed,
not the record.

773
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:29,383
- Maybe where you come from.
- What do you mean, where I come from?

774
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:31,249
- I come from where you come from.
- No, no. You come...

775
00:56:31,315 --> 00:56:33,650
from the land of the dense,
the tribe of the Girgashite.

776
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:35,616
- What does that mean? I'd like to know.
- I t means what it means.

777
00:56:35,682 --> 00:56:38,051
It doesn't mean anything.
It's beyond meaning.

778
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:41,918
- It doesn't mean anything to you.
- You see what can happen to
an undisciplined mind? Hmm?

779
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:46,519
- Dad, it is a 78 R.P.M.
- I know that.

780
00:56:46,582 --> 00:56:50,519
But it cost 79 cents.
See?

781
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:53,952
There you go.

782
00:56:56,982 --> 00:56:58,883
All right.

783
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,184
Watch your step.

784
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,817
Don't step
on the cracks.

785
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:07,752
- I think she's in one, two, three...
- she's 18 from Levy.

786
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:10,217
- I think it's... Danny, she's
in the fourth row, I think.
- Over there.

787
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:13,217
- Eighteen from Levy.
- All right? Arthur?

788
00:57:13,281 --> 00:57:16,384
- Eighteen from Levy.
- Yeah.

789
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:19,050
There's Levy.
There's Levy.

790
00:57:19,115 --> 00:57:21,517
- That's Israel.
- No, Levy behind it.

791
00:57:21,582 --> 00:57:24,284
- She would've liked him.
- Oh, she would've loved him.

792
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:28,085
- Our Steven has a rare gift.
- Well, a blind man can see that.

793
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:30,783
But that name, Steven,
is so ordinary.
It lacks something.

794
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:33,418
- I know. I wasn't
gonna say anything, but...
- it should be changed.

795
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:35,550
- Change my name?
- Danny, that's enough.

796
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:39,085
He's a Lidz, Sidney.
He should be named
after an ancestor.

797
00:58:28,415 --> 00:58:31,184
Don't you think she has
enough presents, Arthur?

798
00:58:31,248 --> 00:58:33,350
It's her birthday,
Sidney.

799
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:44,118
Here, you see?
It's makeup.
A powder puff.

800
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:48,585
So, Ma, if you feel sad,
you can put on a little makeup,
make you feel better.

801
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,717
Happy birthday,
Mom.

802
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,584
Happy birthday.

803
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:01,750
That was Steven.

804
00:59:09,348 --> 00:59:11,717
- I've got it.
- What?

805
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,284
Franz.

806
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:16,216
- Franz Lidz.
- Franz.

807
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:18,216
It has a ring to it.

808
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,816
Franz. Yeah, Franz.
Wow!

809
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:22,950
First of all, Franz Liszt
is not an ancestor.

810
00:59:23,014 --> 00:59:26,050
Second of all, his name
was spelled S-Z-T not D-Z.

811
00:59:26,115 --> 00:59:29,017
- Well, those Ellis Island
idiots got it wrong!
- Yeah. They were bad spellers.

812
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:32,317
Franz Lidz!
Oh, you're the one
to look out for.

813
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:35,784
- His name is Steven.
- Oh, Franz.
Yes, you're the one to watch!

814
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:38,351
- His name is Steven.
- What about a middle name?

815
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:40,750
I should just take
a rocket to Venus.

816
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:44,718
- Maybe I can find
some intelligent life there.
-You should packa good lunch.

817
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,917
- What?
- Yeah, he's right. It's a long trip.

818
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:49,184
Yeah. You might not like
what they got to eat there.

819
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:52,584
Come on, Steven!
Come on.

820
00:59:52,648 --> 00:59:54,383
- You're Franz.
- Franz.

821
00:59:54,448 --> 00:59:56,583
Say it, say it.
Franz Lidz!

822
00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:58,182
- Franz!
- Franz!

823
00:59:58,248 --> 01:00:00,984
- Franz Lidz!
- I am Franz!

824
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:02,983
Hi, Franz.

825
01:00:27,615 --> 01:00:29,717
- Amen.
- Amen.

826
01:00:29,782 --> 01:00:32,117
- When did this start?
- More coffee?

827
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,615
Please.

828
01:00:33,682 --> 01:00:36,518
Just wanna let you know,
this'll be another 20 cents.

829
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:39,885
Wait a minute.
The sign here says, "Coffee,
all you can drink, 20 cents."

830
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:44,119
Yeah, the sign I know.
It means that that's all
you can drink for 20 cents.

831
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:46,149
No one in their right mind
would read it that way.

832
01:00:46,215 --> 01:00:47,950
- I did.
- You see?

833
01:00:48,014 --> 01:00:51,250
- That just proves my point.
- Well, you don't know, Sid.
See? You don't know.

834
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:55,385
- For once, can't you just admit
you misread a simple sign?
- Shut up.

835
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:57,416
Just shut up!

836
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:59,183
- May I have the salt, Franz?
- His name is Steven!

837
01:00:59,248 --> 01:01:01,950
What are you doing
teaching my son to pray?

838
01:01:02,014 --> 01:01:04,182
You had no right!
Everything I stand for...

839
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:07,084
is to be able to have
these kids to believe in
their own abilities...

840
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:10,084
not some fairy story
about God in heaven!

841
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:12,750
You know where heaven is?
In the minds of morons.

842
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:14,583
- Well, you're wrong, Sidney.
- What?

843
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:18,885
You're wrong, because
when you desert the beliefs of
your father, you're in Gehenna.

844
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:20,884
- Now, it happens. One day...
- Bullshit!

845
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:24,686
- What's Gehenna?
- It's the valley of lamentation,
the valley of groaning!

846
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:27,584
It's the valley
south of Jerusalem where
they burn their garbage.

847
01:01:27,648 --> 01:01:32,419
- It's not garbage, it's junk.
- Religion is a crutch.
Only cripples need crutches.

848
01:01:32,482 --> 01:01:35,952
A crutch isn't bad
if you need it, Sidney.

849
01:01:36,014 --> 01:01:38,449
- Yeah.
- All of us are cripples
in some way.

850
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:41,284
Well, I'm not!

851
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:43,917
Your mother and I have decided
you're coming home.

852
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:46,117
- What?
- Ooh!

853
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:48,583
We'll drop Danny
and Arthur off.
and then you're going home.

854
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:51,250
Enough's enough.
Summer's over.
Now, finish up.

855
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:53,517
- I don't want to hit traMc.
- But I don't wanna go!

856
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:56,851
Your mother and I
want you home,
and that's the end of it.

857
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,083
This for the lady,
with the tip.

858
01:02:00,148 --> 01:02:02,383
- All the coffee she wants.
- Mmm.

859
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:20,284
Sweetie

860
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:21,782
Hi!

861
01:02:21,849 --> 01:02:24,418
- Hi.
- Hi!

862
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:27,685
Ah, that is some outfit.

863
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:30,617
Yeah.

864
01:02:30,682 --> 01:02:32,750
Come here.
Gimme a hug.

865
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:38,917
You know, I'm feeling
much better. We have
your father to thank.

866
01:02:38,982 --> 01:02:43,252
He's been blasting me
with positive ions.
Ooh! Ooh!

867
01:02:43,315 --> 01:02:46,584
Seems to be working.
Maybe we should try it
on your Uncle Danny.

868
01:02:46,648 --> 01:02:49,384
Careful, that's Steven's rabbi
you're joking about.

869
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:52,918
- Dad, my name is Franz now.
- What?

870
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:57,686
Franz. Well, Uncle Danny
said I needed a new name,
so he gave me Franz.

871
01:02:57,748 --> 01:03:01,218
Franz? Franz Lidz?
Oh, Steven!

872
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,783
- Franz, Mom. Franz.
- Sid?

873
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:06,818
Don't look at me.
Danny's got him reciting
the Torah in a coffee shop.

874
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:09,117
- Dad, it's not the Torah.
- And if I told you once
I told you a hundred times...

875
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:11,116
to keep the windows closed.

876
01:03:11,181 --> 01:03:14,918
- He also said that I should be
bar mitzvahed if I want
to become a man.
- What?

877
01:03:14,982 --> 01:03:19,252
- That's ridiculous!
- We need our rituals to rise
above the patterns of history.

878
01:03:19,315 --> 01:03:21,483
- Who said that?
- I did.

879
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,750
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.

880
01:03:24,348 --> 01:03:27,184
I pledge allegiance...

881
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:29,416
- to the flag...
- # Stand up
all victims of oppression #

882
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:33,786
- Of the United States of America...
- # for the tyrants fear your might #

883
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:36,751
- And to the republic
for which it stands...
- # Don't cling so hard #

884
01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:38,750
- # To your possessions #
- One nation under God...

885
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,852
- # You have nothing
if you have no rights #
- One moment! Class!

886
01:03:42,915 --> 01:03:45,484
- # Let racist ignorance #
- Class! Class!

887
01:03:45,548 --> 01:03:48,083
- # Be ended #
- Steven Lidz!

888
01:03:48,148 --> 01:03:50,049
- # Makes the empire str... #
- Steven, wait!

889
01:03:50,115 --> 01:03:51,816
- What are you doing?
- My name is Franz.

890
01:03:51,882 --> 01:03:55,185
The attendance card here
says your name is Steven.

891
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,617
Call me Franz
or call me nothing.

892
01:03:57,682 --> 01:04:00,251
- # So freedom is merely privilege #
- Excuse me.

893
01:04:00,315 --> 01:04:03,317
- # Extended unless enjoyed #
- Let's go, mister. Let's go. Let's go.

894
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,250
-# By one and all #
-Would you all please take your seats?

895
01:04:06,315 --> 01:04:10,285
- # So come brothers... #
- Okay, Steven. What do
you think you're singing?

896
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:13,818
- "The Internationale." It's one
of my uncle's favorite songs.
- Well, that is very nice...

897
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:16,017
and maybe you can sing that
for us for show-and-tell...

898
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:19,184
but right now,
we are all reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.

899
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:21,917
- I can't do that.
It's against my beliefs.
- Your beliefs?

900
01:04:21,982 --> 01:04:24,851
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

901
01:04:24,915 --> 01:04:26,850
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

902
01:04:26,915 --> 01:04:31,219
How can I pledge my allegiance
to a county that suffers
fools and mediocrity?

903
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:34,884
- Not to mention cruci_ing
the Rosenbergs!
- S-Steven!

904
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:38,018
- # So for brothers and sisters #
- Let's hear it for franz! Come on!

905
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:41,984
- Whoo! franz.
- All right, class, that's enough.

906
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:44,750
Yea, Franz!
Whoo-hoo!

907
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:48,351
# The Internationale #

908
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:50,416
Hey, Lidz,
wait up.

909
01:04:50,482 --> 01:04:53,551
Hey, that was pretty cool
what you said in class.

910
01:04:53,615 --> 01:04:55,550
You should run
for president again.

911
01:04:55,615 --> 01:04:57,416
Nancy Oppenheim
said the same thing.

912
01:04:57,482 --> 01:05:00,184
- What'd you say?
- I declined the nomination.

913
01:05:00,248 --> 01:05:03,751
- That's cool. Where you goin'?
- The spillway.

914
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,384
I was thinking
of fishing for lost balls.
Wanna come?

915
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,950
- Yeah!
- I'll show you the way.

916
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:13,518
My real name's
Ashley William Robinson...

917
01:05:13,582 --> 01:05:15,884
but I only answer
to Ash.

918
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:19,519
- My father shot himself.
- I know.

919
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:23,252
I found the body.
It was really bloody.

920
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:26,851
- My mom's dying.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

921
01:05:26,915 --> 01:05:29,617
- That means you'll probably get a dog.
- Why?

922
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:33,652
I don't know. It's just
they always give kids dogs
when their parents croak.

923
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:59,056
Rabbi Blaustein?

924
01:06:59,121 --> 01:07:01,456
Yes?

925
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,155
I'm Franz Lidz.

926
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:08,024
Good. Come on in.
Sit down.

927
01:07:08,088 --> 01:07:11,991
# Shema Israel #

928
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:16,491
# Adonai Elohainu #

929
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:21,225
# Adonai echad #

930
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:24,557
# Shema Israel #

931
01:07:24,621 --> 01:07:28,691
# Adonai Elohainu #

932
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:33,325
# Adonai echad #

933
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:46,022
Mmm.

934
01:09:13,154 --> 01:09:16,090
What would've happened
if I hadn't called?
Steven should've been here.

935
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:17,922
- Where the hell is he?
Studying the Torah?
- Don't blame him.

936
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,956
It's not his fault.
I don't see what harm
it's gonna do.

937
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:22,490
- It's hypocritical.
We're not practicing Jews.
- It's what he believes in.

938
01:09:22,554 --> 01:09:24,856
He doesn't know what
he believes. My brothers
filled him with all that junk.

939
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:26,889
Maybe they're right for once.
What would you know?

940
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,423
You work ten hours a day,
then you lock yourself up
in that workshop.

941
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:32,490
What do you know
about the world?
Maybe there is a God.

942
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:36,457
Or maybe some of us
want to believe there is.

943
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,755
I can't talk
about this anymore.

944
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:41,356
Let's get in the car.
Okay?

945
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:43,556
The doctor's
on his way.

946
01:09:43,621 --> 01:09:46,724
This is the last time, Sid.
I'm not going back.

947
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:49,489
No more hospitals.
That's it.

948
01:09:57,188 --> 01:09:59,290
Is your uncle
really crazy?

949
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:01,523
Which one?
Uncle Danny or Uncle Arthur?

950
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:03,622
- I'll take care of this.
- All right.

951
01:10:11,088 --> 01:10:13,156
-Who is it?
- It's me, Uncle Danny.

952
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:15,756
- Franz.
-Ah, Franz.

953
01:10:17,455 --> 01:10:19,423
- What? No.
- No. No, wait.

954
01:10:19,488 --> 01:10:21,990
Wait, Uncle Danny.
Listen to me.

955
01:10:22,054 --> 01:10:25,323
No, i-it's okay.
He's with me.
He's one of us.

956
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:30,159
Oh, well, then,
I'm sure he won't mind
answering a few questions.

957
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:32,122
No, of course not.

958
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:34,690
How many trustworthy people
are there in the world?

959
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:36,589
- Eight. Eight.
- Um, eight.

960
01:10:36,654 --> 01:10:38,956
Uh-huh. Okay.

961
01:10:41,455 --> 01:10:44,191
Which of your cohorts
is a fascist smear monger?

962
01:10:44,254 --> 01:10:47,824
I got this.
That'd be Ralph Crispi, sir.

963
01:10:48,988 --> 01:10:51,290
Come on. Hurry.
Hurry up.

964
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:56,389
Come on.

965
01:11:02,488 --> 01:11:05,591
Here, Uncle Danny.
The rabbi says he needs
your signature here and here.

966
01:11:05,654 --> 01:11:09,024
What is that,
a disease?

967
01:11:09,088 --> 01:11:11,290
- No, it's a pimple.
- Uncle Danny?

968
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:13,356
- Huh?
- I need your signature here.

969
01:11:13,421 --> 01:11:16,457
Oh, yes, yes.
I'll look at this.

970
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,521
- Thanks.
- Yes.

971
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:22,922
When's he gonna do somethin'
really nutsy?

972
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,757
I don't know.
I can't wind him up like a toy.

973
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:31,258
Got an idea...
a really good idea.

974
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:39,257
- That's it. It's perfect.
- I don't know.

975
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:43,591
Well, go on. Just stick it
under the door and say
someone delivered it.

976
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:46,323
- I don't want to.
- It's just a joke. Come on.

977
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:48,356
- I don't know.
- Go on.

978
01:11:50,154 --> 01:11:52,523
Here you are.
How's your studies going?

979
01:11:52,587 --> 01:11:55,389
- Um, th-they're goin' fine. Fine.
- Mmm.

980
01:11:55,455 --> 01:11:59,125
- What's that?
- Oh, it's, it's nothing. It's just...

981
01:11:59,188 --> 01:12:01,390
Somebody slipped it
under the door.

982
01:12:01,455 --> 01:12:05,292
- When?
- While you were in your room.

983
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:14,323
- Uncle Danny.
- He's freaking out.

984
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,822
What the hell happened,
huh?

985
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:30,356
- He locked himself inside his room.
- What's goin' on?

986
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:32,489
He won't come out.

987
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:37,390
- Arthur?
- Yeah?

988
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:39,523
- Arthur!
- Yeah?

989
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,188
- Arthur?
- Yeah?

990
01:12:41,254 --> 01:12:45,224
- What's goin' on?
- He's in the room and he won't come out.

991
01:12:45,288 --> 01:12:46,922
Danny?

992
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,990
Danny, open the door.

993
01:12:50,054 --> 01:12:54,458
- Danny, stop this nonsense
and open the door.

994
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,889
- No, no, don't.
You're gonna frighten him.
- Enough already.

995
01:12:56,954 --> 01:12:59,489
You'll frighten him.

996
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:03,791
Danny? Danny?
Danny, enough already!

997
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:05,589
- Open the door!
- Sidney, you're scarin' him.

998
01:13:05,654 --> 01:13:09,657
What do you want me to do,
Arthur? I'm taking care
of it, all right?

999
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:18,091
Danny, open the door!

1000
01:13:18,154 --> 01:13:20,756
Danny, I'm gonna
break down the damn door
if you don't open it!

1001
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:24,923
- You all right?
- I have to go. I have to leave now.

1002
01:13:24,988 --> 01:13:27,924
- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna go now.

1003
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:30,256
All right.

1004
01:13:30,321 --> 01:13:32,623
Should I get your coat?

1005
01:13:32,687 --> 01:13:36,290
Danny, wait.
Where, where're you goin'?

1006
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:44,957
I'll go.

1007
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:47,923
Wow!
This guy is really nuts!

1008
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,790
- He's really nuts!
- No, he's not!

1009
01:13:55,088 --> 01:13:56,722
- Steven!
- Steven!

1010
01:13:56,787 --> 01:13:59,256
C'mon, we're gonna be late.
We still have to pick up
your mother. Let's go.

1011
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:01,489
- Wait. You're not taking
the movie camera?
- No.

1012
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:04,189
Why not? You mean,
you're not gonna film
my bar mitzvah?

1013
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:06,556
We need to get through this
as easily as possible today.

1014
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:09,957
- Let's not make it complicated.
Just get in the car, okay?
- But...

1015
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:13,491
- I bet Mom would like
to have it on film.
- I said no.

1016
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:16,089
But...

1017
01:14:16,154 --> 01:14:19,457
- Well, is Uncle Danny coming?
- No.

1018
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,456
- Why not?
- 'Cause he can't, that's why not.

1019
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,890
He committed himself
last night.

1020
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:12,123
Good. Good.

1021
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,789
Oh, honey,
please don't.

1022
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:20,556
- I... baby, I look so awful.
- Come on, Mom.

1023
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:23,590
- Ahh. No, you don't.
- Oh, baby.

1024
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:26,123
You look beautiful.

1025
01:16:26,188 --> 01:16:29,758
- So how you doing, kiddo?
- Okay.

1026
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:33,191
- You feel like a man yet?
- Not really.

1027
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:38,858
- You think Uncle Danny'll get better?
- I don't know, honey.

1028
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,790
I'm sure he missed
being here very much.

1029
01:16:41,854 --> 01:16:44,990
You know,
you could go see him.

1030
01:16:45,054 --> 01:16:50,826
I was thinking tomorrow
I would make pancakes.
Would you like that?

1031
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:55,424
Sure, but...
y-you don't have
to make breakfast.

1032
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:59,525
- I can make you pancakes
just like yours.
- Ooh.

1033
01:16:59,587 --> 01:17:02,089
You make 'em
that good, huh?

1034
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:07,357
You know,
I am so proud of you.

1035
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:11,525
Do you know
how proud I am?

1036
01:17:11,587 --> 01:17:15,757
Would you just do me
one favor?

1037
01:17:15,821 --> 01:17:18,790
Ty to love your dad
a bit more.

1038
01:17:18,854 --> 01:17:22,023
It's not easy being
from another planet.

1039
01:17:22,088 --> 01:17:24,056
Mom...

1040
01:17:29,455 --> 01:17:31,456
a-are you...

1041
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,623
Are you dying?

1042
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:42,124
Yes, I am, Franz.

1043
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:44,590
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:18:18,587 --> 01:18:21,423
Uncle Danny?

1045
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:25,658
Franz!
Good to see you.

1046
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:30,325
Uncle Danny,
there's something
I wanna tell you.

1047
01:18:30,388 --> 01:18:32,690
What?

1048
01:18:32,754 --> 01:18:35,089
We wrote that note,
me and Ash.

1049
01:18:35,154 --> 01:18:37,356
- Ahh.
- It was a mean joke.

1050
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:40,690
- I'm really, really sorry.
This is all my fault.
- No, no, no.

1051
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,689
Don't be sorry.
I'm grateful to you.

1052
01:18:42,754 --> 01:18:46,157
You ended it.
See, I didn't know how.

1053
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,157
Oh, really?
Well, then, you can
come home, right?

1054
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:51,523
- No, no, I can't.
- But...

1055
01:18:51,587 --> 01:18:54,856
B-But Uncle Arthur needs you.
He's lost without you.

1056
01:18:54,921 --> 01:18:56,822
- You should be with your brother.
- Well, I can't.

1057
01:18:56,887 --> 01:18:59,022
Why not?
Are you still hiding
from conspirators?

1058
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:02,658
There's no conspiracy!

1059
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:04,823
Now, listen.
Are you listening?

1060
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:07,322
You forget about me.
You're gonna be busy enough
with your father.

1061
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:09,623
- He's the one that needs you now.
- No, he doesn't!

1062
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:11,722
Yes, he does.
Franz, don't you see?

1063
01:19:11,787 --> 01:19:15,524
People, they get trapped
in their own history unless
someone shows them a way out.

1064
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:19,924
- But I don't know how.
- Oh, don't you worry.
You're gonna figure a way.

1065
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,090
Remember,
you're the one to watch.

1066
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:24,356
- No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

1067
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:29,990
You're the one to watch.

1068
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:37,008
# The other night #

1069
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:40,028
# As I lay sleepin' #

1070
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:42,973
# Whoa
I dreamed I held you #

1071
01:19:44,037 --> 01:19:46,572
# Held you in my arms #

1072
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:49,674
- # Oh, but when I woke up
this mornin'#

1073
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:52,407
No, stir it like this
so the egg gets
all mushied in.

1074
01:19:52,471 --> 01:19:55,407
- He dances like you.
- Yeah, like that. C'mere. Follow me.

1075
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:58,473
# Do you know
that I hung my-y-y#

1076
01:19:58,538 --> 01:20:02,341
You wanna take this batter,
make sure it's not dripping,
quickly...

1077
01:20:02,404 --> 01:20:05,940
- # Oh, you are my sunshine #
- # You are my sunshine #

1078
01:20:06,004 --> 01:20:09,674
- # Oh, my only sunshine #
- # My only sunshine #

1079
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,408
- # Whoa, little girl
you make me happy #
- # You make me happy #

1080
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:15,673
- What?
- The record's gonna skip.

1081
01:20:15,738 --> 01:20:17,606
- I'll go.
- No, I'll get it. I'll get it.

1082
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:20,173
- # You'll never, never know #
- # You'll never know, dear #

1083
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:23,440
What we gotta do
is we gotta make...

1084
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:26,440
We gotta make sure
these are doin' good.

1085
01:20:26,504 --> 01:20:30,274
They look good.
Just a little bit more though.

1086
01:20:30,338 --> 01:20:32,973
- Hey, Mommy.
- You're a good helper.

1087
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,172
Thank you.

1088
01:20:37,404 --> 01:20:40,006
What about,
um, rectangles?

1089
01:20:40,071 --> 01:20:43,941
Yeah, you can make rectangle
shapes. You can make
all different kinds of shapes.

1090
01:20:44,004 --> 01:20:46,172
- Triangle?
- Yeah, any kind.

1091
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:48,472
- You're a great cook.
- You're a great mom.

1092
01:20:48,538 --> 01:20:52,141
- Even a square?
- Yeah, even a square.

1093
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:06,641
- # You told me once, dear #
- Oooh, yuck. Gross.

1094
01:21:06,705 --> 01:21:09,140
# That you really loved me #

1095
01:21:09,204 --> 01:21:11,839
# And no one else #

1096
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:16,642
# Could ever come between
yeah #

1097
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,941
# But now you left me #

1098
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:23,974
# And you love another
yeah #

1099
01:21:24,037 --> 01:21:27,573
# And you have shattered
oh, yeah #

1100
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:31,608
# All of my dreams #

1101
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:35,441
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- # Oh, you are my sunshine #

1102
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:38,506
- Great helper.
- We made them! Look!

1103
01:21:38,571 --> 01:21:41,273
Where's Mom?

1104
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:46,342
-I'll go get her. You kids start eating.
-# When skies are gray #

1105
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:50,708
- # Whoa, you'll never
never know #
- # You'll never know, dear#

1106
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,707
- # How much I love you #
- # How much I love you #

1107
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:58,142
- # Whoa, I don't want you
to take #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1108
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:01,407
- # Whoa, you love me #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1109
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:06,142
- # Uh-huh, you want me #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1110
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,339
- # Don't take my sunshine #
- # Yes, sir #

1111
01:22:08,404 --> 01:22:13,308
- # I don't want you to take
whoa-oa #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1112
01:22:13,371 --> 01:22:15,740
-# Yes, sir #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1113
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:19,108
- # I don't want you to take #
- # Don't take my sunshine #

1114
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:25,243
- # My sunshine away #
- # Shine away ##

1115
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:42,473
Maybe a dog.
Something to make happiness
in the house.

1116
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:46,675
A little levity.
It'll be better than all this
gloom and doom, you know?

1117
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:48,673
- She just died.
- I don't
want to see them hurtin'.

1118
01:22:48,738 --> 01:22:50,673
And this right here,
it's a bolt.

1119
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:53,841
- It's a bolt you could use as a lock.
- Come outside with me.

1120
01:22:53,904 --> 01:22:56,306
- What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?
- Let go of me!

1121
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,606
What the hell is wrong
with you? Stop it, now!
Give it to me!

1122
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:02,041
- But you said
documentation is important.
- Forget what I said!

1123
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:05,674
I put up with
this nonsense with you
when your mother was alive.

1124
01:23:05,738 --> 01:23:07,840
- But no more! Your name is Steven.
- My name is Franz.

1125
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,306
Steven!
She picked it out...

1126
01:23:10,371 --> 01:23:12,706
and she asked me
if I thought
it was a good name.

1127
01:23:12,771 --> 01:23:15,907
I said, "yes,
it's a good name."

1128
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:18,340
It was
her brother's name.

1129
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:23,342
Now, no more.
Just stop it.
Your name is Steven.

1130
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:43,939
Anyway, look.
Laundry, baby-sitting,
food, we're here.

1131
01:23:44,004 --> 01:23:45,538
- We're here for you. We're family.
- Wha...

1132
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,139
- You call us, please. Bye, baby.
- Aw, darling.

1133
01:23:48,204 --> 01:23:51,106
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, bye. Bye.

1134
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,941
Go upstairs...
to your Uncle Arthur, okay?

1135
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:09,239
Steven?

1136
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:15,272
Steven.

1137
01:24:15,904 --> 01:24:17,905
Steven?

1138
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:24,606
Steven?

1139
01:24:26,037 --> 01:24:27,805
Steven?

1140
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,439
Steven?

1141
01:24:37,004 --> 01:24:39,740
- Can I help you?
- I, I know where I'm going.

1142
01:24:39,805 --> 01:24:41,973
Sir!

1143
01:24:52,404 --> 01:24:54,572
- Where is he?
- Who?

1144
01:24:54,638 --> 01:24:56,573
Steven!
Where is he?

1145
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:06,440
I don't know
what the hell he's thinking.

1146
01:25:06,504 --> 01:25:08,939
Where're we going?
I have no idea
where we're going.

1147
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:11,139
Arthur, did you
see him leaving?

1148
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:13,439
-The last time I saw him
he was by the junkcans.
- Mm-hmm.

1149
01:25:13,504 --> 01:25:15,639
- What was he doin'?
- He was takin' the movies out.

1150
01:25:15,705 --> 01:25:18,641
What? You didn't
tell me that, Arthur!

1151
01:25:18,705 --> 01:25:21,841
Well, you didn't ask me
what he was doing.

1152
01:25:21,904 --> 01:25:24,940
You know, it's not right
to throw memories away, Sidney.

1153
01:25:28,137 --> 01:25:31,440
He just needs
to say good-bye.

1154
01:26:47,904 --> 01:26:50,906
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't, don't shut it off.

1155
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:12,240
I...
couldn't find you.

1156
01:27:12,304 --> 01:27:16,307
I'm...
I'm sorry, Dad.

1157
01:27:20,404 --> 01:27:25,108
- What do you have there?
- Mmm, just a bunch of different ones.

1158
01:27:25,171 --> 01:27:27,439
They're not labeled.

1159
01:27:27,504 --> 01:27:31,541
I think...
we should label them.

1160
01:27:31,604 --> 01:27:35,407
Documentation.
They should be labeled.

1161
01:27:37,271 --> 01:27:41,008
Okay. Well,
tomorrow I'll do that.
