1
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:17,023
Man: l must've-
I must've dozed off or something.

2
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,723
l apologize. Watch your head.
Watch your- I'm sorry.

3
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,562
Ready, one, two, let's go.

4
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,394
You're gonna be fine.

5
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,464
You're gonna be fine.

6
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,623
Just relax.

7
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:56,018
Hi guys. My name's Craig.
I'm an aIcohoIic.

8
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,179
Group: Hi Craig.

9
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,347
Today is my five-year anniversary.

10
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,856
That's five years of sobriety.

11
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:10,664
Um, you know,
I know a few of you

12
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,390
are just getting started
with this thing.

13
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,865
l just wanted you to know
it does get easier.

14
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,970
lt never ends.

15
00:05:17,137 --> 00:05:19,071
Uord knows it never ends.

16
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,072
But if you stick with it,
it does get easier.

17
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,971
And believe me,

18
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,669
if I can do it, then so can you.

19
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,871
That's all l wanted to say.

20
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,347
Thank you, Craig.
And congratulations again.

21
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,044
On that note, I think

22
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,553
there's someone else here
who has an anniversary

23
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,920
that they need to celebrate today.
Am I right?

24
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:46,025
Sarah?

25
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:49,219
Oh, um... hi.

26
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,559
I'm Sarah.
And I'm an aIcohoIic.

27
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,064
Group: Hi Sarah.

28
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,930
This isn't- it's not really

29
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,002
as big a deal as Craig's.

30
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:04,039
lt's just l'm three months today.

31
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:13,614
Sarah, is there anything eIse
you'd Iike to say?

32
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,546
No, that's all.

33
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17,582
No? Okay, weII,

34
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,551
unless anyone else has anything
they'd Iike to share,

35
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,519
l guess we're done here.

36
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,783
Okay.

37
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,453
Group: Lord,

38
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,096
grant me the serenity

39
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:37,359
to accept the things
I cannot change,

40
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:40,969
the courage to change
the things that I can

41
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:44,299
and the wisdom
to know the difference,

42
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,964
living one day at a time,

43
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:50,474
enjoying one moment at a time,

44
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,544
accepting hardships

45
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,146
as a pathway to peace.

46
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,544
Amen.

47
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,453
Thank you.

48
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,185
Shit.

49
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,949
- Hey Sarah.

50
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,421

51
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,648
- Yeah, Kevin.
- Kev-

52
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:54,656
That's right.

53
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:57,091
l just wanted to come
say congratuIations.

54
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,594
lt's a really big deal.
You should be proud of yourseIf.

55
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,959
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're weIcome.

56
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,499
Um, and l was thinking maybe

57
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,000
if you wanted to go ceIebrate

58
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,660
it would be my treat.

59
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,273
l could take you out or-

60
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,299
Uh, not tonight.

61
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,341
That's all right.

62
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,206
You've got plans.

63
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,108
On the couch- a movie.

64
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:22,215
Fair enough.

65
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,145
AII right, get home safe.

66
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,148

67
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:28,013

00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,657
Uh, l could- l could do,

71
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,226

72
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,457
Do you Iike ItaIian food?

73
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,123
Yeah.

74
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,394
All right,

75
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,697
right across the street
from my office.

76
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,032
Uet's do that.
It's caIled D'Amato's.

77
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,799
Okay, see you then.

00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,807
Good.
Okay, drive safe.

79
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,535
Stay warm.

80
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,032
You know the drill.

81
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,274
Run your hands
through your hair

82
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:52,715
and your beard.

83
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:57,118
Open your mouth.
Your tongue- move it around.

84
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,451
Show me your armpits.

85
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,450
Lift your nutsack.

86
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,695
And your dick.

87
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,263
Turn around.

88
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,529
All right, get dressed.

89
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,042
Hey. Am I Iate?

90
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,314
No, l got here early.

91
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:05,955
Well, you look great.

00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,216
- Thank you.

93
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,657

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:16,297
Yeah. You too.

95
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,024

Thanks. l just-

97
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,205
lt goes really well with your hair.

98
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:30,069
l just bought this actually.

99
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,140
- Waitress: Good evening.
- Kevin: HeIIo.

100
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,871
Would you like to make a drink order
whiIe you Iook at the menu?

101
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:43,174
Kevin:
No? l'lI have a Coke, pIease.

102
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:45,378
Waitress:
Okay. And for you, ma'am?

103
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:46,851
I'm fine with water.
Thank you.

104
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,581
- Okay, I'II be right back with that.
- Thanks.

105
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:58,429
StiII a weird question, huh?

106
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,588
"WouId you Iike a drink?"

107
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,200
Yes, l would.

108
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,432
l mean, it doesn't really help

109
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:11,402
that there's wine bottles
surrounding us.

110
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,667
l know.
I didn't reaIize...

111
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,433
until l walked in.

112
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,669
Do you want to go somewhere else?
It's not too Iate.

113
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:20,245
No, l'm- no,
don't worry about me.

114
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,406
Okay, are you sure?
I mean, there's a Iot of good pIaces

115
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,414
even just right on this street.

116
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,281
No, it's- no.
I was- l was kind of joking.

117
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,580
Kevin: Um, garcon,
have these removed, please.

118
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:34,717
Orjust put bIankets over them.
That's-

119
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:37,691
Can we put some nice French posters
around the wall,

120
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:40,955
something Iike that?

121
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:44,100
Yeah, l just used
to order a beer, you know?

122
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,063
l would just say,
"Oh, I'm not gonna drink it.

123
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:49,068
l'll just order it
and I'II feeI Iike an aduIt.

124
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:51,535
lt can just sit there."

125
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,933
Sarah:
Such a bad idea.

126
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,472
lt's a terrible idea.
It never works.

127
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:58,940
l'm sure that-

128
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:01,739
that it took about five minutes
before you downed it.

129
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,408
Yeah, that sounds right.

130
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:13,381
- Do you know what you want?
- I have no idea.

131
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:16,218
Kevin: Mm. Well,

132
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,552
it's all pretty good.

133
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:52,508
- CIerk: Hey, how's it going?
- Good, man. How are you?

134
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,586
CIerk: Good.

135
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:56,585
That'lI be $30 even.

136
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:58,519
All right.

137
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,658
What's the deal
with the showers?

138
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:03,350
It's five bucks for 30 minutes.

139
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,358
l'll take an hour.

140
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,498
All right.
Can I get you a bag for these?

141
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:09,292
No no, l'm fine.

142
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,436
Uet's get you in stall 7,
right upstairs.

143
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,536
All right.

144
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,002
Do you need, like,
soap or shampoo?

145
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:19,038
l've got it in the bag.
Thanks.

146
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:20,469
It's through here? Up?

147
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,666
- Yeah, it's just up the stairs.
- Thanks.

148
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:31,439
Sarah: Okay, I'm just gonna put this
around your neck, aII right?

149
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,771
Lift your head for me.

150
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:45,618
Woman:
So how was yesterday?

151
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:48,279
You feeI aII right?

152
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,419
You mean my date?
Is that what you're asking me?

153
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,892
Yes, l mean your date.

154
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:00,589
He's great.

155
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:04,634
l mean, it was really-
it was realIy-

156
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:06,896
reaIIy surface IeveI, so...

157
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:11,969
Woman:
WeIl, this might be

158
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:15,634
a good distraction right now,
you know?

159
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,113
Sarah:
You know, he's reaIIy nice.

160
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,273
I just don't feeI Iike
I'm ready for...

161
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,617
something like that.

162
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:34,815
Well, give it time.
Don't, you know-

163
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,855
don't write it off yet.

164
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,200
Woman:
Are you scared?

165
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:52,463
A little, yeah.

166
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,148
l'm probably just being
paranoid though.

167
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:09,717
l don't know.
I think that's pretty naturaI.

168
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,688
Male TV anchor:
Home saIes here in the Midwest-

169
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,158
numbers show a huge drop
in overaII saIes from December.

170
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,523
SaIes feII 37%/% in January,

171
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,155
but they were stiII up 4%/% in 2009
as compared to 2008.

172
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,233
Recapping our top story
this evening,

173
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
the manhunt continues tonight
for Garrick Turrell,

174
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,630
who remains at large
after escaping from poIice custody.

175
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,172
The search, which is now
in its fifth day,

176
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,708
has Iaw enforcement agencies across
the country coordinating their efforts.

177
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,744
Prison warden CIarkton Smith,
whose facility housed TurreIl,

178
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:44,813
issued a statement to the press
this afternoon

179
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:47,973
addressing the difficuIty in Iocating
the notorious seriaI kiIIer

180
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,051
who may have been taken in
and housed by his purported fans.

181
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:52,879
Smith:
Yes, that is correct.

182
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:55,886
Garrick TurreII during his time
in custody here did receive more Ietters

183
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,546
than any previous resident
we've had incarcerated,

184
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,419
and by a considerable number.

185
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:03,528
And yes, that apparently includes
severaI marriage proposaIs.

186
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:57,462
Sarah:
This is me right here.

187
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:03,634
- Kevin: lt's a cool place.
- Sarah: Thank you.

188
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:06,634
Kevin: Got the whoIe thing to yourseIf
or do you have roommates?

189
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,863
Sarah:
It's just me.

190
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,508
Kevin:
That's pretty nice.

191
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,810
- Kevin: l had a really good time.
- Me too.

192
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,004
Kevin:
Yeah, it was fun.

193
00:24:01,947 --> 00:24:04,507
Oh, we're fogging up
the windows.

194
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:08,880
Kevin:
See you soon?

195
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:11,044
Sarah:
Yeah. Yeah, let's-

196
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,690
Kevin:
Maybe this weekend? I don't-

197
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:16,849
- Sarah: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- AIl right, sure.

198
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:18,789
Sarah: Let me caII you tomorrow
just to make sure.

199
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,121
- Kevin: No pressure. All right, good.
- Okay. Okay.

200
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:23,628
- Sarah: I'II see you sometime.
- Yeah, taIk to you tomorrow.

201
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,266
- Okay.
- Bye.

202
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,375
Woman on TV:
ExactIy as I dreamed it.

203
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,916
Or did I?

204
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:52,986
Maybe this is the dream.

205
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:57,983
Man on TV:
It's pretty weird.

206
00:24:58,158 --> 00:24:59,785
Have you had enough?

207
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,825
If you're tired, we can go back.

208
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,894
Woman on TV: No.

209
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,895
We go on this way.

210
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:10,133
Sarah: No.

211
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,734
l'm mad at you.

212
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,665
- Garrick: I missed you.
- No.

213
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:16,499
- l did.
- You didn't.

214
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:18,606
Sarah:
Where were you?

215
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,969
Garrick:
I told you.

216
00:25:21,142 --> 00:25:23,610
l had that dinner meeting

217
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,643
with Mark and TK

218
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:28,178
to talk about their college
bankroII stuff and-

219
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:30,441
Yeah, and then where did you go?
'Cause it's Iike 11:00.

220
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:33,244
Garrick: Where?
We were there Iate.

221
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:35,818
Oh, but wait.
No, we went to the strip club first.

222
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:37,978
Sarah: That's not-
that's not funny at aIl.

223
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:39,748
- lt's a littIe funny.
- I don't Iike it.

224
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,255
- l like you.
- l don't like thosejokes.

225
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:44,017
They're jokes.

226
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:48,430
Garrick: Here.

227
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:58,171
- l Iove you.
- l Iove you.

228
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,231
Fuck.

229
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,271
Male radio anchor:
...related to the escape

230
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,973
of the aIIeged seriaI kiIler
Garrick TurreII.

231
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,050
An FBl spokesman
wouId onIy say

232
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:27,915
that certain detaiIs of the murder,
which they were unabIe to disclose,

233
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,148
linked the killings
with patterns estabIished

234
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:32,791
in Turrell's alleged slayings,
aIl of which took pIace

235
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,325
in Alabama and Mississippi
over the past five years.

236
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:38,794
The disturbing news for law enforcement
is that the search for TurreII

237
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,658
has not yet spread
as far north as Kansas,

238
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,322
indicating that
the escaped suspect

239
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,798
may have somehow
evaded poIice checkpoints.

240
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:46,333
The FBl states
that the search for Turrell,

241
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,130
now in its seventh day,

242
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:50,101
is being expanded
to include the entire Midwest,

243
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,933
with local agencies
coordinating their efforts.

244
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,076
DetaiIed images of TurreII
are being circuIated to checkpoints

245
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:58,268
along the Mexican
and Canadian borders.

246
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:12,413
Woman:
The first time I drank

247
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,454
l think l was eight years old,

248
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,489
but l don't really remember.

249
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,992
The first time I got drunk
I was nine.

250
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:23,097
l do remember that.

251
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:26,132
But, l don't know,

252
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,165
the weird thing now is that

253
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:32,170
l've been sober
for aImost a year

254
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,364
and now my friends are

255
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,839
all on the drinking thing

256
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:41,967
and are going to parties
around town.

257
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:46,708
And they don't understand
why I don't want to go with them.

258
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:49,043
And, l don't know, sometimes

259
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,310
I aImost feeI robbed
of something,

260
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:54,319
you know,
of some experience

261
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:57,980
that l should have had
or should have enjoyed.

262
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:00,285
But, l don't know,

263
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,156
l guess it doesn't really matter.

264
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:06,729
So that's it.

265
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:17,739
Sarah, I was just wondering
if you wanted to telI us

266
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:21,399
what made you decide
to finaIIy confront your iIIness.

267
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:26,472
Uh...

268
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,340
l was...

269
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:36,887
in a pretty bad relationship.

270
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,080
He was...

271
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:43,658
not very honest with me
about a Iot of things.

272
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,998
After l...

273
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,259
found out that-

274
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,334
well, that- that-

275
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:58,336
after I found out...

276
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:03,675
l realized...

277
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:06,073
that l had been...

278
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,542
drinking a lot,

279
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:11,443
that maybe

280
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,084
it wouldn't have happened-

281
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,344
no, l'm- not that it-

282
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,385
nothing-

283
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:21,182
that maybe it wouldn't
have been as bad

284
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:25,588
if I hadn't been drunk

285
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,228
all the time.

286
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,127
So I- after I moved here

287
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:36,233
l...

288
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,199
uh, started coming to meetings.

289
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,931
And it's been reaIIy good for me.

290
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,549
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,419
- How are you feeIing?
- Er...

292
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,617
That was reaIIy great.

293
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,261
What?

294
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:15,831
Just everything you said in group
was reaIly-

295
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,126
was really vulnerable and great.

296
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:20,599
lt's really good
that you could do that.

297
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,829
l think everybody
appreciated it.

298
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,838
Yeah, there's a lot more
to that story

299
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,338
that l should-

300
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:29,738
- Yeah, l'm sure.
- Yeah.

301
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,743
There's a lot more to my story too
and everybody eIse's,

302
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:35,744
but l think you said
what you had to say

303
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,472
and, um...

304
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,980
l should probably tell you
about it though.

305
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,175
l mean, l should-

306
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:44,343
it's pretty...

307
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,356
bad.

308
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:51,789
Good. Someday you can
teII me about it, okay?

309
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,157
Not right now.

310
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,195
l really like you.
I reaIIy-

311
00:32:57,364 --> 00:33:00,697
l like hanging out with you.

312
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:03,961
And l want to hear that story

313
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:08,039
and all your other stories,
you know?

314
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:12,439
But I don't want you to feeI Iike
you have to teII them to me.

315
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,469
Anyway, whatever.
I shouId get going.

316
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:18,308
But l'll see you
on Wednesday, right?

317
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,472
Do you want to come over
right now?

318
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,951
Come over to your pIace?

319
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:29,319
Yeah.

320
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:32,117
Yeah, we c- yeah.

321
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:37,784
Yeah.

322
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:40,863
We'll have tea or something.

323
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,897
If you think
it's a good idea.

324
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:46,059
l mean,
tea sounds great.

325
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:48,364
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:54,304
All right, well,
I'II meet you over there, okay?

327
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:57,504
All right.
See you soon.

328
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:11,347
No! No! No!

329
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,610
It's okay?

330
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,508
Do you have a condom?

331
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:55,347
l think l have one
in the nightstand.

332
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:58,014
You want me to get it?

333
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:37,713
Do you want me to put it on?

334
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,914
Kevin: Yeah.

335
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,829
Kevin:
Are you sure?

336
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:50,056
Are you sure it's okay?

337
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,124
Sarah: Yeah.

338
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,175
Hold on. Hold on.

339
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,673
Oh shit. HoId on.

340
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,179
Oh shit.

341
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:22,813
Oh shit.

342
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,792
No. No.

343
00:36:30,264 --> 00:36:32,824
Are you okay?

344
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,594
l'm sorry.

345
00:36:39,671 --> 00:36:41,696
Fuck.

346
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,436
- lt's okay.
- I'm sorry.

347
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:49,772
lt's okay.

348
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,316
Garrick:
When we get up to him,

349
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,318
he's probably gonna ask you
for your driver's license.

350
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,785
Just give it to him.
It's not a big deaI.

351
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,190

He's gonna make sure

368
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,498
You know,
I think this is not easy,

369
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,725
but you're doing really good.
You're getting through it.

370
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:04,335
You'II get through it fine.

371
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:09,366
You're almost done.

372
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,533
Policeman:

378
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,277
Policeman:
Take care.

379
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:49,802
Garrick:
Keep driving.

380
00:38:50,906 --> 00:38:53,374
When you get up here at the fork
in the road, take a left.

381
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,305
Here you go.

382
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,308
Thanks.

383
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,641
You said you just needed me
to get through the roadblock

384
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:05,444
and then you would let me go.

385
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:07,610
l know. l will.

386
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:09,982
Yeah, Ieft here.

387
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,992
Where are we going?

388
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,636
l'm still trying
to figure that out.

389
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,666
My famiIy was expecting me at home
a half-hour ago.

390
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:40,004
If l Ieave you here,

391
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,475
the cops will be on me

392
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,307
before I can ditch this car
and find another one.

393
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,345
It's fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

394
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,314
l just want to get up the road
a IittIe bit further before l Iet you go.

395
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,145
l won't talk to the cops.

396
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,618
l just want to see
my family again.

397
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,597
You said you weren't
gonna hurt me.

398
00:40:04,764 --> 00:40:06,925
You said that you were
gonna let me go. PIease just-

399
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:09,192
What the fuck is wrong with you?
l'm not gonna hurt you.

400
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,825
l'm just trying to think. l just want
to get up the road a Iittle ways.

401
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:15,494
I'II drop you off, okay?
Take it easy.

402
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,035
Here, just-
in fact, puII off up here.

403
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,677
Yeah, here. PulI off.

404
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:25,370
Put the car in park.
Park it.

405
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:21,259
Sarah:
What are you doing?

406
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,590
Oh hey.

407
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:26,392
l'm sorry.
I couIdn't sIeep.

408
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:28,763
l thought l'd put some clothes on

409
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:31,928
and take a walk or a drive
or something.

410
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:35,372
You know me.
I'm weird.

411
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:37,569
lt's really late, sweetie.

412
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:40,078
Yeah, l know.

413
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:43,776
What are you doing up?
Are you doing okay?

414
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,442
Sarah:
No, my head reaIly hurts.

415
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:47,680
I was gonna get a drink of water
or something.

416
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,847
Garrick: That's a good idea.
You shouId drink some water.

417
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,959
You know, you should get
something to eat too.

418
00:42:52,128 --> 00:42:54,790
- Sarah: Yeah.
- Some bread or a pretzeI or something.

419
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:57,454
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah.

420
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,760
Sarah: You don't want to come back
to bed with me?

421
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:03,632
Oh, come on.

422
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:05,534
Of course I do.

423
00:43:05,706 --> 00:43:07,367
I just feIt Iike
I was keeping you up.

424
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,534

425
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,770

00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:22,481

- Kevin: Hey, good morning.

431
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,747
l didn't know you were still here.

432
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,083
Welcome to the world
of the waking.

433
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,020
- How are you doing?
- Good.

434
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,622
I made coffee.

435
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:02,628
Oh, thanks.

436
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:05,359
I wouId have made breakfast,
but you don't have any food.

437
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:10,306
Yeah, l haven't been
grocery shopping in a while.

438
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,809

440
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:19,012
Want coffee?

441
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:23,015
Um, yeah, l'll have-

442
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:36,059
l'm just gonna brush my teeth
real quick.

443
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,134
Kevin: All right.
I used your toothbrush.

444
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,791
l hope that's okay.

445
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,562
Yeah, that's fine.

446
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:43,639
- ReaIIy?
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,537
l didn't really
use your toothbrush.

448
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,234
You can if you want.

449
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,073
No, l was just kidding.

450
00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:51,805
Okay.

451
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:53,847
l brought my own.

452
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:56,009
Okay.

453
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:58,882
- That was also a joke.
- Okay.

454
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:01,650
l'll be back.
I'II be there in a second.

455
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:05,058
Kevin: All right.

456
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:06,856
Whoa.

457
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,630
Man:
Hey man.

458
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,738
- What?
- You need to be carefuI.

459
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:53,900
Huh?

460
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,138
See these power Iines?

461
00:45:56,314 --> 00:45:58,441
Yeah.

462
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:01,916
They got transponders in them.
You know what a transponder is?

463
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:03,987
Garrick: I do.

464
00:46:04,155 --> 00:46:06,146
Well, they put them in

465
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:07,917
back when it was built
in the '50s

466
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:10,562
for the commies.

467
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:14,393
They never had to
use them though.

468
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:17,932
But this nigger president
in the White House-

469
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:21,937
he wants to keep track
of us out here

470
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:24,906
- with them- using them...
- Garrick: Right.

471
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:32,906
...you know, to keep track
of our thoughts.

472
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:37,954
You know, driving a car
like you're driving-

473
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:42,755
with that pIastic roof-

474
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:46,799
they can read
right through that.

475
00:46:46,966 --> 00:46:50,800
Now what you need-

476
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,370
a steeI roof.

477
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:55,972
- Yeah?
- They can't read through that.

478
00:46:56,141 --> 00:46:57,870
They can't.

479
00:46:58,043 --> 00:47:00,204
So you need to get yourseIf
one of these.

480
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:01,937
I'm gonna go, aII right?

481
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:04,675
Well, l thought
I'd just pass the word.

482
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,715
Thank you.
Good looking out.

483
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,787
- You be good now.
- AlI right, drive safeIy.

484
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,616
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:19,961
Kevin: ls there a university
in JacksonvilIe, a coIIege?

486
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,897
Sarah:
University of Northern FIorida.

487
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:25,799
Kevin: I'm trying to think of
what the sports team is.

488
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:28,966
l'm sure there's, what,
minor Ieague basebaII?

489
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:32,805
- Sarah: I don't reaIIy keep up with sports.
- Spring training?

490
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,312
Well, there's Jacksonville Jaguars-
footbaII.

491
00:47:35,482 --> 00:47:38,076
l'm sure your mom sees
Iots of Jaguars games.

492
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:40,379
No, she doesn't really
do anything, but-

493
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:41,646
- ReaIIy?
- No.

494
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:43,312
She's not a season ticket hoIder?

495
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:47,051
No, just work, home, television.

496
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:51,889
How's it going, Kevin?

497
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:54,330

00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:55,730

00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:08,514

505
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:13,914
Would you two like

00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,887
Rusty: l never see you

Rusty:

511
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:29,435
So is this here why you never

512
00:48:31,538 --> 00:48:35,531
If I had a pretty young Iady Iike this,

513
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:38,542
- Here you go.

You work with them?

520
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,173
l do.

521
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:08,070
They're old drinking buddies.

522
00:49:08,243 --> 00:49:10,234
Mm.
He smeIIs Iike Iiquor.

523
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:14,247
That's pretty normal.

524
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:19,582
Easier just to avoid them
these days than...

525
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,181
trying to explain
the idea of sobriety,

526
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:27,418
which l don't think their brains
can fulIy process, you know?

527
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:29,996
Sarah:
I understand that.

528
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:05,954
- Hi Sarah.
- Hi. Sorry I'm Iate.

529
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,957
Hey. Hey. Do you know
where CarIa is?

530
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,151
No. She didn't come in?

531
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,194
No. She didn't show up
this morning.

532
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,264
She didn't caII in either
or anything.

533
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,697
Dr. Belton's pretty pissed about it.

534
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,770
That's weird.

535
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:22,304
Yeah. Uook,
if you taIk to her,

536
00:52:22,474 --> 00:52:24,442
will you just tell her
to get the heII in here?

537
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,976
Sure thing.

538
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:40,186
Hey girl.
Just wondering where you are.

539
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:42,350
You're supposed to be at work.

540
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:45,497
Everyone's a little pissed.

541
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:48,326
Okay, just caII me back
when you get this.

542
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,127
Bye.

543
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,394
What can I get you?

544
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,554
- Are you guys stilI serving food?
- Yeah.

545
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,393
- You got steak?
- Sure.

546
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,967
And a soda, please.

547
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,116
Female radio anchor:
FBI agents involved in a manhunt

548
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:12,980
for a suspected seriaI kiIler
Garrick TurreII

549
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:15,088
have asked members of the pubIic
to come forward

550
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:18,054
if they have any information that might
Iead to the capture of the suspect

551
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:20,216
who escaped from state custody
on Tuesday.

552
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:23,488
It was specificaIIy noted
that citizens shouId come forward

553
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:26,724
if they might have knowIedge of anyone
aiding the aIleged killer in his escape.

554
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,766
An FBl spokesman noted
that Turrell,

555
00:54:28,937 --> 00:54:31,303
who is thought to have already traveled
beyond police roadblocks,

556
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:33,997
has severaI fansites on the internet
dedicated to him

557
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:37,303
and a Facebook fan page with membership
in the hundreds of thousands.

558
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:40,447
WhiIe some of this is no doubt intended
as galIows humor, it remains a reaIity

559
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:43,777
at least three Turrell copycat slayings
are currentIy under investigation...

560
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:47,785
A shortcut.

561
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:50,014
Anchor:...assistance in continuing
to evade custody.

562
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,351
Anyone with knowledge or
suspected knowIedge of any such activity

563
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:55,621
is asked to contact their local
Iaw enforcement agency immediately.

564
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:04,036
Oh, wait wait.
I'Il be right back.

565
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:26,385
Hey.
Hey man.

566
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,824
Hey. Hey.

567
00:55:28,997 --> 00:55:30,658
Hey, what-?

568
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:57,886
Excuse me.

569
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:01,491
You're CarIa's IandIord, right?

570
00:57:01,658 --> 00:57:02,920
Yeah.

571
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:05,084
Yeah, have you seen her today?

572
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:07,593
Not today.

573
00:57:07,764 --> 00:57:11,598
l guess the last time l saw her was

574
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:13,669
the day before yesterday.

575
00:57:13,837 --> 00:57:16,305
Okay. CouId you just-

576
00:57:16,473 --> 00:57:19,567
if you see her, couId you teII her that
her friend from work is looking for her?

577
00:57:19,743 --> 00:57:21,973
Sure.
What's your name again?

578
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:23,510
Sarah.

579
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,013
Just teII her to caII me if you-

580
00:57:27,183 --> 00:57:29,174
No problem.

581
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:01,182
- There you go.
- Kevin: Mm, thanks.

582
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,684
Yeah.

583
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:05,380
- Want some of this?
- No.

584
00:58:05,557 --> 00:58:08,321
Sure? lt's reaIIy good.

585
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:10,825
l'm sorry.
I'm distracted.

586
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,630
My- my friend

587
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:18,735
didn't show up for work.

588
00:58:18,903 --> 00:58:21,463
And l tried calling her.

589
00:58:21,638 --> 00:58:23,663
- Which friend?
- CarIa.

590
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:28,803
l went by her house
and she wasn't there.

591
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,709
She's- it's just-

592
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,817
Kevin: Do you want to talk
to the police?

593
00:58:33,986 --> 00:58:36,318
We can go in there
after group

594
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:38,353
and just talk to them
for a second.

595
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:40,583
Maybe somebody's
heard something.

596
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,760
Sarah:
She's probabIy fine.

597
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:55,528
I'm feeIing kind of weird today.

598
00:58:56,776 --> 00:58:59,768
l guess you guys probably heard
about the murders Iast night.

599
00:58:59,945 --> 00:59:01,776
Woman: No.

600
00:59:01,947 --> 00:59:03,209
No?

601
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:07,580
Okay, weII, Smitty's-
that bar on old 63-

602
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,618
there was a couple mur-
a coupIe guys got murdered.

603
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:11,847
They got stabbed to death
in the parking lot.

604
00:59:12,023 --> 00:59:14,617
And l'm sure it'll be
on the locaI news tonight.

605
00:59:14,794 --> 00:59:19,231
But l guess the deal was
they said their waIlets were missing

606
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:22,594
so it must have been a mugging
gone bad or something.

607
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,133
But, l don't know,
one of the guys was a meth cooker,

608
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:26,895
or had been a meth cooker,

609
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:29,132
so that might have had
something to do with it.

610
00:59:29,308 --> 00:59:31,776
Man, the thing is though, like,

611
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:35,038
Smitty's used to be one of my bars.
And l knew those guys, you know.

612
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:37,479
l used to drink with them
back in the day.

613
00:59:37,651 --> 00:59:40,882
And just seeing that,
hearing about it

614
00:59:41,054 --> 00:59:43,716
kind of got me thinking, you know,
that couId have been me.

615
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,291
Uike, l could have been hanging out
with them tonight or the night before.

616
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,621
And, you know,
whatever happened to them-

617
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:52,230
that could have happened
to me too.

618
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:58,803
l don't know.
So it just kind of put everything

619
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:00,838
in this kind of focus for me,

620
01:00:01,007 --> 01:00:04,636
like nothing good ever comes
of drinking, you know,

621
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:08,474
really, like not ever.

622
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:11,481
So I guess I'm just happy to be

623
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,618
on the, you know, sober path,

624
01:00:13,787 --> 01:00:17,188
not the devil's path.

625
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:19,326
Ueader:
Thank you, Werner.

626
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:29,096
Ueader: All right, with that,
Iet's have a littIe prayer.

627
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:37,876
Group:
Uord, grant me the serenity

628
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:41,776
to accept the things
I cannot change,

629
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:45,179
the courage
to change the things I can,

630
01:00:45,352 --> 01:00:48,617
and the wisdom
to know the difference,

631
01:00:48,788 --> 01:00:51,621
living one day at a time,

632
01:00:51,792 --> 01:00:55,626
enjoying one moment at a time,

633
01:00:55,796 --> 01:00:57,661
accepting hardships

634
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:00,562
as a pathway to peace.

635
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:02,725
Amen.

636
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,233
CarIa.

637
01:02:15,244 --> 01:02:17,974
CarIa, are you in there?

638
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:20,741
lt's me- Mr. Harper.

639
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:25,545
If you can hear me,
l'm coming in now.

640
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,678
CarIa.

641
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:09,090
Oh shit.

642
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,151
Sarah.

643
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:09,249
Sarah.

644
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,896
Oh shit.

645
01:04:12,063 --> 01:04:13,928
l'm so sorry.

646
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,999
l came as soon
as I got your message.

647
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,396
Oh, I'm so sorry.

648
01:04:18,569 --> 01:04:21,595
- l know who kiIled CarIa.
- What?

649
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:24,240
- I know who kiIIed CarIa.
- What? They caught the person?

650
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:27,708
No, it's my ex-boyfriend.
He's gonna kiII-

651
01:04:27,878 --> 01:04:29,402
What?
Your ex-boyfriend?

652
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:32,913
No one's supposed to know who l am.
The FBI- that's why l'm here.

653
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:35,450
- l'm sorry.
- What are you taIking about?

654
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:37,883
The FBl- that's why l'm-

655
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:40,183
- Kevin: What?
- He's gonna kilI me.

656
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:44,219
We have to get out of here.
He's coming after me.

657
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:46,727
- He knows where you live?
- No, you don't understand.

658
01:04:46,898 --> 01:04:49,366
He'll kill you too.

659
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:51,695
l'm sorry.
I didn't know who to caII.

660
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,806
- l'm so sorry. l'm sorry.
- It's okay.

661
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:57,635
- l don't know where to go.
- HoId on a second.

662
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:02,937
All right, my parents
have a pIace-

663
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,049
a cabin, okay?

664
01:05:05,216 --> 01:05:09,050
Nobody is gonna be able
to find us.

665
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:11,086
- AII right?
- Okay.

666
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:13,314
If we go and spend the night there,
are you gonna feeI better?

667
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,153
Yeah.

668
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:16,885
- Okay.
- Thanks.

669
01:05:17,061 --> 01:05:18,926
Uet me just call them
and make sure we can do this.

670
01:05:19,097 --> 01:05:20,086
Okay okay.

671
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:21,959
All right, go put some clothes
in a bag, okay?

672
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:24,159
Okay.

673
01:05:25,436 --> 01:05:27,961
I'II be right here, okay?

674
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,521
PoIiceman: Ma'am, we have to find
the owner of this storage shed.

675
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:08,561
l don't know who owns it.
l toId you Garrick-

676
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:10,221
he was here,
but he doesn't own it.

677
01:09:10,398 --> 01:09:13,526
Ma'am, have you seen exactly
what's in there?

678
01:09:15,505 --> 01:09:17,973
Then you have to tell us
where he is.

679
01:09:18,141 --> 01:09:20,006
He's- he doesn't-

680
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:23,202
he's working in an office
on 29 Crescent.

681
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:24,869
He doesn't have anything
to do with it though.

682
01:09:25,048 --> 01:09:28,381
Send armed units to 29 Crescent Street-
Garrick TurreII.

683
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:02,684
Sarah: I just wanted to pretend
like it didn't happen.

684
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:13,723
You know, l remember

685
01:10:13,898 --> 01:10:16,025
when all this went down.

686
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,896
l remember reading about it
in the papers.

687
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,630
And l didn't read your name.
I never read about you.

688
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:26,368
Sarah: It's part of my deal
for testifying against him.

689
01:10:26,544 --> 01:10:28,478
- lt's part of your deaI?
- Yeah.

690
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:31,273
What, are you
in witness protection?

691
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,384
Sarah:
Supposed to be.

692
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,883
How did they keep that
out of the papers?

693
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:39,454
It's pretty high-profiIe.

694
01:10:46,464 --> 01:10:49,126
Kevin:
Never mind.

695
01:10:49,299 --> 01:10:51,665
Look, we're almost there, okay?

696
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:59,505
AII right, wait here for a sec.

697
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:19,452
Grab your bag, 'cause we're gonna
have to waIk the rest of the way.

698
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:09,546
We have to turn on the electricity.

699
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:12,908
All right.

700
01:12:14,053 --> 01:12:16,078
Come in.

701
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:23,991
What the fuck are you boys
doing here?

702
01:12:24,164 --> 01:12:27,725
You're seriously gonna
keep going with that bulIshit?

703
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:31,667
What, are you using this
as your vacation house, Rusty?

704
01:12:31,837 --> 01:12:34,704
All right, man.
Look, I'm tired of waiting.

705
01:12:34,874 --> 01:12:37,206
lt's time to get down
to business.

706
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:39,776
- What are you taIking about?
- Yeah, aII right.

707
01:12:50,423 --> 01:12:52,914
- Garrick: Sarah, are you awake?
- Sarah: Yeah.

708
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:55,288
- Garrick: Yeah?
- Yeah.

709
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:59,562
- Garrick: Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

710
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:02,726
Garrick: It's kind of
a messed up question.

711
01:13:02,902 --> 01:13:05,370
Okay.

712
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:10,403
If you were gonna die

713
01:13:10,577 --> 01:13:15,276
and you knew you were gonna die
and you couId choose how,

714
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:17,610
what wouId you choose?

715
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,753
Sarah: Uh...

716
01:13:23,055 --> 01:13:26,218
morphine overdose.

717
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:28,622
That'd be-
I think that'd be nice.

718
01:13:28,795 --> 01:13:31,457
- Garrick: ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

719
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:34,258
- That seems kind of weak.
- Weak?

720
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:36,299
Garrick:
Yeah, it's kind of pussy.

721
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,995
Sarah: It's not.
You just asked me if l wanted to die.

722
01:13:40,908 --> 01:13:43,069
Sarah:
WeIl, how would you want to die?

723
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:44,609
- Garrick: How do l want to die?
- Yeah.

724
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:47,145
Something reaIly hardcore.

725
01:13:47,314 --> 01:13:48,645
Like what?

726
01:13:48,817 --> 01:13:51,251
l don't know.
Like...

727
01:13:51,419 --> 01:13:53,580
kamikaze pilot.

728
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:55,450
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

729
01:13:55,624 --> 01:13:58,115
Sarah:
No, you wouldn't.

730
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,658
- Garrick: Good night.
- Yeah.

731
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:25,008
She's awake.

732
01:14:25,186 --> 01:14:27,381
- Sarah: Kevin.
- Rusty: It's about time.

733
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:29,614
Kevin.

734
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,384
You want me to give her something
so she won't pass out?

735
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:34,825
Sarah: Kevin, pIease pIease.
PIease Iet me go.

736
01:14:34,996 --> 01:14:36,554
Kevin:
Like what?

737
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:39,359
Rusty: l don't know.
Like some crank or something.

738
01:14:39,534 --> 01:14:41,399
- Do you have any crank?
- Kevin, pIease.

739
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:45,062
Rusty:
No, but I can get some.

740
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,333
Please, Kevin, please.

741
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:48,874
- What are you doing?
- What?

742
01:14:49,045 --> 01:14:50,672
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

743
01:14:50,845 --> 01:14:53,405
- l'm gonna have some fun with this one.
- No no.

744
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:56,745
She's way hotter
than that coworker skanky bitch

745
01:14:56,918 --> 01:14:58,977
that Reed fucked up.

746
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:04,826
Kevin, l don't know why
you had to fuck her poor face up.

747
01:15:04,993 --> 01:15:07,928
She was pretty good-Iooking
before that.

748
01:15:08,097 --> 01:15:12,033
Just roII her over

749
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,929
and fuck her in the ass.

750
01:15:14,103 --> 01:15:15,695
From the mouths of babes.

751
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:18,270
- Kevin: Nobody's gonna fuck her, okay?
- Reed: That's what I wouId do.

752
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,931
- Kevin: Nobody's gonna fuck her.
- What? And why not?

753
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:26,210
lt's like we get a girl in the room
and you guys forget why we're here.

754
01:15:26,383 --> 01:15:28,783
This is the bitch

755
01:15:28,951 --> 01:15:30,714
that put Garrick TurreII
behind bars-

756
01:15:30,887 --> 01:15:32,013
Sarah: No.

757
01:15:32,188 --> 01:15:35,089
-the greatest killer
of our generation

758
01:15:35,257 --> 01:15:37,919
and my own personal
goddamn fucking hero.

759
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:41,728
After aII the fucking time we put in

760
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:43,956
trying to find her,

761
01:15:44,133 --> 01:15:46,397
all the time on the site,

762
01:15:46,568 --> 01:15:48,763
we're finaIIy here, guys.

763
01:15:54,444 --> 01:15:56,708
- How wouId Garrick do it?
- Sarah: PIease.

764
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,780
- Reed: The feet.
- Kevin: Mm-hmm. Why?

765
01:15:58,948 --> 01:16:01,473
- Breaks the spirit.
- Are you Iistening?

766
01:16:01,651 --> 01:16:03,812
If you hurt their feet,
they can't run away.

767
01:16:05,054 --> 01:16:07,955
So even if she
manages to escape,

768
01:16:08,124 --> 01:16:11,116
- she knows she's not going anywhere.
- PIease.

769
01:16:11,294 --> 01:16:13,728
'Cause how can you run
when you can't even walk?

770
01:16:13,897 --> 01:16:16,661
- Please please.
- Shh, he's taIking. Shh.

771
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,893
Kevin.

772
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:26,837
Sarah: No no no!

773
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:29,275
Kevin: Yeah, Reed.
Yeah yeah, shut her up.

774
01:16:29,447 --> 01:16:31,779
Shut her up.

775
01:16:34,418 --> 01:16:38,286
Shh. Shh shh.

776
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:40,753
Shh.

777
01:16:40,924 --> 01:16:43,324
Come on.

778
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:54,030
Shh shh.

779
01:16:54,204 --> 01:16:55,831
Come on, Reed,
shut her up.

780
01:16:56,006 --> 01:16:57,940
Reed:
You want to do it?

781
01:17:14,325 --> 01:17:16,020
Who the fuck is that?

782
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:22,155
Shh.

783
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:29,665
You two just need
to caIm down.

784
01:17:48,058 --> 01:17:50,424
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

785
01:17:50,594 --> 01:17:54,052
Hey man, thanks
for having me, sincerely.

786
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:56,563
Garrick.

787
01:18:02,674 --> 01:18:05,438
Was it you who sent me
aII those Ietters?

788
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:08,046
Well, we all sent you letters.

789
01:18:08,214 --> 01:18:11,741
- l told you how to get here.
- Ah.

790
01:18:11,918 --> 01:18:14,716
He sent me a code
so that l couId find you.

791
01:18:14,887 --> 01:18:18,015
Made sense to me. l mean,
I knew you had a friend Iiving here.

792
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:22,527
That was very clever.

793
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:24,595
- Thank you.
- No one eIse saw that.

794
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:26,391
Reed: l really appreciate that.
Thank you.

795
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:28,863
Yeah. l am a bit curious though,

796
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:32,266
um, about what exactly it is

797
01:18:32,437 --> 01:18:35,133
you're doing to her there.

798
01:18:38,377 --> 01:18:40,971
Hmm?

799
01:18:45,283 --> 01:18:47,148
Finishing your work.

800
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,754
- My work?
- Yeah, man.

801
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:52,948
We're gonna kill the bitch
who put you away.

802
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:56,117
She's the reason
you got caught.

803
01:18:56,295 --> 01:18:59,321
We're just trying
to fucking heIp you out.

804
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,094
Why would l want to kiII her?

805
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:10,142
'Cause it's- it's her fauIt.

806
01:19:12,513 --> 01:19:14,845
Yes. Yeah.

807
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:19,417
Our reIationship-
mine and Sarah's-

808
01:19:19,585 --> 01:19:22,349
was based on
a mutuaI understanding

809
01:19:22,522 --> 01:19:25,150
and trust-

810
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:28,352
trust that l'd be a normal man

811
01:19:28,528 --> 01:19:30,428
and that we'd have a happy,

812
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,929
normal relationship

813
01:19:33,098 --> 01:19:35,123
together.

814
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:37,861
ClearIy I- I fucked that up.

815
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,044
I don't bIame Sarah...

816
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:49,511
...for caIIing the poIice when she
found out I couId never give her that.

817
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:53,147
And fuck,

818
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,118
God knows I'd do the same thing
if l was in her position.

819
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:04,153
Besides, l liked it in prison.

820
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,532
Rusty:
Okay, he's fucking with us.

821
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,829
- Have you ever been to prison?
- Yeah.

822
01:20:10,004 --> 01:20:13,963
Yeah? Okay, weII, then you know how
hard it is to hurt somebody in there,

823
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,633
especiaIIy if you're
in soIitary confinement,

824
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:18,972
which l was.

825
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,172
You know, no weapons,

826
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:24,181
guards, cameras everywhere.

827
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:26,912
Everyone's aware
of their own space.

828
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,921
Reed: And why wouId you Iike that?

829
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,888
l was happy there.

830
01:20:35,062 --> 01:20:37,587
l was calm.

831
01:20:37,765 --> 01:20:39,357
You know- you know what?

832
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:43,025
This is the truth-
I'd have never Ieft there

833
01:20:43,203 --> 01:20:47,230
if it wasn't for aII those Ietters
from you assholes.

834
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,604
You don't understand
what I mean, do you?

835
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:54,839
- No, l don't.
- Okay. Okay.

836
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,882
l can make it clear.

837
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,714
l just need an example.

838
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:04,586
Can I see your gun
for a minute?

839
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:06,056
Are you fucking kidding me?

840
01:21:06,227 --> 01:21:08,593
No, man, just for a second.
l'lI give it right back.

841
01:21:08,764 --> 01:21:11,096
Rusty, just give him the gun.

842
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,358
Huh-uh.

843
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,866
Are you fucking crazy, Reed?

844
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,197
No, look, if it makes you feel
more safe,

845
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,135
take the bullets out
before you give it to me.

846
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:22,640
This is my fucking gun.
Nobody's getting it but me, man.

847
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,716
That's fine.
That works too.

848
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,148
- Reed: You motherfucker!
- Nol

849
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:39,782
Sarah: No! No!

850
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:49,100
Garrick, I'm so sorry.

851
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:53,166
Garrick, I didn't mean
anything by it.

852
01:21:56,813 --> 01:21:58,280
You're my hero.

853
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,187
Baby, you gotta untie me.

854
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:18,259
CouId you, pIease?
PIease.

855
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,992
Please.

856
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:21,500
- l know.
- Could you? Could you?

857
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:23,866
CouId you?
Come on. Come on.

858
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:27,373
Baby, baby, baby.

859
01:22:27,544 --> 01:22:29,307
Come on.

860
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:32,641
Garrick:
Hey. Hey.
