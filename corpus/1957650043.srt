Look at you.

- Oh God.

26
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,260
- I missed you so much.

27
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,730
- Look at you, I leave
you alone for four years

28
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,070
and look what happens to
you, you've grown up on me.

29
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,430
Rainie when I saw her
last she was a skinny,

30
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,214
freckle-faced girl,
now look at her, golly.

31
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,660
She's a knockout, isn't she a knockout?

32
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,783
- [Rainie] Knocked me out.

33
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,367
- Wait, where's grandpa?

34
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:34,367
- Grandpa's not doing so good Billy.

35
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,700
- I wanna go see him.

36
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,815
- Let's go.

37
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:40,972
- [Billy] Well how'd you get here?

38
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:42,007
- I drove.

39
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,840
- You're driving now!

40
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,804
- Yeah, so next week I get
to take the training wheels

41
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:46,726
off my bicycle.

42
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:47,800
- God, okay.

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,633
- Say you mind if I catch a ride

44
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,789
to the bus station with y'all?

45
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:51,960
- It's okay with me if you don't mind

46
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,260
riding with a baby sister.

47
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,480
- Be my baby any day.

48
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,221
- You're Rainie Pritchard aren't ya?

49
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,837
- [Rainie] The one and only.

50
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,033
- That's Stumpy?

51
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,032
- That's Stumpy.

52
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:03,710
- [Rainie] That's what
they used to call me.

53
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,350
- Boy this place has sure built up

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,113
since the last time I was here.

55
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,640
So you're a college girl now, huh?

56
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,160
- If I don't get through this trig course

57
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,010
I won't be for long.

58
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,491
- What college are you going to?

59
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,491
- Centenary.

60
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,070
- Isn't that expensive?

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,708
- I'm on a scholarship.

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,135
- For what?

63
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:24,968
- Choir.

64
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,044
- Watch where you're going.

65
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:27,300
- I see him.

66
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,307
- Choir, they give scholarships for that?

67
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,640
(chuckling)

68
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,963
So, how come you haven't
asked me about my leg yet?

69
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:47,114
- What happened?

70
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,034
- Iwo Jima.

71
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,193
Caught a slug right below the knee.

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
I woulda bled to death if old Rainie here

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,190
hadn't pulled me to safety.

74
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:12,211
- They couldn't save it?

75
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,350
- They didn't even have time to try.

76
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,253
Not with all the casualties
they were tending to.

77
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,779
You know what that's called?

78
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,280
What?

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,630
Rainie you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

80
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:34,883
It's called triage.

81
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:39,576
- What's triage?

82
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,150
- Well let's say you
got a boy in a stretcher

83
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,200
with a chest wound and
in the next stretcher

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,500
you got someone else
with a severe head wound,

85
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,013
well the doctors are gonna
treat the chest wound,

86
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,680
because the poor sap that
got shot in the head,

87
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,980
well he's a gonner anyhow.

88
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,910
And if you've got a mangled leg,

89
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,282
well it's a heck of a lot easier

90
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,820
to take a hacksaw to it than it is

91
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,583
to piece it together again, that's triage.

92
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,117
And that's what happened
to my leg little sister.

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,813
And that is what the war is all about.

94
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:22,371
(dramatic music)

95
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,871
- I'm sorry Billy.

96
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,003
- We're home Billy, we made it.

97
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,270
So what's for supper Sara?

98
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,281
(snoring)

99
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,551
- [Billy] Grandpa.

100
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,593
Grandpa.

101
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,650
- Who's that?

102
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,720
- Hey, it's me, Billy.

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
- [Will] Billy?

104
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,433
- Yeah.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,093
- Billy!

106
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh my goodness my boy, good to see you!

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,900
How are ya, you made it home did ya?

108
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,733
Let me look at ya.

109
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:19,610
- [Billy] I did, I made it back.

110
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,170
- My golly, look at them medals
and stripes, and everything,

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,130
how in the world are you?

112
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,553
- [Billy] I'm good, how are you?

113
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,480
- Well I'm fine as frog's hair.

114
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,490
- Oh, that's not what I hear.

115
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,690
- Who's this fella here?

116
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
- Rainie Pritchard, sir.

117
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,773
- You remember Rainie, from back home?

118
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,300
We were in the same outfit together.

119
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,370
- He's the one that saved Billy's life.

120
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,040
- Why I sure do, welcome
here my boy, good to see ya.

121
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,049
- [Sara] Grandpa now, let's
not get yourself too worked up,

122
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,049
boys let's let grandpa.

123
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,840
- Now wait a minute, they just got here.

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,587
- You'll see plenty of them after supper,

125
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:53,836
now I'll bring yours in directly.

126
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,384
- You will not, I'm getting up,

127
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,151
I'm having supper at the table.

128
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,373
(upbeat music)

129
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,206
- Come on.

130
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,020
(laughing)

131
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,610
- Rainie let me get you
another piece of pie.

132
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,760
- No, no, no I can't, I'm full.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,340
- Oh, come on you've only had two.

134
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,410
- Billy, will you do something
about your little sister,

135
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,243
she's killing me.

136
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,080
- I can't help you there buddy,

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
she's got a mind of her own.

138
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,960
- I'll have a piece of that pie.

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,110
- Grandpa, you know
you can't have any pie.

140
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,625
- You can't control the girl.

141
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,603
- Well I don't think she's all that tough.

142
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,500
- Well you just might be surprised.

143
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,623
- You never can tell.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,360
Say, anybody know what time it is?

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,193
- I do!

146
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,143
Quarter to 9:00.

147
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:47,140
- The last bus leaves at
9:30, I better be going.

148
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,320
- Oh I can get you there, but
we'd have to leave right now.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,660
- [Rainie] You don't mind?

150
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,833
- No, no, not at all.

151
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,640
- [Rainie] Sorry I gotta
eat and run partner.

152
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,910
- Well you want me to go with ya?

153
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,880
- [Sara] Oh, no thanks Billy.

154
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,111
- No, no, that's okay, I'll be happy to.

155
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,777
- No thanks, Billy.

156
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:04,610
- Nice seeing you Mr. Coleman.

157
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,090
- Good to meet you sir.

158
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,350
- Take care.

159
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,560
- I'll be back soon.

160
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,974
- [Will] You drive carefully you hear?

161
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,141
- [Sara] Okay.

162
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,092
- Well, what's the matter with you?

163
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:20,925
(scoffing)

164
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,593
- You're just gonna let her go like that?

165
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,383
- Why not?

166
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,680
- Grandpa, Rainie's my best
friend, but that doesn't mean

167
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,593
I like that fact that
he's with Sara, alone.

168
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,490
I've seen this guy in action,

169
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,163
and I don't mean the battlefield.

170
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,980
- I don't think you're
giving your little sister

171
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,594
enough credit, she's a
grown woman you know.

172
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:48,770
- I know, and that's what worries me.

173
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,963
- Don't worry, she can
take care of herself.

174
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:57,380
Now I'm going out on the
porch, why don't you bring

175
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,853
your coffee and come with me?

176
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,823
- Gosh, it sure feels good

177
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,260
to drive a car after all this time.

178
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,380
It's funny the things you
miss when you're away.

179
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,023
- I read your letter and
I'm sorry about your leg.

180
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,020
You know, they tell me
that the coon hunting

181
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,930
around here is number one.

182
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,945
- Is that so?

183
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,130
(chuckling)

184
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,240
Well, I haven't been coon
hunting in a long time grandpa,

185
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,513
not since I was a kid.

186
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,265
(soft music)

187
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,363
- Maybe it's about time
you tried it again?

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,603
- No, I don't think so, not with this leg.

189
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:52,082
- Billy,

190
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,520
you remember when you was a young fella

191
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,750
and you had a tough time saving
up the money for that dog,

192
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,357
what was it Red Boy?

193
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,683
- Old Dan and Little Ann.

194
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,890
- You remember how we
talked about you making

195
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,790
a deal with God, and how
if he held up his end

196
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,573
of the bargain you'd meet him halfway?

197
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,200
Did you do that, did you meet him halfway?

198
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,311
How do you know?

199
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,533
- 'Cause I got my dogs.

200
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,417
- No different now you know?

201
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,603
Just gotta meet him halfway.

202
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,380
Would you be at all interested in

203
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,910
looking and seeing what's out in the barn?

204
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,128
(chuckling)

205
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:51,663
- You better not have.

206
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,897
- Welcome home my boy, this
old man's going to bed.

207
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,433
- Grandpa, come on.

208
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,219
- What?

209
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,110
- I'm not gonna go stumbling around

210
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,010
in the dark just to check out the barn.

211
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,910
- There's a lantern
hanging right on the corner

212
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,743
of the house.

213
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,070
- [Billy] What about the yard is it level?

214
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,343
- No sir, it's bumpy,
it's bumpy all the way.

215
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,543
There's nothing guaranteed you know?

216
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,260
- You're messing with me old man.

217
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,262
(upbeat music)

218
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,503
- Well Sara, thank you for the ride.

219
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,263
And you take care of that
no good brother of yours.

220
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,773
- When will we see you again?

221
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,313
Billy would wanna know.

222
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:26,840
- Well that depends.

223
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,740
- Depends on what?

224
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,223
- If we're gonna go out Saturday night.

225
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,823
- Saturday, Saturday let me see.

226
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,178
- I'll pick you up at 8:00.

227
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,813
- Old man.

228
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:17,959
Oh boy I'm gonna drown you

229
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,374
if you're messing with me tonight.

230
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,791
(soft music)

231
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,485
(puppies whimpering)

232
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:04,740
(chuckling)

233
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,233
I don't need this!

234
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:11,835
(upbeat music)

235
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:21,771
(scoffing)

236
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:24,638
(chuckling)

237
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,758
Look at this.

238
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:29,758
Huh, look at this, yeah
you like that don't you?

239
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,084
Great.

240
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,396
You ready to go out, huh?

241
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,646
You ready to go out with me?

242
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:39,479
Come here.

243
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,433
I don't have time for this.

244
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:49,433
Come here you, come on.

245
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:56,803
(sighing)

246
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,633
Come on get back in.

247
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,852
You're gonna drive me nuts, no stay.

248
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,270
Get in there, get back down,
you're gonna drive me crazy.

249
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,593
Get in, come on.

250
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,523
There you go, get your tail off.

251
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:18,485
Get in there.

252
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:21,213
(chuckling)

253
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:23,463
I don't have time for this!

254
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:25,490
Come on.

255
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,153
(chuckling)

256
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,600
- Well he knew the trouble we went to

257
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,143
to get the dogs for you,
not to mention the money.

258
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,270
Think of all the clothes
I could've bought.

259
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,947
- Sara, I'm sorry okay, but
you should've asked me first.

260
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,510
I mean I don't want the dogs,

261
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,323
I don't need the responsibility.

262
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Look, it was a very sweet
thing that you and grandpa did

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,771
but I just I can't have
it, it's not gonna work.

264
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,730
- It wasn't something me and grandpa did,

265
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,160
it was all his idea, and all his money.

266
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,693
- Well fine then, fine I'll pay him back.

267
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,100
- You're gonna break his heart.

268
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,240
Billy, just keep the dogs!

269
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,240
- Sara I can't, I don't know
how long I'm gonna be here.

270
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm planning on sending
out job applications,

271
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,550
that might take me away from here.

272
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,260
Sara, I just, I have
to get on with my life.

273
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,963
I can't keep doing this.

274
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,580
- Then just keep the dogs
while grandpa's still with us?

275
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,550
- How long's that gonna be?

276
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,640
Sara, he doesn't look that critical to me.

277
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,200
- Well I know he doesn't look it,

278
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,820
but the doctors have given him two months,

279
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,080
three months at the
longest to live, who knows,

280
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,713
you may get lucky, he may
die before you get a job.

281
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,120
- That's nice, that's really nice.

282
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,093
- Okay, I'm sorry.

283
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,553
Just look at the dogs.

284
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,963
- I looked at the dogs all last night.

285
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:14,663
- Good morning sweet pea,
isn't she the sweetest thing?

286
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,693
Hello.

287
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,423
(soft music)

288
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Just long enough for grandpa to see.

289
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,341
What are you gonna name 'em?

290
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,603
- Well the other dogs
were named Ann and Dan,

291
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:46,570
and they looked a lot like these two.

292
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,270
- Well then, why don't you
just call them Ann and Dan?

293
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,200
- I guess I could couldn't I?

294
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
What do you say about that Little Ann?

295
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,293
Huh, you like that name?

296
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:58,733
- I think she likes it.

297
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:02,309
- What do you think about Old Dan, huh?

298
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,475
What do you think about Old Dan?

299
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:09,392
I think he wants to get
back to bed, don't you?

300
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:11,892
Thank you for keeping him.

301
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,368
- Hey, let's go into grandpa's room,

302
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:16,213
let's wake grandpa up.

303
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,046
- Ah!

304
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:17,879
- Okay?

305
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,379
- Okay, all right.

306
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,769
- What's going on here?

307
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,983
What's going on here?

308
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:38,965
What's going on here?

309
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:40,980
Oh my goodness, that's a heck of a way

310
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,913
to wake an old man up
out of a sound sleep.

311
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:46,230
- I think they like him.

312
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,663
- Oh grandpa, you done it again.

313
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,320
All right guys, get the
coon scent, come on.

314
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,970
Get the coon scent, there you go.

315
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,600
Okay Sara, I want you to rub
this good in the ground first,

316
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,300
then drag it along,

317
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,660
and bring it around the
corner of the house.

318
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,903
- Okay,

319
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:08,736
like this?

320
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,223
- Right, even more.

321
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,220
Okay, and then go around and hide it

322
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,663
behind that pecan tree.

323
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,010
Let's just see if these mutts have

324
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,363
a nose on 'em old man.

325
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,883
Okay guys, here's the deal,

326
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,970
if you want me to train
you to be coon hunters

327
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,860
you better do your end of
the bargain, you understand?

328
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,453
And I promise to do my part.

329
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,360
But, if you don't turn out to
be as good as I used to have,

330
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,990
if you just wanna be a
bunch of lazy, flea bitten,

331
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,740
front porch biscuit eaters,
well, that's fine by me.

332
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,590
I won't have nothing to do
with you then, you understand?

333
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,126
- Homer!

334
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:52,709
(honking horn)

335
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,383
- Who's that?

336
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,380
- That's Homer Jeffries
and his boy Wilson,

337
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,533
they live up the road.

338
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,863
- Sara, you ready?

339
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,873
Okay, here goes nothing.

340
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,303
Go get it, go on.

341
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,690
Well if you clear a space
for them there on the porch

342
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,311
I'll just tell Sara to
go cook those biscuits.

343
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:21,984
- Come here, come here.

344
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:22,952
Come here, come here.

345
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:24,568
(upbeat music)

346
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,318
Slow down, come here.

347
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,426
(dogs growling)

348
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,496
Good boy.

349
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,101
Good, yeah.

350
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:54,907
Good boy.

351
00:22:57,915 --> 00:23:00,583
- Old Dan, Little Ann, come on, come on.

352
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:04,795
Dan, puppy, puppy, puppy,
puppy, puppy, come here.

353
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:09,167
Little Ann, Little Ann
come on, come on let's go.

354
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:12,750
Little Ann, come here
girl, come here girl.

355
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:14,867
Good girl, good girl.

356
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,134
Good boy, you want another one?

357
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:17,277
You have to listen to me.

358
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:20,997
Come here, Little Ann, Little Ann come on.

359
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,936
Don't eat the flowers, come on.

360
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:24,597
Come on dude.

361
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:28,267
Come on Little Ann, Little
Dan come on, come on, come on.

362
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,496
There you go.

363
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:32,079
(upbeat music)

364
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:43,457
(happy chatting)

365
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:51,182
Come on, come on.

366
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:59,147
(both talking)

367
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,202
Go get it, go get it Dan.

368
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:04,762
You're gonna have to fight for it.

369
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:07,679
Fight for it, come on get in there.

370
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,172
You tired, you had enough?

371
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,471
Good boy, they're pretty good.

372
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:19,961
- [Sara] Good girl.

373
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,249
- Old Dan.

374
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,161
- Did he wear you out?

375
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:22,994
- Way to go.

376
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,243
- Let's go to sleep, let's get
a good night's sleep, okay?

377
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:27,798
All right get down and go to sleep.

378
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,710
- [Billy] You gonna be
nice to your sister, huh?

379
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:32,191
- [Sara] Come on.

380
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:34,019
- [Billy] No fighting.

381
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,918
- Now you go to sleep.

382
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:38,519
Get a good night's rest, give me a kiss.

383
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,352
Goodnight.

384
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:41,400
- [Billy] Watch out.

385
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,805
- Let your legs go to sleep, night-night,

386
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:46,722
go on to sleep Old Dan.

387
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,223
(soft music)

388
00:24:59,223 --> 00:25:00,723
- [Billy] Tell me about choir.

389
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:05,047
I didn't know you had a good voice.

390
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:05,880
- I have a great voice.

391
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,713
- [Billy] Do ya?

392
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,060
What's your favorite song,
what do you like to sing?

393
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,668
- [Sara] Amazing Grace.

394
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:12,849
- [Billy] Oh, everybody
sings Amazing Grace.

395
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,089
You gotta stand out, you gotta be like.

396
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:17,550
- [Sara] I'm studying very carefully.

397
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,704
- [Billy] If you want to
stand out at Centenary

398
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:22,373
you gotta sing something
else like Stars and Stripes.

399
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,956
(upbeat music)

400
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:29,220
- Here, you tore my book for heck's sake.

401
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:33,635
Don't you have no wrecks on my bed here.

402
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,166
- Go, go team go!

403
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,749
(dogs barking)

404
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,071
Get up Dan, come on buddy,
come on, come on, come on,

405
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,590
come on, come up, that's right,
there you go, there you go!

406
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,452
Come on, come on Ann.

407
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,461
(soft music)

408
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:23,294
(people chatting)

409
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:02,617
- All right, I can get this, I've got it.

410
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:03,917
(chuckling)

411
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:04,917
- I'm sorry.

412
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,780
- You know those people act like

413
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,520
they ain't never seen
no one in a wheelchair.

414
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,083
- Or, with a gimp leg.

415
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,473
- Yeah, or with a gimp leg.

416
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,890
- And we were going up Mount Suribachi.

417
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,620
- Say, did you help raise the flag?

418
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,293
- No, no, I didn't get quite that far.

419
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,873
Anyhow,

420
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,950
all of a sudden, I mean from
all around, every direction.

421
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,783
- Both flanks.

422
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,353
- Both flanks.

423
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:59,553
My buddies were falling left and right,

424
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,193
and I caught one right below the knee.

425
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,450
And you know what the
funny thing about it was?

426
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,173
It wasn't even that
serious, it missed the bone.

427
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,743
- Triage.

428
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:25,990
- Yep.

429
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,510
- What'd you do that for?

430
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,010
What if somebody saw you.

431
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,333
- Well, what if they did little sister?

432
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:50,587
(upbeat band music)

433
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,623
- Rainie.

434
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,750
- Now, don't Rainie me little sister.

435
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,165
You know from the first moment I saw you

436
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:11,165
at the train station I knew
we were gonna be together,

437
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,573
and you did too.

438
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:15,113
And don't try and deny it.

439
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:34,788
Well you're not gonna try
and deny it now are you?

440
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,343
- Stop it, Rainie.

441
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,090
Rainie stop it or I'll scream, I will.

442
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,293
- Well now that won't be necessary,

443
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,143
if you want me to leave you
alone I'd be more than happy to.

444
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,540
- I don't want you to leave me alone, but.

445
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,790
- But what little sister?

446
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,850
- I wish you'd stop calling me that.

447
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,587
I don't want you to leave, but

448
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:17,176
I'm not that kinda girl.

449
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,820
- There's something
you've got to understand,

450
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,270
I'm not one of your little
fraternity boyfriends.

451
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,010
I've been to war, and I've seen killing,

452
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,710
a whole lot of killing,
and if there's one thing

453
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,201
that I learned you know what that is?

454
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,550
That life is short, very short,

455
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,083
it can be over just like that.

456
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,310
No warning, no tomorrow.

457
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,850
So if there's something
you want out of life

458
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,950
you've got to take it,

459
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,690
'cause it might not be there tomorrow.

460
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,504
And darling there's something I want,

461
00:30:56,504 --> 00:31:00,403
right here and right now.

462
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:07,040
- [Sara] Rainie no, Rainie.

463
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,233
- Go on, run back to big brother, go on.

464
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:18,147
God!

465
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,733
- She doesn't have to Rainie, I'm here.

466
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,930
- Look Billy, your sister and I.

467
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,713
Billy.

468
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,880
Look, Billy I am not gonna fight you.

469
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,470
- Too proud to fight a
one-legged man, is that it?

470
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,090
- That has nothing to do
with it, we're buddies Billy.

471
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,553
- Yeah, you shoulda thought of that

472
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,946
before you messed with my sister.

473
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:39,830
- But you don't understand!

474
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,900
- I don't understand, I don't understand!

475
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,980
- Look, are you sure you
didn't catch some shrapnel

476
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,813
in the back of the head?

477
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:46,484
'Cause you're acting like a crazy man.

478
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:47,770
- [Billy] Oh yeah, I'll
show you crazy if I get

479
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,640
my hands on you.

480
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,837
- Go home Billy.

481
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:50,670
- [Billy] Come here.

482
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,503
- Go home.

483
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:51,507
(dramatic music)

484
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,115
- How long you been standing there?

485
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:56,782
- Just a little bit.

486
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:14,303
I'm very, very sorry if I
frightened you last night Sara.

487
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,298
I really am.

488
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:22,701
Well.

489
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,653
- Well, what?

490
00:33:25,915 --> 00:33:26,903
- I said I was sorry.

491
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:33,767
- I got that, see ya later alligator.

492
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:41,445
You still here?

493
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,008
- Your bow.

494
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,223
- It's not a bow, it's a rag roller.

495
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,580
- That right there, that's that tendon

496
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,890
that's runs down along the inside.

497
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,940
- [Rainie] Hey Billy.

498
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,460
- It's a little sore isn't it?

499
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,310
Well, we'll fix that.

500
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,730
- [Rainie] Your dog hurt his leg.

501
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,053
- We'll put some of this on
it, time heals everything,

502
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,330
well almost everything.

503
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,163
- Listen Billy, I came by
to apologize to your sister.

504
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,810
- Did you?

505
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,643
- Yeah.

506
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,280
- Come on, let's put you
back inside your house,

507
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,880
you stay off that leg, you hear?

508
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,000
There you go, good boy.

509
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,290
Something I can do for you?

510
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,040
- I wanted to apologize to you too.

511
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,203
I like your family Billy, I really do.

512
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:08,193
I mean you grandfather, and your sister?

513
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,440
She's the sweetest,
prettiest, young thing I know.

514
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,403
- She's also a sweet, and
pretty young lady, Rainie.

515
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,563
- Yeah I know.

516
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
But I don't know how to treat her Billy.

517
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,770
I mean, you know the kinda women

518
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,620
I've been around the past five years.

519
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,730
I don't know how to treat a good girl.

520
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,260
And I didn't have any sisters growing up.

521
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:42,870
- Rainie come on, having sisters

522
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,653
ain't got nothing to do with this.

523
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,220
Sara wants to be treated
with a little respect.

524
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,840
To be treated as a different person.

525
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,210
What would your daddy
have done if he caught

526
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,540
another man being rough with your mom?

527
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,660
- He woulda killed them.

528
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,783
- [Billy] That's right.

529
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,663
- Billy!

530
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,113
Look,

531
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,663
we've been through a
long, hard fight together.

532
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,270
And even though our side
won I don't feel like

533
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,613
much of a winner, and I
know you don't either.

534
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,122
I mean all that pain.

535
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,693
The killing.

536
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,440
Just when you think this
world is this horrible,

537
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,350
terrible place to live
someone like your sister

538
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,960
comes into your life
and it doesn't seem like

539
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,653
such a terrible place after all.

540
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,580
- Well don't tell that to
me Rainie, tell that to her.

541
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,023
(dramatic music)

542
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,253
Want me to shoot him?

543
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,493
I'll be happy to beat
him up if you want me to?

544
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,840
- No thanks, but I'll
holler if I need you.

545
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,423
- Okay, you do that.

546
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,063
Rainie listen to me, okay?

547
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,420
I can't speak for Sara,

548
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,240
she's old enough to
make her own decisions.

549
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,720
But, if you treat her

550
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,943
anything less than the Queen of England,

551
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,010
Lord help me boy I'm
gonna put a hurt on you

552
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,423
kerosene won't wash off,
do you understand me?

553
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:28,836
- Yes sir, Sergeant.

554
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:35,327
Sara, listen.

555
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:39,200
- No, you listen, and
you listen good buster.

556
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,713
If you ever wanna kiss me
again, you ask me first.

557
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,733
And if I say yes, which I don't often do.

558
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:51,870
Then I want you to give me

559
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,860
a short, sweet, gentlemen like kiss.

560
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,860
Not one of those wet,
slobbery, bathe my face kisses.

561
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:07,531
- Like that?

562
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,250
- You didn't ask me first.

563
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,417
(sighing)

564
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:16,202
- Sara, may I kiss you?

565
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,213
- I suppose.

566
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,064
- Is that okay?

567
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,760
- Howdy neighbor.

568
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,400
- Howdy, how are ya?

569
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,320
Homer Jeffries.

570
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,631
- Billy Coleman, pleased to meet you sir.

571
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:20,464
- [Homer] This is my son Wilson.

572
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:21,297
- Hi.

573
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,300
- You know we only live just
a mile and a 1/2 up the road.

574
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,540
- Yes sir, I know, I've seen
you pass by a couple of times.

575
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,793
My grandfather speaks
very highly of you sir.

576
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,803
- Billy, how is he?

577
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,350
- Well, with all things
considering I'd say

578
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,350
he's doing quite well, thanks.

579
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,273
- Anyhow, the reason why I
stopped is to ask you a favor.

580
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,160
My boy here has been driving me crazy

581
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,568
to stop here and see if you might let him

582
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,143
take a look at them dogs.

583
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:52,304
(chuckling)

584
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:53,137
- Is that so.

585
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:54,450
(dog barking)

586
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,443
Well sure, come on down, be my guest.

587
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,680
- Wilson, just a couple of minutes now,

588
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,610
we gotta get into town.

589
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,711
- Yes, sir.

590
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:02,544
- Okay.

591
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:03,740
- How are you Wilson?

592
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,135
Pleased to meet ya.

593
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:05,968
- Redbones?

594
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,170
- You bet, you a coon hunter?

595
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,003
- You bet.

596
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,353
- You got some dogs?

597
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,573
- No, sir.

598
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,740
- Tell me something Wilson,
is there coom back in here?

599
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,870
- You bet, if you know where to look.

600
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,370
- Yeah, do you know where to look?

601
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,090
- Well, yes, sir, I go
hunting and trapping

602
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,230
just about every night,
and I do all right.

603
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,281
Do a lot better if I
had me some dogs though.

604
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,698
(soft music)

605
00:40:37,545 --> 00:40:39,340
- You know I've been training these dogs

606
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,850
for quite some time now,
and I was thinking about

607
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,800
taking 'em out tonight.

608
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,250
You see, I don't get along
very well on this leg,

609
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,763
and I was hoping I could get some help.

610
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,670
Think maybe you'd like
to come along with me?

611
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,070
- Yes, sir, you mean it?

612
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,853
- You bet, why don't you go ask your pa?

613
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,675
- I'm so excited, I hope
they do good for you.

614
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:11,940
- Well being that it's their first time,

615
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,770
I'm not expecting too much.

616
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,506
Could you pack another
one of those please?

617
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,339
- [Sara] Oh sure.

618
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:17,172
- Thanks.

619
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,940
- Where you going?

620
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,000
- I'm taking the dogs
out tonight, first time.

621
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,133
You know your neighbor, Mr. Jeffries?

622
00:41:31,029 --> 00:41:33,730
He stopped by today and
I asked his son Wilson

623
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,540
to come along with me.

624
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
- Oh, that's nice.

625
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,373
- Yeah.

626
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,750
- You're not gonna be too late.

627
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,500
- Well no, I don't think I'll be.

628
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,333
Why?

629
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,450
- Well, I think tomorrow
morning I'll go to church.

630
00:41:54,206 --> 00:41:55,039
(chuckling)

631
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,010
- All right, would you
like me to go with you?

632
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,840
- Yes I would.

633
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,520
You too.

634
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,803
- Yes, sir.

635
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,733
- Good, well good hunting,

636
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,493
and goodnight.

637
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,197
- He looks really tired,
doesn't he look tired to you?

638
00:42:26,423 --> 00:42:29,110
I mean do you think he's
gonna be up to getting dressed

639
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,286
and going to church tomorrow?

640
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:32,613
- I think it'd be good for him.

641
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,900
I was thinking about asking
Rainie to go to church with us.

642
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,733
- Hmm.

643
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,453
Gee, I haven't seen much
of my ex-best buddy.

644
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,950
Is everything okay?

645
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,563
- He is so nice.

646
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,189
Have fun.

647
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:53,022
Thank you.
- Be careful.

648
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,020
- Well, you look like you're about ready.

649
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,853
- Yes, sir.

650
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:00,686
- Hold this.

651
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,140
How is my gang doing tonight?

652
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,120
Little Ann you're looking
very, very pretty.

653
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,868
And Old Dan, you're the
dignified gentlemen, isn't he?

654
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:08,701
- Yes, sir.

655
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:10,560
- I'm counting on you
two, let's not forget

656
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,880
what I've been teaching ya, huh?

657
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,430
You ready to do a little
hunting tonight, huh?

658
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,200
- Yes, sir, Little Ann
looks about ready to go.

659
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,893
- Yeah, she sure is,
okay, grab your lantern.

660
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,120
Now, Wilson, hold on.

661
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,820
Wilson, see there very fired up?

662
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,130
- Yep.

663
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,720
- This is why you have to
listen to me at all times.

664
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,893
It's very important, hey, back!

665
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,010
You have to listen to me at all times,

666
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,146
that is first and foremost,
you understand me?

667
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:37,979
- Yes, sir.

668
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:39,550
- Okay, that's why I
invited you to come along,

669
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,740
to experience this, and the second thing,

670
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,720
you must remain quiet, okay?

671
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,370
Do not speak unless you're
spoken to, is that clear.

672
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,122
- [Wilson] Yes, sir.

673
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:50,400
- All right, now I was gonna
let you handle the dogs tonight

674
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,850
but you gotta be able to pull them back

675
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,916
whenever you have to.

676
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:53,749
- Yes, sir.

677
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:54,715
- You can't let them run
off on you like that.

678
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,548
- Yes, sir.

679
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:56,430
- Okay, come on back Dan.

680
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,580
Think you can do it?

681
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,413
- Yes, sir.

682
00:43:58,413 --> 00:43:59,380
- Okay, you hold onto here.

683
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:02,550
And give me the lantern.

684
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,143
Hey, are you a good runner?

685
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,690
- Yes, sir, pretty good.

686
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,400
- Pretty good, come on
Wilson, this isn't a time

687
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,530
for laziness now, there's
a lot of endurance

688
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,363
involved in this.

689
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,720
Come on, suck in your stomach boy!

690
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,180
Pull back those shoulders.

691
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,665
You gonna be able to run with my dogs?

692
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:20,498
- Yes, sir.

693
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:21,331
- I can't hear you.

694
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:22,201
- Yes, sir!

695
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,280
- Let's do ourselves a little hunting.

696
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,113
Woo hoo!

697
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,883
Let's go!

698
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:32,790
That a boy.

699
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,373
(upbeat music)

700
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:49,293
Give 'em a ya-hoo every once in a while.

701
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:50,126
- Ya-hoo!

702
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,158
- You gotta work on that Wilson.

703
00:44:55,158 --> 00:45:00,158
- [Wilson] Yes, sir.

704
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:06,830
(dogs barking)

705
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:25,825
(raccoon chittering)

706
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,197
- They got one?

707
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,030
- Sure sounds like it.

708
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,270
- What do you want me to do?

709
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,610
- Okay, I want you to
run as fast as you can

710
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,310
and follow 'em, and when you find 'em

711
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,085
you stay with them until I get there.

712
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:50,918
- [Wilson] Yes, sir.

713
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:51,751
- Okay, get going.

714
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:04,254
- [Wilson] Ya-hoo!

715
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:09,021
- Ya-hoo!

716
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,693
(dramatic music)

717
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,531
- Great, now what?

718
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:22,758
Mr. Coleman, Mr. Coleman!

719
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:28,806
(groaning)

720
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:37,869
- Damn.

721
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:54,748
(groaning)

722
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,483
(dogs barking)

723
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,802
(dramatic music)

724
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:26,254
Wilson!

725
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:30,337
- [Wilson] Sir, over here,
I'm just ahead of you.

726
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:35,190
- Come on I thought you
said you were a coon hunter?

727
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,290
You gotta keep moving.

728
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:37,983
- Which way?

729
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:43,077
- There, there are the tracks, that way.

730
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,433
That a boy, you gotta tough it out now.

731
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:50,773
Woo, way to go team!

732
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:53,105
Huh?

733
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:55,610
You got 'em in the tree?

734
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,693
Way to go team, okay let's
get the leashes ready.

735
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,643
Way to go Dan,

736
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,083
my boy!

737
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,560
(laughing)

738
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,603
How do ya like that, first time out!

739
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,030
- [Wilson] Now what?

740
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,193
- Well, looks like we're just
gonna have to wait 'em out.

741
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,020
Either that or cut down the tree.

742
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,120
- I've got my hatchet.

743
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,933
(chuckling)

744
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:26,130
- That little thing?

745
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,250
No, we'd be down here all week long

746
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,701
cutting this tree down with that.

747
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:30,534
You know?

748
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:33,284
When I was your age I used
to have a hatchet like that.

749
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,700
First time I went out coon hunting,

750
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:40,450
came up to a big tree like
this and I was cutting away

751
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,652
all night long, I got so tired.

752
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:43,980
(chuckling)

753
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,780
Grandfather gave me heck for it too.

754
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:49,398
We just have to sit down and wait 'em out,

755
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,810
that's the only thing we can do.

756
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,460
And that's liable to
take quite a spell too.

757
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,810
Let's see what time we got here.

758
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,763
Way to go team, I'm so proud of you!

759
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,328
It's 10:30!

760
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,270
I promised my grandfather

761
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,170
I'd take him to church in the morning.

762
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,163
- Church?

763
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,970
- Wilson, I gave him my
word, I've gotta keep it.

764
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,569
- But you gave your word to them too.

765
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:22,120
- I know.

766
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,620
- [Wilson] I'll stay with 'em.

767
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,350
- What, I'm supposed
to give you the rifle?

768
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,183
- Yes, sir.

769
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,193
- Have you ever shot one of these before?

770
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,333
- [Wilson] You bet.

771
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,330
- Well, you know Wilson there's no telling

772
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,260
how long this ringtail's
gonna stay holed up in here.

773
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,680
I mean you could be here all night long.

774
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,710
- Yes sir, but doesn't that also mean

775
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,423
it could be 15 minutes from now?

776
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,153
- Well,

777
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,220
you got a point there.

778
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,703
But it's more likely you're
gonna be here all night long.

779
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,060
Okay.

780
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,863
All right, now look.

781
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,250
This is not a toy, you understand me?

782
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,083
- Yes, sir.

783
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,370
- Now, hold it, put it in your hands.

784
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,400
Now you see here, this is the safety.

785
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,390
Okay, you keep that pressed in
when you're not gonna use it.

786
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,500
- Yes, sir, I know.

787
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,820
- [Billy] You do?

788
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,653
- Yes, sir.

789
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,340
- Now, you're gonna be here
awhile it's not gonna be

790
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,317
coming out in no 15 minutes
so, let's put you over here.

791
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:32,160
- Come on Ann.

792
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,516
- Let's get you comfortable.

793
00:50:33,516 --> 00:50:34,349
- Come on.

794
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,044
- Come on.

795
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:38,646
Come on.

796
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,730
I bet you don't like
fried chicken much do ya?

797
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,563
- Hate it.

798
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:47,447
- Yeah, I bet.

799
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,230
Boy, you're making out
like a bandit tonight.

800
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,403
Got fried chicken, got my dogs.

801
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:56,803
Got a ringtail holed up there.

802
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,620
That looks pretty good.

803
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,483
- I'm starving.

804
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,530
- Say Wilson, I really do appreciate

805
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,260
you watching my dogs for me.

806
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,360
- [Wilson] No problem.

807
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,930
- [Billy] Okay you guys.

808
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,347
(soft music)

809
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,652
- Dan, Little Ann,

810
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:28,278
here you go.

811
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:38,069
Here you go.

00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:34,596
What's happening, did it run?

818

819
00:52:36,178 --> 00:52:39,178

Come on brother Will, come

836
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:58,860
- Well I want to bring my grandson up.

837
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,590
He's just back from the
war and he's a war hero!

838
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,323
Come on Billy.
- Come on Billy.

839
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:06,156
- [Man] Come on Billy.

840
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,942
- [Man] Praise God!

841
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:08,775
- Brother Will, in appreciation

842
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:10,133
for what you've done for this church,

843
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:11,813
for the community and for the Lord's work.

844
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:14,300
We want to give you a small
token of appreciation.

845
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,916
We thank you and appreciate ya.

846
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,821

852
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,583

- Come on Billy, we're on the trail again.

856
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:12,543
We're just about to get him.

857
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:14,547
- Wilson!

858
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:17,360
- Mom.

859
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,420
- [Mom] Where have you been young man?

860
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,630
- [Will] I'll go get them dogs.

861
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,120
- You better answer me.

862
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,710
- Coon hunting.

863
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,490
- Coon hunting!

864
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,323
- Yes, ma'am.

865
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,790
- Mrs. Jeffries I can explain everything.

866
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,640
- And where did you get that rifle?

867
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,130
- Billy gave it to me.

868
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,440
- Billy?

869
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,233
- Mrs. Jeffries, no, no Mrs. Jeffries.

870
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,230
Listen everybody, I'm really sorry about

871
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,580
what happened this morning.

872
00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:49,349
(laughing)

873
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,047
- That wasn't your fault son.

874
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,883
- Well, I was partially
responsible for that.

875
00:55:57,672 --> 00:55:59,550
- Well, if you ask me, Mrs. Jeffries

876
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,320
was completely out of line.

877
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,160
But she swings a mean purse boy.

878
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,743
(all laughing)

879
00:56:08,356 --> 00:56:10,847
- Or when my leg landed in her lap.

880
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:13,430
(all laughing)

881
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:17,430
(soft music)

882
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,263
- Billy,

883
00:56:20,886 --> 00:56:22,660
did you have a little bit of fun

884
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,110
out there during the hunting?

885
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,970
- Well, to tell you the truth

886
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:34,263
it's not like what it used
to be when I was a kid.

887
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,270
But then again, I'm not a kid anymore.

888
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,620
- Rainie and I have an
announcement to make.

889
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:57,220
- Well listen, as you know me and Sara,

890
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,120
we've been seeing a lot of each other.

891
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,033
And well, I've fallen in love with her.

892
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:08,170
(soft music)

893
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,950
And I was thinking if it was okay.

894
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,653
- Rainie's asked me to
marry him, and I said yes.

895
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,523
Gosh, I kinda expected
you'd be happy for me.

896
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,833
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

897
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,570
- Grandpa, I'm gonna knock his head

898
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,281
from his shoulders with one
hand tied behind my back.

899
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,890
- Billy!

900
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,865
- I'm gonna help ya.

901
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:42,282
- [Sara] Grandpa!

902
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:46,272
- Does that mean I have your blessings?

903
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:48,855
(all laughing)

904
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:57,863
- [Sara] Grandpa!

905
00:57:57,863 --> 00:57:58,993
- What is it honey?

906
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,350
- Grandpa, Rainie and
I are going into town,

907
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,517
can I bring anything back for you?

908
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:06,900
- No, no, I'm just fine, you go ahead

909
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,080
and have a good time, be careful.

910
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,680
- Feeling okay today?

911
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,863
- I feel just fine.

912
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,680
- Okay, you get some rest,
I'll be back in a minute.

913
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,230
- Feel like I'm kinda running out of gas.

914
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:40,717
- Son.

915
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,650
Your father and I have had
a long talk, and he feels

916
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,233
very strongly about this,

917
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,876
we're gonna let you have your own dog.

918
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:52,300
- A coon dog?

919
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,470
- No, but Mr. Davis down
at the dry goods store

920
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,280
has a brand new litter of chihuahuas.

921
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,913
- I don't want a stupid
chihuahua, I want a coon dog!

922
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,560
- Well, I am sorry sir,
but you are not going out

923
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,390
hunting coons with dogs, and
running all over the place,

924
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,593
and staying out there with a loaded rifle.

925
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,743
Wilson,

926
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,523
Wilson honey, I love you too much,

927
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,323
I'm sorry.

928
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,093
- Hello, is Mr. Renfro there please?

929
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,240
Mr. Renfro, how do you do sir?

930
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,320
My name is Billy Coleman,
I sent you my resume

931
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:49,320
a little while back, I was
in charge of my outfit's

932
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,160
radio operations, yes sir.

933
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,023
Oh you did, okay.

934
00:59:58,377 --> 00:59:59,453
(chuckling)

935
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:02,253
Yes, sir I think I could start right away.

936
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh no ca, no, I've been to California,

937
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,890
I stayed there a little while

938
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,670
when I was in the Marine Corps.

939
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,570
No, I'm sure I would,
I'm sure I'd love it.

940
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,680
But sir, this is happening a little fast.

941
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,397
My grandfather, he's not
feeling very well right now,

942
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:24,803
and I can't leave him at
this moment, yes, sir.

943
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,447
Well that's nice, I
really appreciate that.

944
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,046
No, thank you, and I'll keep in touch.

945
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,380
I'll let you know what's happening,

946
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,450
thank you for being patient.

947
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,313
Right, thank you sir, bye-bye.

948
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:45,038
Come here, Little Ann, come here.

949
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:47,588
Now you stay here, you
understand me Old Dan, stay.

950
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,370
I'm sorry, but you just
can't go with us this time.

951
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,270
I know you wanna go big
guy, but we just gotta let

952
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:56,783
that leg of yours heal.

953
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,366
(upbeat music)

954
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:48,540
Little Ann, come here girl, you stay.

955
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,760
How's my girl doing tonight, huh?

956
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,970
Ready to go, huh?

957
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:54,470
You stay Old Dan.

958
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,763
Okay, let's go.

959
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,993
Good boy.

960
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:09,530
- You gonna need to
double that wire won't ya?

961
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:13,050
- No, need to, now with
him, he can't figure out

962
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,920
how to open it anyhow,

963
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,800
now, if it was her, I'd
have to chain it closed

964
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,280
with a combination lock.

965
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,900
Of course you'd probably
figure out the combination

966
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:21,800
wouldn't you girl?

967
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,123
Let's go.

968
01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:28,300
Where do you think you're going?

969
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,273
- Well, I'm going with you.

970
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:34,280
- The heck you are,
Sara would skin us both.

971
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,180
Don't be ridiculous grandpa,
you probably haven't been

972
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,083
coon hunting in over 10 years anyway.

973
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,330
Grandpa, I can't take you.

974
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:46,380
I'll tell you what, I will
make you the warmest pair

975
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,620
of coonskin slippers you ever had.

976
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,453
How 'bout that?

977
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:51,200
- I'd like that.

978
01:02:54,445 --> 01:02:56,394
- What do you think you're doing?

979
01:02:56,394 --> 01:02:58,780
- Like I said, I'm going with you.

980
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,557
- [Billy] No, you're not,
I'm not gonna let ya.

981
01:03:01,557 --> 01:03:02,907
- How are ya gonna stop me?

982
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,610
- Don't make me lock you up
in the kennel with Old Dan,

983
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,400
then I'll have Old Dan and
old man, how do ya like that?

984
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,083
- If you think you can
put me in that kennel

985
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,320
with them dogs you just
get right at it mister!

986
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,990
I ain't had a good tussle in years.

987
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,613
- Grandpa come on!

988
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,133
Please, I don't want you to come, okay?

989
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,280
You're not invited.

990
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,713
Not invited.

991
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,170
Can't you take a hint.

992
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:35,650
- You're right you know,
I'm an old man, if you think

993
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,763
for a minute you'll have to wait on me,

994
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,530
don't worry about that.

995
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,310
You know I could out
run you in a foot race

996
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,570
before you was a one-legged smart aleck.

997
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,380
- Okay, fine, you suit
yourself, but I' am not

998
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,136
gonna hold up for you,
you understand that?

999
01:03:51,136 --> 01:03:52,803
- You won't have to.

1000
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,220
(dramatic music)

1001
01:04:17,344 --> 01:04:19,207
- You okay?

1002
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,624
- [Will] I hope you're not waiting on me.

1003
01:04:27,607 --> 01:04:30,440
(Old Dan barking)

1004
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,198
(owl hooting)

1005
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:41,270
- Well, listen up now,
we let that coon dog

1006
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:44,833
flat outsmart us last night,
you know it, and I know it.

1007
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:48,770
But I feel different tonight,
tonight's gonna be better.

1008
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,420
You just have to, well you
have to stick to the basics.

1009
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,747
Pay attention to detail now,
and I know you can do it

1010
01:04:57,747 --> 01:05:01,313
'cause you've turned out to
be one crackerjack coon dog.

1011
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:03,010
You know that?

1012
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,853
You know you're on your own tonight,

1013
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,490
but let's face it, you happen
to be the pair of the two

1014
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:14,490
with the brains, good Old
Dan, what he lacks in brains,

1015
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,400
he definitely makes up
for in determination.

1016
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,283
Girl, come on.

1017
01:05:19,543 --> 01:05:21,400
You gotta stick with 'em you understand?

1018
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,360
Don't leave there until you're done.

1019
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,890
And I'll be right behind ya.

1020
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:25,723
- I will too.

1021
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:29,430
- Now, I might take a
little while to get there,

1022
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,267
but I'll get there.

1023
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:32,568
- And I'll probably be just ahead of him.

1024
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:33,714
- Not a fat chance.

1025
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:34,790
You gonna get me a coon tonight?

1026
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:35,887
Are you girl?

1027
01:05:35,887 --> 01:05:37,201
Huh?

1028
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:39,200
Go on, go to it girl.

1029
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,464
That a girl.

1030
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:44,775
Ya-hoo!

1031
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:47,608
(Old Dan barking)

1032
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:53,937
(upbeat music)

1033
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:02,796
(Little Ann barking)

1034
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:13,942
(Old Dan barking)

1035
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:35,970
I think that old coon is fooling us again.

1036
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:36,803
- Could be.

1037
01:06:38,383 --> 01:06:39,559
- How 'bout a breather?

1038
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:42,142
(upbeat music)

1039
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:03,329
(Old Dan barking)

1040
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:05,823
Over there, you hear that?

1041
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:07,011
- She's on to one son.

1042
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:08,207
- Yep.

1043
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:09,040
(chuckling)

1044
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:09,873
Woo!

1045
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:17,770
Dan, oh dag gonnit, how'd
he get out of there.

1046
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,330
- Maybe next time you'll double that wire.

1047
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:23,583
- No Dan, you big dummy, not that way!

1048
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,570
I'll tell you what, you
go after wonder dog,

1049
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,010
I'll go after Little Ann.

1050
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,020
- I'll tell you what,
you go after wonder dog,

1051
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,270
and I'll go get the coon.

1052
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,363
- All right we'll flip for it.

1053
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,373
- Heads I win, tails you lose.

1054
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:44,780
Good luck with your dog,
and say hello for me.

1055
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,823
I'm coming Annie!

1056
01:07:46,716 --> 01:07:49,448
I'm coming Annie get
the coon, get the coon.

1057
01:07:49,448 --> 01:07:52,031
(upbeat music)

1058
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:18,492
(breathing hard)

1059
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:25,389
(upbeat music)

1060
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:38,840
(whistling)

1061
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,673
- Dan!

1062
01:08:42,174 --> 01:08:43,007
Idiot.

1063
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,870
(whistling)

1064
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:54,360
Dan?

1065
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,400
You see?

1066
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,147
I was afraid this might happen.

1067
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:04,929
Yep, sure was.

1068
01:09:06,745 --> 01:09:09,474
You just had to come along didn't ya?

1069
01:09:09,474 --> 01:09:10,807
You and grandpa.

1070
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:18,927
Now what are we gonna do?

1071
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:20,743
You can't walk on that can ya?

1072
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,363
This is just great.

1073
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:29,480
Lord, I'm stuck out here
with a crippled, dense,

1074
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,383
hard-headed, aggravating animal!

1075
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,483
Well now what?

1076
01:09:41,533 --> 01:09:43,550
Well forget it pal.

1077
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,000
There's no way I'm about
to carry you outta here.

1078
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,897
Man I'll tell you what, I'm gonna

1079
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,786
put you down for a second.

1080
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,023
Okay, let's set you down now, easy.

1081
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:16,113
No, easy, easy, steady,

1082
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,953
you okay?

1083
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,033
Dan,

1084
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,073
you are a load.

1085
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,470
I don't think I'm gonna feed you

1086
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,933
anymore biscuits from now on.

1087
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:35,257
(Little Ann barking)

1088
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,143
I knew it, you hear that?

1089
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,610
Your sister's treed a coon.

1090
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:47,472
(Little Ann barking)

1091
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:48,305
I knew it.

1092
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,453
(breathing hard)

1093
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:55,446
Let's look at your leg.

1094
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,353
It's gotten real sore.

1095
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:04,976
I'll tell you what,

1096
01:11:04,976 --> 01:11:07,103
I don't know why I put
up with you so much.

1097
01:11:09,176 --> 01:11:10,526
Life just isn't fair is it?

1098
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,145
That'll do.

1099
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:18,943
Let me catch my breath before we continue.

1100
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,123
Smell something?

1101
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,430
What's out there?

1102
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,771
You picking up on a trail are ya?

1103
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:32,354
(upbeat music)

1104
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,117
Hurt leg and all.

1105
01:11:37,117 --> 01:11:38,787
Awe, you're just kidding me aren't ya?

1106
01:11:38,787 --> 01:11:39,620
There's nothing out there.

1107
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,453
(Old Dan barking)

1108
01:11:50,824 --> 01:11:52,366
Dan!

1109
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:57,366
I wish you'd give me a warning, Dan!

1110
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,594
Dan.

1111
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:38,921
Dan!

1112
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:43,711
Dan!

1113
01:12:44,933 --> 01:12:47,153
Where'd you go off to now?

1114
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,686
Dan?

1115
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:54,750
(soft music)

1116
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,420
What the heck are you doing up there?

1117
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,580
Dan, what the devil are you doing?

1118
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,020
You just can't stay
out of trouble can you?

1119
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:10,270
Listen, if you think
I'm gonna come up there

1120
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,470
and bring you back down
again, you're crazy!

1121
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,033
Dan, I mean it, get down from there now!

1122
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,170
Wait, stay, stay right there.

1123
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,813
Don't move.

1124
01:13:28,955 --> 01:13:30,605
I'll come and bring ya back down.

1125
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,523
Dang it dog!

1126
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:45,031
Lord.

1127
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,340
I get my leg shot off in the
war, you'd think that'd be

1128
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,163
enough bad luck to last
me a lifetime, oh no.

1129
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:55,710
I gotta get a stupid dog

1130
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,923
that likes to climb trees all of a sudden.

1131
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:06,743
Wagging your tail like a stupid fool.

1132
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:11,274
You don't know how much trouble you're in.

1133
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:20,662
You sure know how to get
into trouble, you know that?

1134
01:14:23,723 --> 01:14:27,981
You certainly don't have the
brains in the family do you?

1135

(Little Ann barking)

1136
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:32,334
- What a good girl.

1137
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,100
(laughing)

1138
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,210
I'm proud of ya sweetheart,
you got him up there,

1139
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,413
he ain't going nowhere,
let's go wait for Billy.

1140
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:42,013
The old man's gotta get his air.

1141
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,806
- Dan I need you to turn your head around,

1142
01:14:46,806 --> 01:14:48,056
just to look at me, okay?

1143
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:54,478
I know you're surprised because
we're very, very high up,

1144
01:14:54,478 --> 01:14:56,595
and I don't wanna make you react more.

1145
01:14:56,595 --> 01:15:01,310
Just listen to me, okay?

1146
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:05,667
Dan please, we gotta use
our heads about this now,

1147
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,239
we're in a lot of trouble,
just listen to my voice.

1148
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,863
I'm gonna come and get you, okay?

1149
01:15:10,863 --> 01:15:13,280

Bill, what happened son?

1165
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,367
- Fell out of a tree.

1166

(somber music)

1173
01:17:51,754 --> 01:17:54,921
I always thought I knew what fair was.

1174
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:59,340
You taught me that.

1175
01:18:03,696 --> 01:18:04,970
When I was a boy running

1176
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:12,353
through these forests I
learned how to trust, and care,

1177
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,970
and believe

1178
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,273
in life, I always have.

1179
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,993
I've always done my part.

1180
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:27,036
- Well,

1181
01:18:30,067 --> 01:18:32,817
it don't seem quite fair does it?

1182
01:18:34,603 --> 01:18:35,436
Your leg,

1183
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,625
and your dog.

1184
01:18:43,743 --> 01:18:48,410
But you know, nobody said it
was gonna be fair, or easy.

1185
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,853
Your dog done what he was bred to do.

1186
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,980
I'm gonna tell you something now I learned

1187
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,160
a long time ago son,

1188
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,500
I learned that if you surround yourself

1189
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,450
with living things, sooner or later

1190
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,200
you're gonna watch 'em die,
and that ain't fair either!

1191
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,650
Hell I don't know the answers,

1192
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,330
I don't even know the questions.

1193
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:21,279
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1194
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:24,713
You know, you talk about these woods and

1195
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:30,160
I don't know what makes these trees

1196
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,210
turn green in the spring, and
shed these leaves in the fall.

1197
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,440
And I don't know what makes
them creeks run downhill,

1198
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,420
and I don't know what makes that dog crazy

1199
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,803
to get a coon in the tree.

1200
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,150
I don't know what that
is, whatever that is,

1201
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,590
whatever that power is

1202
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:52,253
it's a heck of a lot
bigger than me or you!

1203
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:59,240
And I feel like sometimes
I have to give thanks to it

1204
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:03,073
and call it God, I
don't know what fair is.

1205
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:07,571
I don't.

1206
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:11,640
But I know that dog gave his life doing

1207
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,853
what he was bred to do.

1208
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,570
And I know this one ain't dead.

1209
01:20:23,776 --> 01:20:25,943
She treed a coon you know?

1210
01:20:29,947 --> 01:20:33,213
I think it'd be fair if me
and you went and got it.

1211
01:20:33,213 --> 01:20:34,447
I love you my boy.

1212
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:40,387
And I wanna help you through
this, and I don't understand.

1213
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:44,947
Maybe I'm too old, maybe
I never was smart enough.

1214
01:20:50,286 --> 01:20:52,536
You oughta meet me halfway.

1215
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,826

01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:15,274

1243
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,742
Let us pray.

1244
01:23:39,742 --> 01:23:41,330
(soft music)

1245
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:43,720
Father in the name of Jesus,

1246
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,623
we thank you for Brother Will Coleman.

1247
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,075
We thank you for the years
you let us enjoy with him.

1248
01:23:50,075 --> 01:23:54,210
And we ask you to prepare
a special mansion for him.

1249
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,540
And thanks for all the good
things he did for people

1250
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:59,563
while he was here, and for
the work he did for the Lord.

1251
01:24:01,164 --> 01:24:03,628
And we thank you and
give you all the praise

1252
01:24:03,628 --> 01:24:06,128
and glory in Jesus name, amen.

1253
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:14,173
- Hello, Wilson.

1254
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:31,631
Can I talk to you for a minute buddy?

1255
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,793
Wilson,

1256
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:40,340
I decided to take a job in Los Angeles,

1257
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,040
I'm gonna be moving to California.

1258
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,690
- [Wilson] Can't.

1259
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:45,830
- [Billy] Why not?

1260
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,152
- [Wilson] I don't think
they coon hunt out there!

1261
01:24:48,152 --> 01:24:51,290
(chuckling)

1262
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,193
- Well, you might be right there.

1263
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:57,790
And that's why it's
important to keep the spirit

1264
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,683
of coon hunting alive back here.

1265
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:03,873
So I want you to have Little Ann.

1266
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:10,720
- [Wilson] I don't know if my
parents will let me, I mean.

1267
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,923
- [Billy] Well, I think they will.

1268
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:21,640
- Can I have her?

1269
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,740
- You promise me you'll be careful?

1270
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,040
- [Wilson] I promise mama.

1271
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,193
- Okay.

1272
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:36,378
(soft music)

1273
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:40,250
- Now Wilson, ain't it great
having a dog like this,

1274
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,670
it requires a lot of commitment

1275
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:45,390
and a great deal of responsibility.

1276
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,500
Now do you think you can handle that?

1277
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,863
- I'll do my honest best.

1278
01:25:51,785 --> 01:25:56,053
- Hey girl, how would you like
to go home with Wilson here?

1279
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,893
He promises to work with ya,
and take you out hunting.

1280
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:06,130
And love her, and take care of her,

1281
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,803
and you're gonna feed her biscuits, right?

1282
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,267
Okay, 'cause that's
meeting her halfway Wilson,

1283
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,063
that's doing your part, you understand?

1284
01:26:23,059 --> 01:26:26,097
You're a good soldier Wilson.

1285
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,070
Little Ann she's one of the best,

1286
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:29,633
I know you're gonna do right by her.

1287
01:26:29,633 --> 01:26:30,990
- I'll do my honest best.

1288
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:37,063
- Go on, take her,
before I change my mind.

1289
01:26:43,569 --> 01:26:45,316
You be good to Wilson, you're gonna listen

1290
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:47,233
to what he says, go on.

1291
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,785
- Ya-hoo!

1292
01:26:56,237 --> 01:26:57,070
- Wilson.

1293
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:04,325
- Bye, Little Ann.

1294
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:08,462
(sighing)

1295
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:11,525
(soft music)

1296
01:27:11,525 --> 01:27:14,103
(chuckling)

1297
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:16,186
(crying)

1298
01:27:21,077 --> 01:27:22,406
- [Sara] Rainie and I are
going on up to the house,

1299
01:27:22,406 --> 01:27:23,356
you coming with us?

1300
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,560
- Nah, I think I'd like
to hang around here

1301
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,510
for a little while.

1302
01:27:30,475 --> 01:27:31,642
- [Sara] Okay.

1303
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:41,663
(train horn blowing)

1304
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:46,146
(dramatic music)

1305
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,263
- [Billy] After grandpa died
I could still hear his voice.

1306
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:54,950
- [Will] Billy, did you do that?

1307
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:56,283
Did you meet him halfway?

1308
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:02,623
- [Billy] Well, not exactly
grandpa, he found me.

1309
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,160
And you know what else?

1310
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,393
He's been there all along, for everyone.

1311
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:13,113
Sara and Rainie got married in the spring.

1312
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:17,193
Wilson had him the best coon dog ever was.

1313
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,193
And Little Ann, she found
herself the perfect home.

1314
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:27,843
And me, well I'm doing just fine.

1315
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:33,771
And only the good Lord
knows, but maybe one day

1316
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:35,833
he'll help me find another red fern.
