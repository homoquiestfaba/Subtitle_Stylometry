I mean, it's not cool to be homophobic,
but I totally respect your right to be.

313
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,568
Wait, you think I'm homophobic
because I won't embrace a man

00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,737
in his underpants that I just met?
Is that your definition?

315
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,990
But your reaction was really strong.
Borderline violent.

316
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,910
I bet if I were a hot woman in a bikini,

317
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,454
you'd probably be fine hugging me, yeah?

318
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:03,333

hug a hot woman in a bikini

let alone the definition of homophobia.

327

all the questions. Understood?

00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,552
- What's up, bro?
- Dude, that is awesome!

345
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,222
You know, my cousin competed
against you in freestyle.

346
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,516
I cannot tell you how many times
I've seen you ride.

347
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,683
- Like, a billion.
- Ah!

348
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,894
That's so flattering.
Who was your cousin?

349
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,145
Oh, Reed Junior.

350
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,897
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

351
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,315
He was amazing.

352
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,691
I wish he would've stuck with it.

353
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,819
Yeah, me too.

354
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,028
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

355
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,906
Well, hey, look, man, welcome.
I cannot wait to work with you.

356
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,075
- Oh, man. Do you ride?
- Fuck yeah!

357
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,243
Oh, we're gonna ride!

358
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,161
Awesome. You too, Poncharrow.

359
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,329
(BOTH GRUNTING)

360
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,747
BRIAN: Buddy!

361
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,249
- This is gonna be badass!
- It means a lot to me.

362
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,416
Hell, yeah. All right, later.

363
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,085
All right, take care, man.

364
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,766
ARNAUD: Do you have a favorite artist?

365
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,436
RAY: I have a favorite size. Backpack.

366
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,063
We've just the piece for you.

367
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:53,610
Piet Mondrian's <i>Composition No. 7,</i> 1941.

368
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,865
20x26 inches.
And if you pay in cash, it's 14.

369
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,199
Million.

370
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,368
- For this?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,078
Is it finished?

372
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,039
Indeed. You can roll this painting up
and put it in your carry-on.

373
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,625
No matter where you take it
in the world, it's worth 14.

374
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,588
There's no better way to get cash
across the border.

375
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,132
Perfect, I'll take it.

376
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,467
I don't have it, but I'll get you the 14.

377
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,887
Excellent.

378
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,307
CASTILLO: <i>Put that away.</i>

379
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,933
You're going to get us
pegged as slap-dicks. Come on.

380
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,476
JON: <i>What's that? No, I got to take notes.</i>

381

(JON SHUSHING)

382
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,063
- Hi.
- Good morning.

383
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,316
Okay, everybody.

384
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,319
Uh, we have a couple of new team members
to welcome this morning.

385
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,615
Transferring from the Redding branch
is Officer Pantera.

386
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,159
It's Poncherello.
Francis Llewyl Poncherello.

387
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,493
JANE: Hi, Francis.

388
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,495
You can call me Ponch. Ponch is fine.

389
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,414
Ponch. Much easier.

390
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:51,293
And correcting me is, uh, Jon Baker.

391
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,255
Uh, Jon has the distinction of being
the oldest rookie ever.

392
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,758
- MAN: <i>Ooh.
- By nine years.</i>

393
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,676
Thank you, thank you.

394
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,347
Oh, I actually have a rookie question,
if you don't mind me interrupting.

395
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:08,435
Um, I was told that I have to land in the
top 10% of my department in citations--

396
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,812
It's a joke. He was just joking.

397
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,230
Great joke, Jon!

398
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,398
<i>- Keep 'em comin'!</i>
- (LAUGHTER)

399
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,608
JANE: Okay, we're having a problem

400
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,776
<i>with the fire extinguishers, people.</i>

401
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,903
Do you each have one in your car?
Show of hands.

402
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,863
Who has a fire extinguisher in their car

403
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,406
<i>at this very moment as we speak?</i>

404
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,868
JON: Gotta say this is pretty badass,
yeah?

405
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,745
Being all suited up for battle.

406
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,581
What, looking like UPS drivers?

407
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,334
Yeah, that's super cool.
Fuckin' go brown, right?

408
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,879
We don't look like UPS drivers. Do we?

409
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,589
Hold up a second.

410
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,508
ROTH: <i>It's Roth.</i>

411
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,926
- You find out where she works?
<i>- On Riverside.</i>

412
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,094
AVA: <i>Hey.</i>

413
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,596
Oh, hey! How are you?

414
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,181
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

415
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,517
Is that your Sport 1000 I'm seeing?

416
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,936
- Yeah. You know what that is?
- Ah...

417
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,270
Just a little bit.

418
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,523
I got a Paul Smart 1000 myself.

419
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,274
Oh, I love those. Those are beautiful.

420
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,735
So beautiful. I've been looking
for one of yours for a while, though.

421
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,487
- Car wash in the Valley?
<i>- Yeah. Happy Hands.</i>

422
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,406
Okay. Send me the address.

423
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,701
If you're interested, you should ride up
Angeles Crest with us to Newcomb's Ranch.

424
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,286
Beautiful ride, ton of Ducatis.

425
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,663
Um...

426
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:14,042
God, I'm so flattered
'cause you're crazy attractive,

427
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,128
but I'm trying to repair
my marriage right now.

428
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,713
Oh, my God. Really?

429
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:18,880
What?

430
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,299
First of all, you're old as fuck.

431
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,719
Second of all, no one wants to hear
about your marriage troubles.

432
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,095
Okay?

433
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,097
So, maybe you just want to
get over yourself a little bit?

434
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,765
(STAMMERING)

435
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,935
- Good work.
- I wasn't... (GROANS)

436
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,938
Good work. No, you're just
blending right in. It's perfect.

437
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:42,029
I just hope he's not a crazy stalker
or something.

438
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,905
He knew I had cats.

439
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,365
Crazy.

440
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,993
<i>It's probably a lucky guess or something.</i>

441
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,661
Hmm...

442
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,079
Did you hear any names?

443
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,291
LT. What's going on?

444
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,209
Yeah, someone called him "LT."

445
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,837
How about the pilot?
Did he seem to fall, or was he pushed out?

446
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,174
No, I just saw him land.

447
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,342
Don't go back there. No, no, it's fine.

448
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,844
You know what?
Nobody's going to get away with this.

449
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,137
I promise, okay?

450
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,264
Is your friend ticketing me?

451
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,099
- One down.
- CASTILLO: <i>Hey!</i>

452
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,935
Jon. What are you doing?

453
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,854
- What am I doing?
- What is this shit?

454
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,315
No, no, no. Hey.
This car doesn't have plates.

455
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,817
No, because it's brand new.
Can you not see it's brand new?

456
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,445
Listen, I've got to write some tickets,
or I'm going to blow my probation

457
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,613
and I'm going to get canned.

458
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,074
But you got to use your brain.
They just bought this car.

459
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,409
We're up! No seatbelt. Red Ford!

460
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,952
We're not up! You're getting ticket-happy!

461
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,204
It's just a seatbelt.

462
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,371
- No!
- Mount up.

463
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,581
No! Stay right here!

464
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:35,916

Ponch.

467
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,801
Is your partner okay?

468
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,719
He just got assigned to me, you know?

469
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,347
- Right.
- You transfer from Redding?

470
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,973
Yeah! Ponch.

471
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,434
- Ray.
- Nice to meet you.

472
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,478
You must know Bob Lynn?

473
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,980
Of course. Asian Bob.
Everybody knows Bob.

474
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,358
- "Asian Bob"?
- Yeah.

475
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,735
Thought he was
English or Scottish or something.

476
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,781
Oh, you're talking about Bob Lynn,
L-Y-N-N.

477
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,742
I thought you were talking about
Bob Lin, L-I-N,

478
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,494
who's Asian as hell.

479
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,912
I think he's a hundred percent.

480
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,165
But to answer your question, yes.
I do know white Bob.

481
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,625
We haven't met. I'm Gay Terry.

That makes sense, that makes sense.

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,844
- Don't do that! Hey!
- (LAUGHTER)

487
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,346
Okay, this is a prank.

488
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,597
Yeah, I wish it was a prank.

Everything's gone to shit,
that's how it's gone.

492
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,356
Hey, I need the address
of the pilot that jumped.

493
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,025
And I also need a profile made
for a Bob Lin.

494
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,821
L-I-N for the last name,
and he's got to be super Asian.

- Okay.

You got it, bro?

498
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,412
Huh?

499
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,663
All right.

500
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,093
We're the Highway Patrol.
Shouldn't we be patrolling a highway?

501
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,095
I'm paying my respects
to the widow of a fallen officer.

502
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,847
It's going to take me all of two minutes.

503
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:18,018
Okay. Listen, I have one shot
at saving my marriage, okay?

504
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,769
This job is crucial to that.

505
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,439
I couldn't care less about your wife,
but stay with the bikes, okay?

506
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,732
And don't ticket anybody.

507
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,109
Okay, and fuck that. Not a chance.

508
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,945
- Excuse me?
- I'm not letting my partner fly solo

You're not going let me or not
let me do a damn thing. You're a rookie!

Okay, I respect your rank,

- Yeah?

1026

Did I feel you face-plant
into my pubic mound?

1027
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,544
No! There was no contact whatsoever.

1028
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:26,548
Are you sure? Because I could've sworn
I felt either your nose or your lips?

1029

getting back to me

1037

said that shit to me,

I wouldn't have risked my life to
save theirs 10 minutes later.

1042

helicopter pilot that jumped.

1054
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:34,908
He had a second home.

1055
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,410
There's no way he could afford it
on a cop's salary.

1056
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,577

actually ever slept here.

Who's David Barton?

1085
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,314
That was the guard that was being held at
gunpoint when TJ jumped, who's now MIA.

1086

That's brutal.

1087
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,610
His boyfriend was being
held hostage by chance?

1088
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:53,945
Not by chance. No way.

- How often do I shit?
- Yeah.

1100
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:25,519

01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:04,024
How's your body?

you, Cooper, and Hansen,
you head up to Big Bear.

and you broke your phone.

I didn't torpedo it. We have
a suspect's head. That's a victory.

and I didn't wanna be too sexy
for the staff.

1606
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,370

1607
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:06,707
and just wanted to brag
about saving your life.

You saved my life?

1609
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:11,420
I gave you CPR
and I breathed life back into you.

1610
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,588
So, when I went out cold,

1611
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,757
you ran in and tried to kiss me?

1612
01:17:15,924 --> 01:17:17,926
- (LAUGHS)
- And you said it was CPR?

1613

Not quite! Um...

1614
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,889
That's a little gross because
you kind of remind me of my dad.

01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:24,558
Wait, your dad was a cop?

1616
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:25,892
God, no.

1617
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:28,520
He was just a fuck-up, kind of like you.

1618
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,814
Mmm. So flattering.

1619
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:34,234
I was wondering, when you get discharged,

1620
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:35,944
if you wanted to, um,

1621
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:39,948
take a ride back home with me?

I'm pretty sure she's gonna pick me up.

1624
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,584
Is this the same wife
that hasn't been here once?

1625
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:53,170
You haven't met her.

1626
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:57,507
I'd appreciate it if you didn't bag on her.

1627
01:17:57,674 --> 01:17:58,675
Yeah.

1628
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:00,927
I'll see you around.

1632
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,784
- I didn't know it was you!
- You're not gonna answer your phone?

1633
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,536
You're gonna make me fly to fucking LA
to talk to you?

1634
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,705
My phone was broken.
I was trying to activate it--

1635
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:30,832
I told you to stay away from
that drug house.

1636
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:32,626
You gotta stop shooting Allen!

1637
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:34,711
I didn't do it on purpose!
It was an accident.

1638
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:35,879
I was trying to shoot Ray Kurtz.

1639
01:18:36,046 --> 01:18:37,798
Well, you missed, and he's gone.

1640
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:40,634
You fucked up this whole case

1641
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:42,969
and when I called your captain
to find out where you were,

1642
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:44,679
she told me she hadn't heard from you

1643
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:47,724
since you initiated a sexual exchange
with her at 1:00 a.m.

1644
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:49,643
That was my bad. That was on me.

1645
01:18:49,810 --> 01:18:51,478
- That was an accident.
- You fucking pervert!

1646
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:55,023
Just goddamn nasty!

1647
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,733
I was trying to text
with this girl, Lindsey--

1648
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,984
You're fired!

1649
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,736
You're on the 11:00 a.m. back to Miami

1650
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,739
and guess what, I'm keeping your gun.

1651
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:05,033
Can we just go with a warning,
instead of a full-fledged fire?

1652
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,701
If you had been doing your job

1653
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:09,496
instead of looking at all this juicy,
LA booty they got out here,

1654
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:10,997
things wouldn't be so bad.

1655
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,505
Hands down, the best app for meeting girls.

1656
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:20,382
I just keep swiping until I meet one.

1657
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:21,758
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

1658
01:19:21,925 --> 01:19:25,178
Now, when you get intimate with these gals,

1659
01:19:25,345 --> 01:19:27,597
is oral expected?

1660
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,851
Like, with the butt?

1661
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,894
Oh, yeah. That's standard, boss.

1662
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:34,354
- That's standard?
- (CHUCKLES) Yes, sir.

1663
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:36,356
Wow, things have changed!

I'm sorry about this.

1672

I just got my phone working.
I got all your messages.

1673
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:05,385
Dude, I'm so happy you're here.

1674
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:07,095
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Thank you for coming.

1675
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,389
I'm really sorry, man.

1676
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:12,100
I would've been here when you woke up,
but I was buying a new phone.

1677
01:20:12,267 --> 01:20:14,227
No, man, it's good. I'm all good.

1678
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:16,897
What do you mean, you're good?
You got hit by a truck.

1679
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,064
Yeah,

1680
01:20:18,231 --> 01:20:20,775
but my titanium humerus
took most of the hit.

1681
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,611
It was only a five.

1682
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:23,904
Five out of what?

1683
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,322
Out of ten.

1684
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:28,909
- Then what's a 10?
- Scrotal tear, which I've had.

1685
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:31,953
Nuts unravel down your leg.
It's gruesome.

1686
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:36,124
- JON: What?
- I know.

1687
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:38,585
- You sexted with Captain Lindel?
- I did.

1688
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:41,379
Ponch-y, she's a senior!
That's pathological.

1689
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,547
She's old. She's up there.

1690
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:43,757
How was her body?
What did that look like?

1691
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,009
I mean, it was tight. (MUMBLING)

1692
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:48,094
- It was tight?
- She's confident, you know?

1693
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:49,346
That's sexy. That's really sexy.

1694
01:20:49,513 --> 01:20:50,931
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is this?

1695
01:20:51,515 --> 01:20:53,266
Put that, uh, right in the living room.

1696
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:54,976
- Whoa, whoa.
- Thank you so much.

1697
01:20:55,143 --> 01:20:57,103
- Excuse me, hey.
- Hey.

1698
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,271
What are you doing?

1699
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:01,024
We're moving in. Are you my neighbor?
I'm Amy.

1700
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:03,151
