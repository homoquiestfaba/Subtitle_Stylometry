1
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,272
<i>- [Bell Sounding]</i>
<i>- [Crowd Cheering]</i>

2
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,205
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>"I'm in with Hancox, the trainers."</i>

3
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,804
"I'm in with Hancox, the trainers."
That's what he said, right?

4
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,352
Look, Ray,
he got me by the elbow.

5
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,387
See, Ray?

6
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,013
Messing about...

7
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,423
movir the flesh about on it.

8
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:40,056
I was just goir in. I had my three
and six ready when he come up to me.

9
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,624
"I'm in with Hancox, the trainers,
and I'll give you two.

10
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,671
Two for the third race.
Come on. You'll just make it."

11
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,503
So I pulled out...

12
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,601
this inordinately large sum of money...

13
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,341
which he immediately grabbed, you see,
Ray, and he'd give me two...

14
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,010
Hermosa of Selsdon as number one
and Polish Otto.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,486
Hermosa of Selsdon, Ray.

16
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:07,117
"Do it on the tote," he said.
"Do it on the forecast."

17
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,687
So I went in and I shelled out
10 shillings on Hermosa of Selsdon...

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,358
and the other dog, right?

19
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,995
I come back outside again
to see how the bettir was goir.

20
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,302
Hermosa of Selsdon is 10-1.

21
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,775
Ray, I don't know why...

22
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,579
this guy instilled faith in me, Ray.

23
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,319
I don't know why.

24
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,322
<i>Anyway, the fanfares blew.</i>
<i>They brought them out.</i>

25
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,452
This fellow I went with said,
"There's yours.

26
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,031
There's your dog... Hermosa of Selsdon."

27
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:50,466
So I looked at him. I swear to God, Ray,
I looked back again...

28
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,731
they lengthened to fourteens.

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,637
I thought, "Everyone has gone mad."
I said...

30
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,835
"Everyone has gone mad!"

31
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,209
Then you won't believe it.
Ray, I'm watching the dog, right...

32
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,647
and they're marchir it
around and back again.

33
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,379
And just as they're about
to put the dog in its trap...

34
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,285
he stops dead in his tracks.

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,451
He tightens up, shivers,
lowers his little ass...

36
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,122
and has the mother and father
of all dumps right there.

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:24,033
Dog was 52 pounds as it was. After that lot
shot through his glory hole, he was nearer 40.

38
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,571
- Wort make much difference.
- Of course it does.

39
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,403
Ray, that's how to catch out
those eggs in the ring.

40
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,912
Ray, they got their backs
to the dogs and the dogs' psychology.

41
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,948
<i>Anyway, the bell goes off.</i>

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,779
The hare comes shootir out,
sets off the trap.

43
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,582
- Some bloody egg behind me shouts,
"They're off!"
<i>- I know.</i>

44
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,281
I'll cut it short for you, Ray.

45
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,419
It was the dog Mystic Nora all the way.

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,931
Hermosa of Selsdon wasrt even in it.

47
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,935
Nowhere! Dead out!
I just stared, Ray.

48
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,603
<i>Ray, I just stared.</i>

49
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,340
Then you won't believe this, Ray.

50
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,747
When they went down to the track
to take the dog back...

51
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,217
it didn't wanna go.

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,380
<i>It didn't want to go.</i>

53
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,220
That's what really got me, Ray.

54
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,453
It didn't want to go.

55
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,431
I wanted to go down there
and kick it to death, Ray.

56
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,728
I saw that dog
for what it really was...

57
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:34,000
nothing but a dirty little whippet.

58
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,598
Dachshund on stilts,
filthy little fart...

59
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,974
with a horsehair shirt
to stop it from gassir everyone.

60
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,944
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,642
I usually don't bother
with the forecast, actually.

62
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,651
Usually double up on the favorites.

63
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,586
<i>Very fair last Thursday,</i>
<i>as a matter of fact, Graham.</i>

64
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,123
<i>I used to do the Duella pools</i>
<i>sometimes on the off chance...</i>

65
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,251
but they closed 'em down
for the forecast betting.

66
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,025
I'm talking about last Saturday
at Wandswon'th, Ray.

67
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,869
We're just leavir, right...

68
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,806
when this fellow I went with...

69
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,937
says to me,
"What you gonna do about it?"

70
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,948
I said, "About what?"

71
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,041
He said, "About the guy
who gave you the dog."

72
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,279
Ray, I'd completely
forgotten about him.

73
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,251
So we go back up the stands
into the bar.

74
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,293
There's the guy give us the dog.

75
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,589
He's sittir there with his back to us.

76
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,326
This fellow I went with, Ray, he's a bloody
egg, in fact. You know what he did?

77
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,495
<i>He takes a lit cigarette.</i>

78
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,630
He walks up right behind the guy...

79
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:47,043
and he burns a hole right in
the back of his jacket, just like that.

80
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,411
Then he taps him on the shoulder
and says, "Hello."

81
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,151
The guys turns around, right?

82
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,551
He don't recognize us at first,
but then he does.

83
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:01,923
He says, "Oh, hello, boys.
Hello, hello. Have a drink."

84
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,361
The fellow I went with, Ray...
Jimmy... he says...

85
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,229
"Two double scotches."

86
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,996
And he gets 'em.
He gets 'em.

87
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,072
<i>And then this guy I went with...</i>

88
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,835
he grabs him and he says...

89
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,140
"I wonder if you could help me.

90
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:24,342
"I'm interested in recoupir
certain losses made recently...

91
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,918
"in an ill-advised venture.

92
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,477
<i>"And I got with me here</i>
<i>this tin ofbandages...</i>

93
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,490
"which I'm willir to sell.

94
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,117
"Matter of fact,
I'll sell it so cheap...

95
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,890
it would be a pleasure
to cut yourself."

96
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,558
- Heard that before. Huh.
<i>- Anyway...</i>

97
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,294
this half-hard idiot
that give us the dog...

98
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,372
he gradually catches on
that he's being threatened...

99
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,406
and he shoots off his mouth.

100
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,774
We get thrown out.
They wouldn't let us back in.

101
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,144
Oh, well, you had a good day.
You shouldn't let it worry you.

102
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,444
Graham, you remember that time
I was barred from the queer pub...

103
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:06,048
in Earl's Court for adjustir
the vertical hold on the television set?

104
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,128
<i>Yes, Ray.</i>

105
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,423
That was ironical, wasrt it?

106
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:16,230
Barred from a queer pub for
adjustir the vertical hold.

107
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,462
Yes.

108
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,132
Why don't you go unravel in the bath?

109
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,236
You're startir to sound like Auntie Daisy,
you are, pushir out the dirt.

110
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,838
Bloody dog!

111
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,475
Bloody little animal!

112
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,316
- Oh, forget it.
- I have forgotten it.

113
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,481
And you've forgotten about
forgettir it as well.

114
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,189
Oh, yes.

115
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,823
Yes! Yes.

116
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,694
Yes.

117
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,384
- I don't know.
<i>- What?</i>

118
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,488
You don't know what?

119
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,726
Got out of bed on the wrong side.

120
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,962
- It must have done.
<i>- I</i> did.

121
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,539
Oh, did you?

122
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,340
Right, then.
Right.

123
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,257
Right.

124
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,663
Sharon should come around.

125
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,672
- Bringing any food?
- I didn't ask her to. I didn't give her any money.

126
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,174
I never pay for sex, Ray.

127
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,542
That's 'causeJesus Christ
paid for our sins.

128
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,207
That's got nothing to do with it.

129
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,784
I like her, Ray.

130
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,787
I like her very much.

131
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,759
Let's give her a miss.
Let's go up the West End.

132
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,303
Right, then.

133
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,036
What's the name of that place
you got thrown out of? Let's go there.

134
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:46,141
The Earl of Strathmore... Strathcona.
That's in Earl's Court.

135
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh!

136
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,479
<i>Close the bloody window.</i>

137
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,234
"With railers drawn on the outside...

138
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,599
"and wide runners on the inside...

139
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,401
"tonight's heats of the Ben Truman Stakes

140
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,635

difficult assignment for punters...

141
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,770
<i>"and I would not be</i>
<i>at all surprised...</i>

142
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,007
<i>"to see more than</i>
<i>a couple of shocks...</i>

143
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,746
before the six for
Saturday's finals are known."

144
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,255
What they wanna do that for?
Balingaddy runs wide.

145
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,451
They should shove her on the outside.

146
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,892
That's a very pacy little hound.

147
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,261
Clocked 28:06 solo last Monday.

148
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,462
Remember? Why ain't they written it up?
Here.

149
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,272
"She is also no stranger
to New Cross...

150
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,172
"having won over
the course and distance.

151
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,804
"And connections were wise to renew
her associations with the circuit...

152
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,645
by giving her
a 500-yard spin on Monday."

153
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,652
She'll be on big offer.

154
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,689
She won't be on a big offer at all.
What'd you say that for?

155
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,692
She got Miss Vanilla
and Spring Guest against her.

156
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,288
Half an hour's boredom and agony
for a few seconds' pleasure.

157
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,891
- Ha.
- If Sharon were here, she would say...

158
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,835
"That's like a lot of things, Ray,"

159
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,396
and leer at you.

160
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,670
I spared you that.

161
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,077
How bothered was I
about being spared it?

162
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,048
- I don't know. It's all on the cards.
- I don't see it.

163
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,245
It don't matter.
I'm not goir that far with you.

164
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,368
<i>[Chattering, Indistinct]</i>

00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,072

- I said they're not for perusing, those.

Why? Man wants to know

180

Why, everyone knows that.

181
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,132

186
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,083
to Holborn Viaduct.

187
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,751
He didn't say a word.

188
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,660
Finally, he turns to me and says...

189
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,632
"Those Italians really know
what life's about."

190
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,793
I could've kicked him in the crotch.

191
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,804
The last time I went
to the pictures with you...

192
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,033
you said you went
with some American.

193
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,600
And after you came out,
he said...

194
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,580
"Some very poignant songs
have come from the mines."

195
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,583
I could've cut his balls off too.

196

I remember that.

<i>- No, not in Pittsburgh, Ray.</i>

No, no.
But as far as I remember, Ray...

200
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:34,401
Pittsburgh is the center of
the mining district in Pennsylvania.

201
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,532
I forced that out of him.
Let's go have a drink.

- I could drink you under a table.

- You're gettir very kittenish.

- Huh?

00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,053
Let's go have a drink, Ray.

206
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,255
Where's the nearest pub you got
thrown out of? Let's go there.

207
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,129
We passed it.

208

- Which one was that?
- Strathmore Arms.

209
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,872

"You'll have to go.

Right. You don't
believe me then, Ray?

00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:35,035
Let's go down the road.
Come on.

335
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,083
I didn't read you out
the best one, Graham.

336
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,620
<i>"Barbara Can'tland,</i>
<i>the famous novelist, she said..."</i>

337
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,785
Look, you can go back home to that
old cow of yours if you like, you know.

338
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,090
You don't have to come along with me.

339
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,097
What with her mange
and your socks...

340
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,099
you'll have to open the fuckir window!

341
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,567
<i>And the next time,</i>
<i>you go along with me.</i>

342
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,106
You can go home if you like. If she's not there,
go have a row with yourself in the toilet.

343
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,903
Go unravel in the bath.
I don't care.

344
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,570
I tell you, I don't care.

345
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,949
I don't care.

346
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,980
I don't.

347
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,193
No, I just thought...

348
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,199
I mean, I like
going out with you, Graham.

349
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,864
Yes.

350
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,669
Yes, Ray.

351
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,336
You. It's all right with you, Graham.

352
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,504
You're right, Ray.

353
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,482
You're quite right.
Oh, yes.

354
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,453
<i>Listen to this prick.</i>

355
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:04,365
"Hermosa of Selsdon...

364
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,796
Now, they got the nerve
to bring that dog up again.

365
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,527
We've seen that bloody hound.

366
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,899
<i>Seen that bloody hound.</i>

367
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,131
<i>"Favored by having trap three vacant."</i>

368
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,208
<i>Wouldrt make a difference</i>
<i>if they're all bloody vacant.</i>

369
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,436
We've seen that bastard dog.

370
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,479
Isn't that him?
That one?

371
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,741
Who?

372
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,841
Wouldrt make a difference if they're all
fucking vacant. Who? What's the time?

373
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,443
One of those people you follow.

374
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,547
<i>There. No... See there?</i>
<i>No, there, there.</i>

375
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,526
There. There he is.

376
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,358
<i>You see there? There.</i>

377
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,867
Yes, yes, yes.

378
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,928
No. It's not him.

379
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,539
It's another one.

380
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,669
I know who you mean.

381
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,574
I know who he is.

382
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,483
<i>Let's go chat him up.</i>

383
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,319
Yes, Ray.
Whatever for, Ray?

384
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,154
Well, you know.
Next time you see him...

385
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,160
you can say to yourself,
you know...

386
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,890
that you and me, we chatted him up
and how it went or something.

387
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,967
I don't know why
you follow these people.

388
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,036
They follow me.

389
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,402
Coming along with me, are you?

390
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,311
- Hmm?
- Well, yes. Yes.

391
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,314
Yes, Graham.

392
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,509
You're beir a bit kittenish.

393
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,187
Hmm?

394
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,258
Graham.

395
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,191
Excuse me.

396
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,696
I would just like to say...

397
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,359
that I admired greatly...

398
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,834
the way you extricated yourself...

399
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:57,931
from that dirty little bitch
on the train to Santa Fe.

400
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,045
Oh, yes. Yes.
You-You-You saw that, did you?

401
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,948
Y-Yes, yes.

402
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,886
Yeah, my friend and I, we happened
to spot you over here in the corner...

403
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,288
and we just thought, you know,
we would just come over...

404
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,917
to let you know
we were on your side.

405
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,088
Oh, yes.
Well, uh, thank you.

406
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,223
You know,
they're releasing that again...

407
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,528
- Oh!
- As a matter of fact.

408
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,867
I was very pleased about that.
I suppose you'd be...

409
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,997
Oh, no. We'll be there.
Oh, no.

410
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,008
Oh, definitely, we'll be there.

411
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,010
Oh.

412
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,673
Yes, I thought it was fairly
well buried... that one.

413
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,977
- I must say, it is nice that you should...
- Oh, no.

414
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,110
We're great admirers of yours, David.

415
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,712
Great admirers.
You know, when we first saw you...

416
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,055
oh, you had a part in <i>Oklahoma...</i>

417
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,424
at Hastings five years ago.

418
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,794
Right? There are not many people come up
to you and tell you that, huh, David?

419
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,198
No. Oh, yes, yes, I remember.

420
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,863
I remember that well.
The local newspaper said...

421
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:05,636
it was a once-in-a-lifetime
clinch with gaiety.

422
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,536
That's a giggle, huh, Ray?

423
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,381
Can I get you a drink?

424
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,858
Yes. Well, yes.
Campari. Thank you.

425
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,452
I'll get It, Ray. 'Cause I don't want
to rush you off your feet.

426
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,266
Campari.
That's port and lemon in disguise.

427
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,738
You're sewn up, aren't you?

428
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,342
Can I have a Campari?

429
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,082
<i>Glass of scotch and a glass of tonic</i>
<i>with a slice oflemon.</i>

430
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,053
<i>Dave? You heard the oldjoke.</i>

431
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,999
Hey, she been...
she been taken up, huh?

432
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,632
That dirty little bitch
on the train to Santa Fe?

433
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,338
Oh-Oh, yes. Oh, ye-yes. Yes.
She's been... Yes, thank you.

434
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,540
She's been, um...

435
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,050
- Yes, she's been taken up in a big way.
- Yeah?

436
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,120
Oh, yes. Yes.

437
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,391
Cheers. Thank you.

438
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,039
This recent one
you been working on, David...

439
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,838
- This recent one...
- Mm-hmm?

440
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,379
What's the director like
to work with?

441
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,042
- Oh, you-you've been reading
about that one, have you?
- Yes.

442
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,144
Well, it is very difficult work...

443
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,485
to begin with, but I've found...

444
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,083
that the only way to avoid
a direct clash...

445
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,961
personalities... was to, um...

446
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,591
well, almost...

447
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,296
the exact opposite
to what he wanted.

448
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,497
I mean, not quite the exact opposite,
you see.

449
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,667
Do you see what I mean?
But almost the exact opposite.

450
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,711
And then, you see,
he-he knew...

451
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,304
that you werert kowtowing
to him like everybody else...

452
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,508
and at the same time,
you werert sort of...

453
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,849
you know,
playing the game of doing...

454
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,854
the exact opposite...

455
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,754
in order to show that you were obviously,
as it were, standing<i>... - </i>

456
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,759
uh, standing up to him.

457
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,265
- You see, it's very...
- Brilliant, David.

458
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,494
That is absolutely brilliant.

459
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,502
- Ohh...
- Ray? Huh?

460
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,368
Yes. Very, very clever.

461
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,714
It's funny you should talk about
that film, because you know what?

462
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,945
Ray and I were talking
about that very film just before.

463
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,988
- Yeah?
- And he bet me...

464
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,489
you really lived it up there, David.

465
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,123
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, yes, yes, yes.

466
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,790
Yes.

467
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,799
Well, no, no, no.

468
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,960
No, no.
It's not, um...

469
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,800
- It's not what you'd imagine at all, really.
- Oh, no, no, no.

470
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,933
We've got no illusions about it, David.
No illusions at all.

471
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:30,140
No, I can imagine what...
just what it's like, you know.

472
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:35,584
I saw you rehearsing the other day.
Hammersmith. Some hall there.

473
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:40,124
- Oh, really?
- I often pass that place on my way to the dogs.

474
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:44,422
- You know, do you go to...
Do you go to the dogs at all?
- No.

475
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,123
No, I don't.
L-l-I, uh...

476
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,257
Well, l-I never have the time.

477
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,701
I'd lose, I suppose.

478
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,874
Somebody was saying something
about greyhound racing...

479
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,240
the other day.

480
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,313
Some remark.

481
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:07,050
No, no. No, no. I was...
I was reading it.

482
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,142
"Animated roulette."

483
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:13,349
Winston Churchill.

484
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,359
Animated roulette.

485
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,022
No, I don't...
I don't follow it, really.

486
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,135
Graham follows it.

487
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,103
Yes.

488
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,674
Yes, well, I'll, um...

489
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,868
I'll be with you in a minute.

492
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,082
- Huh? [Chuckles]
- Oh.

493
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,556
Gone downstairs, Graham.
See a man about a dog.

494
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,560
Huh.

495
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,725
Coming along with me, are you?

496
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,632
You gonna hedge your bets?

497
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,441
No. No.

498
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,075
It's like you say, Graham.
It's just like you say.

499
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,240
The old black magic.

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,251

00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,222
Hello.

00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,293
What?

504
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,287
Knock 'em back, don't you, David?

505
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,424
I bet your liver goes on living
long after you're dead.

506
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:34,027
Right? You'll have to hire a couple
of guys like us to beat it to death.

507
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,442
What about coming
down the road with us?

508
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,479

509
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,174
Oh, no, no, no.
I have to get back. I really...

510
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,880
I really must get back.
I'm very, very, um...

511
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,888
very, very tired.

512
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,391
- Oh, well, we'll walk along with you.
- Oh. Very well.

513
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,160
You know, David,
you haven't let us introduce ourselves.

514
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,165
My name is Graham, David...

515
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,326
and this is my very good friend here,
Ray Summers.

516
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,336
- How do you do?
- Hello.

517
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,100
Do you mind at all being
recognized by strangers?

518
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,110
Oh, no, no, no.
It's just part of the old, uh...

519
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,410
Well, they, uh...
They usually get my name wrong...

520
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,349
and then they get embarrassed
and walk away.

521
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,512
No, it doesn't... It doesn't, um...
doesn't take much out of you.

522
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,817
You know, I expect a lot of'em
must come up to you...

523
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,859
ask you for your autograph,
then say it's for their small son...

524
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,794
their niece, someone you've never
heard of just to cover up, huh?

525
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,797
- Yes.
- Can I have your autograph?

526
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,096
- It's funny you should...
- It's for Ray.

What?

530
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,072
I never knew that.

531
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:54,208
Oh, well. Came in handy to play
the Duke of, um... the Duke of Clarence with.

532
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,221
Oh, they wouldn't let you.
He was Jewish.

533
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:04,124
You know there were 50,000
SephardicJews in London in 1066?

534
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,527
They all got to the top,
then nobody knew who they were.

535
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,432
There were 20,000 Negroes
in England in the early 1800s.

536
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,903
- Nobody knows where they are. Ray's Jewish.
- Oh, yeah?

537
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,533
He had to have it cut off.
I bloody wore it off.

538

- Stop laughing.

539
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,503
You sound like a clam goir mad.

540
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,878
Yes, well, um...

541
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,988
Yes, well, perhaps, um...

542
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,253
Perhaps I shall run across you again.

543
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,057
Run across us again?
David.

544
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,793
You'd have to run very fast.
Very fast, indeed.

545

You got it all wrong!

552
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,278
And even if that were the case,
we'd forgive you.

00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,015
Wouldrt we, Ray?

554
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,058

<i>But you sell yourself so cheap.</i>
<i>Don't defend yourself.</i>

556
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,397
You've got to put yourself out a bit.

557
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,626
They'll defend you as much
as they can, David...

558
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,295
but when it comes to crucial issues,
you're out on your own.

559
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,066
You haven't done half of it.

560
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,075
Well, let's leave that for a bit.
Right?

561
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,407
Turn to the more rational side.

562
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,051
How would you assess
his physical condition and stature...

563
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,521
in a few words, Ray, for guidance?

564
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,890
Well, I'd say about six feet...

565
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,624

566
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,599
Fairly good working order,
I should think.

very approachable, David?

568
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,562

All right, David.
Now.

572
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,626
Okay.

573
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,497
Let's put it another way for you.

574
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,595
It's the simplest thing
in the world once you grasp it.

575
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,901
Now, you take Ray, for example.

576
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,205
This girl he's shacked up with... Sharon...

577
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,212
she thinks he's you.

578
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,839
And when they're in their bed,
David, he thinks he's you...

579
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,645
and she thinks she's being done by you.

580
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,619
Well, it's not quite as simple as all that.
Kick him again. Go ahead.

581
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:55,223
It's got nothing to do with resenting you.
Nothing at all.

582
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,767
It's just that it seems stupid...

583
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,133
you're not there with Sharon and Ray
to defend yourself.

584
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,473

Have his face done.

00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,484
- What's that? A birthmark?
- No, I just did that.

589

"I'll have a Guinness,"

592
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,099

"That'll put lead in your pencil."

594
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,805
"I can't write," the man says...

595
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,108
saving his wink for another time.

596
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,211
As a matter of fact,
I've swindled you, David.

597
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,779
I usually like to tell that story
at the beginning to ingratiate myself...

You had a beautiful woman

Beautiful buttocks she had. Mmm!

00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,590
I think it was your wife, Ella.

617
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,717
She was slightly pregnant at the time.

Nineteen thousand men
were having blood tests.

619
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:10,759
Beautiful buttocks she had. I watched one,
going like a fiddler's elbow.

620

Then I lost track of it,
watched the other.

I was with a friend

I watched him come
without trimming the candle.

in your direction...

But he looked away.
See, David? He looked away.

627
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,518

That's what he was thinking.

<i>I'm not gonna give myself away.</i>

Oh, I can ask you now, David,
what danger was there of that?

630
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,497
Huh? You wouldn't have
remembered him...

himself away, would you?

But what he didn't know...
what he didn't realize...

was the reason
he wasrt looking at you...

00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,298
Well, he's got a nerve.

673
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,430
Not recognizing you, Ray...

674
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,509
<i>that takes the bloody biscuits.</i>

675
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,371
- Was he looking at you?
- He looked at me, and then he looked away.

676
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,383
Well, he recognized you, then.

677
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,644
No. No.

678
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,155
<i>That was a bit of a moody, Ray.</i>

679
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:07,187
Made the game simple for him
so he could understand it...

680
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:11,563
and he blatantly chooses
to ignore the rules.

681
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,737
[Sighs] Well, you know,
he might have thought we were jealous.

682
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,206
All that gone to waste.

683
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,280
Huh?

684
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,315
Yeah.

685
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,176
No, I don't think...

686
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,690
No. He's not as stupid as that, Ray.

687
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,819
It was double bluff.

688
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,489
Double bluff.

689
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,897
I don't grudge it him,
all said and done.

690
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,436
He's entitled to do
what he likes, you know.

691
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,200
He's been out of work for six months.

692
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,707
He's probably on the streets now.

693
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,643
<i>Poncing around like a blue-assed fly...</i>

694
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,238
and flogging...
flogging his chops into the bargain.

695
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,284
Poor fellow.

696
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,048
The Salvation Army does a lot for them.

697
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,260
Ray.

698
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,759
Fairlands Mandy.

699
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,631
You chose that, you silly cow.

700
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,668
Fairlands Mandy.

701
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,844
Give him a ring.

702
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,355
<i>It's ex-directory.</i>

703
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,987
Belgravia six...

704
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,191
one five two seven.

705
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,869
Use your Douglas Fairbanks voice.

706
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,190
Hello. Hello. Is David there?

707
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,891
Hello, David.
Is that you?

708
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,161
Well, we've been
watching your movie.

709
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,169
You know?

710
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:32,101
Yes. Spellbinding.

711
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:39,714
I expect you've had your fill, but I wanted to
register it with you before I leave tomorrow.

712
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,282
You put on a great, great show.

713
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,221
<i>"Well, can I know who this is?"</i>

714
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,854
That's the game, kid.

715
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:56,865
That's the game.
You put your finger on it.

716
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,401
I just wanted to say
what a fine showing.

717
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,939
That's all. Yeah.

718
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,441
<i>No, that's all right.</i>

719
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,881
Yeah. Yeah.

720
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,844
Bye, now.

721
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:28,225
Tsk. Isn't he slow?

722
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,096
- Oh, it makes you sick.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

723
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,799
You know...

724
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,805
in three years' time...

725
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,807
he's gonna have 10 face-lifts.

726
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:42,003
Every time he winks,
his legs are gonna jump up in the air.

727
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,138
<i>Belt up, Ray. Belt up.</i>
<i>Go on.</i>

728
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,512
<i>Belt up.</i>

729
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,180
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

730
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,724
What's the selection say?

731
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,902
"Fairlands Mandy. 100-8."

732
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,566
Oh, fat chance.

733
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,235
Their selection, not yours.

734
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,648
- "Polish Otto."
<i>- Otto?</i>

735
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,322
- What's it say about him?
<i>- "Polish Otto...</i>

736
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:31,292
"traps well and is well placed
for a wide runner.

737
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,161
"If she can lead out from
privately trained Fairlands...

738
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,927
"she should outstay the field.

739
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,003
But she tends to get badly balked..."

740
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,934
I'll take that. Otto.

741
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,244
Bring it with you.

742
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,447
Coming?

743
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,019
- Yes.
- Well, come on, then, Ray.

744
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,214
"Privately trained," Ray.

745
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,387
Huh?

746
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,394
Ray.

747
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,195
<i>- [Bell Ringing]</i>
<i>- [Crowd Cheering]</i>
