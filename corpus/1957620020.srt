This boy right here, boss.
He just seems to wanna find
 trouble.

518
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:54,151
Mr. Pete, please. I wasn't
 speaking to you.

519
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,286
My name's Del Sebastian.

520
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,455
What can I do for you,
Mr. Sebastian?

521
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,392
I heard you were hiring.

522
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,830
I might be.

523
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,166
At least we should talk about
  the possibilities,

524
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,101
before you do any more damage
  to my crew.

Do you always present
   such an aggressive
   first impression?

528
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,417
Well, I seem to lately,
Mr. Taylor,

529
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,220
although I generally
   prefer to think
   through a problem

530
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,556
before I'm forced
 to attack it.

531
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,193
That's sound reasoning,
Mr. Sebastian.

532
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,128
What kind of work
 are you looking for?

533
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:42,499
Well, I'm licensed on most
 heavy equipment
 and demolitions.

534
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,336
I can take orders
 and I know how to do my job.

535
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,640
And I'll give you an honest
day's work for an honest
day's pay.

536
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,042
Where'd you get
   your experience?

537
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:56,246
Military mostly. First with
   the Army Corp Stateside,

538
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,582
later as a ranger with the
 Third Battalion.

539
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,350
I served in Vietnam.

540
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,053
That would be where you got
 your expertise in demolitions?

541
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,588

  hand in our modest effort

00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:23,207

this morning.
No, no problem at all.

 whoring with liberals

784
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,377

he had to sell us out.
