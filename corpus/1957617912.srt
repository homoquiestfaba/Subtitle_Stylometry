I told you: not here!

38

started this way,

like to see me do?

forget the kid at home

00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,211
Today I made
an amazing discovery.

95
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:54,214
It appears that I have found the
body of a humanoid creature

96
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:56,423
that has washed ashore
on Lake Erie.

97
00:09:56,457 --> 00:10:00,013
Apparently the creature -- which
closely resembles a human --

98
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:03,188
made its way from the ocean
to the Great Lakes.

99
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:21,103
I believe that the creature may
have originated from the city of
Atlantis,

100
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:24,865
although this could be seen as
an early and unproven hunch.

101
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,660
The creature doesn't
appear to be alive,

102
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,698
so this evening I shall
attempt an autopsy.

103
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:33,425
I believe that if I can retrieve
some samples from the creature's
innards,

104
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,876
I can track the
samples backwards

105
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,396
and discover where the
great city of Atlantis

106
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,432
might once have existed.

much time to study it,

147
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:44,573
I can only imagine it can
have a limited existence
out of the water.

148

It's going to head for
water, I do suspect.

353
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,464
There  is a good
part on it?

354
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,778
You fixed it?

355
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:31,744
That's awesome!

356
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:37,888
Listen, um...what was that guy
Blake was talking about.

357
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:38,717
Ray?

358
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,201
Doctor Ray?

359
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,375
OK, listen...um...

360
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,205
Grab the tape,
come on over.

361
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,758
We'll check this out.

362
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,242
Okay.

363
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,175
Yeah, I love you too.

364
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,176
Bye.

365
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,873
[Knocks on door]

366
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,360
Hi...Doctor Ray?

367
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,499
Oh, you must be Ken Adams.

368
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,363
Uh...this is my
girlfriend Julie...

369
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:05,260
I called you earlier?

370
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:06,227
Oh, hi Julie.

371
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,366
Why don't you
guys come on in.

372
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,539
Okay, thanks.

373
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,202
Here, let's go
into the kitchen.

374
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:23,520
I really appreciate
you seeing us like this.

375
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,212
What seems to
be the problem?

376
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,629
Well, Julie and I are
filming the documentary
on the city's lake...

377
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:33,633
and while we were down there,
we ran into this creature
of some sort.

378
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:34,669
Creature?

379
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:36,533
Yeah, it nearly killed us!

380
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,191
That "creature" as you call it
is the find of the century

381
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:42,401
and if we don't find it
within twenty-four hours
it's going to die!

382
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,885
How do you figure?

383
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,199
The humanoid is the last
survivor of the great
city of Atlantis.

384
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,201
and it can't survive
without salt water.

385
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:52,169
It's already been loose for
at least twenty-four hours!

386
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,826
What do I care?

387
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,001
That thing almost killed
Julie and I today!

388
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,934
No, I doubt that it
would have killed you...

389
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,867
You see, that's what
I thought at first.

390
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:04,181
But then I received some test
results this morning and it 
disproves that theory.

391
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:05,251
Come again?

392
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,012
The creature is not
a meat-eater.

393
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,566
It won't attack a human
unless it's attacked first.

394
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,464
See, it's very defensive
of its own turf,

395
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:13,225
much like other animals,
but, you see...

396
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:14,916
it's highly intelligent.

397
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,643
The humanoid needs to take in a
certain amount of salt water

398
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,611
but it can only survive on
one rare chemical.

399
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,199
How rare?

400
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:25,202
This chemical can only be found
in one product known to man:

401
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,480
toxic waste!

402
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:29,758
Get outta here,
you're puttin' me on!

403
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:30,690
No I'm not.

404
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:33,210
I thought the humanoid may
have gone to the reservoir 
first,

405
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:34,280
so I did check there.

406
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,317
I did find traces of
footprints, but you see,

407
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,043
the water was
just too clean...

408
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,527
it couldn't find
anything to eat,

409
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:42,116
so I believe it may have
gone to Lake Tempe.

410
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,427
Well it attacked us today!

411
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:44,981
How do you explain
that one, doc?

412
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,948
Yeah, what were you doing
while you were attacked?

413
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:49,192
You had mentioned
something about a video?

414
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:51,194
Yeah, we were trying
to videotape it,

415
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:52,851
but the damn thing
kept screwing with us.

416
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,887
Finally it just attacked!

417
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,371
It's just as I thought.

418
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:59,236
You see, Ken, this
humanoid is very intelligent.

419
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,480
I believe it was just
playing a game with you.

420
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:04,241
And it just wanted to see
how far it could take you.

421
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,242
I gotta tell you, doc...

422
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:07,141
this sounds like a bad
B-movie to me!

423
00:31:07,175 --> 00:31:09,868
Well like it or not,
that creature is fairly
harmless

424
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:10,869
and we have to capture
it again before it dies.

425
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:14,355
It's the find of the century!

426
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:15,218
Okay.

427
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,219
What can we do to help?

428
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:17,151
Well, follow me.

429
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:18,738
I want to show you
something in my lab.

430
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:19,878
Okay.

431
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,072
Okay, this is where the humanoid
was, but it has escaped

432
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,350
and we have to get it as soon
as possible before it dies.

433
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,179
Okay, um...

434
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:47,457
I think the best idea is to go
back to the lake, though.

435
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,630
That's where
we saw it last.

436
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:50,149
Okay, that's fine but I'm
going to need the video.

437
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,081
The video?

438
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,221
The video of the creature.
I'm going to need it.

439
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:54,567
For what?
What do you need it for?

440
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,569
Well, you see, I'm up for the
Nobel Peace Prize this year.

441
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:58,295
Why is it that we don't
get a part of this?

442
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:04,198
Well see, it's my discovery
because I did see the creature 
first,

443
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:05,751
so if anyone sees
that you filmed it

444
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:08,547
and give you the credit that
means I'm out for the prize!

445
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:10,066
I think we should
give her the tape.

446
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,860
She does deserve
a Nobel Prize.

447
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:15,105
Um...can we please excuse
ourselves for just a minute?

448
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,210
Okay, please, please...

449
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:17,211
we don't have much time.

450
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:18,212
No problem, no problem.

451
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,282
C'mere, dummy.

452
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:20,593
C'mere...dummy.

453
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:21,974
Listen...do you have any idea

454
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,597
how much money we
are talking about here?

455
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:25,633
Why?

456
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,220
She deserves it,

457
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,841
we don't.

458
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,980
Did we not film it?

459
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,085
Yes we filmed it, but...

460
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,086
she discovered
it...she...

461
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,673
Did you see it by the lake?

462
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,951
Yes I saw it by the lake,

463
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,090
that's not going
to help us.

464
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:35,229
Then why...
what?

465
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:36,437
What is your
problem now?

466
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:37,438
I am telling you that--

467
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,542
It's back!

bad monster!

00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:31,216

477
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,217
Don't hit it!

00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,390

479
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,426
Don't!

all right?

I hope you're okay...
I wish you could talk!

You've gotta get them...get
them, look what they did to you!

489
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:03,800
Get them!

491
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:07,183

C'mon, c'mon!

493

This way!

494

00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:53,832
Look at this...

510
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:56,904
Hon...I'm a little
tied up right now!

511
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:09,503
it shows here that Doctor Ray
was actually a Queen of 
Atlantis...

512
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:13,196
she brought him with her just
to take over our world
or something!

513

Not if I can help it.

514
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:16,717
Look, here's a map.

515
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:19,237
She has everything drawn out
where she used to live.

516
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:25,450
And all these other people
that she killed who
were against her.

517
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,047
So you found
the book, huh,

518
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:40,430
and now you know all the
deep dark secrets of the
city of Atlantis.

have been great

520

and I could have gotten the
Nobel Prize until you kids
interfered.

wait until the sequel!

sit through the sequel?

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,706
She's evil...
you know it!

530
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,641
You know
this is wrong!

531
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:20,228
Don't believe him...he'll do
anything to be a big director.

532
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:24,336
I'm your Queen!

533
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:34,001
I'm the reason
why you're alive!!

534
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:39,627
No!

535
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:57,231
Hell with it...no more
Mister Nice Guy, Fish-Boy!

536
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,578
[Fighting]

537
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:01,166
Wait!

538
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:02,823
Stop, sorry...

539
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:05,204
That is it,
I'm sick of this!

540
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,827
What is this?

541
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:07,655
Y'know?

542
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,380
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:09,381
Oh...
you're sorry.

544
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,209
You're sorry!

545
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,556
You're not the
one that got hit!

546
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,488
Okay, okay...
let's cut.

547
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,075
What's...what's
the matter, Arvin?

548
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,214
What's the matter?

549
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:16,215
Look at me!

550
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,182
Look at me!

551
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:18,459
What?

552
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:20,461
We're makin' a movie here,
what are you doing?

553
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,670
I look like The Creature From
The Black Lagoon in drag!

554
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:24,465
No, you look like
an alien choir boy.

555
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,225
Anybody can
play your part!

556
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,779
I'll just call SAG...

557
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,263
Hey, man...I'm union!

558
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:30,264
I'm union!

559
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,439
Oh, buddy...you're gonna
have hell, mister!!

560
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:33,129
It's okay, pal.

561
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,061
No, no...

562
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:36,512
I turned down a part in
"Chickboxer 2" for this!

563
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:37,685
No, I know...but....

564
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,893
Makeup! Makeup!

565
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:39,929
It's gonna
be a classic!

566
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,171
We can do great
things with this!

567
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:41,896
Cigarette!

568
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:43,104
Now!!

569
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,416
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

570
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,418
Can you believe this?

571
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,732
Can you believe this?
This is bloody ridiculous!!

572
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:52,907
This is such a low-budget
film...they forgot the blood!

573
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:55,116
I came all the way from
Deutchland for this?

574
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:56,842
That's enough, go, go!

575
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,775
[mumbles something
incoherent in German]

576
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,225
Bloody directors.

577
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:16,034
Ken?

578
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:17,207
Down here!

579
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,798
What are you
doing, hon?

580
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,213
The screening's
in twenty minutes!

581
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:24,974
Aw, I just wanted
to finish this up.

582
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,976
I want it to
be perfect!

583
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,674
Now what
are you doing?

584
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,642
Well it needs a
title, doesn't it?

585
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,132
This I've got to see.

586
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:52,622
Now I've seen it all!

587
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:53,623
What?

588
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,211
It needed
a title, right?

589
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,938
Since I'm the director,
that's the title I gave it!

590
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:58,870
Okay, director...

591
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:00,354
let's get our butts
to the screening

592
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:02,183
before they think you've
bailed out on them!

593
