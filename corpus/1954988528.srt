00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,592
*

2
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,994
Brooklyn: This is a story
about the guy I fell for.

3
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,297
But to really
understand why,

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,202
You have to know
a little bit about
the game he loves.

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,174
The game has been played
by native Americans

6
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,809
For centuries.

7
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,044
It requires speed
and agility,

8
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,147
Teamwork, strategy,

9
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,716
And a bit of violence.

10
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,522
You may know it
as lacrosse,

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,990
But native Americans
know it as baaga'adowe...

12
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,859
The little brother of war.

13
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,429
Their matches took days

14
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,564
And were played
over Miles of terrain.

15
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:07,367
The winners got land,
wives, and sometimes glory.

16
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,975
There's a lot
that's different
about the game now.

17
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,878
But the thing
a player needs most
hasn't changed at all.

18
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,280
And if you find
someone who has it,

19
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,251
I'd tell you
to never let go.

20
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,360
(Whistle blows,
crowd cheers)

21
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,810
(Overlapping shouts)

22
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,646
Get it over there!
Center it!

23
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,082
Swing it!
Watch his pass!

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,886
(Shouting continues)

25
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,086
(Whistle blows)

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,655
(Shouting continues)

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,799
(Whistle blows)

28
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,902
Who's Jimmy's back-up?
Hanson.

29
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,740
We're in trouble.

30
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,341
(Whistle blows)

31
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,843
(Sportscast playing
on radio)

32
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,081
Hey, coach says he's
having second thoughts.

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,452
*

34
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,689
You ready for this?

35
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,457
I was born ready,
bro.

36
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,227
Whoa.

37
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,731
A moment with
my player, ref?

38
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,400
Hansen's the backup,
and I don't want to
hear any arguments.

39
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,001
I thought I was getting
a second chance.

40
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,671
You're arguing.

41
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,539
There's a delay of game
penalty with your name on it

42
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,309
If I don't get
a resolution A.S.A.P.

43
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,278
I can win this.

44
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,213
What's it gonna be,
coach?

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,817
(Whistle blows)

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,256
We'll run a switchblade
first, coach says.

47
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,822
Yeah, sure.

48
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,326
I mean it, man...
Switchblade!

49
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,727
Trying to win the
game by yourself.

50
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,297
My play is called
"the iceman".

51
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:19,933
I'm not talking
about your play.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,502
Do it... switchblade.

53
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,372
Bring us all in.

54
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,739
You got no time
for one shot,

55
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,308
And I know wherever
you're going.

56
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,143
15 seconds?
All I need is 10.

57
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,981
(Whistle blows)

58
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,350
All right, go! Go! Go!

59
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,089
Come on, Conor!
Switchblade!

60
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,191
Run switchblade!

61
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,861
Conor, pass! Sullivan,
that's not switchblade!

62
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,530
(Cheering)

63
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,780
Good job out there.
Good job out there.

64
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,452
Hey, Riggins.

65
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,387
Hey, did that go in?
I didn't see.

66
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,521
Conor, man, let it go.

67
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,723
Come on, fighting
means suspension.

68
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,861
That was wonderful.
Yeah, nice, man.

69
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,763
You should call
your father.

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,999
The only time
he won't pick up

71
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,300
Is when he's
on patrol.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,834
He's okay.

73
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,437
Dad calls that
"being in the shit".

74
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,904
Hey, Keegan!
Top-key mushrooms.

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,406
Maybe he didn't
pick up

76
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,875
Because his phone
is turned off.

77
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,143
Or maybe dad flew back
early from Iraq

78
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,812
To surprise his family.

79
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,815
Dad, you're home!
Ha ha ha!

80
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,918
You're looking
rather dashing,
colonel Sullivan.

81
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,952
As are you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

82
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,254
Perhaps I could escort you
home after this.

83
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,991
Perhaps you should.

84
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,859
Heh!
Aww.

85
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,727
Perhaps I could
escort you home
right now.

86
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,329
Easy, marine.
Get a room.

87
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,763
Ahh.

88
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,400
So, how come
you're home?

89
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,867
I'm wondering
the same thing.

90
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,836
Can't a guy just
slip away from the war

91
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,738
Without his family
thinking something's up?

92
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,172
No.

93
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,442
(Laughter)

94
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,544
I got some news.

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,525
I'll be right back.

96
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,360
Where are you going?

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,662
30 minutes, Conor.

98
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,000
Conor:
I can win this.

99
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,603
Dad: Other than the fact
that you let 14 get
inside your head,

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,872
I thought you were
ten tons of awesome.

101
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,473
Why are we
doing this, dad?
You know why.

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,074
We're gonna
move again.

103
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,477
Then they'll
call you back,

104
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,111
And it'll all
be for what?

105
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,880
Sorry, pal, that's
the military life.

106
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,082
Sometimes you gotta
just suck it up, son.

107
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,183
(Sighs)

108
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,355
Conor... It's
very important

109
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,959
That you tone your
attitude down here
on and off the field.

110
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,662
I had to pull some
strings to get you
in here.

111
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:13,166
I want you to promise me
that you'll show humility.

112
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,307
Conor, you listening
to me?

113
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,141
Not really, dad.

114
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,717
(Chuckles) Come on.

115
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,662
He's really cute.

116
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,831
Brooklyn: It's funny
what you notice

117
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,534
The first time
you see someone...

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,435
Confidence, a nice smile,

119
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,437
A little connection.

120
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,140
What you don't see...

121
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,509
What's impossible to know
at first glance...

122
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,578
Is everything else.

123
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:00,113
At least everything
that counts.

124
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,222
Hey, dad, how many
of those are yours?

125
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,958
That one.

126
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,996
And my name
is on that one.

127
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:20,199
And that was taken
right after the state
championship.

128
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,201
How many of those
did you win?

129
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,537
Four in a row.
Four?

130
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,938
Heh heh.
All right.

131
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,340
Hey, who's that
one guy you always...

132
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,010
Dave Milligan.

133
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,444
You're about
to meet him.

134
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,950
Straighten your tie.

135
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,486
He played on
one of the best
west coast teams ever.

136
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,056
The kid scored
70 goals last year.

137
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,891
Look, nobody
plays varsity
their first year.

138
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,594
I can't bench somebody
who's paid their dues.

139
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,195
It wouldn't be fair.

140
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,564
Since when are you
a stickler for propriety?

141
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,666
Why'd you
bring him here?

142
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,500
Because, despite our
considerable differences,

143
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,036
I know your reputation
as a coach,

144
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,770
And you turn out
a hell of a lacrosse player.

145
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,910
We play real lacrosse
here, not that west
coast field hockey.

146
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,977
Just play him,
see how he does.

147
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,213
I'm not asking
for favors.

148
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,117
I'm doing you
a favor just by
giving him a look,

149
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,387
And right now,
that's all I can
give you.

150
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,255
Fair enough.

151
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,903
(Indistinct chatter)

152
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,224
Can I help you?

153
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,227
Thanks,
but I'm pretty good
at dressing myself.

154
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,829
No, varsity only here.
Scrubs dress in there.

155
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,469
So, you're what passes
as varsity around here?

156
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,437
Yeah.

157
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,240
Heh. Awesome.

158
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,963
Yo, skip,
toss me a ball.

159
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,000
Watch the ball.
Sticks up, sticks up.

160
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,602
Watch that throw.
Watch the ball!

161
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,570
Let's go!

162
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,273
Great, guys.
Keep the pace up.

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,109
Stay focused.
Really well done.

164
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,977
Good, keep
the ball moving.

165
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:49,349
Oh, you're late,
west coast.
It's 4:00.

166
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,685
If you're not early,
you're late.
You owe me a lap.

167
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,687
Let's go,
cradle it out.

168
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,888
Sticks up. Keep your
feet moving.

169
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,759
Nice. Nicely done.
Watch the ball.

170
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,660
Get the energy up.
Sticks up.

171
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,095
You okay?

172
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
Cradle it out.
Sticks up.

173
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,377
Sticks up! Sticks up!

174
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,780
(Overlapping shouts)

175
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,948
Come on,
you can take him!

176
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,486
(Grunting)

177
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,188
(Laughs)

178
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,089
You think you can
do better, Sullivan?

179
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,292
Only one way
to find out.

180
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,794
Switch up your Jersey
to white.

181
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,362
Coach,
give me a whistle.

182
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:36,764
You got it, coach.

183
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,265
(Blows whistle)

184
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,801
Braveheart, give me
Bryant! Let's go

185
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,737
(Overlapping shouts)

186
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,707
Bryant, Sullivan,
let's go!

187
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:52,412
Anytime today, Sullivan!
Here we go!

188
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,713
Joe's gonna crush you.

189
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,447
One-on-one,
go on my whistle.

190
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,752
First one to score wins.
It's that simple. Got it?

191
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,720
Down. Keep it clean.

192
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,590
Good luck, brother.
I'm not your brother.

193
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:06,525
Oh, we're all brothers
in lacrosse, west coast.

194
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,361
(Whistle blows)

195
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,568
Come on!
Come on, west coast!

196
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,870
(Grunting)

197
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,842
No, no, no, no!

198
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,509
Hey!

199
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,576
Yeah!

200
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,512
(Cheering)

201
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,852
You should've
shot when you
had the chance.

202
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,387
Yeah, I guess so.

203
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,857
Welcome to Briarfield,
Sullivan.

204
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,805
Conor.

205
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:52,873
Conor.

206
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,843
Hey, come on, wake up.

207
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,643
Dad? Is the house
on fire?

208
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,178
No, it's morning.

209
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,117
No, it isn't.

210
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,421
It's close enough.
Let's go.

211
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,428
(Laughing and grunting)

212
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,764
Not bad, not bad.

213
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,232
(Cell phone rings)

214
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,069
Hang on a sec.
I gotta take this call.

215
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,740
Sullivan.

216
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,442
Morning, general.

217
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,947
Yes, sir.

218
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,519
Right. Okay.

219
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,090
Thank you, sir.

220
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,495
What was that about?
Nothing.

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,865
Just some advisory work
they want me to do.

222
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,466
That it?
Yeah, that's it.

223
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,700
Don't worry about it.

224
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,503
Let's go.

225
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:00,840
Okay.

226
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,810
Keep your arms
extended, this side.

227
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,678
Let's see
what you got. Go.

228
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,646
(Grunting)

229
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,448
Oh, nice, nice.

230
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,451
Except you gotta
learn how to shoot.

231
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,922
Who's gonna pick up
a guy who shoots
like a drunk woman?

232
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,522
Huh? Come on.

233
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,990
*

234
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,530
Brooklyn:
There are a bunch of ways
to find out about someone.

235
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,665
You can watch them
around other people,

236
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,968
Find out what
their interests are,

237
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,136
How they react
to new circumstances.

238
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,304
Sometimes, if you
really want to know,

239
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,706
It's easiest to just
talk to them yourself.

240
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,742
Hey.
Hey.

241
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,645
Hey yourself,
newbie.

242
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,113
Name's Conor Sullivan.

243
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,551
Brooklyn...

244
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,053
Milligan.

245
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,655
Ahem.

246
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,691
(Mutters)
Coach's daughter. Ahem.

247
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,293
(Laughs)

248
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,029
So, my dad says
you come out here

249
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,729
To practice
every day at 5 A.M.

250
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,265
Oh, does he?
He does.

251
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,869
Does that make you wonder
how your dad knows that?

252
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,570
Because it sure
makes me wonder.

253
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,939
(Laughs)

254
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,073
Hey, Joe, think fast!

255
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,608
Ha ha! Hey, babe.

256
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,077
Hey.

257
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,611
Hey, this is
my girlfriend Charlie.

258
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,880
Hey.
Hey.

259
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,547
Um...

260
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,616
We should probably
get back to practice.

261
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,918
Yeah.

262
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,021
See you later.
Bye.

263
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,622
See you later.
See you later.

264
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,728
Nothing's hotter than
chicks with sticks.

265
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,929
Nothing.

266
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,431
Just doesn't sound right.

267
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,100
I didn't mean it
that way.

268
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,235
(Overlapping shouts)

269
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,349
Gotta watch the pick!

270
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,318
Ohh.

271
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,588
(Grunts)

272
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,822
This kid can play.

273
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:58,390
He most definitely
can play.

274
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,527
So, what do you think?
You want to move him up?

275
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,429
We'll see where he is
in a week.

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Hey.

277
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,305
Nice practice.
Thanks.

278
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,044
You're not
taking my spot.

279
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,944
Do you play
right-side attack?

280
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,446
Damn straight.

281
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,450
Then I'm definitely
taking your spot.

282
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,387
Let it go.

283
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,228
(Chuckles) Ahh.

284
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,367
(Knock on door)

285
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,104
You wanted to see me?

286
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,777
Yeah, take a seat.

287
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,979
So, uh, you've been
practicing with us...

288
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,116
For, what,
about a week now?

289
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,817
What do you think?

290
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,919
Uh...

291
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,523
Well, I think you've
got a good system
going on...

292
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,757
Thanks, kid,
but I don't need you
to kiss my butt.

293
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,460
I'm asking if you can
play with them.

294
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,929
Not a one-man dance
out there,

295
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,599
But actually working
with them as a unit.

296
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,001
I thought you weren't
gonna play me.

297
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,735
Well, that may change.

298
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,405
May?
May.

299
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,005
You're not the God's gift
you think you are,

300
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,473
But you're better
than I expected.

301
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,046
Yes... I can play
with them.

302
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,781
Good. You'll suit up
on Friday.

303
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,817
It's our last game
before the playoffs.

304
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,853
Impress me.

305
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,091
(Overlapping shouts)

306
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,161
Why isn't he
playing Conor?

307
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,928
Relax, he knows
what he's doing.

308
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,431
I don't think Dave's
gonna give him a fair shot.

309
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,068
You know
us Sullivans, huh?

310
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,869
We always a way
to get it done.

311
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,672
(Laughs)

312
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,207
Move your feet!

313
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,076
Let's have some
pressure, defense!

314
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,882
All right, Dupree out!

315
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,051
Sullivan!

316
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,455
Eh-eh.

317
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,157
Remember what
I told you?

318
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,560
You got it?
Got it, coach.

319
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,828
Dad: Okay,
here we go.

320
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,429
It's about time.

321
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,332
He just wanted to show
Conor who's boss.

322
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,066
You think that taught
Conor anything?

323
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,269
Heh! Doubt it.

324
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,272
(Shouting)

325
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,382
Let's go, baby!
Nice goin'!

326
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,286
You gotta get your body
between the ball
and the goal, son.

327
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,019
What is this,
girls' volleyball?

328
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,354
(Cell phone ringing)

329
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,023
Good scrimmage!
First team, come off!

330
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,759
I'll be right back.

331
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,094
Dave: Nice job,
first team, good work.

332
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,332
Good work today. Nice.

333
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,568
Good effort.
Let's go, second team!

334
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,104
Let's see some pressure,
let's hear some talk!

335
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,140
That's what I'm talk...
come on, let's hear
some talk!

336
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,776
(Shouting)

337
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,111
Come on, let's go!
Keep it moving!

338
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,847
Keep that ball high!

339
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,915
(Shouting continues)

340
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,227
(Whistle blows)

341
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,894
End of the day.
Hit the showers.

342
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,129
Good work today.

343
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,666
Good work today,
everybody.

344
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,277
You didn't
have to wait.

345
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,045
Well, I think
we should talk.

346
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,181
All right.

347
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,322
So, who was that
on the phone?

348
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,229
They need me
back in Iraq.

349
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,066
Well,
mom needs you here.

350
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,369
So does Keegan.

351
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,574
Under six months.
That's it.

352
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,641
That's just
another surge.

353
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,877
We could've just
stayed in California.

354
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,845
At least then
I'd have some friends
to hang out with...

355
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:19,586
I know it wasn't
part of the plan.

356
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,988
Then this is where
you need to be.

357
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,957
This is your future.

358
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,960
Six months.

359
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,032
Come on.

360
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,869
*

361
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,749
Conor?

362
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,083
I've got something
for you.

363
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,218
What is it?

364
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,186
A box of roses.

365
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,656
Just open it.

366
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,863
That's what you said
they called you, right?

367
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,765
Captain America?

368
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,737
Hope you score
a lot of goals
with that, son.

369
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,773
But it's important
how you score.

370
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,042
Never put yourself
above the game.

371
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,114
Now, give your
old man a hug.

372
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,284
Come on.

373
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,160
I'll have my
right hand shot down
when you get back.

374
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,028
Can't wait.

375
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,699
Keep your head down
over there.

376
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,535
You just keep your
head up over here.

377
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,713
(Alarm ringing)

378
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,794
*

379
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,019
He's here.

380
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,027
You're late,
west coast.

381
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,097
Late to my own practice
that you're intruding on.

382
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,467
Intruding, huh?

383
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,401
We could leave.

384
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,370
You can stay.

385
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,039
My work here is done.

386
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,278
At least try
to play hard-to-get.

387
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,946
Shut up.

388
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,250
You ready?

389
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,088
Let's do it.

390
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:43,456
(Grunting)

391
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,068
You okay?

392
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:59,671
Yeah. Fine.

393
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,917
I can't shoot
with this thing.

394
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,151
Shooting strings
are a mess.

395
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,522
Ahh.

396
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,558
Much better.

397
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,159
Maybe if you didn't
shoot so hard.

398
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,170
I heard
about your dad.

399
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,306
Yeah?

400
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,442
How long
is he gone for?

401
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,112
Six months.
Hmm.

402
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,184
(Car horn honks)

403
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,623
(Sighs)

404
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,962
Same time tomorrow?

405
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,299
Well, I'd hate
to intrude.

406
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,769
(Chuckles)

407
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,141
Uhh!

408
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,478
Morning.

409
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,647
(Sighs)

410
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,516
It's fine.

411
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,552
When your daughter
leaves the house
before dawn,

412
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,152
It's not spying,
it's parenting.

413
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,487
(Scoffs)

414
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,955
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

415
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,657
To hang around
that Sullivan kid,
though.

416
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,294
Dad, I barely
even know him.

417
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,797
Right.

418
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,469
Everybody gather up!

419
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,505
Whole team, gather!
Let's go!

420
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,309
Everyone, bring it in!

421
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:44,811
I've just been informed

422
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,746
That Briarfield has been
selected as the location

423
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,683
For the first ever east-west
championship game.

424
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,184
Gentlemen,
it is my intention

425
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,220
That we're not only
hosting that game,

426
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:56,287
But we're playing in it.

427
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,390
Hands in, men.
Warriors on three.

428
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,559
(Cheering)

429
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,560
One, two, three.

430
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,995
All: Warriors!

431
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,463
Let's go out
and show 'em who we are!

432
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,934
Come on!

433
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,771
(Overlapping shouts)

434
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,721
(Whistle blows)

435
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,661
Sullivan, get in there
for Dupree.

436
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,733
Uhh!
Uhh!

437
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,905
(Overlapping shouts)

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,823
Bounce back up.
Let's go.

439
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,494
(Whistle blows)

440
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,596
We got number 9...
unsportsmanlike
conduct.

441
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,031
Two minutes.

442
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,266
That was a stupid play.

443
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,671
He pushed me,
I pushed back.

444
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:21,307
Come on Briarfield!
Man down!

445
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,142
Let's go!

446
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:28,147
(Indistinct shouts)

447
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,443
Nice game, Conor.

448
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:58,778
Except for the penalty.

449
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,511
Dad would've been proud.

450
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,680
Thanks, mom.

451
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,115
There's some mail
for you.

452
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,588
(Laughs)
What is it?

453
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:15,194
Dad signed me up
for some old-school
lacrosse camp.

454
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,196
Looks good,
doesn't it?

455
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,866
Run by native American
players.

456
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,769
Your dad used to
love it up there.

457
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:32,543
"Ha ha, dad.
Indian lacrosse camp.

458
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,347
Hooray east coast."

459
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,222
Your dad knows
how to text?

460
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,124
Uh, yeah.
He said he made
his private show him.

461
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,770
(Coughs)

462
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,739
* then we went up

463
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,808
* we are much older

464
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,911
* you wait like an angel

465
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,580
* and I pine
like a soldier *

466
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,650
* but I remember love

467
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,254
* love don't remember me

468
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,892
* it's been a long

469
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,728
* long time

470
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,664
* since I've been on

471
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,667
* your mind

472
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,903
* but I cannot

473
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,739
* decline

474
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:37,776
* anything for you

475
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,983
* I'll drink the whiskey

476
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,953
* you'll drink
gin and tonic *

477
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,788
* you got
much more strong *

478
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:52,190
* I got more neurotic

479
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,994
* but I remember love

480
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:59,030
* but love
don't remember me *

481
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:28,895
* now that I've been
replaced *

482
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,000
* I have the guts
to face *

483
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,168
(Lyrics indistinct)

484
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,840
Mother: Thank you
for coming.

485
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,477
Is it cold in here?

486
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,115
(Indistinct chatter)

487
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:00,258
Hey. With all
due respect, son,

488
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,860
I think your mom
needs you here.

489
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,931
I can't stay.
I just can't.

490
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,532
A warrior doesn't
run from pain.

491
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,801
Do the right thing
by your family

492
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,604
And stick around.

493
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,907
I'm sorry,
but I just really need
to get out of here.

494
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,952
(Indistinct chatter)

495
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,920
Hey, you mind
if I, um...

496
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,710
I'm...

497
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,079
I'm so...

498
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,624
It's okay.

499
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,659
I'm so sorry.

500
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,001
I can't go back
in there right now.

501
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,975
Let's...

502
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,277
Let's get out of here.

503
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,980
Okay?

504
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,350
I'll drive.

505
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,686
Yeah.

506
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:11,223
(Grunting)

507
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,327
Arms extended.

508
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,147
Are you better?

509
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,216
A little.

510
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,021
As good as I can be.

511
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,998
Hey, Brookie.

512
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,535
Come on,
we gotta go.

513
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,504
(Sighs)

514
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,942
See you tomorrow?

515
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,512
You know the time.

516
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,863
I thought I asked you
to stay away from him.

517
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,132
What is your problem?

518
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,733
He just buried
his dad.

519
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,435
He's not real stable
right now.

520
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,104
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

521
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,513
*

522
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,180
Uhh!

523
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,947
What was that?
What?

524
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,882
What was that?

525
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,785
(Overlapping shouts)

526
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,222
Hey! Hey!

527
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,889
Settle down!
Settle down!

528
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,158
Dupree, you're done.
Back off, back off.

529
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,892
Sullivan, get out.

530
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,929
Go, go.

531
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,164
Get out of here.

532
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,564
Let's go, everybody
back to work.

533
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,866
Come on. Get back
to your stations.

534
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,836
Let's go.

535
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,615
Mom: Is this
about what happened?

536
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,651
Dave: Believe me,
it's not about that.

537
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,786
I have
a responsibility to...

538
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:57,488
Hello, Conor.

539
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,725
Coach.

540
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,160
I was just talking
with your mother

541
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,196
About whether
to let you play again.

542
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,368
It's been a month
since...

543
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,240
I thought you'd be
a little less
hotheaded by now,

544
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,008
But after today, I...

545
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,809
I need this.

546
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,813
Otherwise, I can't play
at the naval academy.

547
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,285
I know. But I need you
to be a player,
not a liability.

548
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,753
I'm trying to get
this team

549
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,153
In the national
championship game.

550
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,989
We could use you.

551
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,323
But if you fight again,

552
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,827
That's it...
You are off my team.

553
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,430
So, what you're
saying is,

554
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,900
I have to let them
beat on me
and just take it?

555
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,535
If you want to come back
as a player, you're welcome.

556
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,937
Otherwise,
don't come back at all.

557
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,308
But what you're doing
out there now

558
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,843
Is not lacrosse.

559
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,847
Brooklyn: You think
you know someone.

560
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,048
You have
a nice connection.

561
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,286
But before they can
let you in,

562
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:01,853
They've got to
let themselves in.

563
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,590
They have to learn
their own heart.

564
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,957
Come on,
you're gonna be late.

565
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,328
Come on,
you said yourself
you needed to play.

566
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,162
Don't waste
this opportunity.

567
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,999
I'm not going.
You've been given
a second chance.

568
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,934
Just leave me alone.

569
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,136
Honey, I know
this is hard for you.

570
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,772
Do you?!

571
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,984
Come on.
You need to
suck it up, mom.

572
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,889
That's what this is?
You're sucking it up?

573
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,825
Since you've got
it all figured out,

574
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,692
Why don't you
step up and be a man?

575
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,728
Get yourself
to school on time.

576
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,596
Maybe you can spend
a little time
with Keegan.

577
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,165
Because you know what?
He's not sucking it up.

578
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,402
He's gotta learn.

579
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,319
Hey.

580
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,321
Hey.

581
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,190
Where were you
this morning?

582
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,392
I was up late.

583
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,927
Okay.

584
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,197
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

585
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:26,236
What's the point?

586
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,439
You know your dad's
never liked me.

587
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,876
Doesn't even want you
around me.

588
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,811
Oh, come on.
We both know

589
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,481
My dad cares more
about winning the
championship game.

590
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,850
But it isn't enough
to be good, Conor.

591
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:42,320
Maybe if you were
more of a team player,

592
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,322
He would find a way
to use you.

593
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,758
Wow. So, you're
taking his side now?

594
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,595
Are you serious
right now?

595
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,831
I have been on your
side since day one.

596
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:56,667
Frankly,
I don't know what
your side is anymore.

597
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,985
(Whistle blows)

598
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,724
Sullivan, Douglas
is banged up.

599
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,527
Get in there.
Left side attack. Yes.

600
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,395
All right,
Briarfield, let's go!

601
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,195
Come on!

602
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,465
Hey, Sullivan!

603
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,566
How you liking
that left side?

604
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,175
(Whistle blows)

605
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,413
(Overlapping shouts)

606
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:58,063
Here, here, here!

607
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:01,099
Come on!
Come on!

608
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,400
(Shouting continues)

609
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,706
Ref, come on!

610
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,611
(Cheering)

611
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,324
Conor, no!

612
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,528
(Whistle blows)

613
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,128
You're done.
Get out of my sight.

614
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,511
You all right?

615
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,647
(Indistinct chatter)

616
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:54,085
*

617
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,135
(Yells)

618
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,606
What is wrong with you?

619
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,240
Hey! Stop right there!

620
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:01,653
(Sighs) Heck of a way
to start spring break.

621
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,288
Any idea who
might've done this?

622
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,492
Um, it all happened
so fast.

623
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,161
I didn't...

624
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,780
* in the light of the sun

625
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:33,183
* is there anyone?

626
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,756
* oh, it has begun

627
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:40,290
* oh, dear,
you look so lost... *

628
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,193
No.

629
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,331
* your eyes are red,
your tears are shed *

630
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:50,268
* this world you must
have crossed, you said *

631
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,671
* you don't know me

632
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:58,442
* and you don't even care

633
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:01,445
* oh, yeah

634
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:02,580
* you said

635
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,684
* you don't know me

636
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:11,456
* and you don't
wear my chains *

637
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:14,291
* oh, yeah

638
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,230
Conor.

639
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,732
I'm going to bed.

640
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,102
You're not going
anywhere, Conor Sullivan.

641
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,138
* essential, yet appealed

642
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:32,343
* you carry
all your thoughts *

643
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,715
* across an open field

644
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:40,686
* where flowers gaze at you

645
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,223
* they're not the only ones

646
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,626
* who cry when they see you,
you said *

647
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:51,561
* you don't know me

648
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,767
* and you don't even care

649
00:43:55,834 --> 00:44:00,437
* no, no, no,

650
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,273
Sullivan!

651
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,611
He doesn't deserve
that name.

652
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,480
The kid has no idea.

653
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,749
You wear glasses?

654
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,451
No.

655
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:14,752
Any prescription
medication

656
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,353
I need to know of?

657
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,755
What? No.

658
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,324
Do you have
a cell phone?

659
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,226
No.

660
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,329
From this point on,
you do not speak
unless spoken to.

661
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,630
Am I clear?

662
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,533
You're coming with me.

663
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:31,301
Like hell I am.

664
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:35,072
Fine. Spend another
night in jail.

665
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,675
Okay, okay.

666
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,748
So, where are we going?

667
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,449
The six nations
work camp.

668
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,284
It's where we send
all the reservation kids

669
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,319
Who can't get
their life together...

670
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,355
Kids like you.

671
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,890
Work camp?

672
00:44:51,957 --> 00:45:16,814
Like picking up
litter and shit?

673
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,017
Get out.

674
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,695
(Both speak
native language)

675
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,497
Court papers?

676
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,366
Didn't get that far.

677
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,737
Weapons?

678
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,572
Drugs?

679
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,608
Pornography?

680
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:46,778
What? No.

681
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,383
I'm gonna frisk you
just the same.

682
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,085
And this will turn
into a court case
if you're lying.

683
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:57,789
Hands on the counter.

684
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:00,690
Spread your feet.

685
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,760
And your cheeks.

686
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,870
Sit.

687
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,739
I'll grab
your counselor.

688
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,508
I am
his counselor.

689
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,043
Yeah?

690
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,280
Okay.

691
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,615
Missionary Ridge.

692
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,617
Think you can find
your way back in the dark?

693
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,419
Shitfaced and blind.

694
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:33,458
(Both speak
native language)

695
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,969
(Thunder)

696
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,735
Not that it matters,

697
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,341
But would you mind
explaining to me
this whole thing?

698
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,643
Do not speak
unless spoken to.

699
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,313
Well,
where are we going?

700
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,916
What are we
supposed to eat?

701
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,993
You gotta be
kidding me.

702
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:16,366
(Thunder)

703
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,104
Jeez!

704
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,876
You need to build
a shelter

705
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:27,645
If you plan on
getting some sleep.

706
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:28,947
It's impossible.

707
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:30,614
(Thunder)

708
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,986
Duke! Duke!

709
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,824
Duke!

710
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,061
Duke!

711
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:46,932
* If heaven would
fall down from the sky *

712
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:50,167
* and I'd walk right in

713
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,703
* I wouldn't know
where to begin, no *

714
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,875
(Lyrics indistinct)

715
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:02,580
* what did I ever do

716
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:05,782
* to deserve
to be kicked out? *

717
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,885
* oh, oh

718
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:12,422
* can you remind me?

719
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:15,126
* or can we write
the songs... *

720
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,827
Who are you texting?

721
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,331
Joe?
Yeah.

722
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,167
Any news
from your felon?

723
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:26,870
I can't stop
thinking about him.

724
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:31,409
But how do you
know if someone's
right for you?

725
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:34,279
Obviously, I can't
ask my dad about Conor,

726
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,847
And my mom's been gone
for so long.

727
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,550
I just don't know.

728
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,053
I guess you just have
to trust yourself,

729
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,056
And if he's right
for you, you'll know it.

730
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,325
Mm-hmm.

731
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,473
(Coughs)

732
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,416
(Coughs)

733
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,199
(Coughs)

734
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,801
Hey, home slice.

735
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:35,106
How come you slept
out in the rain
last night?

736
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,507
I got a great
shelter here.

737
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,708
Why didn't you
come get me?

738
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,312
Is it noon yet?

739
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:45,483
I don't know.
Aren't you an Indian?

740
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,618
Can't you look up
at the sun or something?

741
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,490
Well, it's gotta be
noon somewhere.

742
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,958
Well, you'd better
get started.

743
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,294
Started on what?

744
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:01,931
Knocking it down.

745
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,000
Why would I want
to knock down

746
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,035
A perfectly good shed?

747
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,704
Don't you live
in this place?

748
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,605
I've got my reasons.

749
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,675
I don't even know how
to use one of those.

750
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:17,415
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

751
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:20,984
Which is
your chicken-choker?

752
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,554
My what?
Answer the question.

753
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,491
Are you really
asking me that?

754
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,628
You could've
killed me, man!

755
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,130
Lefty. Interesting.

756
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:34,699
One hand on the bottom,
one on the top.

757
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,202
Swing over
your shoulder,
extend your arms.

758
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,570
You get a lot more
power that way.

759
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:44,075
This place is
a freakin' mansion.

760
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,077
How am I supposed
to knock it all down?

761
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:48,113
Board by board.

762
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:52,049
Board by
ever-loving board.

763
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:54,418
Am ambidextrous.

764
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,754
*

765
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:06,131
* you feel like a candle

766
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,966
* in a hurricane

767
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,867
* just like a picture...

768
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:14,003
Be sure to extend
your arm.

769
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,641
* alone and helpless

770
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,208
* like you've lost
your fight *

771
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,044
* but you'll be all right

772
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:23,547
* you'll be all right

773
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:26,117
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

774
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,718
* you taste what
you're made of *

775
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,221
* you might bend
till you break *

776
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,192
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

777
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,227
* on your knees,
you look up *

778
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,696
* decide you've
had enough *

779
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,266
* you get mad,
you get strong *

780
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,067
* wipe your hands,
shake it off *

781
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,470
* then you stand

782
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,209
* whoo, ooh

783
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:56,580
* 'cause when push
comes to shove *

784
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,217
* you taste what
you're made of *

785
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,752
* you might bend
till you break *

786
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,289
* 'cause it's all
you can take *

787
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:06,757
* on your knees,
you look up *

788
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:09,894
* decide you've
had enough... *

789
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,330
(Man screaming)

790
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:27,178
Get working.

791
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,951
I have blisters.

792
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:36,620
(Laughs)

793
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:56,406
There's gotta be
a purpose.

794
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:03,180
Crazy Indians got me
knocking down
a stupid shed

795
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,952
'cause it represents me
breaking myself down.

796
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,020
Yeah.

797
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:13,190
So stupid.

798
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,995
Why am I doing this?

799
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:21,232
You tell me.
You're the one
who screwed up.

800
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,668
When do I get
to go home?

801
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,336
When you learn
your lesson.

802
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,104
When's that
gonna be?

803
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,975
When I'm finished
knocking down your
palace here?

804
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,246
Kid, there's dozens of
buildings just like this

805
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,282
Waiting for you
and that sledgehammer.

806
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,584
What, Sully's
little boy

807
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,019
Want to come out here
and take a swing?

808
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,389
Temper is good.

809
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,357
It's how you use it
that matters.

810
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,360
When you fight,
you quit. Right?

811
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:52,330
In life, in lacrosse...
You know you failed.

812
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,163
You know you're not
gonna win.

813
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,601
So, you throw a punch.
And you quit.

814
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,907
Get back to work,
you little jerk-off.

815
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,480
(Squawking)

816
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,187
Is it 12:00 yet?

817
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,224
Crazy Indian.

818
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,393
Where's your sundial?

819
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,962
Save it.

820
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,333
You work,
I'll talk.

821
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,904
You know,
I'm a full-blooded
Iroquois.

822
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,776
This may sound
antiquated to you,

823
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:42,746
But the Iroquois
banded with five
other tribes

824
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:44,915
To form
the six nations...

825
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:47,318
A participatory
democracy

826
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:49,320
That lasts
to this day.

827
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,622
I have no idea what
any of that means.

828
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,494
A participatory
democracy

829
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:59,797
Means that my people
got the vote

830
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:02,900
100 years before
Thomas Jefferson

831
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,671
Decided all men
were created equal.

832
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,940
So?

833
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,209
So, you couldn't be
more authentically

834
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,679
And originally American
than that.

835
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,050
So, the next time
you call me
a crazy Indian,

836
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:24,822
I will personally
tattoo those words
to your forehead.

837
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,863
Do I have to
remind you again?

838
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:36,367
Do not speak unless
you're spoken to!

839
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,036
I was talking
to myself.

840
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:40,704
What?

841
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,739
I'm pretty sure
this is illegal.

842
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:46,377
So is destroying
a trophy case.

843
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,880
Now, work!

844
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,901
(Man shouting
in the distance)

845
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,509
(Shouting continues)

846
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,650
(Shouting)

847
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,237
Heh.

848
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,274
Permission to speak.

849
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,210
Define "warrior".

850
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:58,214
Someone who spills blood
on the field of battle.

851
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,485
What about...
I know what
you're gonna say.

852
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:02,186
But don't waste
your breath asking.

853
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:05,122
Turf burns do not now
and never will count

854
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,757
As spilling blood.

855
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:09,927
I'm sure your dad
taught you all this.

856
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:13,530
My dad was never
really around
to teach me much.

857
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:17,200
Well, that's
too bad for you.

858
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,570
'Cause my colonel
was there for me
in a big way.

859
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,941
Let me tell you
a story.

860
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:28,411
I left the F.O.B.
In a re-supply convoy

861
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:30,948
To the other side
of Fallujah.

862
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:33,484
You know what
we were carrying?
Ammo?

863
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,218
Energy drinks.

864
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:37,555
Gatorade and red bull.

865
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:40,824
The bare necessities,
right?

866
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,861
Then, all of a sudden,
we come to a traffic jam.

867
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:51,035
Before I know it,
I'm hit.

868
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,436
And the corpsman
takes one in the head

869
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:57,107
As he runs to save me.

870
00:57:57,174 --> 00:58:00,244
And, I mean...

871
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:01,911
We can't move.

872
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:05,248
All of a sudden,
we're surrounded.

873
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,184
End of story.

874
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:12,356
Then your dad just
comes out of nowhere,

875
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:14,859
Like the cavalry.

876
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,126
You know what
he says to me?

877
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,197
"I'll never drink
another Gatorade

878
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,000
As long as I live."

879
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:28,305
And somehow he gets
the medevac.

880
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,774
He gets me out.

881
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:37,147
He gets everybody out.

882
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:40,950
I never knew a warrior
better than him.

883
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,607
Duke: Well,
you're up early.

884
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,741
Can't sleep.

885
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:07,244
I could swear
I'm hearing things.

886
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,478
Well, all right.

887
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,815
Let's go find them.

888
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,952
Find what?

889
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,654
The noises.

890
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,189
(Men shouting and whooping)

891
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,606
Conor: So, that's
what I've been hearing?

892
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,642
(Shouting)

893
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:45,115
Some of those guys
are the counselors

894
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:47,450
From the six nations
lacrosse camp

895
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:48,686
Your dad signed
you up for.

896
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,688
They come down here

897
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:52,690
To play the counselors
from the work camp.

898
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:54,792
Who are
the other players?

899
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,560
It's just them.
It's real lacrosse.

900
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:00,230
And, brother,
let me tell you... real.

901
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,767
Your dad played here.

902
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,702
He was a counselor?

903
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:07,672
Just a camper.
Hand-picked...

904
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:11,241
For his love of
the game was pure.

905
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:20,785
(Overlapping shouts)

906
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,587
You know,
Milligan played at
this game, too.

907
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:27,090
You didn't know that,
did you?

908
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,427
He and your dad
played together at Navy
after that.

909
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:33,630
They were cool until
a woman came between them.

910
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:35,999
Milligan fell hard
for her.

911
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,736
Your dad just
stole her away.

912
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,040
My mom?

913
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,278
My dad did that?
To a friend?

914
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:52,750
You know, every great man
has a weakness,

915
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:56,385
And Sully's...
It was Claire.

916
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,291
I'm giving up
lacrosse.

917
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,994
Why? Just because
your old man
wasn't a Saint?

918
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,799
You don't get it.

919
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:12,036
Every time
I pick up a stick,

920
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,604
Every time I hear
the word "lacrosse",

921
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,874
I think of my dad.

922
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:21,144
You know, if I could
say something...

923
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,082
Let him run
in your veins.

924
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,152
Let him
make you better.

925
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,823
He was proud of you.

926
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,994
Don't forget that.

927
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:47,838
Let's go.

928
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,842
(Shouts and laughter)

929
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,444
West coast.

930
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,749
Duke,
how you doing, sir?

931
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:00,384
What are you
doing here?

932
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,718
Spring break.

933
01:02:01,786 --> 01:02:03,720
This is where
I learned to play.

934
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,256
Briarfield made
the championship.

935
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:10,060
Good for you guys.
Thanks.

936
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:13,362
Come on,
be on my team.
Let's go.

937
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,805
Here we go! Go!

938
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,372
(Cheering)

939
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:29,879
All right, guys,
I found a couple more.

940
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,782
This game's faster.

941
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,716
Looks the same
to me.

942
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:37,120
Heh. Ready?
Game on!

943
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,456
Trash talk out here...
You lose a few teeth.

944
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,792
(Overlapping shouts)

945
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,127
Ha ha ha!
You see that?

946
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:45,661
Were you watching
the roll dodge

947
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,264
Or were you watching
Joe getting burned?

948
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,731
I was watching Joe
get schooled.

949
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,535
Iron sharpens iron.

950
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,769
All right?

951
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:55,138
Joe's getting awfully
sharp today.

952
01:02:57,706 --> 01:02:59,742
Two points down!

953
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,112
(Shouting continues)

954
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,554
Go! Go! Go!

955
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,425
(Shouting continues)

956
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,870
Go! Go!
Ha ha ha!

957
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,108
Ha!
Yeah!

958
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,548
(Shouting continues)

959
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,819
What the hell, man?

960
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:44,321
Joe! Joe! Joe!

961
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:47,524
Come on, man!

962
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,527
(Shouting continues)

963
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,362
Here we go, here we go.

964
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,166
Really?!

965
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,672
(Grunting)
Get off me!

966
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,910
(Grunting)

967
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:20,657
Nighty night.

968
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,825
Let's go!

969
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,962
Play on. Here we go.

970
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:41,078
It's more than
a game, west coast.

971
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,581
When are you
gonna learn that?

972
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,802
Brooklyn: It's hard to say
if warriors are born

973
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,539
Or if they're made
by circumstances.

974
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:12,675
I know everyone faces
hardship in life.

975
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,379
It just seems like
some people

976
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,248
Are actually
made stronger by it.

977
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:28,492
Brooklyn:
I thought you wanted
to be the best.

978
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,495
Dad: Sometimes in life,
you just gotta
suck it up, son.

979
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,531
What you're doing
out there now
is not lacrosse.

980
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,866
When I was your age,
I could go for hours.

981
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,569
Conor:
Think I don't do that?

982
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,138
I never see it.

983
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:43,040
Brooklyn: What is
wrong with you?!

984
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,976
Mom: Why don't you
step up and be a man?

985
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:12,036
Hey.

986
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,570
This place is
starting to bore me.

987
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,672
Let's head back.

988
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:28,117
So, I still
don't get it.

989
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,919
Was this supposed
to be a metaphor?

990
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,358
Was I knocking down
the walls of my anger?

991
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,693
I mean, what was I
doing up there?

992
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,129
You think too much.

993
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:41,665
It's a simple
question.

994
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,503
How do you feel
right now?

995
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:50,873
Pissed that you
kicked my butt.

996
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:53,143
Other than that.

997
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:56,146
Honestly?

998
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,882
Confused.

999
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:01,785
It's about time.

1000
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,020
What?

1001
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,891
I spent a week...

1002
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:10,959
Knocking down
a house...

1003
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,662
So I could feel
confused?

1004
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,934
You spent a week
knocking down a house

1005
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:20,104
So you could feel
at all.

1006
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,650
Look, you're
on your own now.

1007
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,518
I'm not gonna be
able to be there

1008
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,486
To rein in
that temper

1009
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:41,023
Or whisper words
of sweet wisdom
in your ear.

1010
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:43,827
You gotta
hold it together.

1011
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:45,928
Can you do that?

1012
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,864
Yeah. Sure.

1013
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:52,836
Well... That's
a resounding hoorah.

1014
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:55,672
You know, if I was
a betting man...
which I am...

1015
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,006
I wouldn't put a single
George Washington

1016
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,442
On your self-importance.

1017
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:03,011
Ahh...
that's just
the way I am.

1018
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,848
Now, your old man...

1019
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,551
He would've probably
done things differently.

1020
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:13,157
You asked me for the
definition of a warrior.

1021
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:17,360
A warrior
gets the job done.

1022
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:20,729
That's all I got.

1023
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:28,905
Now get out
of my truck.

1024
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:31,507
Yes, sir.

1025
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,748
Hey, kid.

1026
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:43,519
For the record,
I'm rooting for you.

1027
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:47,224
Thank you.

1028
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:52,128
(Starts engine)

1029
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,109
Whoa. What's up, buddy?

1030
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,910
Man, you need
a shower.

1031
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,547
I try.

1032
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:14,484
Mom... Is it okay
if I go see Brooklyn?

1033
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:19,623
Here.

1034
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,792
Wish me luck.

1035
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,495
(Sighs)

1036
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,204
(Playing classical music)

1037
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,661
(Stops playing)

1038
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,164
(Doorbell rings)

1039
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:03,867
(Resumes playing)

1040
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:08,238
Help you?

1041
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,039
I'm here
to see Brooklyn.

1042
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,708
I'm not so different
from you.

1043
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,376
You're never playing
for me again.

1044
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,811
But I'll play.

1045
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,115
Anywhere there's
a couple of goals
and a field,

1046
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:20,983
I can find a game.

1047
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:22,752
I'm a lacrosse player.

1048
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,889
And that's one thing
no one can ever take
away from me.

1049
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,598
And, with all
due respect,

1050
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,933
Tell Brooklyn
I stopped by.

1051
01:10:47,976 --> 01:10:49,612
Hey.

1052
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:58,388
*

1053
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,260
Brooklyn: The heart's
a funny thing.

1054
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,765
It can break,
it can beat a little faster.

1055
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:12,000
But the most important thing
it can do is heal.

1056
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,770
And if you follow it,

1057
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:16,439
It'll lead you
where you need to go.

1058
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,004
(Beeps)

1059
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:50,306
*

1060
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:12,095
(Beeping)

1061
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,063
Get up.

1062
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,000
(Laughs)
Where'd you come from?

1063
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:24,441
(Indistinct chatter)

1064
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:26,443
Oh.
(Laughs)

1065
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,111
I can do that, too.
Aah! Ha ha!

1066
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:30,447
Goal.

1067
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,180
That was cheating.

1068
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:33,450
(Beeps)

1069
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:35,151
All right.

1070
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:37,053
Oh!

1071
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,189
(Indistinct chatter)

1072
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,026
Here, take it. Oh!

1073
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:53,870
(Beeps)

1074
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,513
(Laughs)

1075
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:08,585
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1076
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:13,489
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

1077
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:17,025
* if I kiss you
where it's sore *

1078
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,931
* will you feel better,
better, better? *

1079
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:26,069
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1080
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,336
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1081
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,973
(Beeps)

1082
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:36,111
* will you feel
anything at all? *

1083
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,914
Joe: Good, Sullivan.

1084
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,552
Nice to see you,
east coast.

1085
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,554
Nice to be seen,
west coast.

1086
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:47,524
Performing
your penance?

1087
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:49,291
How'd you know
I was here?

1088
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:51,660
Word gets out.

1089
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,798
If you don't mind,

1090
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,733
I invited some friends.

1091
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:00,402
Let's go, guys!

1092
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,539
Whoa!
There he is!

1093
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:04,339
The boys took
a little vote,

1094
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:07,443
And we decided
we could use your help
this next game.

1095
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:11,080
In case you didn't hear,
we're, uh...

1096
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,148
We're playing
your old school
for the championship.

1097
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,550
Thanks, Dupree.

1098
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,585
I won't let
you guys down.

1099
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,721
What's up, boys?

1100
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:24,092
Let's go, guys.
Let's throw some
balls around, huh?

1101
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,195
Brooklyn: The beauty
of finding yourself

1102
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:28,797
And really knowing
who you are

1103
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,034
Is that it allows
the possibility

1104
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:34,203
For others to be a part
of your world as well.

1105
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,440
Hey.

1106
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,476
Heh.

1107
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,182
* do you

1108
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:48,283
* want to get to

1109
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,986
* know me?

1110
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:54,356
* every little thing that

1111
01:14:54,422 --> 01:14:57,761
* makes me me

1112
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,865
* if you want
the best I've got *

1113
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:06,703
* it'll cost you
a little honesty *

1114
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,008
* take a deep breath

1115
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:15,378
* and tell me what
you're feeling... *

1116
01:15:15,443 --> 01:15:17,914
(Sighs)

1117
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,789
Hey.
Hey.

1118
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,938
What the hell is this?

1119
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,475
We need west coast.

1120
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,212
Out of the question.

1121
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:53,617
We aren't asking,
coach.

1122
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:58,887
This isn't a democracy.

1123
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:02,225
He knows Sierra
better than any of us.

1124
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:05,894
Come on, you guys.
Get back to class.

1125
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,200
Brooklyn?

1126
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:13,637
You need to find
a way, coach.

1127
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,704
This is a team issue,
Brookie.

1128
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,206
No. No,
it's personal, daddy.

1129
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,076
So find a way.

1130
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:23,045
Either Conor plays,
or none of us play.

1131
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:25,413
There's a national
title on the line.
We're a team.

1132
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,150
Remember?

1133
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:29,284
Sullivan's a good kid,
and he's been
through a lot,

1134
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,786
But he's not up to this.

1135
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:33,322
And he'll take you all
down with him.

1136
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:37,226
Then we all go down
together.

1137
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,864
Big game today, dad.

1138
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:46,235
I'm sure you'd have something
inspirational to say.

1139
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:52,308
Well, guess what?

1140
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,644
I met a girl.

1141
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:56,979
She's beautiful, dad.

1142
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,349
And the best part is...

1143
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,986
She's Milligan's daughter.

1144
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:07,055
I'm sure you got
a kick out of that.

1145
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,862
You should see
my right-handed shot.

1146
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,035
I miss you, dad.

1147
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:26,608
I'm gonna get it done.

1148
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:28,712
I promise you.

1149
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,981
(Cheering)

1150
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,885
(Overlapping shouts)

1151
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,257
Look sharp,
west coast.

1152
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,860
Respect the game,
east coast.

1153
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,531
You ready
to win this?

1154
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,399
How cute is he?

1155
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,202
He looks
like his father.

1156
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,206
(Whistle blows)

1157
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:00,676
Let's go!
Sideline, everybody!

1158
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,680
Gather up, gentlemen.

1159
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,215
This is it.

1160
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,552
The national championship
is on the line.

1161
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:11,653
It's yours to win.

1162
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:14,490
Hands in, gentlemen.
Do or die.

1163
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,559
"Warriors" on three.

1164
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:17,660
One, two, three!

1165
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,562
All: Warriors!

1166
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:23,366
Let's go, baby!

1167
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,769
To the national high school
lacrosse championship,

1168
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,204
Courtesy of lacrosse-x.Com.

1169
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:30,706
This will be the first ever
national high school
lacrosse championship,

1170
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:34,210
Featuring the best
of the east...
the Briarfield warriors...

1171
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:36,880
Versus the best of the west...
The Sierra lions.

1172
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,815
Shake hands.

1173
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:40,682
The captains shake
as we get ready

1174
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,887
For the national championship
high school match-up.

1175
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,792
Dude. Midfield,
new team.

1176
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,794
Fresh start,
green hornet.

1177
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,796
What's Riggins
doing here?

1178
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:54,730
Late-season transfer.

1179
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,698
How sweet is that?

1180
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,600
You hear me, Sullivan?

1181
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,135
Did you say
something?

1182
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:01,703
Both teams at midfield
as we get underway.

1183
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:03,239
We'll have a chance to see

1184
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:04,740
If west coast lacrosse
is ready

1185
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,508
For the national stage,

1186
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,244
And whether they can overcome
the transfer

1187
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:09,779
Of their former
star player...

1188
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:21,723
Number 9, Conor Sullivan.

1189
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,725
All right, all right!

1190
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,428
(Shouting continues)

1191
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,830
Shot, and a goal!

1192
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,531
Briarfield goes
on the board first.

1193
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,270
Possession Sierra,
to number 14...

1194
01:19:34,337 --> 01:19:36,305
That's Riggins moving
the ball up the field.

1195
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,408
Unchallenged
on the outside.

1196
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:41,811
And a nice save
by the Briarfield goalie,

1197
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:44,280
And the ball's out
the other way.

1198
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,282
These east coast teams
can move the ball well,

1199
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:48,150
And Briarfield's "d"
is doing just that

1200
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,751
With a diagonal
up the field.

1201
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:52,922
(Shouting continues)

1202
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:57,961
Go to 3!

1203
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,628
And a shot!
Goal, Briarfield.

1204
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:01,965
Late in the second quarter,

1205
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,532
With a 3-1
Briarfield advantage.

1206
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,169
Shot Sierra... score!

1207
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:09,072
All right, good finish!

1208
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:12,175
Let's do it!

1209
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:17,613
Goal, Briarfield!

1210
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,948
Yes!

1211
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:25,753
Number 9... Sullivan...

1212
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,690
Doing it all by himself.

1213
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:30,025
Sullivan scores!

1214
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,063
This could be
a different game tonight

1215
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,464
If 9 were still wearing
the purple of Sierra.

1216
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:48,111
(Shouting continues)

1217
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,080
Sierra just needs one
to take the lead,

1218
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:56,251
And the later in the game
we go, the more the momentum
seems to shift to Sierra.

1219
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,364
Oh, and a huge hit
by number 77!

1220
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,032
Next time,
take his head off!

1221
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,034
And Sierra's gonna
have a shot here.

1222
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,036
We're under a minute,
tied at 9.

1223
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,605
(Shouting continues)

1224
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:23,311
Sierra working it around,
controlling the pace.

1225
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,749
They swing it back up top.

1226
01:21:26,814 --> 01:21:28,316
Riggins,
stick somebody!

1227
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:31,219
They've got time
to set something up.

1228
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:37,625
And a goal! Sierra has
scored the go-ahead goal!

1229
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:41,064
Sierra has just silenced
this home crowd.

1230
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,831
28 seconds.

1231
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,001
This is embarrassing.

1232
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:46,936
We gotta tie this up.

1233
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:49,538
What you got in mind?

1234
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:50,940
You're captain America.

1235
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:52,874
Nah, they know
my moves.

1236
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,709
That's why we
gotta change it up.

1237
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:56,079
Hey, offense, get in.

1238
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:58,047
Come on, guys.

1239
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,985
Briarfield needs
a big play

1240
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,552
If they hope
to pull this out.

1241
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:04,920
All: Break!

1242
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,023
Let's go, white!
Nice play, white!

1243
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,757
Come on, guys.

1244
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:10,493
Come on, Briarfield!

1245
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,595
Here we go.
National title on the line.

1246
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:14,963
10-9, advantage Sierra.

1247
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,899
Captain America!

1248
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,436
Sullivan! Find Sullivan!

1249
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:22,370
The ball's down.
The ball's up.

1250
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,974
Oh! Possession Briarfield!
That's Joe Bryant.

1251
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,342
The long stick is going
across midfield.

1252
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:28,910
He's looking to pass inside.

1253
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:31,779
Finds Sullivan.

1254
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,715
Sullivan with a great dodge.

1255
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,084
He cuts to the middle,
looking for his big left.

1256
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,187
Needs a shot.
No, he dishes back!

1257
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:42,924
Goal Briarfield!
There's no time on the clock.

1258
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,527
But we are not done yet.

1259
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,996
Hey, we've got overtime.
Don't get kicked out of this.

1260
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,930
You east coast guys, man.

1261
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:51,500
Talk about overrated.

1262
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:53,935
Did Riggins just
call me east coast?

1263
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:56,039
You are, aren't you?

1264
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:58,641
That's not captain America.

1265
01:22:58,706 --> 01:23:00,576
It is over here.

1266
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,511
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
by coaches' choice,

1267
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:04,980
There will be no overtime.
We're still in there.

1268
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:09,084
The game will be decided
by braveheart.

1269
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,619
Why are we doing
braveheart?

1270
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,420
Before the game,
the officials asked,

1271
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,089
"do you want to do
overtime or braveheart?"

1272
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,459
You agreed
without asking me?

1273
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,126
I didn't know
a west coast team
would be that good.

1274
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,763
Let's go!
This is our game!

1275
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:24,067
All right, guys.
Settle down, it's not over.

1276
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,768
Come on, settle down.

1277
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:31,706
Gentlemen, the game is gonna
be decided by braveheart.

1278
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:33,008
Dupree, that's you.

1279
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:35,143
Not me, coach.
Bryant's hurt.

1280
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,114
But Conor's not.

1281
01:23:40,948 --> 01:23:44,486
You know these guys
better than Dupree.
It has to be you.

1282
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,122
Sullivan,
you up for this?

1283
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,660
Okay, we know Sullivan's
looking for a fight.

1284
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,130
Find it for him.
Hit him, and hit him hard.

1285
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,565
Sooner or later,
he'll lose it.

1286
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:01,336
All right, let's do it.

1287
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:07,575
Let's do it!
Let's go! Let's go!

1288
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:09,144
The nets will be brought
to center field.

1289
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,879
This is sudden death.

1290
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:12,815
No time on the clock,
no time outs.

1291
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,452
Simple rules. The first
to score wins the game.

1292
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:27,028
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join us on the field
for braveheart.

1293
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:28,696
Oh, I can't take this.

1294
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:31,766
We have to go.
(Laughs)

1295
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:35,571
Braveheart may be
a new development
for organized lacrosse,

1296
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:38,073
But its pedigree comes straight
out of the sport's history

1297
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:40,776
As a true test
of a warrior.

1298
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:43,078
No rest, nowhere to hide...

1299
01:24:43,146 --> 01:24:44,979
Just man-on-man
sudden death.

1300
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:49,084
Who has the heart to
battle it out to the finish?

1301
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:51,120
Down.

1302
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:53,921
Too bad your dad's
not here to see
you lose.

1303
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,557
Don't worry.

1304
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:58,161
There's more than enough
of him here.

1305
01:24:58,227 --> 01:24:59,994
(Whistle blows)

1306
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,231
Possession Riggins.

1307
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:04,899
Driving Sullivan
up the field.

1308
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:06,868
Left hand hold.

1309
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,035
No clean opportunity.

1310
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,938
Come on, Conor.

1311
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:11,339
Fires. Blocked.

1312
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,808
First chance for Sierra
comes up short.

1313
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,710
And now to Sullivan.

1314
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,346
Come on, Sullivan.

1315
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:21,316
Sullivan looks
for an opportunity.

1316
01:25:23,186 --> 01:25:25,553
And he's down. Riggins...

1317
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:28,657
Going back the other way.
Sullivan holding ground.

1318
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,493
Riggins lowers
his left shoulder,

1319
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,260
Tries to spin.
No movement.

1320
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,028
Sullivan denies.

1321
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,063
You can take him.
Come on, Conor!

1322
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,301
Come on, get him!

1323
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,804
Riggins fires
from the outside,

1324
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:44,105
And shot blocked.
Easy save.

1325
01:25:44,173 --> 01:25:45,940
Back the other way.

1326
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,875
Let's go, Sullivan.

1327
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:49,977
Ohh!

1328
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,046
Riggins lays into him.

1329
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,749
Get used to that,
Sullivan.

1330
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,517
This contest
is a bit chippier

1331
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,353
As time goes on
and tempers flare.

1332
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,054
Sullivan looks fired up
by the contact.

1333
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:01,623
Come on, come on!

1334
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,061
Sullivan hunting
for the game-winner.

1335
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:08,563
Working the right side now.

1336
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,666
Come on!
Come on, Sullivan.

1337
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:13,201
Lining up for his big left.

1338
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,504
Fires it!
A clutch save!

1339
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:18,006
You can't let him
take that, Riggins!

1340
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:21,443
(Shouting)

1341
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,979
Riggins gets past Sullivan.
He's driving.

1342
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:25,613
Take him down!

1343
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,550
Get him!

1344
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,116
A shot!

1345
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,853
Crowd: Ohh!

1346
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:34,088
His stick got tangled up
in Sullivan's facemask.

1347
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:38,125
The shot was wide,
but Briarfield may be
in trouble here anyway.

1348
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,295
You all right, son?

1349
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:41,062
Dad: Conor...

1350
01:26:41,128 --> 01:26:42,798
Hope you score a lot
of goals tonight, son.

1351
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,532
But it's important
how you score.

1352
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,702
Never put yourself
above the game.

1353
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:48,871
Conor: I have to let them
beat on me and just take it?

1354
01:26:48,936 --> 01:26:50,973
Duke: Temper's good.
It's how you use it
that matters.

1355
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:53,709
Dave: If you fight again,
you are off my team.

1356
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,778
Dad: Promise me that
you'll show humility.

1357
01:26:55,844 --> 01:26:57,445
Duke: When you fight,
you quit.

1358
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:58,881
It's more than
a game, west coast.

1359
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:00,849
When are you
gonna learn that?

1360
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,752
Duke: A warrior
doesn't run from pain.

1361
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:07,456
A warrior
gets the job done.

1362
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,762
9, you okay?
If you can't continue,

1363
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,632
I'm gonna have to
call a forfeit.

1364
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,536
Nah.

1365
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:24,071
We've got business.

1366
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,373
All right,
play on!

1367
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,942
(Blows whistle)

1368
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:29,278
Come on, boy!

1369
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:31,847
Sullivan attacks, powers.

1370
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,416
Come on, Sullivan!

1371
01:27:33,482 --> 01:27:35,318
(Grunting)

1372
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,653
Ride him, Sullivan!

1373
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,622
Push him out!
Push him out!

1374
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:43,224
Riggins giving nothing away.

1375
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:44,793
Come on, come on.
Take the shot!

1376
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,796
Sullivan spins,
he's got an opening.

1377
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,802
It's in! It's in!

1378
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:56,939
Briarfield wins!
Briarfield wins!

1379
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:01,777
The first national high school
lacrosse championship

1380
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:04,780
Will go to the east coast
Briarfield warriors.

1381
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:08,984
Thanks for being part of
a great championship game.

1382
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:40,949
Congratulations
on the game, Conor.

1383
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:44,420
Coach, thanks again
for the second chance.

1384
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,455
I could say
the same to you.

1385
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:49,958
Great job.

1386
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,330
Good job, Conor.

1387
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:57,565
Coach,
congratulations.

1388
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:58,967
Thanks. You played
a hell of a game.

1389
01:28:59,034 --> 01:29:01,302
Impressive...
Captain America.

1390
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:03,406
Nice right-handed shot.

1391
01:29:03,472 --> 01:29:06,842
Yeah? Well, now I'm
ambidextrous, too.

1392
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:09,044
Way to go.
Your boys played well.

1393
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:13,248
Thank you, honey.

1394
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,983
Congratulations.

1395
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,621
Go ahead.

1396
01:29:21,223 --> 01:29:22,289
You heading back?

1397
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,428
Unfinished business.

1398
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,095
Sergeant major.

1399
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:29,296
Hey.

1400
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,933
I gotta ask you...

1401
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:33,368
Hammering down
the house...

1402
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:35,904
Metaphor or not?

1403
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:41,108
Hey. Are you okay?

1404
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:42,511
Yeah.

1405
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:46,113
Well done, honey.
Thanks, mom.

1406
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,484
Hey, Sullivan.

1407
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,018
You got a minute?

1408
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:53,821
With all due respect, sir,

1409
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:56,357
I need a few minutes
with my family.

1410
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:58,093
All right. Nice job.

1411
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,504
Brooklyn: It isn't easy
watching people you love
get hurt,

1412
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,138
And it's impossible
to replace

1413
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,007
Some things in life
that are lost.

1414
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,009
But everything I look for
in a person...

1415
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,512
Someone who stands up
when they're knocked down,

1416
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,414
Can work with a team,

1417
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:21,749
And has strength
and humility...

1418
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:23,851
Can be found
through this game.

1419
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,655
Maybe that's why lacrosse...
Or baaga'adowe...

1420
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:30,124
Is known by another
even older name...

1421
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,660
The creator's game.

1422
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:33,929
Native Americans
believe they play

1423
01:30:33,996 --> 01:30:36,063
For the pleasure
of their creator.

1424
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:40,135
Sometimes I think that's
why we do anything at all.

1425
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,674
(Cheering)

1426
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,994
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise

1427
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:09,798
As we honor the memory
of lieutenant colonel
Sully Sullivan

1428
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:12,601
With a missing man
formation.

1429
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,410
You do your dad
