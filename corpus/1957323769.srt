00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,393
(Multicom jingle)

2
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:17,672
(somber piano music)

3
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:19,823
[Priest] We are here today to say goodbye

4
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:22,510
to the dear soul of Helen Walsh.

5
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,832
May perpetual light shine upon her,

6
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,663
and may she rest in peace.

7
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:30,073
Amen.

8
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,670
(somber music)

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,638
Let us take a moment to reflect

10
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:38,839
on how she touched each one of our lives.

11
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,787
Helen was always there with a kind word

12
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,390
and a helping hand.

13
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:47,769
She lived in this community
all of her adult life,

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,677
and worked tirelessly to keep it a place

15
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:54,864
where we could all be proud
to raise our families.

16
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:59,737
The Walsh home was a warm and loving home.

17
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:01,497
And all of us who were fortunate enough

18
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,198
to spend time there,

19
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:05,569
certainly were aware that Helen's radiance

20
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,922
was at its core.

21
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:12,969
Let us pray that she
has found eternal peace,

22
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,619
and let us also pray that
her beloved husband, Frank,

23
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:20,475
and their beloved sons,
Robert, James, and Steven,

24
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,889
find solace in the knowledge

25
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,110
that she is amongst the angels.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,619
Amen.

27
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,222
(somber music)

28
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,948
I can't believe Uncle Bill didn't show.

29
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,755
Yeah, that's your
mother's side of the family,

30
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,192
a bunch of kooks.

31
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,053
You gonna tip?

32
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,736
Did you tip?
- Yeah, yeah, I tipped.

33
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:00,467
Nice little place you picked out here.

34
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,427
Waiter!

35
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:02,261
[Waiter] Yes, sir.

36
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,267
Never seen people eat so
much in my whole entire life.

37
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:05,148
Free meal.

38
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,415
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,888
So, who's that woman you were speaking to

40
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:10,219
at the service?

41
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,197
Which one? I was talking
to a couple of them.

42
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:13,499
Yeah, I know.

43
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,477
Everybody thought you worked there.

44
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,458
At a funeral parlor?

45
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:19,523
Well, you spoke to every
woman that walked in.

46
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:22,160
They were mom's friends, from work.

47
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,720
She never told me she worked
with so many younger women.

48
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,771
Probably trying to keep her job.

49
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,859
A ha!

50
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,147
You're a funny guy, Pop.

51
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,167
Thank you.

52
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:39,611
Now, Dad, our place is your place.

53
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,216
Come by tomorrow, I'm making
franks and beans for supper.

54
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:43,496
Don't worry about it.

55
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,269
Kids, get in the car!

56
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,819
Get in the car!

57
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,589
Okay, Bob, goodnight!

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,471
Goodnight, Dad.

59
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,075
Goodnight.

60
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:52,909
I'll call ya.

61
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:54,392
If you need us, just give a ring.

62
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:56,526
Don't worry, don't worry about it.

63
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:57,899
I'll call you in the morning, Pop.

64
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,919
Okay.

65
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,040
Goodnight.

66
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Goodnight.

67
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,640
You gonna open the door for me?

68
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,223
All right!

69
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,243
I forgot.

70
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:13,952
You know, your brothers aggravate me.

71
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:15,744
Where do they find those girls they marry?

72
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:18,481
Your mother was nothing like that.

73
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,584
And what's her name?

74
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:20,960
- Joy.
- Joy.

75
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,001
You see the face on her all day?

76
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,472
Did she ever smile once?

77
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:27,731
It was a funeral.

78
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:28,934
They can't have kids.

79
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,283
You know why, don't you?

80
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,553
It's her fault.

81
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,690
I don't understand you boys at all.

82
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,084
What's her name?

83
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,740
[Robert] Who?

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,662
[Frank] You know, the wife.

85
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:47,732
Darlene.

86
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,085
Darlene, yeah.

87
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,302
Well, she's gotta be at least
10 years older than him.

88
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,884
Did you see her today?

89
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,872
Your mother looked younger.

90
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,867
She has 2 kids and he marries her.

91
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:00,729
What is he thinkin' about?

92
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,296
He's a kid himself.

93
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:03,347
How old is he?

94
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,197
I can't remember any of that stuff,

95
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:07,550
your mother knew everything.

96
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:09,797
You didn't get a chance to talk much today.

97
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:10,968
Are you gonna be okay, Dad?

98
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:14,734
Yeah, yeah, I'll take a walk later.

99
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,754
Okay.

100
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:19,027
So, everybody was asking me

101
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:21,622
whether you're gonna settle down.

102
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:22,517
Pop, I'll settle down

103
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,015
when I find the right girl, all right?

104
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,084
- What do you mean by that?
I never know what you mean.

105
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:27,950
I mean the right girl.

106
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,131
Like your chair, right?

107
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,428
You know how it feels right?

108
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,292
That's what I'm looking for,

109
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,840
something that feels right.
- I know what you are,

110
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,584
you're what they call a confirmed bachelor.

111
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:38,531
Make it sound like I have a disease.

112
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:42,149
Hey, whatever happened to
that girl Kathy something?

113
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,171
I'm just curious.

114
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,015
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

115
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,629
She wasn't right for me.

116
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:47,463
And you know what?

117
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,891
I probably wasn't right for her, so...

118
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,901
How long did you go out with her?

119
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:52,735
I don't know.

120
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,822
A year, year and a half?
- I remember how it was,

121
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,148
it was the same thing every night.

122
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,901
I mean, she was a nice
girl, I liked her a lot,

123
00:04:58,921 --> 00:04:59,902
but it was like...

124
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,200
"What do you want to do tonight?"

125
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,531
She's like, "I don't know,
what do you wanna do?

126
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,365
I don't know."

127
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,469
That stuff drove me crazy after a while.

128
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,079
That's what you go
through, that's what it is.

129
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,611
You should've married that girl.

130
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:14,101
What are you gonna do now,
go through life alone?

131
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,954
Well, I'm alone now.

132
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,159
Eh, you gotta share,

133
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,749
you gotta share your life with somebody.

134
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:21,749
Share what?

135
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,709
Share my day, my troubles?

136
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,901
(Robert chuckles)

137
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,689
It would've been nice
having someone there today,

138
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,914
you know, mom dying and everything, but...

139
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:33,839
I did okay, you know?

140
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,608
I got you, and James, and Steven.

141
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:42,406
It wouldn't of been her mother
who died anyway, it was mine.

142
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,509
My mother I'm gonna miss.

143
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:50,406
So, in the end, I'd be
just as alone, wouldn't I?

144
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:53,009
(somber music)

145
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:03,005
You know, your mother
was a beautiful woman.

146
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:04,775
Yeah, she was, Pop.

147
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:07,627
To Mom.

148
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,207
(glass clangs)

149
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,560
(dog barks)

150
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:19,550
(whimsical music)

151
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,670
(dog barks)

152
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,693
May I help you?

153
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,963
Yeah, I need a microwave.

154
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,671
[Man] What size?

155
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:22,079
For one person.

156
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,508
Right this way.

157
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,821
Here we go.

158
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,952
That's for one person?

159
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:38,031
Yes.

160
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:39,744
Looks kinda big.

161
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:41,721
How does it work?

162
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,153
There's directions inside the box.

163
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,923
"As a general rule, when doubling a recipe,

164
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:56,450
increase the cooking time by about 50%.

165
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,222
When cooking...

166
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:04,602
When cutting a recipe in half,

167
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,558
reduce the time by about 40%."

168
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:21,878
(siren blares)
(cars honking)

169
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:23,663
Tony.

170
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,084
Robert.

171
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,104
Hello.

172
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:32,723
Okay, everyone, I would like
you to meet Susan Prescot.

173
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:33,557
Hi.

174
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,840
Susan is a whiz with the new tax laws.

175
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,752
We're lucky that the office
in Milwaukee could spare her.

176
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,222
Robert, could you familiarize Susan

177
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:43,920
with the Burton account?

178
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,023
Absolutely.

179
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:52,331
How do you like your new office?

180
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,582
Yeah, it's great, I just can't stop

181
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,592
staring out of the window, it's-

182
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:57,593
- Yeah.

183
00:08:57,613 --> 00:09:01,151
Happens to everybody, and you
never quite get used to it.

184
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,171
Um...

185
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,410
I've gone over the Klein account,

186
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,470
and I saw what you accomplished
here, very impressive.

187
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,301
Thank you very much, I appreciate that.

188
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,520
Well, as far as the Burton
account is concerned,

189
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,050
I've only had a few hours to look at it,

190
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,730
but my first reaction is
we've got a lot of work to do,

191
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,520
but yes, we can definitely,
definitely save them money.

192
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,230
Good, good, good, good, that's good.

193
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,861
We have a shot at the account then.

194
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,548
Let me show you what
I've come up with here.

195
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:30,484
Go to 14A.

196
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,012
No, yeah, 14A.

197
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,375
(cars honking)
(calming jazz music)

198
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,954
Falco was right, this girl is sharp.

199
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,725
We're gonna have that Burton
account locked up in no time.

200
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,637
I heard she's married.

201
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,657
Separated.

202
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:55,255
[Man] She's not your type.

203
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,804
[Robert] What do you mean not my type?

204
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:01,083
She's slick and east-side,
you're funky and downtown.

205
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:05,603
This girl's got something,
she's a straight shooter.

206
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,368
You like him, don't you?

207
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:13,482
Well, I don't know,
I've been working with him

208
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:14,781
for a couple of days.

209
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,622
He seems nice.

210
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,141
Oh, yeah, he is.

211
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,158
But just be careful.

212
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:28,558
(somber piano music)

213
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,813
(laughing)

214
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,133
Did you get that one?

215
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,794
Yes, thank you for dinner.

216
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:56,943
Chivalry is not dead.

217
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:57,777
You're welcome.

218
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,573
(Susan chuckles) You eat a lot for a girl.

219
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:00,554
I can't believe you would say that-

220
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:01,388
- I don't know if you've ever heard that.

221
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:02,693
I could understand seconds, but thirds,

222
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,893
I think it's a little much.

223
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,023
I did not have thirds!

224
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,193
What were you saying now before?

225
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,026
You asked me a question.

226
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:07,860
I was asking...

227
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,295
Oh, do you have any brothers and sisters?

228
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,442
Oh, no, I am an only child.

229
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,276
Oh.

230
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,040
And spoiled.
- Spoiled, spoiled.

231
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,223
Of course, I knew you would
say that. Spoiled brat, yeah.

232
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,711
Was it lonely growing up?

233
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,663
Eh, a little bit maybe,

234
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,111
but I had a lot of friends.

235
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:23,893
High school and college
I joined some clubs.

236
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,791
The debating club, the science club,

237
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:26,683
the business club-

238
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,871
- Those are all the kids I
used to beat up in school.

239
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,573
You beat up kids in school?

240
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:31,842
I didn't really beat 'em up!

241
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:33,412
That's for all the kids
you beat up, that's terrible!

242
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,503
Ow, ow, she's beating me up!

243
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:35,504
- I am not!
- Help!

244
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:36,794
- No, I'm not!
- Help!

245
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:40,251
(Susan chuckles)

246
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:41,412
Did you wave for a taxi?

247
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,245
No!

248
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,079
Is there a taxi here?

249
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,413
They're right behind you.

250
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,702
When you need a taxi, can't find a taxi.

251
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:47,615
When you don't want a taxi,

252
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:48,782
like in a moment like this,

253
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,582
sure enough a cab shows up.

254
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:53,191
Well, I kind of want a
taxi, it's a little late.

255
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,857
- Right.
- I had a great time.

256
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:56,907
Yeah, I had a good
time too. Here, allow me.

257
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,185
Thank you.

258
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,218
Buckle up.

259
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,051
I will.

260
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:00,898
Take care of her!

261
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,227
[Driver] Yeah, yeah, right.

262
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,664
She's a lousy tipper, so...

263
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:13,248
[Narrator] The ring-tailed
lemur is often found

264
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:15,607
on the island of Madagascar.

265
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:18,210
(somber music)

266
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,276
(Robert yawns)

267
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:26,385
You've gotta be kidding!

268
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,236
Is that old?

269
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:28,218
Is that old?
(Susan laughs)

270
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,445
- It's very old-
- I'm sorry.

271
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:30,905
- But it works.
- It's the only one I know.

272
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:31,906
(Susan laughs)

273
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,023
All right, so there are five boroughs.

274
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:33,898
Is that what I was talking about?

275
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,465
Five boroughs, we're in one of them.

276
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:37,131
- Really?
- You don't care, do you?

277
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,732
I do, I do, it's just
you wear the best ties.

278
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,126
Well, thank you, I made this one actually

279
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,465
in a weaving competition.

280
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,426
- No way.
- Yes, I did.

281
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,564
I won first prize for this.

282
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:45,995
It's very elegant and sexy.

283
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:46,829
Oh, why thank you.

284
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:48,252
Especially this one.

285
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,522
You're welcome.

286
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,208
(ship honks)

287
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,117
What are we having for dinner tonight?

288
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,156
Oh, dinner?

289
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:05,990
What?

290
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,993
What, one kiss and I gotta buy you dinner?

291
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,906
- Well, I'm hungry!
- Again?

292
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,055
First base, boom, buy me dinner.

293
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,466
(Susan laughs)

294
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:12,866
You're always hungry!

295
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:13,699
That's not true.

296
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,532
All right, I'll make you dinner.

297
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:15,366
I'm gonna make you a very nice dinner.

298
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:16,506
A little shrimp thing I do.

299
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:17,340
All right.

300
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,596
Home cooking, that sounds good.

301
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,756
Well, do you have health insurance?

302
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,757
Yeah, why?

303
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,836
I may make you sign a
waiver of responsibility-

304
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:25,405
- I'm sure you're an excellent cook.

305
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:27,139
I've never killed anyone...

306
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,546
Yet.

307
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:32,149
(lighthearted jazzy music)

308
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:36,740
(Susan chuckles)

309
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,910
[Susan] What was your grandmother like?

310
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,744
[Robert] Oh, my grandmother.

311
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:41,398
Now, she was one of the first women

312
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:44,910
to become a shop steward
for the electrician's union.

313
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,744
[Susan] Wow.

314
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,528
[Robert] She worked down
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

315
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:48,362
[Susan] Huh.

316
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:49,568
What was she like?

317
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,619
[Robert] She was beautiful,
smart, and senile actually.

318
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,704
(Susan laughs)

319
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,018
But she was nice.

320
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:55,879
[Susan] I love how you're so proud

321
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,310
of your family, that's nice.

322
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,955
[Robert] Yeah.

323
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:01,533
[Susan] What was your mom like?

324
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:02,635
My mom was special.

325
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,683
Yeah?

326
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,033
And of course I'm gonna say
that 'cause she's my mom, but-

327
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:06,867
- Well-

328
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,233
- I remember, she used to
take us down to the beach

329
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:10,374
at Rockaway every Sunday,
no, every Saturday.

330
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,674
Every Saturday, she'd take us
down to the beach at Rockaway.

331
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,136
And I remember this one time,

332
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:17,384
I'm looking out at the ocean,

333
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:20,834
she comes up to me and she
whispers in my ear, and she says,

334
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,685
"Make a wish on the third wave."

335
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,519
The third wave?

336
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:25,815
- Yeah.
- Oh.

337
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,504
And I did.

338
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:28,394
And I got my wish.

339
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:29,227
- No!
- Yeah.

340
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:30,061
Really?

341
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,853
What was it?
- I wanted to see a whale.

342
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:32,687
Oh, you're kidding!

343
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,354
I wanted to see a whale, and sure enough,

344
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,695
the third wave, right out of the horizon,

345
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,673
boom, a whale pops in.

346
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:40,284
Your mom believed in magic, huh?

347
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,971
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

348
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:44,764
Wow, I don't think I've ever

349
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:47,284
told anyone that story before.

350
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,343
Want to go on a picnic tomorrow?

351
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,531
- Picnic?
- Mhm.

352
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,365
I'd love it.

353
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,822
Picnic?

354
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:55,964
That's so funny.

355
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:56,984
What's funny, a picnic?

356
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,004
No, no, no, I came here to work,

357
00:15:59,024 --> 00:15:59,925
I came here to work,

358
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,273
and I've just had the best two weeks

359
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,024
I've had in a long time.

360
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,155
Really? I wanted you
to have a terrible time

361
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:05,988
while you were here.

362
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:06,857
- Oh, why thank you.
- Oh.

363
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,045
You've been a prince up to this point.

364
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,024
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

365
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:09,858
That's the kind of guy I am.

366
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,343
In fact, you can call
me "Prince" if you want,

367
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:12,715
'cause he's not using the name,

368
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:13,776
so you can call me prince.

369
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,665
(Susan laughs)

370
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,102
No, no, it's...

371
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,509
It's strange.

372
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:24,268
That I can meet someone from so far away

373
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:25,207
from where you're from,

374
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,226
and you feel like you...

375
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:30,026
Like you know them.

376
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:30,860
Yeah.

377
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,068
You know?

378
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:33,505
And I know you.

379
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:37,977
Yeah.

380
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,247
(romantic jazzy music)

381
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:44,528
Yeah.

382
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,185
(lighthearted music)

383
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,122
(pump sprays)

384
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:59,857
(garbage can rattles)
(dog barks)

385
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,762
I'll just drop this off,
I'll be back in one second.

386
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:19,583
I cracked the windows for ya.

387
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,452
Don't bark at the neighbors.

388
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:25,222
(Susan chuckles)

389
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,598
You said noon!

390
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,708
Hey, Pop, how you doin'?

391
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:38,581
Did you see it?

392
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:39,740
What?

393
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,524
Come on, I'll show it to ya.

394
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:43,961
What do ya got?

395
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,266
Here, take a look at this.

396
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:51,100
Eh?

397
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,290
Looks like one of them fancy imported jobs.

398
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,890
Oh, yeah, very imported looking.

399
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,461
Nice car, Dad, nice car.

400
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,631
Listen, you know, you
gotta put oil in your car.

401
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:01,139
Did you change the oil?

402
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,871
Yeah, yeah, I changed it.

403
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,481
Good, because that's very important-

404
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,962
- Dad, I have a friend with me,

405
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:06,803
I'm going to a picnic.

406
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,031
Is it okay if I invite her in?

407
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:10,329
Sure, sure, bring her in, bring her in.

408
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,163
Okay.

409
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,322
Another one of those...

410
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:13,342
Susan!

411
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:22,870
Pop, this is Susan.

412
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,500
Susan, this is my father, Frank.

413
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,334
Hi.

414
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,309
I was looking forward to meeting you.

415
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:29,110
I just bought a new car.

416
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,943
I saw.

417
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:30,777
That's yours, huh?

418
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,329
It's very, very nice.

419
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,569
Yeah, you can't keep
anything nice around here,

420
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,709
they steal it.

421
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:36,543
Hm.

422
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:37,824
Were you ever over here before?

423
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,878
My son has so many girlfriends, sometimes-

424
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:43,598
- No, no, she was never here, Dad.

425
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,150
I was sorry to hear about your loss.

426
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,860
Thank you.

427
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,110
I wish it was me instead of my wife.

428
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,868
My wife was much, much better with people.

429
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,805
A nicer person, anyway.

430
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:58,603
Let me show you something in the basement.

431
00:19:58,623 --> 00:19:59,623
Okay.

432
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:04,742
Here.

433
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,731
Robert built all this
stuff, isn't it great?

434
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,552
No, I didn't!

435
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,081
Built this bar.

436
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,112
The bar I built.

437
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:13,136
The bar, that's very nice.

438
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:16,787
Yeah, I want you to see the backyard here.

439
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,905
Actually, I paid a couple of
kids and told him I built it.

440
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:19,925
Oh.

441
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:24,722
My, what a cute backyard!

442
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,222
Pops, Susan is from Wisconsin.

443
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,332
I bet you have a backyard
bigger than this whole block.

444
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,822
Yeah, but we didn't have the ocean.

445
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,123
Why not?

446
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,342
Wisconsin, Pop.

447
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:33,293
Oh.

448
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,724
I sent this guy through college

449
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:37,494
so he could tell me these things.

450
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,721
You two eat yet?

451
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,871
No, we're going to a picnic but-

452
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,753
- I want to show people that I got company,

453
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:46,612
I don't want them to feel sorry for me

454
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,319
because my wife died.

455
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:50,589
I'll go get some cold cuts.

456
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,313
Where are my keys?

457
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,312
Um...

458
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:57,022
See my keys around, Robert?

459
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,113
Let me see.

460
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,633
Here.

461
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:00,736
Oh, thanks.

462
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:04,691
Watch my spot, will ya?

463
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:05,711
All right.

464
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,122
What's a spot?

465
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,324
Well, out here in Queens,

466
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:12,513
it's more than just a
place you park your car,

467
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,873
it's kind of an extension of your house.

468
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:15,893
Symbolic.

469
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,522
It represents family pride, you know?

470
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:20,356
See that garbage can?

471
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,302
That garbage can is a marker.

472
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,572
We have a spot.

473
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:26,942
When my father passes away,

474
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,561
not only will my brothers
and I inherit the house,

475
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:31,248
but we'll also inherit the spot.

476
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,011
Yup.

477
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:38,529
Now he's got a spot and not much else.

478
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,676
I felt sorry for him.

479
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:40,748
I know, every time I come over here,

480
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,617
I find it harder and harder to leave.

481
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,524
But I think he liked you, though.

482
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:46,357
Really?

483
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,315
How can you tell?

484
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:48,778
'Cause he showed you the basement.

485
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,444
Oh. I'll bet you he shows every girl

486
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,780
you bring over the basement.

487
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,609
Yeah, but he showed you the
basement and the backyard,

488
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:54,529
he never does that.

489
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:55,549
Oh, wow.

490
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,428
Ah, don't get me started!

491
00:21:58,448 --> 00:21:59,299
We're at your father's house.

492
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
Oh...

493
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,259
Listen, if it's okay with you,

494
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,828
I'm gonna ask Falco to make us partners

495
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,020
on the Burton deal all the way through.

496
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,586
Is that all right with you?

497
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:14,548
Um, well, actually, I
was gonna talk to Falco

498
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:19,568
on Monday morning and tell
him that I'm going back home.

499
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,619
Why?

500
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:24,452
Well, Ted called.

501
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,567
What did old Ted want?

502
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:33,092
Well, he misses me and I want to see him.

503
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,752
Well, what about us?

504
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,212
What about us?

505
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:42,046
What, are you saying that this

506
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,935
was an exclusive relationship?

507
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:45,004
Yeah!

508
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:45,986
For me, it has been.

509
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,995
Oh, come on, Robert, be honest.

510
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,015
I am!

511
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,655
Last week you asked Joanne
from payroll out for a drink.

512
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:55,489
I did?

513
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,073
Yeah.

514
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:57,907
Oh, yeah.

515
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:01,604
Well, it's just a friendly
thing, totally platonic.

516
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:02,438
(Susan chuckles)

517
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,553
I have been here two weeks,

518
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,075
and even I know that no one asks

519
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:06,807
Joanne from payroll out for a drink

520
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:08,996
expecting it to be platonic.

521
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,535
Well, she didn't show.

522
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,165
I know, I had lunch with her.

523
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,665
She didn't know you and
I were seeing each other,

524
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,745
very few women know that
we're seeing each other.

525
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:22,175
The word on you up there is
not to expect anything else.

526
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,126
The word on me?

527
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,556
What's wrong with a guy who dates?

528
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,686
Nothing.

529
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,036
You just shouldn't expect loyalty

530
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,716
if he doesn't have any himself.

531
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,465
Susan, I'm totally loyal.

532
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:33,625
I'm totally loyal to
whoever I'm going out with.

533
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,945
Okay.

534
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:37,775
All I'm saying is that
I'm going back to see Ted

535
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:41,212
to see if he and I could work things out.

536
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,886
Yeah, that's cool.

537
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,319
Doesn't she eat?

538
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:53,599
I have to be able to fit into
my bathing suit this summer.

539
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:55,850
If a man likes a woman he likes her

540
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,130
if she's got a belly or not.

541
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,508
You know, if I were a younger man,

542
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,679
I'd fight you for her.

543
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:04,788
Seems I got competition everywhere I turn.

544
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:06,788
[Frank] Yeah.

545
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,695
So where's Steven and
James? They coming over?

546
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:11,696
No, no, James is in Boston tonight,

547
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,908
and Steven and his wife,
you know, what's her name...

548
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:16,366
[Robert] Joy.

549
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:19,479
She's sick again, always sick, you know.

550
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,130
So they're not coming over.

551
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,298
They should be here tonight.

552
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:24,568
Ah, they got their own lives to live.

553
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,560
So do you!

554
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,776
Well, we'll have to do it without them.

555
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:29,610
What do you got?

556
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,759
What are you doin'?

557
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:31,608
Come on, will ya?

558
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:32,539
I'm not a kid!

559
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,976
Move that, move that.

560
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:36,528
You bought yourself a
car that looks imported,

561
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,258
I got you a fat-free birthday cake.

562
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,616
Fat-free birthday...

563
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:42,999
You ain't gonna sing
Happy Birthday, are ya?

564
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,610
All right, we won't sing happy birthday.

565
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,898
Oh, good, thank you.

566
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,330
Here, now make a wish.

567
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,164
What?

568
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:50,648
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

569
00:24:50,668 --> 00:24:51,482
Make a wish?

570
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:55,084
I already got everything I ever wished for.

571
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:59,385
Your mother loved you, you know.

572
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,971
Come on, blow 'em out.

573
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,490
(Frank blows)

574
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,099
(clapping)

575
00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,831
You like my son, huh?

576
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,416
How can I not?

577
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,943
Yeah, well, I feel sorry for ya.

578
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,224
Funny.

579
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:25,355
Listen, if you're ever in
the neighborhood, drop by.

580
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,129
You don't need to bring him, you know.

581
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:27,962
(Robert chuckles)

582
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:28,796
(Susan laughs)

583
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,108
I might take you up on that offer.

584
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:30,941
Okay.

585
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:31,869
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.

586
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:32,886
Pleasure.

587
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,720
Watch your step going down.

588
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
Thanks, all right.

589
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,574
You know what?

590
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:36,606
I'll meet you at the car,

591
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:37,585
I'm just gonna walk him back up, okay?

592
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:38,419
Okay.

593
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,055
- Watch out there.
- Thanks.

594
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,215
All right, Pop, I'll call ya.

595
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,049
Nice girl.

596
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,175
The way you ever found
a nice girl like that,

597
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:46,384
I'll never know.

598
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:48,986
Well, she's married.

599
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,607
She's what?

600
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:52,025
She's separated, but she's just

601
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,855
going through something right now.

602
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,689
Come on.

603
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:57,285
Come on in, come on in.

604
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,615
Don't waste your time.

605
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,598
If the girl has somebody,

606
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,621
it's normal to go through
life with somebody.

607
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:05,486
What are you trying to
tell me, Dad? It's fate?

608
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,152
Something like fate? Like
you put two people together

609
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:08,243
and you sprinkle fairy dust on them

610
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,714
and they're happily ever after?

611
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,146
I don't know what you're saying.

612
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,964
I always had to ask your
mother what you were saying.

613
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:17,693
Your brothers I don't understand either,

614
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,604
but at least they settled down.

615
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:20,834
Yeah, but they married
people you don't like.

616
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:23,263
Don't you see the irony in that, Pop?

617
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:25,434
What are you looking for?

618
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:26,275
My keys.

619
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:29,903
I had my car key and my
house key on the same ring.

620
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,902
Well, they have to be
around here somewhere.

621
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,674
Where'd you put 'em?

622
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:34,944
I don't know.

623
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,853
Whenever I lost something,

624
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,948
your mother would always find it,

625
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:41,718
I never had to worry.

626
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,230
Check your pockets?

627
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,561
I checked them, I checked them.

628
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,571
All right, you go, I'll find them later.

629
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:52,142
Go ahead, don't keep the girl waiting.

630
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,171
[Robert] You sure?

631
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,005
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,159
I'll find them later.

633
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,179
All right.

634
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,784
I'll talk to you later, Pop.

635
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:11,946
Oh, thanks.

636
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,375
Where were they?

637
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:14,915
In the door.

638
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,457
(Frank chuckles)

639
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:19,310
(whimsical music)

640
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:22,319
I'll see ya.

641
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:23,339
Okay.

642
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,729
(somber music)

643
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:47,625
Lydia and Warren invited me to a dance.

644
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:50,795
They say it's been 6
months, I should get out.

645
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:53,945
Some kind of luau thing,
they bought me this shirt.

646
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:54,779
Ooh!

647
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,734
Yeah, very nice shirt, very nice.

648
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:57,687
Now, I've been thinking about it, Dad.

649
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,595
You should go out, meet somebody new.

650
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,953
You've been thinking about it?

651
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,886
Yeah. I mean, I don't know
what the dating scene is

652
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,145
for a youngster like yourself, but,

653
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:05,979
I'm not saying get serious,

654
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,886
I'm just saying meet a
new friend or something.

655
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:11,594
Who's gonna put up with
me the way your mother did?

656
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:13,225
Good point.

657
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:15,986
I mean, you know, just
someone to share things with,

658
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:17,542
someone to go on your walks with,

659
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,062
watch TV with you.

660
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:21,385
Good point.

661
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:24,743
That's it, right?

662
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:26,633
[Falco] Oh, Robert.

663
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:27,467
Yeah?

664
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:30,440
Yeah, I'm thinking of
sending Wilson off to Milwaukee

665
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,274
for that conference.

666
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,229
What do you think?

667
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:34,829
Why don't you send me?

668
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:35,663
Well, are you sure?

669
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:36,918
I mean, it's gonna be a couple of weeks.

670
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:38,540
I'd want you to stop into
Detroit on the way back,

671
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,559
look at the Firestone account.

672
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,048
I can do that, I can do that.

673
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:42,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

674
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,248
Great.

675
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:44,081
Good idea.

676
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,101
All right.

677
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,127
Yeah, I can...

678
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,790
(people chattering)

679
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:03,967
I can't take this.

680
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:06,905
It's a long time since I've
been to a dance without her.

681
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:09,569
I probably forgot how to
do it, it's embarrassing!

682
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,847
Just mingle.

683
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,657
You'll have fun!

684
00:29:12,677 --> 00:29:14,767
You look great, Frank!

685
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,196
Doesn't he, Warren?

686
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:17,633
You look great.

687
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,962
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

688
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:25,399
(calming tropical music)

689
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:18,071
Uh, I'll have some of that punch.

690
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,133
Hey.

691
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:24,582
What's your sign?

692
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:26,033
42 long.

693
00:30:26,053 --> 00:30:26,867
(Florence chuckles)

694
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,373
No, sign!

695
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,694
You know, like Sagittarius,
or Capricorn, Leo.

696
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:33,283
Oh, astronomy.

697
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,303
Astrology.

698
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:37,021
Uh, Libra.

699
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:39,173
Ooh!

700
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,401
Is your mother with ya?

701
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,633
No, she dropped me off.

702
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,820
You're not a senior citizen, are ya?

703
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,481
You want to dance?

704
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,041
Sure.

705
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,061
Come on.

706
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,954
I'm not exactly a great dancer.

707
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:01,346
Fake it.

708
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:04,052
(Frank chuckles)

709
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:07,489
(calming tropical music)

710
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:18,338
My name's Florence, like in Italy.

711
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:21,378
My name is Frank, like in hot dog.

712
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:22,719
(Florence chuckles)

713
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,330
I don't know.

714
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,850
You don't look like a Frank to me,

715
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,535
you look more like a Francis.

716
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,555
It's classy.

717
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:34,868
My wife passed away last spring.

718
00:31:34,888 --> 00:31:36,555
Four years for me.

719
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,295
No kidding?

720
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:39,129
Mhm.

721
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,740
How old are you, Florence?

722
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,248
Old enough to know better,

723
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,340
but young enough to
learn a new trick or two.

724
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,399
I just thought I was old
enough to be your father.

725
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:50,280
Good!

726
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,108
Then you can help me with my homework.

727
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,900
(Florence chuckles)

728
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,248
Woohoo!

729
00:31:56,268 --> 00:31:57,081
(Florence laughs)

730
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:58,101
Whoa.

731
00:31:58,909 --> 00:31:59,992
Suave of you.

732
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:03,319
You got a nice smile, you know that?

733
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,339
Yeah?

734
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,469
It's my legs you've been looking at.

735
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:08,586
No, your legs?

736
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,138
When?

737
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:10,972
The whole night!

738
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:13,824
(Florence laughs)

739
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:29,752
(calming tropical music)

740
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:33,235
I'm thirsty, how about you, huh?

741
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,069
Thirsty?

742
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,265
I'll get you some punch.

743
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:38,382
No, no, I'd like a real drink, huh?

744
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:41,625
I don't think they serve liquor here.

745
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:44,025
What's the matter, don't you drink?

746
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,545
Oh, no, I don't.

747
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:48,734
Well, look, I know this cute little diner

748
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:50,035
over on Belle Boulevard.

749
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,374
You could buy me a real drink,

750
00:32:51,394 --> 00:32:54,644
and we'll get you a cup of coffee, huh?

751
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:01,978
You know, my wife was so neat

752
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:05,136
she used to put newspaper
under the cuckoo clock.

753
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:07,989
(Florence laughs)

754
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:13,663
Oh...

755
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:16,395
Tell me about your kids.

756
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:17,998
Well, three boys.

757
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:23,465
One is an electrical engineer,
he's doing very well,

758
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:27,083
the other one, he sells
something, he's a salesman.

759
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:31,274
I think computer products,
something like that.

760
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:32,915
He's doing pretty good.

761
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,852
And Robert, Robert's an accountant.

762
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:39,894
Except for the fact that he's
got too many girlfriends,

763
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:43,123
he's doing very well and he's a nice kid.

764
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:44,242
(Florence chuckles)

765
00:33:44,262 --> 00:33:45,905
That's terrific.

766
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:49,860
Yeah, you know, I'm proud
of my sons, all of them.

767
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,505
Do you tell them that?

768
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:53,525
No.

769
00:33:57,223 --> 00:34:01,195
You know, my husband,
Sam, God rest his soul,

770
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,798
absolutely adored our daughter.

771
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:06,880
But then he died.

772
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,521
And the first thing she said to me was,

773
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:12,374
"Mom, what did Daddy think of me?"

774
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:16,717
Life's short.

775
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:18,928
Get my drift?

776
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,761
I don't kiss on the first date.

777
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,457
Whatever's right.

778
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,118
I had a good time though, thanks.

779
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:43,758
But I'm free Wednesday.

780
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:44,724
Wednesday?

781
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:45,744
Mhm.

782
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:50,476
Francis, when I first laid eyes on you

783
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,351
back there at the luau,

784
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:59,993
I saw that sad, hangdog look of yours,

785
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:05,013
and I just thought maybe I'd
like to get to know you better.

786
00:35:06,598 --> 00:35:11,598
I was hoping maybe you would
like to get to know me better.

787
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:15,030
(calming jazz music)

788
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,708
Call me tomorrow?

789
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:31,188
I just broke my rule.

790
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:36,252
(whimsical music)

791
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,103
(engine revs)

792
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:56,282
Don't you have anything better to do?

793
00:35:56,302 --> 00:35:57,302
Snoopy!

794
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,458
(whimsical music)

795
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,789
[Robert] So, how was
the dance the other night?

796
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:05,699
[Frank] Okay.

797
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,661
Just okay?

798
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:08,239
[Frank] Yeah.

799
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,506
Hey, listen, I'm going to Milwaukee

800
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,597
for a conference for work.

801
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,037
For how long?

802
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:15,741
[Robert] I don't know, a couple weeks.

803
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:17,799
And from there I'm gonna go visit a friend.

804
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:18,947
A friend?

805
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:19,870
[Robert] Yes.

806
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,239
Girlfriend?

807
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,842
Yes, it's a girl.

808
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,090
Well, you be careful.

809
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,261
All right, you be careful too.

810
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:29,281
Bye, Pop.

811
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:38,772
(lighthearted music)

812
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,445
I bought the business from my boss 15...

813
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:43,286
Thank you.

814
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:44,755
15 years ago.

815
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:46,773
We do department store receipts.

816
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:50,325
And, well, I used to have
25 girls working for me,

817
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:51,435
and now I got 6!

818
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:54,622
Everything is computerized these days.

819
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,665
Hey.

820
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:58,385
You okay?

821
00:36:59,065 --> 00:36:59,879
Hm?

822
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:01,648
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

823
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,605
Oh, come on.

824
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,792
Tell me, talk.

825
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:11,085
I feel strange.

826
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,188
About what?

827
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:17,115
Florence, for over 40 years
I've been faithful to my wife,

828
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,135
and now...

829
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,267
Now she's gone.

830
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,068
It's important to respect
her memory, Francis,

831
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:29,726
but you gotta move on.

832
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,668
It took me a long, long
time to accept that fact,

833
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,438
but you just have to.

834
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:39,925
Yeah, I know, but it's
easier said than done.

835
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,403
You don't want to see me anymore, do you?

836
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:47,673
I'm not sure.

837
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:55,994
Well, that's too bad,
because you made my week.

838
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,699
You know, you just might surprise yourself

839
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,386
and be on this planet
a long, long time yet.

840
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,770
You really want to waste those years?

841
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,237
Florence.

842
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,989
There's gonna be a little get together

843
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:27,538
in my house this Saturday
afternoon with my sons.

844
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,725
Will you please come over?

845
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:32,877
I'd love to.

846
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:33,897
Good.

847
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,058
Sit down and have some dessert.

848
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:41,245
(wistful piano music)

849
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,910
This is good.

850
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:59,568
(doorbell rings)

851
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:04,284
(lighthearted piano music)

852
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:05,244
Robert!

853
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:06,264
Hi.

854
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:08,183
Hi.

855
00:39:10,506 --> 00:39:11,383
I guess you don't have to

856
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:14,726
fight for spots around here, huh?

857
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:15,746
Yeah, no.

858
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:19,326
Wow, what are you doing here?

859
00:39:19,346 --> 00:39:20,287
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood,

860
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:22,591
so I thought I'd, you know, swing by and...

861
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,554
- Yeah, right.
(Susan chuckles)

862
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:28,034
No, I came to see you.

863
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:30,042
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

864
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,274
No, no, not at all.

865
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:34,352
These are for you.

866
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,642
Thanks.

867
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:36,643
Come in, I'm sorry.

868
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:37,732
Come on in, come on in.

869
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,372
All right.

870
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:42,975
(dramatic saxophone music)

871
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,197
Well, I saw Ted.

872
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:49,039
Oh, Ted.

873
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:49,872
Yes.

874
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:50,706
How did it go?

875
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:52,857
Well, he wants to move to Seattle,

876
00:39:52,877 --> 00:39:53,840
which I thought was kinda funny,

877
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,276
so I told him that a change of location

878
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:59,145
would not necessarily fix
what's wrong with our marriage.

879
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:02,236
And I just realized that being with Ted

880
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:04,006
actually stopped me from
doing a lot of things.

881
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,062
For instance, I've always
wanted to go to New York,

882
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:09,030
and you know like when the
business trips would come up,

883
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,961
he would talk me out of them all the time.

884
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:13,121
Well, maybe it's best that you two

885
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:13,954
aren't together anymore.

886
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:14,974
Yeah.

887
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:19,574
You know, Falco wanted to
send someone else to Milwaukee,

888
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:21,844
but I insisted that I come.

889
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:24,702
Well, this isn't New York, Robert.

890
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,421
My problems aren't a hundred miles away,

891
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:28,892
the fantasy month is very much over.

892
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:30,214
So, you're saying we're
not in Kansas anymore?

893
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:31,047
(Susan chuckles)

894
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:32,067
Exactly.

895
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:37,159
Well, why don't we just take a shot?

896
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:38,641
Hang out together, you and I.

897
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:40,472
No pressure, just hang out.

898
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:42,481
I have a friend who has a little cabin

899
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,430
right on the lake in
Vermont, it's beautiful.

900
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,441
You're very persistent, aren't you?

901
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:46,343
Well, can you blame me?

902
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:49,081
(Susan laughs)

903
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:52,313
I don't know what you did, coming here-

904
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,162
- Stalking you.

905
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:57,598
Showing up at my doorstep
was very brave, you know.

906
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,282
I could've shut the
door right in your face.

907
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:02,601
You would've never shut the door-

908
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:03,791
- I could have, I could have.

909
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:07,644
Not this sad, little
face coming to see you.

910
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:11,792
You would've slammed the door on me?

911
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:13,932
No.

912
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:14,766
I guess not.

913
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,113
See?

914
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:19,216
(lighthearted music)

915
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,034
I hate to leave so soon,
but I promised Falco

916
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:31,532
I'd go check this account out in Detroit.

917
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:32,499
Oh, it's better this way,

918
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,268
it'll give us some time to think.

919
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:39,331
[Robert] Bye.

920
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:40,898
Bye.

921
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,348
Hey, tell your dad I say hi.

922
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:43,309
Oh, yeah.

923
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,513
You know, I talked to my brother,

924
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,888
and he said that my dad met somebody.

925
00:41:46,908 --> 00:41:47,722
You're kidding!

926
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,730
I'm so happy for him.

927
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,748
Yeah.

928
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:52,768
It's nice to meet somebody.

929
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:55,824
(lighthearted music)

930
00:41:55,844 --> 00:41:58,696
You turn an unexpected
corner, and then wham!

931
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,554
Your life changes on you just like that.

932
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:02,914
(kids playing)
And my motto...

933
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,784
My motto is that you always
take it while you can

934
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:07,104
and run like hell with-

935
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,686
- Stop with the balls!

936
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,245
[Kid] Come on!

937
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:12,079
Go!

938
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,348
[Kid] I got it, I got it!

939
00:42:17,094 --> 00:42:19,634
Don't you get tired?

940
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:20,994
Oh, no, no.

941
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:22,562
Life's a blast!

942
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,873
Right, Francis?

943
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:25,093
Yeah, usually.

944
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:28,274
(Frank chuckles)

945
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:29,584
Nice outfit.

946
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:30,853
Oh, thanks.

947
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:34,040
My friend's daughter has it in blue.

948
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:36,034
I think...

949
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:40,853
I'll be right back, I
got some ice, I think.

950
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:01,793
I think I'll go see if
Francis could use some help.

951
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:08,377
Francis.

952
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:09,556
What'd I do wrong?

953
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:11,204
You didn't do anything.

954
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:12,857
Well, your boys, they just sat there

955
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:13,996
and looked at each other.

956
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:15,065
Well, that's the way they are,

957
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:17,025
they usually keep to themself,
don't worry about it.

958
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:18,265
And the wives!

959
00:43:18,285 --> 00:43:20,337
I can just imagine what
they're saying about me now.

960
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:22,984
I don't care what they say.

961
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:26,171
Come over here, I want to talk to you.

962
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:33,710
Robert will understand, he's been around.

963
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,589
It'll go better with him, I know it will.

964
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:38,609
Oh.

965
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:40,657
Aw!

966
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:44,846
(lighthearted music)

967
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,376
[Commentator] The
quarterback is not getting

968
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:49,720
the protection from his offensive line,

969
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,618
and he's having to let go of the football-

970
00:43:51,638 --> 00:43:53,605
- Oh, the door's open, he must be here.

971
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,439
[Florence] Oh!

972
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:55,272
Hey, Pop.

973
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:56,106
Hey, kid.

974
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:57,535
How are ya?

975
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:59,069
Hi, Robert!

976
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:00,126
I'm Florence.
- Nice to meet you.

977
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:01,480
Hi, Florence.
- Hello!

978
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,968
Hey, give us a hand with this, will ya?

979
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:03,910
All right, let me get this for ya.

980
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,189
Thank you, thank you.

981
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,589
Oh, so you're Robert?

982
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:07,422
Yeah.

983
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:08,256
Oh!

984
00:44:08,276 --> 00:44:10,760
Your father's told me so much about you.

985
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,128
Most of it's good.

986
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,338
- Oh.
(Florence laughs)

987
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:14,978
Can you just put those down there?

988
00:44:14,998 --> 00:44:15,811
Yeah.

989
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:16,644
So, how you doin' Pops?

990
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:17,478
Just put that down.

991
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:20,181
Your father's gonna live a hundred years.

992
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:21,581
Oh, so, listen.

993
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,922
Can I get you something, huh?

994
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,721
Name your poison.

995
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:28,592
Uh, I'll have a mineral water.

996
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:29,425
Honey?

997
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:30,291
Same thing.

998
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:32,162
Okay, coming right up!

999
00:44:32,182 --> 00:44:34,321
I'll check on dinner too.

1000
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,901
Interesting pattern there, Pop.

1001
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:36,992
Oh, thanks.

1002
00:44:37,012 --> 00:44:38,688
Florence picked that out.

1003
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,911
I was never any good at that stuff.

1004
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:43,322
I did buy some paintings though.

1005
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:45,232
Clowns, they're all clowns.

1006
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:47,911
There's something about clowns that I like.

1007
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:50,328
You know, your mother and
me were always interested

1008
00:44:50,348 --> 00:44:52,541
in purchasing some works of art,

1009
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:55,561
but we never could get around to it.

1010
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,751
You like them?

1011
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,071
- They're clowns.
- Eh?

1012
00:44:59,091 --> 00:44:59,905
Yeah.

1013
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:01,370
Well, don't they make you feel good?

1014
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,410
They sort of pep you up a little bit.

1015
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:07,280
Okey dokey, here we are!

1016
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,392
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Here you are.

1017
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:10,602
Here's your water.
- Thank you, thank you.

1018
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:11,730
Come on, sit down, honey.

1019
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,501
Come on, come on.
- I'll take a seat.

1020
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:14,687
Here's your water.

1021
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:17,490
- Ah, thanks!
- Very well.

1022
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,510
Robert.

1023
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,640
You know, your father told me

1024
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,470
that you've been away, huh?

1025
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,780
Yes, yes, I was on a business trip,

1026
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,121
and I went to visit a friend in Wisconsin.

1027
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,310
Oh.

1028
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,649
Wisconsin?

1029
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:31,120
Where the hell's Wisconsin?

1030
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,159
Is that near Vegas?

1031
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:34,041
(Frank chuckles)

1032
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:35,061
Close.

1033
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,879
So, you're the one who's not married, huh?

1034
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,951
Yeah, he's got too many girlfriends.

1035
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,260
Oh, he's the wild man of the family, huh?

1036
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,960
I'm a people person.

1037
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,901
He's a what?

1038
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:49,201
[Robert] A people person.

1039
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:50,202
It's an expression.

1040
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:51,241
He's a people person.

1041
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:52,529
He likes people, yeah.

1042
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,710
(Frank chuckles)

1043
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,544
Yeah.

1044
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:57,420
So, where are you from?

1045
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
- Well-
- Me?

1046
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:00,362
He's talking to me!

1047
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,270
Originally, I'm from Texas,

1048
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,511
but I've been living
here a long, long time.

1049
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:08,468
I've got a cute little
place over in Rosedale.

1050
00:46:08,488 --> 00:46:09,488
Hm.

1051
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,588
Should we have something to eat?

1052
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:25,608
Good, yes!

1053
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,201
Yes, I'll get it in a jiffy!

1054
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,643
We got a microwave.

1055
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:51,751
What's the matter?

1056
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:52,771
Full.

1057
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,489
So, Pop, do you guys have
fun, you and Florence?

1058
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:58,323
Yeah!

1059
00:46:58,343 --> 00:46:59,721
She loves to do things.

1060
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:03,351
We're gonna paint the
house over the weekend.

1061
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:04,898
She's had it very rough, you know.

1062
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:07,340
Her husband died of liver cancer.

1063
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,812
She's like a rock.

1064
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:10,641
Well, I can see that.

1065
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,041
You should see her daughter.

1066
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:13,000
Beauty.

1067
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:17,080
Oh, but stay away from
her, she's getting married.

1068
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,066
Listen, Pop, you should...

1069
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,681
Why don't you think about
this a little bit, you know?

1070
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:24,121
Maybe play the field a little bit.

1071
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,151
Maybe date some other women.

1072
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:26,971
You're a handsome man, you're funny.

1073
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:27,805
You know, word gets out,

1074
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:29,060
those women are gonna
be running towards you,

1075
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,921
I guarantee it.

1076
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:30,972
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1077
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:32,591
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, no.

1078
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:34,800
That way you and I can
double date or something,

1079
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,634
it would be nice.

1080
00:47:35,654 --> 00:47:36,833
- Double date?
- Yes.

1081
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,209
Florence would like that.

1082
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:41,771
You boys want seconds?

1083
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,283
No, no thank you.

1084
00:47:43,303 --> 00:47:44,303
I'm still...

1085
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:46,810
You got anything for dessert?

1086
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,593
It's a surprise!

1087
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:49,613
Okay.

1088
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:54,452
What are you doing?

1089
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,889
Just doctoring it a little.

1090
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,827
That was some dinner.

1091
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:05,097
- Thank you!
- Yeah, some dinner.

1092
00:48:05,117 --> 00:48:07,457
Hey, you tired, huh?

1093
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:08,758
[Frank] Nah.

1094
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:10,659
A little bit.

1095
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,441
Say, Florence, you need a lift?

1096
00:48:13,461 --> 00:48:14,790
A lift?

1097
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,143
Oh, you drove?

1098
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,910
Her car's in Rosedale.

1099
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,859
Oh. Oh, all right, it's
a little out of my way,

1100
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:23,761
but I don't mind. You know,
it's late, that way my father

1101
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:24,660
doesn't have to drive you home.

1102
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,331
No, you don't understand.

1103
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:29,101
Florence is staying here tonight.

1104
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,224
Hm?

1105
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:33,493
We have an early morning.

1106
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:37,879
Oh.

1107
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:43,480
Well, I guess I better go upstairs.

1108
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:46,620
[Frank] All right.

1109
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:52,342
Goodnight, boys.

1110
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:57,942
Night.

1111
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:00,453
So?

1112
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:02,997
Everything okay?

1113
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:06,100
Yeah.

1114
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Good.

1115
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:09,134
Yeah, I gotta get outta here, Pop.

1116
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:09,968
[Frank] What?

1117
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,535
No, I'm fine, I'm gonna take off.

1118
00:49:11,555 --> 00:49:13,084
You what?

1119
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:14,215
I'm driving over to Steve's tomorrow.

1120
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:15,174
You want to take a ride?

1121
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:18,021
[Frank] No, we're
painting upstairs tomorrow,

1122
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,407
and tomorrow night we're
seeing some friends.

1123
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:21,427
Oh.

1124
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:24,540
Does she have money, Pop?

1125
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,690
She's got her own business

1126
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,293
with six people on the payroll.

1127
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:36,167
You know, they make you feel
happy when you look at them.

1128
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:37,187
What?

1129
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,920
The clowns!

1130
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,820
The clowns.

1131
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,161
They make you feel happy
when you look at them.

1132
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,181
Yeah.

1133
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:48,990
I'll see ya.

1134
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,010
Okay.

1135
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:56,362
(dog faintly barks)

1136
00:49:56,382 --> 00:49:59,745
(lighthearted jazzy music)

1137
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:01,297
He gonna be okay?

1138
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:02,131
Him?

1139
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:04,785
Yeah, he'll be all right.

1140
00:50:04,805 --> 00:50:06,937
I love him, you know.

1141
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:11,457
Well, it's an awful lot
for him to take all at once.

1142
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,385
You and I are getting married.

1143
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:17,946
(Florence laughs)

1144
00:50:17,966 --> 00:50:20,377
I bet you say that to all the girls.

1145
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:21,730
Nah, just two.

1146
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:29,428
Come on upstairs, I'll
show you my etchings.

1147
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,448
(Florence chuckles)

1148
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:41,030
[Announcer] Flight 232,
nonstop service to Chicago

1149
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,533
is now boarding in gate-

1150
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:43,632
- [Robert] Susan!

1151
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:44,465
Hi.

1152
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:45,298
[Robert] Hi.

1153
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:46,131
How are ya?

1154
00:50:46,151 --> 00:50:46,964
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

1155
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:47,798
Good.

1156
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:49,463
How was the flight, good?
- Oh, it was all right.

1157
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:50,413
Sorry I'm late, thank you.

1158
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:51,599
That's okay.

1159
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,310
My dad's having a little party,

1160
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,973
wanted to stop by for a bit.

1161
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:56,807
Yeah.

1162
00:50:56,827 --> 00:50:58,053
What's the party for?

1163
00:50:58,073 --> 00:50:59,710
I don't know, he didn't say.

1164
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,685
You look good.

1165
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:01,693
Great, I mean.

1166
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:02,713
Thanks.

1167
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,034
[Robert] You okay?

1168
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:05,868
Yeah, yeah.

1169
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:07,313
Just wasn't planning on
coming back to New York,

1170
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,500
but here I am.

1171
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,424
Well, I'm glad you came.

1172
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,444
Good.

1173
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:18,682
Thank you.

1174
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,387
You're welcome.

1175
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:21,268
You're a true gentleman.

1176
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:24,656
Oh, I don't know who I am anymore.

1177
00:51:24,676 --> 00:51:27,277
Since I met you, I don't know,

1178
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,654
my world has-

1179
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:29,488
- What?

1180
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:32,747
I don't know, I hear
your voice and I'm excited,

1181
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:35,158
I see you, I'm unnerved by it, you know?

1182
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:35,992
It's okay!

1183
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:37,248
I mean, I like it.

1184
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,878
It's a good thing, you know?

1185
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:40,918
And women, I don't even care.

1186
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:43,188
(knocking)

1187
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:46,647
Hey, hi, come on in!

1188
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:47,980
Hi!

1189
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,897
Hi, this is Susan.

1190
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:51,289
- Oh, hello, I'm Florence.
- It's nice to meet you.

1191
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:52,427
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

1192
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,667
Pop, you remember Susan.

1193
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:54,918
Yeah, pretty girl.

1194
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:56,038
Hi, it's good to see you again.

1195
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:58,066
I'm sorry I'm late, my plane was delayed,

1196
00:51:58,086 --> 00:52:00,947
left a little bit of bad
weather back in Wisconsin.

1197
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,606
Is that near Vegas?

1198
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:03,440
- Uh-
- Close.

1199
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,956
- I know it's not.
(Susan chuckles)

1200
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:06,157
May I use the little girl's room?

1201
00:52:06,177 --> 00:52:06,991
- Oh, sure, it's right
- Oh, sure, it's right

1202
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:08,455
upstairs, it's on the...
upstairs, it's on the...

1203
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:09,797
First one on the left.

1204
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:11,067
Okay, thanks.

1205
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:15,218
She's so pretty.

1206
00:52:15,238 --> 00:52:16,052
Yeah.

1207
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:19,163
Does she still got somebody?

1208
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:21,757
No, Pops, she filed.

1209
00:52:21,777 --> 00:52:23,317
Oh!

1210
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:25,055
Oh, look at this.

1211
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,575
You guys have done some stuff.

1212
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,525
What color would this be?

1213
00:52:32,545 --> 00:52:34,945
Well, it's kind of a burnt orange

1214
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:38,345
with a little bit of terracotta.

1215
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:39,986
You know, your brothers were here

1216
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:42,405
the other day with their wives.

1217
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,285
They were speechless.

1218
00:52:44,305 --> 00:52:45,305
Really?

1219
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:49,117
So, what's the occasion today, Pop?

1220
00:52:49,137 --> 00:52:50,245
What are we doing?

1221
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:53,325
No occasion, we're just
having a little get together.

1222
00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:54,159
Yeah, yeah.

1223
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:56,746
We got everything fixed
up down in the basement.

1224
00:52:56,766 --> 00:52:57,616
Come on!

1225
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,746
We don't need an occasion, come on down!

1226
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:01,365
Get your friend when she comes down

1227
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:03,302
and go to the basement.

1228
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:17,880
Oh.

1229
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,314
No, my mom must be doing
flip flops in heaven right now.

1230
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:23,474
Well, shall we join them?

1231
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:24,475
Yeah.

1232
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:25,562
Can I...

1233
00:53:25,582 --> 00:53:28,749
Sit down one second, I just want to...

1234
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:30,802
I've been thinking.

1235
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:33,572
I need to settle down in my life.

1236
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:37,143
I need to be more responsible.

1237
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:38,722
Okay.

1238
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:42,825
So, I think that we
shouldn't see other people.

1239
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:44,555
[Florence] Yoohoo!

1240
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,714
Hey, come on down, we're waiting for you!

1241
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,394
Don't, just think about it.

1242
00:53:48,414 --> 00:53:49,582
I'm just- Okay, well

1243
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,213
Don't, just...

1244
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:52,233
Come on.

1245
00:53:54,012 --> 00:53:57,595
(lighthearted piano music)

1246
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:01,023
Not...

1247
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:05,536
You want to dance with me, hey, Papa?

1248
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:08,639
(lighthearted music)

1249
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:16,787
So, Robert tells me that your marriage

1250
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:18,221
didn't work out so good.

1251
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,450
Pop, I heard that.

1252
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,979
Are you drinking?

1253
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:23,140
You know I don't drink.

1254
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,971
So, did you come to marry my son?

1255
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:27,509
Pop!

1256
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,531
I've never seen you like this,
what's the matter with you?

1257
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:30,365
What's the matter with you?

1258
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:33,021
You're never here, you're
never around, you never fax.

1259
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,171
(Susan laughs)

1260
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:35,389
I'm here, and you don't have a fax.

1261
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,450
And if you had a fax, you
wouldn't know how to use it.

1262
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,371
(phone rings)

1263
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:41,331
Oh, excuse me.

1264
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:42,165
I'll be right back.

1265
00:54:42,185 --> 00:54:43,267
Absolutely.

1266
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,010
(phone rings)

1267
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,030
Yeah?

1268
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,082
Yeah.

1269
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,121
(Susan chuckles)

1270
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:55,141
Yeah.

1271
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Yeah.

1272
00:54:58,322 --> 00:54:59,322
Yeah.

1273
00:55:00,242 --> 00:55:01,242
Yeah.

1274
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:02,921
Yeah.

1275
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,621
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1276
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:07,189
Steven, he's not coming over,

1277
00:55:07,209 --> 00:55:11,181
his wife is sick and he doesn't
want to leave her alone.

1278
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,290
What about James?

1279
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,440
James' car broke down,

1280
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,160
the wife needs the car in the morning,

1281
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:16,390
so he's working on it.

1282
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,030
They live two blocks away.

1283
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:22,770
Yeah, they're not very big
in the walking department.

1284
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,288
I'm glad you're here anyway,

1285
00:55:24,308 --> 00:55:28,272
because I think you should hear this first.

1286
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:30,125
I'm selling the house.

1287
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,551
Good, good, that's a good idea.

1288
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:35,581
You gonna move in with Steven?

1289
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:39,518
No, no, I'm moving to
Rosedale with Florence.

1290
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,727
You're gonna move in with Florence?

1291
00:55:44,747 --> 00:55:47,687
Yeah, we're gonna live
together until next spring,

1292
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:49,957
then we're getting married.

1293
00:55:53,146 --> 00:55:54,146
Married?

1294
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:56,510
Why?

1295
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,625
Because they want to get married, Robert.

1296
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:00,116
Yeah, I'd like to get married

1297
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:01,726
so I could have some happiness.

1298
00:56:01,746 --> 00:56:03,766
Is there anything wrong with that?

1299
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:05,716
I don't want to talk about this, not here.

1300
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:07,052
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait!

1301
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,452
Robert, no, come on back.

1302
00:56:08,472 --> 00:56:10,139
Talk to us, tell us.

1303
00:56:11,074 --> 00:56:12,846
Pop, a lot happens to a person

1304
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:15,172
when they lose their
spouse, they go into shock.

1305
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:16,006
It's not a good time to be

1306
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:17,694
jumping into something like marriage.

1307
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:21,126
Besides, it's been like not
even a year since mother died.

1308
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:24,116
You were married to mom for 41 years.

1309
00:56:24,136 --> 00:56:26,374
You're talking about
us like we're children.

1310
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:29,726
I just think that maybe you
guys don't know what you want.

1311
00:56:29,746 --> 00:56:31,329
We want marriage.

1312
00:56:32,236 --> 00:56:33,878
What's the matter with you?

1313
00:56:33,898 --> 00:56:35,853
Are you always this negative?

1314
00:56:35,873 --> 00:56:37,567
Florence, please, I'm not being negative.

1315
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:39,797
It's just, there's a lot
to take into consideration.

1316
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:44,175
I'm being realistic, that's
all I'm being, realistic.

1317
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:45,367
You don't like me.

1318
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:47,186
That's what this is all about.

1319
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:49,516
No, I like you, it has nothing to do

1320
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,837
with the fact if I like
you or I don't like you.

1321
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,005
It sure as hell does.

1322
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:55,308
Listen, why can't you be honest?

1323
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,252
What's the matter with you.

1324
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:58,611
Just say it, talk, tell us.

1325
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:00,910
At least that would be a beginning.

1326
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,419
You don't like me!

1327
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:04,971
Yeah, too bad you don't
like her, 'cause I do.

1328
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:07,520
That's good, good, I'm glad you like her,

1329
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,251
and I like her too, believe me.

1330
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:10,720
It's just, there's a lot

1331
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,331
to take into consideration here.

1332
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:13,360
What's he talking about?

1333
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,988
I never know what he's talking about.

1334
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:16,838
What do you have against marriage?

1335
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:17,672
[Robert] Nothing!

1336
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:20,360
It's a very good question, Robert.

1337
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,742
I have nothing against
marriage, I know my father.

1338
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:25,440
Pop, mom took care of you for four decades.

1339
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,090
Now, the fact that you
can't take care of yourself

1340
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,972
and you don't want to be alone

1341
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:29,720
is no reason to run off and get married.

1342
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,061
That's enough out of you.

1343
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,077
[Robert] Where you goin'?

1344
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:34,930
Gettin' out of here.

1345
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:47,012
Pop.

1346
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,064
I thought you had some common sense.

1347
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:50,078
Why do you have to jump into this?

1348
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:50,911
I thought you'd understand.

1349
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:51,745
Why?

1350
00:57:51,765 --> 00:57:53,155
How long do you think I'm gonna be around?

1351
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:54,453
I'm trying to protect you, that's all.

1352
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:55,525
Protect me from what?

1353
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:57,902
- From yourself!
- Do me a favor, will ya?

1354
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,342
Don't protect me.

1355
00:57:59,362 --> 00:58:01,022
I'm just trying to be happy, that's all.

1356
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,731
That's what's wrong with you.

1357
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:04,449
You don't care about being happy,

1358
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:06,219
you're a damn coward!

1359
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,253
(dog barks)

1360
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:36,386
Can I ask you something?

1361
00:58:36,406 --> 00:58:37,768
Do you understand him?

1362
00:58:37,788 --> 00:58:38,602
Oh, dear.

1363
00:58:38,622 --> 00:58:40,517
Well, to tell you the truth,

1364
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:41,438
I kinda thought it was time

1365
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:43,576
the man tried understanding me, you know?

1366
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:44,946
Understand you, him?

1367
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:46,946
Honey, you've got your
hands full with that one.

1368
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:48,495
Yeah, I know.

1369
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:51,506
Right now he's out
there sitting in his car,

1370
00:58:51,526 --> 00:58:54,346
and his father's out there
sweeping up God knows what.

1371
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:55,763
And you know what?

1372
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:57,666
That's how they communicate.

1373
00:58:57,686 --> 00:58:59,386
They've known each other all their lives,

1374
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:02,797
and this is the way they
tell each other they care.

1375
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:04,496
Boy, that's kinda scary, isn't it?

1376
00:59:04,516 --> 00:59:06,496
Mm, good point.

1377
00:59:06,516 --> 00:59:08,385
And you want them to understand us.

1378
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:09,866
(Florence chuckles)

1379
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:12,666
Honey, even if they had the inclination,

1380
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:14,576
they don't have the equipment.

1381
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,025
Yeah.

1382
00:59:16,045 --> 00:59:18,266
(Susan laughs)

1383
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:21,369
(lighthearted music)

1384
00:59:29,763 --> 00:59:31,439
He's sitting in his car.

1385
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:32,772
Yeah, I know.

1386
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,170
He used to sit in his room.

1387
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,303
Once, he didn't talk to me for two months.

1388
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,740
It isn't healthy.

1389
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,903
Yeah, some people are like that, I guess.

1390
00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:44,340
He's too old to be strange.

1391
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:47,911
You know, it's probably
really none of my business,

1392
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:51,215
maybe he thinks because he's your son

1393
00:59:51,235 --> 00:59:54,235
it's his responsibility to speak up.

1394
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,263
He sounds stupid with his ideas.

1395
00:59:58,283 --> 01:00:01,366
(lighthearted music)

1396
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:25,322
Boy.

1397
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:29,584
They think too much, these kids.

1398
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:31,159
They don't know what they want.

1399
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:34,242
Well, they got too much to pick from.

1400
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:36,933
Well, all I know is I don't
want to be sitting alone

1401
01:00:36,953 --> 01:00:39,642
in front of a damn TV set all my life.

1402
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,114
Can't he see that?

1403
01:00:41,134 --> 01:00:42,224
Well, maybe he likes you there,

1404
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:44,052
he knows where you are.

1405
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:45,504
All he ever knew his whole life

1406
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:47,524
was you with his mother.

1407
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:50,832
It's a price you pay for
being something for so long

1408
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:53,185
and then changing it on him.

1409
01:00:54,572 --> 01:00:58,472
You know, what he said might be true.

1410
01:00:58,492 --> 01:00:59,752
We hardly know each other,

1411
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:03,105
I wonder if we're doing the right thing.

1412
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:06,451
Ooh.

1413
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:09,554
(somber piano music)

1414
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:17,686
Look, Francis, if you
got any doubts about us,

1415
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:20,445
I'm outta here.

1416
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:23,516
I couldn't take it.

1417
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,620
Listen, Florence, I've learned something

1418
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,708
in all these years of marriage,

1419
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,740
and that is you can't please everybody

1420
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,778
at the same time,

1421
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,249
even if it's only two of you.

1422
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:45,102
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, huh?

1423
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:48,618
I can take the aggravation,

1424
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,999
I just can't stand the quiet!

1425
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:55,759
Well, you'd never have a
moment of quiet with me around.

1426
01:01:55,779 --> 01:01:56,999
You don't have to go anywhere,

1427
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:58,499
I know what I want.

1428
01:01:58,519 --> 01:01:59,959
April 23rd.

1429
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:01,769
[Florence] What about it?

1430
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:03,639
Well, April 23rd, that's the day

1431
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,039
I want us to be married,

1432
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,892
if it's okay with you.

1433
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:10,839
It's okay with me, Francis.

1434
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:11,991
Frank.

1435
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:14,519
Please don't call me Francis,
I don't like Francis.

1436
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:16,119
The name is Frank.

1437
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:18,108
Why didn't you ever tell me that before?

1438
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:21,029
I've been calling you
Francis this whole time!

1439
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:23,449
Well, I wanted to try it out.

1440
01:02:23,469 --> 01:02:26,140
You said you liked it,
you said it had some,

1441
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,769
what did you use, the word class?

1442
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:30,380
Fine.

1443
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,631
I don't like it though, I like Frank.

1444
01:02:32,651 --> 01:02:33,734
Well, okay!

1445
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:39,572
Why April 23rd?

1446
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:41,343
I looked at the calendar that day,

1447
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:42,943
and there's nothing going on,

1448
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:46,370
so I figured I'd make it special.

1449
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:48,041
You know, it was just an ordinary day

1450
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:49,644
with nothing in it.

1451
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:54,078
Okay, Frank.

1452
01:02:58,294 --> 01:03:01,245
Human beings make no
sense at all, me included.

1453
01:03:01,265 --> 01:03:03,084
I mean, everybody puts so much importance

1454
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:05,525
on finding somebody and falling in love

1455
01:03:05,545 --> 01:03:06,359
and getting married-

1456
01:03:06,379 --> 01:03:07,504
- But that's normal.

1457
01:03:07,524 --> 01:03:08,505
She doesn't even know him!

1458
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:09,614
She's a total stranger.

1459
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:11,234
I mean, I'm a total stranger to my father,

1460
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,255
and he's a stranger to me,

1461
01:03:12,275 --> 01:03:15,146
but she's a double stranger.

1462
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,166
It's hot.

1463
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:18,315
Robert.

1464
01:03:21,054 --> 01:03:22,535
Robert, your father is in love,

1465
01:03:22,555 --> 01:03:24,085
he wants this woman in his life.

1466
01:03:24,105 --> 01:03:25,914
That's all that's
important to him right now.

1467
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,026
Don't you understand, Susan?

1468
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:28,559
Don't you understand what's at stake here?

1469
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:30,565
Marriage puts strangers
together for a lifetime,

1470
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:32,226
I'm just trying to make
some sense out of it all.

1471
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:33,786
You can't make sense out of everything!

1472
01:03:33,806 --> 01:03:34,620
You know, I meet you,

1473
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,925
and suddenly my life has
totally turned around.

1474
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:38,895
I mean, you're so wonderful, Susan,

1475
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:39,824
and you're so smart,

1476
01:03:39,844 --> 01:03:42,274
and when I'm around you, I feel better,

1477
01:03:42,294 --> 01:03:44,374
I feel like a better
person, I feel funnier.

1478
01:03:44,394 --> 01:03:45,234
Part of me says, you know what?

1479
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:46,234
You should chuck it all, Robert,

1480
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:47,096
you should chuck it all,

1481
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:48,946
go to Wisconsin and marry this girl.

1482
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:50,335
I don't want to get married, Robert.

1483
01:03:50,355 --> 01:03:52,434
Another part of me
says whoa, wait a minute.

1484
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,094
No, wait a minute, not so fast.

1485
01:03:54,114 --> 01:03:57,074
Because think about it, everywhere
you go, she'll be there.

1486
01:03:57,094 --> 01:03:58,866
She'll be complaining,
she'll be doing things,

1487
01:03:58,886 --> 01:04:01,605
she'll be making those funny
little noises, you know?

1488
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:04,074
You'll slowly drag her into your life,

1489
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,604
and she slowly drags you into her life.

1490
01:04:06,624 --> 01:04:08,714
It doesn't have to be like that.

1491
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:11,146
In the end, in the
end, if it all works out,

1492
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,016
and it does take work,

1493
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:13,295
because everybody says,

1494
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:15,255
"Marriage takes work,
relationships take work."

1495
01:04:15,275 --> 01:04:18,225
It's not about caring, it's about enduring.

1496
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:19,655
Seeing who will outlive who,

1497
01:04:19,675 --> 01:04:22,335
because at the time, someone
will be standing at the grave,

1498
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:23,565
they'll be looking over that person saying,

1499
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:24,399
"You know what?

1500
01:04:24,419 --> 01:04:26,015
I really loved that person,
I cared about that person."

1501
01:04:26,035 --> 01:04:28,204
But they didn't realize it
when the person was alive!

1502
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:29,807
Who needs all that?

1503
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:34,294
You have a wonderful
and gentle side, Robert,

1504
01:04:34,314 --> 01:04:36,934
and I know you want the best for everybody,

1505
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:40,454
but you're just not ready for all this.

1506
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:45,072
I shouldn't have dragged
you all the way out here, huh?

1507
01:04:45,092 --> 01:04:48,342
Robert, you should never get married.

1508
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:55,607
(dramatic music)

1509
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:04,730
Susan.

1510
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:09,710
I hope I see you again.

1511
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,480
(dramatic music)

1512
01:05:41,143 --> 01:05:43,724
At least you'll never have
to worry about a spot again.

1513
01:05:43,744 --> 01:05:45,743
(Frank chuckles)

1514
01:05:45,763 --> 01:05:47,415
And the best deli in town

1515
01:05:47,435 --> 01:05:48,834
is just a couple of blocks from here,

1516
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:49,776
and it's right next door

1517
01:05:49,796 --> 01:05:52,895
to the most fantastic bakery.

1518
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:53,728
Oh!

1519
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:54,562
Yeah.

1520
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:55,735
I go there a lot.

1521
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:58,838
(lighthearted music)

1522
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:07,215
Well, this is it, this is my favorite spot.

1523
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:08,735
What do you think?

1524
01:06:09,877 --> 01:06:11,236
Oh, it's okay.

1525
01:06:11,256 --> 01:06:14,148
It's a little quiet here.

1526
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:17,795
It's supposed to be, it's a park.

1527
01:06:17,815 --> 01:06:19,454
Yeah, but I know a lot of parks

1528
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:21,796
where it's pretty noisy.
(bell tolls)

1529
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,091
That's pretty noisy.

1530
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:24,776
There, you got some noise.

1531
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:26,736
Belmont Park, Central Park.

1532
01:06:26,756 --> 01:06:28,584
(Florence chuckles)

1533
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:29,604
Oh!

1534
01:06:31,615 --> 01:06:34,235
What am I gonna do with you, huh?

1535
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:37,672
Well, Your Honor, it was all like this.

1536
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:41,913
All right, Charlie, listen to this one.

1537
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:45,350
"I'm a Gemini, SWF, I've never been a DF.

1538
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:50,055
I was once an SSWF, but now I'm a non-SSWF.

1539
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:53,043
I love the rain."

1540
01:06:53,063 --> 01:06:54,953
(Charlie chuckles)

1541
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,473
Kill me, shoot me.

1542
01:06:57,693 --> 01:06:58,620
(car honks)

1543
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,088
No, no, I'm here, go ahead.

1544
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:01,867
Just say it again.

1545
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:02,887
Right.

1546
01:07:03,897 --> 01:07:04,897
Right.

1547
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:07,390
That's fine.

1548
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,076
No, tell him I said that's fine.

1549
01:07:10,096 --> 01:07:11,096
Yeah.

1550
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:13,978
Hi!

1551
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:15,081
Hi, Robert.

1552
01:07:18,646 --> 01:07:20,004
Linda!

1553
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:21,084
Robert, hi!

1554
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,454
Hi, how are you?

1555
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:23,288
Good, how are you?

1556
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:24,643
I'm good, I'm good, I'm glad you're here.

1557
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,313
- Yeah!
- This is good.

1558
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,274
Can I buy you a drink?

1559
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,710
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I can't.

1560
01:07:31,098 --> 01:07:33,612
I'm waiting for my fiance.

1561
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,351
It just happened this
weekend, isn't that great?

1562
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,185
Yeah!

1563
01:07:37,205 --> 01:07:38,892
Well, thank you!

1564
01:07:38,912 --> 01:07:40,829
I'm so happy for you!

1565
01:07:41,985 --> 01:07:43,360
Hi!

1566
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,191
Listen, we have dinner reservations.

1567
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:46,211
Excuse me.

1568
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,413
[Bartender] Hey, man.

1569
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:58,247
What will it be?

1570
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:00,516
Can I get a beer, please?

1571
01:08:03,922 --> 01:08:06,147
The name's John.

1572
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,043
Robert.

1573
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:07,876
How are you?

1574
01:08:07,896 --> 01:08:08,710
Robert.

1575
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,149
Ah.

1576
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:13,339
Just came from a singles weekend.

1577
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:15,189
That must've been a horror story.

1578
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:17,579
My friends have been
dying to get me to one.

1579
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:19,179
There's 500 hungry women up there

1580
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,720
looking for a good time, they told me.

1581
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,692
Yeah?

1582
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:24,619
"A woman away is a woman at play."

1583
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:26,219
Terrific.

1584
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,170
I just think the whole thing's depressing.

1585
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,070
But I went anyway, and I'm lucky I managed

1586
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:34,190
one conversation with one girl.

1587
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,920
Maybe you're trying too hard.

1588
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:39,259
I was engaged just a year ago,

1589
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,446
but she met somebody else.

1590
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,447
Could you believe that?

1591
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:48,819
Canceled the wedding and everything.

1592
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:52,051
She just married the guy a few weeks ago.

1593
01:08:52,071 --> 01:08:53,240
Wow.

1594
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,897
Yeah.

1595
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:59,834
I go to a bar, any bar, and I
think I see her in the crowd.

1596
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:05,401
Sometimes a song will come on, and I...

1597
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:12,610
It's okay, bud.

1598
01:09:13,473 --> 01:09:16,030
You had a year, why
didn't you go after her,

1599
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,632
tell her how you felt?

1600
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:19,652
Yeah.

1601
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:23,287
Thanks for listening.

1602
01:09:34,531 --> 01:09:37,031
(jazzy music)

1603
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:41,671
Can I get a vodka martini
instead of this beer, please?

1604
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,028
[Bartender] You got it.

1605
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,048
Thanks.

1606
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:50,072
[Voicemail] The number you
have reached has been changed.

1607
01:09:50,092 --> 01:09:51,704
The new number is...

1608
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:52,807
212-555-0189.

1609
01:10:03,652 --> 01:10:06,273
(phone rings)

1610
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:07,132
[Susan] Hello?

1611
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:08,262
[Robert] Susan?

1612
01:10:08,282 --> 01:10:09,651
Hi, it's Robert.

1613
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:10,633
Robert!

1614
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:11,982
Hi, how are you?

1615
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:13,401
Hi, I'm good, I'm good.

1616
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:14,235
How are you?

1617
01:10:14,255 --> 01:10:15,366
[Susan] Very well, thanks.

1618
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:16,912
I can't believe you're living in New York.

1619
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:18,361
I mean, you are living in New York?

1620
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,195
[Susan] Yeah.

1621
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,926
Yeah, I can't believe it, that's so wild.

1622
01:10:21,946 --> 01:10:23,279
How'd it happen?

1623
01:10:24,442 --> 01:10:27,121
Well, I took an offer
from Lamont and Company.

1624
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:29,422
I've only been here few days.

1625
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,430
[Robert] Well, it's great.

1626
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,479
I mean, it's so great
that you're living here.

1627
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:35,971
I had to get away, you know what I mean.

1628
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:37,211
Yeah, yeah.

1629
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:40,481
Well, maybe we can hang out sometime,

1630
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:41,895
maybe go to dinner or something.

1631
01:10:41,915 --> 01:10:44,481
I don't know about that, Robert.

1632
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:46,281
Oh, oh, okay.

1633
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:48,182
Um, then how about lunch?

1634
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,278
You know, it would be just really cool,

1635
01:10:50,298 --> 01:10:52,381
we just hang out, say hi.

1636
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,041
Yeah, yeah.

1637
01:10:55,061 --> 01:10:56,663
Sure, sure, that's fine.

1638
01:10:56,683 --> 01:11:00,005
How about the day after tomorrow?

1639
01:11:00,025 --> 01:11:02,165
That's gonna be bad for me.

1640
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:03,234
No, I'm kidding.

1641
01:11:03,254 --> 01:11:04,912
Yeah, okay, yeah, the day
after tomorrow would be good.

1642
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,093
How about the Corner Bar?

1643
01:11:06,113 --> 01:11:07,543
That's fine.

1644
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:08,434
[Robert] Okay, noon?

1645
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:09,533
Noon is good.

1646
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:10,367
Good.

1647
01:11:10,387 --> 01:11:12,136
All right, bye Susan.

1648
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:18,754
How was your meal?

1649
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,588
It was all right.

1650
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,420
Not as good as your famous shrimp dish.

1651
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,701
(Susan chuckles)

1652
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:27,845
You know, I'd love to
cook for you again sometime.

1653
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:29,823
Yeah, we did have fun, didn't we?

1654
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:32,280
I was thinking about that the
other night after you called.

1655
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:37,252
I think about it all the time.

1656
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:39,191
You know what?

1657
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,882
That was a fantasy time for me, Robert,

1658
01:11:40,902 --> 01:11:43,461
I've said that already.

1659
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:46,922
And I'm really happy that
I experienced it, I am,

1660
01:11:46,942 --> 01:11:49,442
but after Ted, and you and me,

1661
01:11:50,462 --> 01:11:51,853
I think I really believe that

1662
01:11:51,873 --> 01:11:53,392
it has to happen for the right people

1663
01:11:53,412 --> 01:11:55,173
at the right time, you know?

1664
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:57,739
That could be us, Susan.

1665
01:11:57,759 --> 01:11:59,602
No, when I get involved again,

1666
01:11:59,622 --> 01:12:00,661
it's gonna be with someone

1667
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:03,173
who feels the exact same way that I do.

1668
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,581
I do.

1669
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:06,699
I feel exactly the way you do.

1670
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:07,533
Robert, forgive me,

1671
01:12:07,553 --> 01:12:10,472
but I don't think you know what you want.

1672
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:14,492
We're just not right for
each other, that's all.

1673
01:12:20,972 --> 01:12:21,972
Understand?

1674
01:12:23,151 --> 01:12:24,151
Okay.

1675
01:12:29,966 --> 01:12:32,047
I'd like you all to meet Wendy Ferris.

1676
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:34,266
Wendy joins us from our office in Miami.

1677
01:12:34,286 --> 01:12:35,375
Welcome aboard, Wendy.

1678
01:12:35,395 --> 01:12:36,395
Thank you.

1679
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:38,717
[Falco] Okay, let's get right to it,

1680
01:12:38,737 --> 01:12:40,453
and let's put you under the gun.

1681
01:12:40,473 --> 01:12:41,727
You have a report for us this morning?

1682
01:12:41,747 --> 01:12:43,397
[Wendy] Yes, you take a look at this?

1683
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,145
[Falco] Thanks.

1684
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:46,706
[Frank] They keep it up nice.

1685
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:48,059
Yeah, they do.

1686
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:50,826
You know, I wouldn't change

1687
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:53,767
what I had with your mother for anything.

1688
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:56,146
But if I went first, I would want her

1689
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:58,499
to get on with her life too.

1690
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:01,887
I don't know how you do it, Pop.

1691
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:04,685
Ah, there's nothing brave about it.

1692
01:13:04,705 --> 01:13:06,626
Boy, am I nervous.

1693
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:07,963
But I guess at my age

1694
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:11,520
it's good to be nervous about anything.

1695
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,354
What about you?

1696
01:13:12,374 --> 01:13:14,390
Why do you like being alone?

1697
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,660
I don't like being alone.

1698
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,400
All right.

1699
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,608
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

1700
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:25,711
(lighthearted music)

1701
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:32,696
Who are you taking to the wedding?

1702
01:13:32,716 --> 01:13:34,107
I don't know yet.

1703
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:35,216
What about that friend of yours?

1704
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:36,518
That girl from Wisconsin.

1705
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:37,538
Susan?

1706
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:39,438
Yeah, she moved to New York, you know,

1707
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,056
she works right down the block.

1708
01:13:41,076 --> 01:13:43,205
Then why don't you ask her?

1709
01:13:43,225 --> 01:13:46,670
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

1710
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,176
Too bad.

1711
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:49,936
She's a nice girl.

1712
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:53,039
(lighthearted music)

1713
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:24,685
How's it going, kids?

1714
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:27,416
Eh?

1715
01:14:27,436 --> 01:14:29,018
Having a good time?

1716
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:32,555
What are you doing, Jimmy?

1717
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,742
Ah, cooking.

1718
01:14:34,663 --> 01:14:36,235
Hey, how's the new car?

1719
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:37,253
It's great, I love it.

1720
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:40,984
I want to sell it and get a Jeep.

1721
01:14:41,004 --> 01:14:42,421
We need a Jeep.

1722
01:14:43,964 --> 01:14:45,923
Don't you ever think on your own?

1723
01:14:45,943 --> 01:14:48,414
You know, I remember when you were a kid.

1724
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:52,005
You had an opinion about
everything, you never shut up.

1725
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:53,363
I'm married now, Pop.

1726
01:14:53,383 --> 01:14:54,714
Hurry with the hot dogs!

1727
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:55,734
Right.

1728
01:14:57,002 --> 01:14:58,202
Well...

1729
01:14:58,222 --> 01:14:59,474
Hey, Pop, you having a good time?

1730
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:01,314
Yeah, I'm having a terrific time.

1731
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:03,002
Pop, we're curious.

1732
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:04,962
What are you gonna do with the house?

1733
01:15:04,982 --> 01:15:06,011
We're having a party here, Steven,

1734
01:15:06,031 --> 01:15:06,915
what are you asking that for?

1735
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,914
The house is all paid for!

1736
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:11,024
Pop won't need it if he's
gonna live in Rosedale.

1737
01:15:11,044 --> 01:15:12,650
It's just a question.

1738
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,402
Well, I figure I'll sell the house,

1739
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:15,674
put the money in the bank,

1740
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:17,694
or take it to the track.

1741
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,922
Good.

1742
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:22,235
What about the furniture?

1743
01:15:22,255 --> 01:15:23,077
Steven!

1744
01:15:23,097 --> 01:15:24,298
TV, stuff like that.

1745
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:25,131
[Robert] I can't believe you!

1746
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:26,088
[Darlene] It's just a question.

1747
01:15:26,108 --> 01:15:27,298
No, no, no, no.

1748
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:30,165
Robert, this is a legitimate question.

1749
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:31,185
It's okay.

1750
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:32,766
Let me tell you something.

1751
01:15:32,786 --> 01:15:34,716
When you mother and I got married,

1752
01:15:34,736 --> 01:15:37,046
we had a big party just like this one

1753
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:41,007
outside in the backyard, at
her Uncle Charlie's place,

1754
01:15:41,027 --> 01:15:42,418
well your grandfather said to me,

1755
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:44,688
"Son, what are your plans?"

1756
01:15:46,216 --> 01:15:47,207
I said, "Plans?

1757
01:15:47,227 --> 01:15:51,218
I plan to buy a house and raise a family."

1758
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:53,445
Now, those were big plans in those days,

1759
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:54,279
because, you know,

1760
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,548
I didn't have two nickels to rub together.

1761
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:02,076
But your mother and I saved
and scrimped for five years.

1762
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:05,068
And we put the down
payment down on a house,

1763
01:16:05,088 --> 01:16:06,898
and I'm proud of that!

1764
01:16:06,918 --> 01:16:08,468
You should be, Pop.

1765
01:16:08,488 --> 01:16:11,205
But what are you gonna do?

1766
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:13,428
You guys want any part of the house?

1767
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:14,262
Fine.

1768
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:15,607
You're gonna fight about it?

1769
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:19,806
Forget it, I'll give it
to the Salvation Army.

1770
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,326
Nice party talk.

1771
01:16:26,554 --> 01:16:28,192
Uh, Darlene?

1772
01:16:28,212 --> 01:16:29,294
Could you help me out here?

1773
01:16:29,314 --> 01:16:32,201
I desperately need some fashion advice.

1774
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:33,254
Joy?

1775
01:16:33,274 --> 01:16:35,632
I need your opinion too, please.

1776
01:16:35,652 --> 01:16:38,803
We've been looking through
all of these magazines.

1777
01:16:38,823 --> 01:16:39,762
[Tina] The wedding dresses.

1778
01:16:39,782 --> 01:16:41,351
[Florence] The wedding dress here.

1779
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:42,403
We've got this one.

1780
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:43,534
What do you think?

1781
01:16:43,554 --> 01:16:44,883
Very nice.

1782
01:16:44,903 --> 01:16:46,112
You really think so?

1783
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:48,151
Yes, actually.

1784
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:51,700
I wanted something in magenta, but Tina,

1785
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,590
Tina thought this was better, huh?

1786
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:54,934
She's absolutely right.

1787
01:16:54,954 --> 01:16:56,214
No way was I gonna let my mother

1788
01:16:56,234 --> 01:16:58,083
walk down the aisle wearing purple.

1789
01:16:58,103 --> 01:16:58,991
(Florence chuckles)

1790
01:16:59,011 --> 01:17:00,671
My baby is so conservative,

1791
01:17:00,691 --> 01:17:02,742
she thinks Al Gore is flamboyant.

1792
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:05,595
(Florence laughs)

1793
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:10,672
(lighthearted jazz music)

1794
01:17:11,676 --> 01:17:14,025
It was so nice of you
to cook dinner for me.

1795
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:14,859
You're a really good cook.

1796
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,285
Oh, thank you.

1797
01:17:16,305 --> 01:17:18,438
I usually make everyone sign

1798
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,987
a waiver of responsibility
at the front door, but...

1799
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:23,007
Okay.

1800
01:17:26,407 --> 01:17:27,787
In Florida, all the executives

1801
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:30,016
are allowed to go casual.

1802
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,867
Oh, I like wearing a tie.

1803
01:17:31,887 --> 01:17:34,185
Oh, but this one's so boring.

1804
01:17:34,205 --> 01:17:36,347
If you want to look really hot,

1805
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:39,006
you should buy one of those
big, flashy ones, you know?

1806
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:42,176
The ones that look like abstract paintings.

1807
01:17:42,196 --> 01:17:43,525
I hate those.

1808
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:45,795
Oh, I think they're wild.

1809
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:49,454
You know what, Wendy?

1810
01:17:49,474 --> 01:17:52,724
I'm sorry, I should take you back home.

1811
01:17:54,913 --> 01:17:56,330
I'm in no rush.

1812
01:17:57,401 --> 01:17:59,517
Well, it's just that it's late,

1813
01:17:59,537 --> 01:18:02,537
and I have to get up early tomorrow.

1814
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:06,965
Well, what's wrong?

1815
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:09,422
It feels a little weird, you know.

1816
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:13,508
We work together, and I'm not
sure of anything these days,

1817
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:14,488
I think that's the problem.

1818
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:16,004
I'm sorry to put you through with this,

1819
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,941
you've been very sweet.

1820
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:20,577
Okay.

1821
01:18:20,597 --> 01:18:22,494
- Okay?
- Great.

1822
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:26,014
(lighthearted jazz music)

1823
01:18:30,936 --> 01:18:31,933
Hey.

1824
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:32,848
Hey.

1825
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:35,534
Susan Prescot's in with Falco.

1826
01:18:37,482 --> 01:18:38,482
Susan?

1827
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:40,612
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

1828
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,805
- How are you?
- How are you?

1829
01:18:41,825 --> 01:18:43,842
I'm well, thanks, how are you?

1830
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:45,542
- I'm good, I'm fine.
- Good, good.

1831
01:18:45,562 --> 01:18:46,632
What are you doing here?

1832
01:18:46,652 --> 01:18:48,194
I just needed to talk to Falco

1833
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:49,028
about the Burton account,

1834
01:18:49,048 --> 01:18:50,882
I wanted to assure him
that weren't any problems

1835
01:18:50,902 --> 01:18:51,914
now that I'm at Lamont and Company.

1836
01:18:51,934 --> 01:18:53,592
- Oh, that's nice of you.
- Yeah.

1837
01:18:53,612 --> 01:18:56,029
Well, I enjoyed working here.

1838
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:59,566
Hey, how was your father's wedding?

1839
01:18:59,586 --> 01:19:00,715
Oh, it's this Sunday.

1840
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:01,548
It hasn't happened yet.

1841
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:02,382
Oh, okay.

1842
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:03,646
Well, he must be very excited.

1843
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:04,833
Yeah, he is.

1844
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:08,853
You know, he was kinda hoping

1845
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:11,444
that you were gonna be my date.

1846
01:19:11,464 --> 01:19:14,515
Oh, that's very sweet of him.

1847
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:16,094
Do you want to come to
the wedding with me, Susan?

1848
01:19:16,114 --> 01:19:17,366
I can't, no.

1849
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:18,825
Susan, you were there when he was alone,

1850
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:20,105
you were there when he told everybody-

1851
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,105
- I'm sorry, Robert.

1852
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,125
No, I can't.

1853
01:19:23,144 --> 01:19:25,045
You know, I wish that
we were meeting each other

1854
01:19:25,065 --> 01:19:27,865
today for the first time.

1855
01:19:27,885 --> 01:19:28,915
Why?

1856
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,326
'Cause things would be different.

1857
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:31,745
Really?

1858
01:19:31,765 --> 01:19:33,774
How can you be so sure about that?

1859
01:19:33,794 --> 01:19:38,275
Because I'm not the same
person anymore, Susan.

1860
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:40,115
You know, you can't wave a magic wand

1861
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:41,646
and expect everything to be okay, Robert.

1862
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,835
It just doesn't work like that.

1863
01:19:42,855 --> 01:19:45,286
We were meant to be together,
and I know it in my heart.

1864
01:19:45,306 --> 01:19:46,120
You're the right girl for me,

1865
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,486
and I'm not gonna let you go that easy.

1866
01:19:49,506 --> 01:19:50,320
But-

1867
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,115
- Just meet me at my father's on Sunday.

1868
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:53,949
Don't do this, Robert.

1869
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:55,218
Sunday, noon.

1870
01:19:56,055 --> 01:19:59,055
I'm not leaving until you get there.

1871
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:02,499
(Robert knocks)

1872
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:04,985
Come on, Pop, come out!

1873
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:07,075
The anticipation is killing me.

1874
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:08,275
[Frank] I can't open the door.

1875
01:20:08,295 --> 01:20:09,955
Open the...

1876
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:12,465
Slide the thing, push the thing.

1877
01:20:12,485 --> 01:20:13,806
Oh, boy.

1878
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:14,695
Whoa!

1879
01:20:14,715 --> 01:20:16,366
Funny lock on there.

1880
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:17,719
Very handsome.

1881
01:20:18,805 --> 01:20:19,865
Very nice.

1882
01:20:19,885 --> 01:20:20,814
Good, thanks.

1883
01:20:20,834 --> 01:20:21,775
You look handsome.

1884
01:20:21,795 --> 01:20:22,806
Yeah, sure.

1885
01:20:22,826 --> 01:20:23,826
You do.

1886
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:26,604
Very good.

1887
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,754
Hey, listen, I've been
thinking about it, Pop,

1888
01:20:27,774 --> 01:20:29,974
I want to buy that house from you.

1889
01:20:29,994 --> 01:20:30,854
What house?

1890
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:31,687
Your house!

1891
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:32,707
Our house.

1892
01:20:33,415 --> 01:20:34,754
What are you gonna do with a house?

1893
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:36,166
Well, why should other
people have the house?

1894
01:20:36,186 --> 01:20:38,806
You're gonna sell it, I want to buy it.

1895
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:40,993
Think about it, will ya?

1896
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:47,546
I bought the house for
$12,000, 30 years ago,

1897
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:49,868
from a Mrs. Wanaburg.

1898
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:50,887
She was a widow,

1899
01:20:50,907 --> 01:20:54,625
and she wanted to move
in with her daughter.

1900
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:57,447
And now you want to buy
the house away from me.

1901
01:20:57,467 --> 01:20:58,465
Now, what are you gonna do,

1902
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:00,505
come home every night alone with a house?

1903
01:21:00,525 --> 01:21:03,886
You don't need a house for that, you know.

1904
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:05,127
Sit down.

1905
01:21:05,147 --> 01:21:08,257
You gotta stop comparing your life to mine.

1906
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:09,497
I don't do that.

1907
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:11,367
Oh, the hell you aren't.

1908
01:21:11,387 --> 01:21:14,476
I made peace with my life a long time ago,

1909
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,163
and you better do the same soon.

1910
01:21:21,837 --> 01:21:23,967
I know, I used to watch you and mom

1911
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:27,218
watching TV night, after
night, after night.

1912
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:29,869
I thought that's what
marriage was all about.

1913
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:30,972
It scared me.

1914
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:37,847
What I didn't realize
was, seeing contentment,

1915
01:21:37,867 --> 01:21:39,534
that you were happy.

1916
01:21:40,977 --> 01:21:42,927
Sorry for judging your life, Pop.

1917
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:46,287
It's okay, it's what a kid does.

1918
01:21:46,307 --> 01:21:49,538
Let's not forget this day, okay?

1919
01:21:49,558 --> 01:21:50,558
All right.

1920
01:21:55,398 --> 01:21:56,597
Let's go in.

1921
01:21:56,617 --> 01:21:59,700
(lighthearted music)

1922
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:14,025
What do you think, huh?

1923
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:16,716
Oh, Mommy, you look beautiful.

1924
01:22:16,736 --> 01:22:17,549
You think so?

1925
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:18,508
I have something for you.

1926
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:20,428
Something old.

1927
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:21,448
Oh, baby!

1928
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:23,567
Aw!

1929
01:22:25,384 --> 01:22:28,613
Have I told you lately how much I love you?

1930
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:30,050
I love you too.

1931
01:22:31,703 --> 01:22:36,703
(car honks)
(whimsical music)

1932
01:22:38,014 --> 01:22:39,366
Oh!

1933
01:22:39,386 --> 01:22:42,219
(whimsical music)

1934
01:22:50,754 --> 01:22:53,087
(dog barks)

1935
01:22:55,853 --> 01:22:56,667
Pop!

1936
01:22:56,687 --> 01:22:58,414
Hey, what happened to 11 o'clock?

1937
01:22:58,434 --> 01:22:59,764
Oh, I'm sorry.

1938
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:02,145
I can't seem to get it together today.

1939
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:03,324
How you doin', you all right?

1940
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:04,705
[Frank] Yeah, sure.

1941
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:05,945
Where's Florence?

1942
01:23:05,965 --> 01:23:08,345
Florence spent the night at her house.

1943
01:23:08,365 --> 01:23:10,553
We thought it right to
spend the night apart

1944
01:23:10,573 --> 01:23:12,763
before the wedding.

1945
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:14,366
It's a good idea.

1946
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,004
How we doin' on time?

1947
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,873
Not very good.

1948
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,151
I figured you might be late,

1949
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:24,088
so I asked Florence to
swing by and pick me up.

1950
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:29,093
Oh, Steven and James are
gonna meet us at the church.

1951
01:23:29,113 --> 01:23:31,884
Listen, when I move to Rosedale,

1952
01:23:31,904 --> 01:23:33,759
you're gonna come and visit me, aren't you?

1953
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:35,524
Of course.

1954
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:36,717
You know, with those other two,

1955
01:23:36,737 --> 01:23:38,475
you never know what's happening.

1956
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:39,816
They live a couple of blocks away

1957
01:23:39,836 --> 01:23:41,677
and I never see them.

1958
01:23:41,697 --> 01:23:44,065
I'll be there, Dad, don't worry about it.

1959
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:44,899
Where's your boutonnière?

1960
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:45,947
You got your boutonnière?

1961
01:23:45,967 --> 01:23:46,836
The what?

1962
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:47,670
The bouton...

1963
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,203
The flower.

1964
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:50,223
Oh.

1965
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,067
You got a flower?

1966
01:23:52,087 --> 01:23:53,347
Here, hold on.

1967
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:54,696
You got one for me?

1968
01:23:54,716 --> 01:23:55,716
Yeah.

1969
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:58,115
Let me see, turn around.

1970
01:23:58,135 --> 01:23:59,165
Here.

1971
01:23:59,185 --> 01:24:02,075
You know, I was thinking this morning,

1972
01:24:02,095 --> 01:24:03,755
if your mother hadn't gotten sick,

1973
01:24:03,775 --> 01:24:06,624
I wouldn't have to worry
about any of this stuff.

1974
01:24:06,644 --> 01:24:09,304
Yeah, well, it happened, Pop.

1975
01:24:09,324 --> 01:24:12,195
You can't go through life alone, you know?

1976
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:13,355
When I think about that,

1977
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:15,125
I always feel better.

1978
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,776
You amaze me, Dad.

1979
01:24:18,796 --> 01:24:21,605
Everybody's gotta be some place.

1980
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,575
(Frank chuckles)

1981
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:25,085
Hey.

1982
01:24:25,105 --> 01:24:26,188
There she is.

1983
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,145
Look at her.

1984
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,164
Huh?

1985
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:32,298
Let's go get her.

1986
01:24:40,147 --> 01:24:42,647
There she is, my future bride.

1987
01:24:44,206 --> 01:24:47,919
Isn't she the prettiest girl in the world?

1988
01:24:47,939 --> 01:24:49,189
Hi, handsome.

1989
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:51,919
You nervous?

1990
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:52,880
Yeah.

1991
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,308
So am I.

1992
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:56,148
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

1993
01:24:56,168 --> 01:24:57,168
So am I.

1994
01:24:59,619 --> 01:25:00,432
Hi, Florence.

1995
01:25:00,452 --> 01:25:01,400
Hi, Robert.

1996
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,967
You look beautiful.

1997
01:25:02,987 --> 01:25:06,938
Listen, I just want to tell
you that I'm a lucky guy.

1998
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:09,317
I've had my parents in
my life most of my life,

1999
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:10,937
and so I'm a little protective of them,

2000
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:13,486
and especially my mother's memory.

2001
01:25:13,506 --> 01:25:16,845
So, I want to say that I'm sorry.

2002
01:25:16,865 --> 01:25:19,429
I want to say I'm sorry if
I've said anything stupid,

2003
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:21,532
'cause I know I have, so.

2004
01:25:22,564 --> 01:25:24,106
Oh!

2005
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:26,026
Oh, thank you, Robert.

2006
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:27,046
Thank you.

2007
01:25:30,315 --> 01:25:33,717
Oh, honey, just remember that life...

2008
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:36,384
Life isn't about losing people,

2009
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:38,245
it's about loving them when they're here

2010
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:41,626
and cherishing them when they're gone.

2011
01:25:41,646 --> 01:25:42,815
Right.

2012
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:44,418
Let's go lock up.

2013
01:25:46,425 --> 01:25:48,685
You look terrible.

2014
01:25:48,705 --> 01:25:51,122
I'm getting married, not you!

2015
01:25:52,884 --> 01:25:56,865
I just have to powder my nose real quick.

2016
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:57,699
All right.

2017
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,468
Hurry up, sweetheart.

2018
01:26:03,345 --> 01:26:04,305
You okay?

2019
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,574
[Robert] Mhm.

2020
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:09,755
You know, you're a good looking guy,

2021
01:26:09,775 --> 01:26:14,395
you make good money, people
respect you at your job.

2022
01:26:14,415 --> 01:26:17,515
But you're the most insecure,
confused wreck of a man

2023
01:26:17,535 --> 01:26:20,535
I've seen in 25, maybe 30,000 years.

2024
01:26:21,804 --> 01:26:23,554
You sure you're okay?

2025
01:26:24,533 --> 01:26:26,373
Yeah, I'm okay.

2026
01:26:26,393 --> 01:26:27,795
Good.

2027
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:28,982
You know what?

2028
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,893
Your old man is starting
over, wish him luck.

2029
01:26:37,538 --> 01:26:38,955
Good luck, Pop.

2030
01:26:42,629 --> 01:26:43,964
Okay.

2031
01:26:43,984 --> 01:26:45,158
Okay, come on, boys.

2032
01:26:45,178 --> 01:26:46,904
Come on, let's go.

2033
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:48,849
I'll meet you guys there.

2034
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:49,918
Come on, come on!

2035
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:53,623
All right, you're the best man, lock up.

2036
01:26:53,643 --> 01:26:54,976
See you there!

2037
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,107
I think the whole neighborhood is jealous.

2038
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:01,558
First I get a new car,

2039
01:27:01,578 --> 01:27:03,537
and then I find somebody.

2040
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:05,907
Even that Peprocki over there.

2041
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:09,307
I let him park in my spot, just once.

2042
01:27:09,327 --> 01:27:11,994
Live and let live, I always say.

2043
01:27:13,273 --> 01:27:14,087
Thank you!

2044
01:27:14,107 --> 01:27:15,493
Yeah, yeah, thanks a lot.

2045
01:27:15,513 --> 01:27:16,846
Good luck to ya.

2046
01:27:42,051 --> 01:27:45,134
(lighthearted music)

2047
01:27:46,891 --> 01:27:48,224
Am I too late?

2048
01:27:51,071 --> 01:27:52,071
No.

2049
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:55,591
No, you're just in time.

2050
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,303
Well, I thought about it.

2051
01:27:57,323 --> 01:28:00,423
I wouldn't miss your father's
wedding for the world.

2052
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:02,783
And it would be nice to spend

2053
01:28:02,803 --> 01:28:04,720
the afternoon with you.

2054
01:28:06,003 --> 01:28:09,962
But hurry up, I think
I took somebody's spot.

2055
01:28:09,982 --> 01:28:12,399
I just gotta lock up first.

2056
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,889
Where are my keys?

2057
01:28:17,733 --> 01:28:19,393
They were in the door.

2058
01:28:19,413 --> 01:28:22,496
(lighthearted music)

2059
01:28:30,462 --> 01:28:31,833
Let's get outta here.

2060
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:34,186
Pop's getting married today.

2061
01:28:38,302 --> 01:28:41,552
(upbeat wedding music)

2062
01:29:26,811 --> 01:29:30,311
(lighthearted jazz music)

2063
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:23,242
(Multicom jingle)
