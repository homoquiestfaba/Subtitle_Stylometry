1
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>The unobserved state
is a fog of probabilities...</i>

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,580
<i>a window of and for error.</i>

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,290
<i>The watcher observes.</i>

4
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,590
<i>The fog collapses.</i>

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,760
<i>An event resolves.</i>

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,090
<i>A theory becomes a fact.</i>

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,940
<i>What is the truth?</i>

8
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,230
<i>Tell me if you know,
and I will not believe you.</i>

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,230
<i>Things are never what they seem.</i>

10
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,780
<i>Clean gloves hide dirty hands...</i>

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,660
<i>and mine are dirtier than most.</i>

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,910
<i>Without truth, there can be no justice.</i>

13
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,370
Justice will be done.

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,350
Illuminating sentiments,
Chairman Goodchild.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,520
So what about justice for Clavius?

16
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,820
It's now been six months since
the abduction of our elected president.

17
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,530
Justice for Clavius.

18
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>Justice for all of us.
There can be no more secrets.</i>

19
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,330
<i>That's what I'm trying to tell you.</i>

20
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,290
And what are your secrets, Chairman?

21
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,580
I have nothing to hide.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>From now on, I will hide nothing.</i>

23
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,010
<i>Only an open society
can be a just society.</i>

24
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,260
Most revealing. Very impressive.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,010
You've made your point.

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,350
Now, where is President Clavius?

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,140
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,520
We must wait for the terrorists
to make their move.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,480
So you've little hope.

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,900
I fear he may be dead.

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,190
How interesting.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,150
Perhaps, then, you can explain
this video reel we obtained...

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,860
from your own security force.

34
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,540
Clavius!

35
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,990
He's alive!

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>Don't you know a tape like that
can be faked?</i>

37
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,210
<i>By showing it, you are
playing into the hands of our enemies.</i>

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,930
<i>Many people hate you
and would like to see you dead.</i>

39
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,140
How does that make you feel?

40
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,230
Those people
should get to know me a little better.

41
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,320
Then they'd know
I don't indulge in feelings.

42
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,890
<i>See it, my friends, and embrace it.</i>

43
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,930
<i>Embrace the new openness.</i>

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,600
<i>Nothing is sacred. Nothing is secret.</i>

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Chairman Goodchild.

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
Gildemere, please.

47
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,970
We're doing what we can about Clavius.
Stop pestering me.

48
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,300
You saw the attack on me today.

49
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,010
Those people are maniacs
and cannot be trusted.

50
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes, we must be careful whom we trust.

51
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,630
You've served me well today,
and now I must serve you.

52
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,420
I owe you very much, Clavius.

53
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,430
You have given me
the way to Aeon Flux...

54
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,430
and I will give her freedom.
True freedom.

55
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,230
Freedom from prying eyes
and expectations.

56
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,530
A private place.

57
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,040
A place of our own.

58
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,890
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

59
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,730
We're being watched.

60
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,860
My name is Aeon Flux.

61
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,860
I'm here on a mission
to assassinate Trevor Goodchild.

62
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,740
<i>Is everybody listening?
Do you believe me?</i>

63
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,490
Everybody happy now?

64
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,910
You're crazy.
You can't kill Chairman Goodchild.

65
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,240
He's our most beloved
and trusted leader.

66
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,250
You don't need to kill him.
Clavius is alive.

67
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,800
I know Chairman Goodchild
came to power by illegitimate means.

68
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,590
We can bring him down.

69
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,300
Put your hand there, and press down.

70
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,430
What?

71
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,050
Is this okay?

72
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,390
Harder.

73
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,470
Do you have any proof?

74
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,480
Proof? Of course.
I've tailed him for months.

75
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,650
Clavius wasn't kidnapped.
At least, not by terrorists.

76
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,440
Don't waste my time.

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,730
No, wait.

78
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,690
I do have proof.

79
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm sure this is very significant.

80
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,450
- Can I borrow this?
- Well...

81
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,950
- Can I borrow the fabric?
- Lf you'll help me.

82
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,250
You're going to like my help.

83
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,460
<i>Sir, I think you better see this.</i>

84
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,550
I think they're having fun
at our expense, soldier.

85
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,970
Let it go.

86
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,180
What is this?

87
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,970
Look, let's not even bother
with those idiots.

88
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,970
Just show me some action.

89
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,270
Going somewhere?
Vacation for 10 years?

90
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,060
Counsellor Gaylen...

91
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,400
you know the rules.

92
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,900
Total information awareness,
equal opportunity enforcement.

93
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,370
We are not losing anything...

94
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,030
but shame, inhibition...

95
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,790
perversion, depravity...

96
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,330
degeneracy...

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,530
You're late.

98
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,950
The patient is in the eleventh hour
of surgery.

99
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,500
We'll have to go in, close the vessels.

100
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,750
Removal could get messy.

101
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
<i>Naturally, the removal.</i>

102
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,550
Yes, excision of the tumour...

103
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,470
<i>Must proceed, and my skills...</i>

104
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,010
<i>Will be...</i>

105
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,140
<i>You have a certain bedside manner...</i>

106
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,060
<i>with the... The tumour.</i>

107
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,390
I see.

108
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,070
In other words,
we must remove the patient...

109
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,690
from the tumour.

110
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,240
And restore function to the organ.

111
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm a tumour now?

112
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,740
Stop pretending.
I know you're coming after me.

113
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Come on. Look at me, Aeon.

114
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,090
What?

115
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,280
What?

116
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,050
You are alive.

117
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,720
Clavius?

118
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,850
My God,
what's that bastard done to you?

119
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,280
Stay calm.

120
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,030
I'll be back.

121
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,430
- What are you doing here?
- I found Clavius.

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,220
- He's free?
- No.

123
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,770
I couldn't.

124
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,900
Listen, I think I'm being watched.

125
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,230
You don't miss a trick.

126
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,230
There are things I have to do.
Keep this safe here.

127
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,900
- What is it?
- Evidence.

128
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,740
Trevor is more dangerous
than I'd realised.

129
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,990
What he's done to Clavius
is beyond treason.

130
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,370
He's being kept in a chamber
under Trevor's bed.

131
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm going to release him.
I think we've done it, Aeon.

132
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,470
Think of it as a challenge.

133
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,390
I must go. We'll be together soon.

134
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,320
Well, Trevor, what do you...

135
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,470
- Well, how do you like it?
- What a dress.

136
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,020
I'm sure it looks good on you.

137
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,520
You shouldn't leave that thing
lying around.

138
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,520
Never know who might end up with it.

139
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,820
You don't know
what you're meddling with here.

140
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,400
You have no idea what this is all about.

141
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,360
I sure don't.

142
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,120
I thought you had an operation here.

143
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,280
I thought you were
getting some work done.

144
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,450
Where is the smoke-filled room?

145
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,710
Where are the sleazy characters?

146
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Where are the window dressers?

147
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,790
You don't like it, do you?

148
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm just trying to survive, unlike you.

149
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,590
For example, Gildemere.
I can't see what you're doing there.

150
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,890
He's a bad accident waiting to happen.

151
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,300
Gildemere?

152
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes.

153
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,220
Tell me about our friend, Gildemere.

154
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,560
Do you have a tip for me?
Maybe some spare change...

155
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,110
something about
this plot to take me down.

156
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,570
When will you give up, Aeon?

157
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,070
Here.

158
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,240
Go ahead.

159
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Kill me if that's what you want.

160
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,410
You can't do it.

161
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,160
You think you know what I'm doing,
so obviously you don't.

162
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,130
What I have in mind for you
is much worse.

163
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,080
Are you all right?

164
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,500
I want out.

165
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,300
I want out.

166
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,260
What's been through you, sir?
I mean, what have you been through?

167
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,510
How long have I been...

168
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
192 days, sir.

169
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,190
The wide acceptance
of the new openness...

170
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,860
has no doubt exceeded
even your highest expectations...

171
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,860
Chairman Goodchild. Congratulations.

172
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,320
So why doesn't this new openness
apply to the Clavius case?

173
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,620
<i>We will relay any information
as soon as it comes in.</i>

174
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,370
Unfortunately, there isn't any.

175
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,290
Paisuck, Andrus, Turkalou!
Who did this?

176
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,500
They've rounded up the whole network...

177
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,420
and you stood by and let this happen.

178
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,590
These citizens
must be released at once.

179
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,590
Cellblock X-7?

180
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,100
These are drug traffickers,
wet-workers, defrauders.

181
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,220
Are you certain?

182
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:34,600
By locking them up, Trevor has
shut down our base of credit, you fool.

183
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,150
These men are my special friends.

184
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,020
Why is it so hot in here?

185
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm staggered by the complexity
of these documents, sir.

186
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,740
I've spent many hours
trying to crack the codes.

187
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,530
What didn't you understand?

188
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,240
I think I have a handle on some of it.
For example, the "mile-high jellyfish"...

189
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,250
that's the upper house of parliament.
Am I right?

190
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,500
No.

191
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,340
And the "flying saucer men,"
that's the Ministry of Justice?

192
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,420
No, the flying saucer men
are the flying saucer men.

193
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,670
Narzak.

194
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,930
Area 66. The global empire.

195
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,970
What level are you?

196
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,350
We're men of peace, so we attack.

197
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,560
Deploy the orbital jellyfish.
Next, expulsion of all foreign particles.

198
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,690
You're mad. You're insane.

199
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,610
Shut up, mother.

200
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,080
I don't know...

201
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,550
But at least you must have some idea
where they're hiding Clavius.

202
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,640
No!

203
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,550
Actually, you're right.

204
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,850
What are we doing here?
We have the leads.

205
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,890
All security forces
are to convene in Y-Section.

206
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,900
I wonder where Trevor would be if not
for true patriots like you, Gildemere.

207
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,070
But you wanted Trevor dead.

208
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,360
Did I?

209
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,580
You knew Clavius was insane.

210
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,160
You're hurting my hand.

211
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,870
Normally I like that...

212
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,290
but, in this case,
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

213
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,590
Goodbye.

214
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,840
Goodbye?

215
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,720
Goodbye?

216
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,140
Goodbye.

217
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,160
Stop.

218
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,830
No.

219
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,040
Not now.

220
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,260
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

221
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,090
I'm in control now.

222
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,840
Clavius is dead, and you're the terrorist.

223
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,800
Aeon, you're mine.

224
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,180
But...

225
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,310
She's got Clavius.

226
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,860
It looks like we've caught our terrorist.

227
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,730
<i>A Monican agent.</i>

228
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,030
Uncover the body.

229
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,950
Whatever.

230
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,330
Who's that?

231
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,380
Trevor Goodchild is guilty.
He's the terrorist.

232
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,210
He was propped up
with the help of this Monican traitor.

233
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,050
They kept Clavius locked up...

234
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,970
and this is the proof.
He used this on Clavius.

235
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,350
Follow me.

236
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,930
Follow him.

237
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,770
He knows where Clavius is.
He pulled the plug.

238
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,060
Yes, I pulled the plug.

239
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,610
I did what Trevor couldn't and saved us
from the corruption and madness.

240
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,990
But Trevor Goodchild lied to us,
and now I will show you.

241
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,720
This is your man.

242
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,140
I had the key, and I gave it back to her.

243
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,640
I had the key, and I gave it back to her.
