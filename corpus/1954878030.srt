City officials and community leaders
are encouraged by this sign

As the long wake of violence that has
besieged this city may be coming to an end

He's got this white-ass mutherfucker working for him

54
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,160
So if you're his message boy,
What's his fucken message, boy?

55
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,600
Willie thinks that the fighting between the Lords
and the Blades is a contributing factor

56
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,450
to the breakdown of the moral fiber
in this neighborhood

57
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,540
All he is saying is

58
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,690
Give peace a chance

The perfect end to a glorious day

63
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,570
This will end all talk of a gang truce
and keep our friends in the Dept busy

64
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,770
We lost 'im

65
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,960

67
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,430
I thought you said there was a truce

68
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,050
Truce my ass. Its blacks vs latinos

69
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
It's the same old shit, it ain't never gonna end.

70
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,790
- Well, it's about time that it does end
-- What can you do?

71
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,790
What do you mean, you?

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,320
WE are gonna shake down every
gang member in this neighborhood

73
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,950
I don't want a fucken war breaking out,
Do you understand?

74
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,680
We throw a net around the whole area

75
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,380
And you will make sure there
is no retaliations

76
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,240
Look, it ain't gonna help, Lt.
It's a waste of time.

77
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,350
I grew up in these nighborhoods

78
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,000
One day at a time, Fernandez, huh?
One day at a time.

79
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,510
Lucinda, you're early.
Lunch isn't for another hour

80
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,680
Early for what, I hadn't noticed
-- You know you're a lousy poker player

81
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,610

baked chicken, corn bread, AND apple pie

83
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,570
Now I now I'm in trouble,
what's on your mind Lucinda?

84
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,730
A friend of mine is in trouble.

85
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,250
Her name's Rebeca Sanchz.
I thought maybe you could help her.

86
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,330
What kind of trouble are we talking about here?
-- Car trouble

87
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,450
The only reason why she didn't come here herself
is she's working and her car ain't

88
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,690
I told her I would ask you if would meet with her

89
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,100
and here is her name and number.
You call her now.

90

Eat your lunch

91
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,230
Tell me -- There's nothing. No word on the street,
the kid split, he's gone

92
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,000
We know he hasn't gone to the police
-- Yet

93
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,370
I don't want anything to interfere with our plan.

94
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:15,060
I want a name, I want an address.
And I want the war to begin.

95
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,160
I promise if you're really good, I'll ???
-- Thank you  Here we go, -- Okay

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,710
Well, you have some information for me or not?

99
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,020
I won't know what to tell you until I take a look at it.
You have it parked around here somewhere?

100
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,560
Do I have what parked around here?
-- Your car.

101
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,160
I don't even own a car

102
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,920
What kind of information are you looking for?

103
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,340
About my brother being missing

104
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,640
IDK what you're talking about. Lucinda told me
you were having trouble with your car

105
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,970
I callled Lucinda this morning and she told me that
she knew an ex-cop who might be able to help

106
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,060
Nww I know why I got the apple pie.

107
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,140
Look, IDK anything about your brother and
I don't do police work anymore.

108
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
- I'm sorry
-- No, that's fine

109
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,140
because to tell you the truth I don't
expect much from anyone anyway

110
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,800
fine, well, in that case
I wish you good luck

111
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,460

Carlos, Where is he?

116

I sent him out to do something,
and he never came back -- He's just a kid

117
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,800
What did you get him into?

118
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,210
When he comes back,
you tell him to find me

119
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,160
You leave him alone. He doesn't
want to be part of the Lords

120

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,160
Even his own gang can't find him
-- He's with a gang?

168
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,830
Yes
-- I'm sorry, I can't help you

169
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,210
Oh, you're some hero, aren't you.
A regular knight in shining armor.

170
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,110
No.  I never was.
You'll have to excuse me now.

171
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,730
You got a problem, Fernandez.
I told you no retaliation.

172
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,930
Make the net tighter. I don't want a goddamn cockroach
to get through. Do you understand, huh?

173
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,400
What's up, 8-Ball?
-- this don't make no sense, dawg.

174
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,140
Well, it makes sense to me.  Motherfucken Lords
have been chewing us up and spitting us out, man.

175
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,910
Word is we been taking the heat for them Lords, man

176
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,480
One time they picked us out
cause the man ain't got no proof

177
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,080
Well, I say we take Cisco and the rest of
them bean-eating Mexicans and pop a cap in they ass

178
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,980
Better chill
-- just fuck taking it chill, Eight

179
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,240
them motherfucken Lords been moving in on
all our business G, and we gotta blast them

180
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,560
Fuck that, man. We're moving now

181
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,180
yo, Willie

182
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:33,420
Don't you ever tell me what I gots to do.
You got that motherfucker?

183
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Van a pagar, Pee Wee

184
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,590
Look at what they did to our homie, man

185
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,660
Look at him.  Since you started dealing
with that leva 8-Ball

186
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,610
Our homeboys, been getting smoked

187
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,430
Fuck the dumbshit

188
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,050
I say we hit them now

189
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,300
You know what ese, we gotta do them up

190
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,340
Take out those pinche mayates, before
the pigs take over our streets

191
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,390
Alright, we run deep

192
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,390
We get the rest of the homies

193
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,240
Do it now

194
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,310
Rebeca

195
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,250
Look about that stuff that happened
last night at the garage

196
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm just glad you called

197
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,560
I can't make any promises, but,
come on let's talk

198
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,860
So where're your folks?

199
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,040
They died when Carlos was five, I was eighteen,
so I brought him up

200
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,010
We're all each other has

201
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,120
You always lived in this neighrbood?
Yes, What about you?

202
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,990
Yeah, all my life

203
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,160
That ballfield over there, my Dad used
to take me there every Sunday

204
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,390
A lot of this have changed since then

205
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,870
Well, in this neighborhood, if you were
a boy and wanted to survive

206
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,880
you joined a gang

207
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,170
Carlos used to be beaten up by gangbangers
every day, coming and going to school

208
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,290
They wanted him to join, kept calling him a coward

209
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,770
Becoming a member was the only way he could remain in school

210
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,230
He's in the Westside Latin Lords, isn't he?

211
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,930
Yes
-- Is Carlos still in school now?

212
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,170
Up till this happened he never even
missed a day of homework

213
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,130
He's a great student. Math, Science
He wants to be an astronomer

214
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,320
It's all he ever talks about, as though life here is
so lousy, He wishes he lived on another planet

215
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,860
Yeah, I know how he feels

216
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,890
Barett,

217
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,860
I need to know. Do you think you could help me?

218
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,870
Let me see what I can find out,
Did you bring that picture of Carlos

219
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,990
Yeah

220
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,920
Ok

221
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,360
You wanted to see me?
-- Carlos Sanchez, I need to find him

222
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:39,980
Same here, ese. You're asking for his sister, que no?

223
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,000
She's being looked after

224
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,380
If she prays, I hear about it before god does

225
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,530
What's with all the soldiers?

226
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,700
Three months ago, 8-Ball and I
came together to end the war

227
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,330
Two days ago, I sent four of my homies to talk business

228
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:15,600
and now they're dead.  That same night,
Carlos was there. And now that chavala is missing.

229
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,210
This morning we find Pee-Wee, with fifteen caps up his face

230
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,650
8-Ball wants war, I can have seventy-five hundred
soldiers in one hour

231
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:36,880
The clicks will roll, Barett. The word will get out.
And this hood will be full of homies in no time.

232
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,970
Do you understand, Barett.  And the lives of everybody
in this hood will never be the same.

233
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,970
This city will burn.

234
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,240
Is that what you want, Cisco?

235
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,000
It's what they want, homes

236
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,870
What're you gonna do if you find out Carlos ran?
-- That's not your problem ese

237
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,850
And so, in conclusion, forensics
began as an inexact science.

238
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,640
But has since, used the cutting edge
of bio-medical technology

239
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,340
to provide for the policeman in the field
the greatest amount of information

240
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,470
with the least amount of evidence

241
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,160
So forensics truly is the best thing to being there

242
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,370
Lady, gentlemen, I thank you,  good day

243
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,080
and so, in conclusion, forensics began

244
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,640
Jake,
-- Hi, Ray -- How you doing?

245
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,460
Good to see you again, man
-- You too, my friend

246
00:30:53,560 --> 00:31:00,850
How you feeling? -- Well, truthfully,
Jake, I'm tired and I'm bored

247
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:09,230
How are you? -- I'm good, you know
- Don't you miss active duty, just a little bit?

248
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:16,190
Well, I don't think about it much
-- So, Why you here?

249
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:21,490
I need to see a police report. The one on that
gang shooting the other night. Seventh Street alley.

250
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,360
You know, if I didn't know better, I would think
you're conducting an informal investigation

251
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's see what the machine tells us, let's check it out here.

252
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:40,080
Here we go, we have one dead black youth,
four dead hispanic youths

253
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,920
ballistics match on the one of the hispanic's
youth guns as the gun which killed the black youth

254
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,810
shell casings all over the ground.
Just another hot day in L.A.

255
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:55,440
Now this is odd. According to the report,
one group of shell casings had oil deposits

256
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,640
from where fingers touched them,
- Did they run a make on the prints?

257
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,060
well, that's just it, there was oil,
but no fingerprints

258
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,560
I don't get it, Did anybody investigate this?
-- Well, apparently not

259
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,990
Whose signature is on the report?
-- It says here Lt Bill Crowe

260
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,480
You don't think the Dept is involved, do you?
-- I don't know

261
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:23,290
See what else you can find out for me, if you would,
Hopefully we won't find out any John Does

262
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,290
in the morgue that fits this kid's description

263
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,040
Give me a call later on, will you? -- Ok, will do
- And thanks  -- You got it, Jake

264
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,160
This is going to be an interesting evening

265
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:49,100
Yo, Barett.  Fuck you doing with
them motherfucken Lords, man?

266
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,210
You got five to tell me what's up

267
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,830
Come on, motherfucker, come on.
I'mma cut you bitch

268
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,490
No, noo, nah, man. Don't you even think about it

269
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,390
You 8-Ball?
--  Right

270
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,900
You Barett, huh? One that runs with the kiddies in the hood

271
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,890
Your set put a hit on me. Why?
-- Been hanging with the them Lords, man

272
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,610
An ex-cop ought to know enough to stay out of the gang business
-- Not interested in your gang business

273
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,340
Cisco is ready to go to war. Cause the other
night you called a meeting, and four of his are gone

274
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,100
Now, what's up?

275
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I ain't done nothing

276
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:48,030
I lost one last night, and another one
this morning. So all meetings are over

277
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,180
Somethings not right here. They lost
four and you lost two.

278
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,440
Nobody wants to be responsible.  It's gonna
take some time to figure this one out.

279
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,110
Time..  time is something that we ain'ts gots

280
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:10,080
Heat's on, and we getting burnt
-- Look, you give me two days

281
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:14,670
I think I can get the same thing from Cisco  -- I thinks not

282
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:20,330
You wanted a truce!  Nobody benefits from war, 8-Ball

283
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,530
I'll see what's up

284
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,320
How I look ese, ah? Que paso

285
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,470
Ya lookin good mun

286
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,700
Move fast, we're just taking the automatics

287
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,530
My, my, my. Who do we have here?
-- Alright, let's make it quick

288
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,530
Come on, let's load 'em those up

289
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,800
Franklin, we got two birds perching
-- Copy

290
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,270
Ese man, don't mess with the Westside Latin Lords  -- What?

291
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,100
Hey, fool, what's your problem man.
Get off of me, man

292
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,170
You don't know who you fucking with. My brother Willie's
gonna put a cap all over somebody's ass.

293
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,930
That's I'm counting on

294
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,050
Who's this?
-- Willie, por favor

295
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:33,070
What?
-- Ahorita matamos a tu hermano [ We killed your brother ]

296
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,660
Lo hubiera oir gritar,  Hey Willie, ese,
We just did your brother, ese

297
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,780
You should've hear him scream,,
Pendejo, aay,, Just like a woman

298
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,090
Why did you leave the force, Barrett?
-- That shop I've got used to belong to my Dad

299
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,690
Fixing cars with him, was one
of the best times of my life

300
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,650
You didn't leave the force to fix cars

301
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,540
About three years ago, there was a situation

302
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,710
Some psycho took an eight-year old hostage

303
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,460
When I put my gun down, the son-of-a-bitch killed her

304
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,410
So when I got out of the hospital,
I left the force and came home

305
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,500
All of my life, I've lived scared in these
streets, scared for myself, scared for Carlos.

306
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,150
It's no way to live

307
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,490
And then the President added, with economic
indicators on the rise

308
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,200
even though there were some difficulties ahead,
the country's prognosis is a healthy one

309
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,080
In local news, it looks like the
gang truce is definitely over

310
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,930
Two men were killed last night when a gun
warehouse was robbed in Downtown Los Angeles

311
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,180
One of the men found dead at the scene,
belonged to the South Central Blades gang

312
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:34,030
And according to witnesses, the robbery and murders
were committed by members of the rival gang, the Westside Latin Lords

313
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,750
And in city hall today, Councilwoman Lana Lee
proposed restrictive anti-smoking

314
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:19,260
This is your idea of a truce?

315
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,770
I told you those goddamn mayugos can't be trusted

316
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,370
You're not gonna be happy till you have a fucken war, are ya?

317
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,630
What're you talking about, they just blasted us, Barett!

318
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,780
You hit a wharehouse last night, and you killed a Blade

319
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,950
Why?
-- What're you talking about?

320
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,060
I gave you two days, I haven't touched
those goddamn chanates!

321
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,650
There were witnesses describing..

322
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,050
For the last time, puto. I put this on my mother.
IDK what the fuck you're talking about

323
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,830
But as soon as those pigs go back to Winchell's, it's on

324
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,210
Fuckers are having to learn to respect me, man

325
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:23,000
A gun doesn't get you respect, Willie.
-- Don't front on me man. Them motherfuckers killed my brother

326
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,700
And they fixing to pay, now
-- The Lords didn't kill your brother

327
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,690
You can't stop me, man.  Eight-ball can't stop me.
The man can't stop me.

328
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,790
How're you gonna stop me? -- Listen to me,
you're gonna start a war for no reason

329
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:46,610
Somebody's messing with you and the Lords.
Somebody else killed your brother, Willie

330
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,460
Now, I need a meeting with 8-Ball,
and I need it now.  It's up to you.

331
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,720
Give me a reason to respect you, man

332
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,020
The truck'll be ready tonight?
-- A couple of hoses, new shocks, she'll be ready

333
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,080
We still had no luck finding Sanchez.
But I have feelers out everywhere.

334
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,580
I want double shifts on the streets. And I want
pay-offs made at all the schools and hangouts.

335
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:35,020
I want every rock turned over, and every door kicked in.
I want Carlos Sanchez.

336
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,170
We still have a problem. -- A problem?
-- A guy named Barrett

337
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,900
Willie was supposed to take out Cisco, but,
Barett stepped in and stopped it

338
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,680
Word is, this guy Barett is an ex-cop

339
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,130
Jake Barrett ?
-- Right  -- You know him

340
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:01,260
I know of him. Graduated Stanford, the top of his class.
He's a highly decorated cop

341
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,380
He even got the Mayor's Commendation award the same year I did.
But now, he's dysfunctional

342
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,440
kid was killed in an incident,
he felt guilty. He quit the force

343
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,410
Now he's wasting his life,
doing penance for kids on the streets

344
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
But he's part of the equation I didn't count on

345
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,000
(John) Kane, (Charles) Lovinger, take care of him.
Make it look like a gang hit

346
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,670
Hello -- Hi, it's me. I was
thinking about what you asked for

347
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,800
Something about Carlos and IDK
if this means anything but

348
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,650
something Carlos always used to
say to me was, "Esta en paz"

349
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,970
He found peace with the stars.
He was always looking to the heavens

350
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,660
We'll find him, Rebecca. -- I, I just wish
there was something more I could do

351
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,840
I'll call you back later, okay?

352
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:41,070
Yeah? -- Go downstairs to your garage, now. Don't ask any questions,
I'll be there in about ten minutes -- Jake?

353
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,000
We'll, what a pleasant surprise
-- There's another one in the back seat

354
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,360
Remember those shell casings?  -- Yeah
-- oil, no fingerprints.  Here's why, look at this they used acid to remove them

355
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:13,930
and this guy dyes his hair, he's wearing colored contact lenses.

356
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,340
these guys went through a lot of trouble to hide their identities

357
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:23,700
They tried to kill me tonight. They're professionals.
I need to know who they are, Ray

358
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:31,550
Well, this guy's had major surgery.  That's a start.

359
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,980
Look, I need to keep this between you and I, know what I'm saying?
-- Hey, I'm up for this, I'm in.

360
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,010
So what're you gonna do?

361
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,120
Are you okay?  --  Yeah

362
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,140
I need to find Carlos Sanchez.
He's the missing piece

363
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,620
How many guards in Section C and D?
-- In section C, only one, we terminate

364
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:03,560
there's an add'l maintenance man ten yards past the freight elevator,
it'll be closing time, so he won't be too alert, we terminate

365
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:10,650
We follow the ramp 12.3 yards until we hit Section D.
We can expect no more than three guards, we terminate

366
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,420
That's it

367
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,420
A few more jobs like this and we can retire
-- And you thought working for the Dept was fun?

368
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:22,980
We lost five years in prison, I can't wait to see this city in ashes

369
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,280
Believe me, the crescendo will soon be heard.
It'll burn, it will burn good

370
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,650
Kane and Levinger still haven't checked in
-- Has Barett's body been discovered yet?  -- Nothing on the scanner

371
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:42,990
Barrett 's dropped out of sight  -- Appears Barrett
is functional again  -- Maybe he just got lucky

372
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,070
I don't believe in luck.  We will take of Barrett in a different way

373
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,970
I just got off the phone with Barrett,
somebody tried to kill 'im last night

374
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:09,560
He wants to have a meeting with me, right away.
-- Where at?  -- Spanky's

375
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,410
You sure on that, chief?  -- He's down

376
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:23,360
Barrett's crazy, but he ain't no fool. Besides,
he actually may do something that saves us a lot of time

377
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,410
Ah, haa, now we're getting somewhere.

378
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:18,700
Remember, once inside the safe, he'll have
two-and-a-half minutes. -- What if it's closed?

379
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:24,180
If the safe is closed, I'll be inside in four minutes
-- It's too long, make sure it stays open

380
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:42,140
Eight-Ball in the side pocket  -- Thousand dollars
Barrett's off'd by sunrise  -- Tap's been activated

381
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:49,710
This is Barrett Auto Body, I can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you

382
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:57,180
Hey, Jake. Jake, you there? It's Ray  -- Damn  -- Listen I ID'd one of our friends

383
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:03,560
So get back to me soon as you can, Ok  -- Ray, Ray, it's me, what do you got? -- Are you ready for this?

384
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,450
The guy had a plastic heart valve, it's French made.
Only two places in the country you can get 'em.

385
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,180
Now, I was able to ID him through his blood type and X-rays
-- Alright, where should we meet?

386
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,470
Listen, meet me in the alley at 8th and Atlantic, okay.
One more thing, your hunch was right, my friend

387
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:21,360
What? cops?
-- I'll tell you about it when I see you

388
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,640
You will never meet Barrett

389
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,610
Hey, Raymond

390
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,160
Ray!

391
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,720
Jake... my pocket

392
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,460
Ok, Ray, I got it

393
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,050
Now it's my turn

394
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,960
Let's get the fuck out of here --  Move it
- You honky, motherfucker

395
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:32,700
Hello  -- It's Jake Barrett
- Hey, Jake, How you been?

396
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,900
It's been a long time, huh?
-- What the hell is going on, Crowe?

397
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,870
well, there's been a murder, you've been ID'd
as the shooter -- Who's been murdered?

398
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:45,150
a gang member, named 8-Ball.  Listen Jake, why don't we sit down huh?

399
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,150
We'll meet, talk this over, see what's going on

400
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,080
Sorry, I'm not up for conversation right now Crowe
-- Jake this is serious

401
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:57,040
yeah, I know. And don't bother tracing the call
-- Jake? Jake!

402
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,530
Get 'im!

403
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,660
Yes  -- No luck on Carlos,
but we found his sister

404
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,400
I just need an address
-- 1824 Delaney, we'll pick her up

405
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,410
No, no, no. I'll handle this myself

406
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:08,830
Excuse me, -- Yeah
-- You seen this kid around here?

407
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,000
It's okay, I'm a cop
-- Yeah, I know where he is

408
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:28,580
Ms Sanchez?  -- Yes  -- I'm officer Green,
I gotta talk with you  -- About what?

409
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:36,250
It's about Jake Barrett. We used to work together,
not too far from here. I need to talk to him.

410
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:41,500
Try directory assistance
-- Yeah, Jake told me about you

411
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:48,100
He said you're someone who can be trusted.  The Dept is looking for Jake,
they have this crazy idea that

412
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:54,850
crazy idea that he's involved in the murder of a gang member.
He's in trouble, I've gotta warn him

413
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,390
What is your badge number, Officer Green?

414
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,800
3-5-6-2

415
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,820
Charlotte, easy!

416
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:21,450
Thank you 
-- I got two of my own, Jake also likes kids

417
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:29,960
They say the motive for the murder was Jake was
trying to get information on a missing boy... your brother

418
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,540
I'm very sorry to upset you

419
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,060
Officer Green, he called me this morning

420
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,540
He went to Griffith Park

421
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,240
Charlotte, where's Rebecca?

422
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,180
Carlos?  My name is Jake Barrett.
I'm a friend of your sister's.

423
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,690
I'm here to help you

424
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,790
I'm not here to hurt you, Carlos.

425
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:01,490
I'm gonna put my gun down, okay?

426
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,340
You,, you don' know my sister!  -- Yes, I do
-- You don't know my sister!

427
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:18,980
That's how I knew you were here, estar en paz

428
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,710
I know something terrible happened that night,
I'll take care of it

429
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:36,850
You don't have to be afraid anymore, Carlos
-- I'm tired

430
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
I don't want to be running no more

431
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,540
You and me both

432
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,410
Officer,

433
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,140
Not again

434
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,900
I was scared, man

435
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,370
He was killing everybody,
I didn't know what to do

436
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:07,640
You think you can identify him?
-- I'll never forget his face, man

437
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,330
The look in his eyes... he wanted me dead

438
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,780
The problem is, I can't go back

439
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,880
See, I didn't do anything, I didn't help my homeboys.
I ran. They're going to kill me.

440
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,360
Not when they hear the truth, Carlos.
That there was nothing that you could've done

441
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,860
So we have something in common.
I've been through this before.

442
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,240
We're not goint to have to run anymore

443
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,220
It's this shack, let's check it out

444
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:48,770
You usually hear cars around here -- No never.  The cops
only come around at night, to check things out

445
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,770
I need you to hang tough.
Try to get us out of here

446
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,600
This way

447
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,260
We've sighted the target, we're in pursuit
-- Come on

448
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,950
There!

449
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,970
Faster, faster, come on!

450
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,900
get up, man

451
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,200
yeah, alright!

452
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,690
Hello? - Lucinda, it's Jake
-- Rebecca is gone

453
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:42,530
What do you mean, she's gone? -- IDK, I thought it was the police

454
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,860
but when I called them,
they didn't know nothing about it

455
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,730
then I got a call from someone who says he wants you

456
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,530
to bring Carlos down to the
train yard tonight at nine, alone

457
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,280
And then work out a deal, What're you gonna do, baby?

458
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,690
Whatever it takes

459
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,870
John Cain, ahh, the guy with the artificial heart

460
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,430
Joined the LAPD in '78, convicted of corruption and brutality

461
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,160

Charles Levinger, Harvery Cruise,

463
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,420
Holy shit,  James Franklin

Infiltrated gang activity, in secret...

467
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:51,250
ahh, wait.  That's him, that's the
one I saw in the alley.  -- Are you sure?

468
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,240
Like I said, I'm never gonna forget that face, yeah, I'm sure

469
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,060
okay, Raymond.  Where can I find him?

470
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,580
I want you to stay here, tonight.  I've got
some stuff I gotta take care of

471
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,750
They've got my sister, don't they?

472
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,860
Yeah, they got her

473
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:32,210
They want me to take you to the train yard tonight
-- Then, I'm coming with you  --- No, you're not

474
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,510
They'll kill you on sight -- What about my sister?
-- She's safer without you there

475
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,710
She's the bait.  Unless they find you, she's safe

476
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,820
But I can't just...  -- Look, I don't
have time to argue with you

477
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,540
about this.  Emilio is waiting

478
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:48,660
Look, he understands everything.
I need you to stay here tonight

479
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:57,500
Alright  - Hey
-- Don't worry,  I'll handle it

480
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,650
You like my sister?

481
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,310
Yeah, sure, I like your sister.
-- You wanna know something man?

482
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,910
What? -- You're not good enough for her

483
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,810
He's probably right

484
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,570
This is your room.  This used to be my
son's room before he got married

485
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,080
Mi casa es tu casa

486
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,570
Thanks

487
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,040
All secure

488
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,030
Roger, we're proceeding as planned.
We're on our way

489
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,960
Tunnels..

490
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,790
Vaults...

491
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,100
Hey, Barrett

492
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,380
I've been waiting for this

493
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,860
Where is she?

494
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,340
Where is she?!

495
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,530
You're not that big, Think about it

496
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,870
Fuck you!

497
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,870

Put him in the van

503
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,010
Clear!

504
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:54,020
Hey, Lt., you just got a call about a 211 in progress
at Alameda Mall (?)  -- Who made the call?

505
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,730
Jake Barrett

506
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,510
Come on, let's take a ride

507
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:12,240
Everybody eyes on the floor, and you will not be harmed

508
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,820
Silence!  Do not move, and you will not be harmed!

509
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:34,530
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

510
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,450
Bingo!

511
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:56,930
Stauts?
-- All clear

512
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,690
Time!

513
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:10,830
20 seconds to the elevator

514
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:18,000
Let the fat lady sing

515
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,890
Let's go!

516
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,740
Move it!

517
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,690
That's it, back it up, back it up, facing the wall

518
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,260
Excuse me, one second
--  Yeah?

519
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:17,570
Would you make sure that Lt. Crowe gets this please?
-- Yeah, sure  -- Thank you

520
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,450
He's alone, he didn't bring the kid
-- That was to be expected

521
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,320
We'll use the girl to smoke out her brother

522
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,320
Take him out,  Barrett(?)

523
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:55,980
Guys

524
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:45,410
Very slowly, toss the gun away

525
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,110
One time,  Where is she?

526
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,810
Think about it

527
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,020
Hey Barrett, you should've brought the kid!

528
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,840
hah shit!

529
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,070
You've been setting us up all along, man

530
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,470
My brother ain't coming home again

531
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,240
He's fucken finished

532
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:51,250
Let's get them other motherfuckers

533
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,780
That was for Jesus, and my homies

534
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,500
A familiar situation, ay Barrett?

535
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,280
Let her go.

536
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,540
You know the routine, Barrett

537
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,860
Put down the gun..., and I'll let her live

538
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,460
Put down the fucken gun

539
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:13,140
Loose it

540
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,700
You never could make the right decision

541
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,640
Wait, wait... we're not clear.. wait

542
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:56,220
It ends tonight, Barrett!

543
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,090
You wouldn't shoot a man in the back, would you?
-- The fuck I wouldn't...

544
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,210
Good night, sweet prince,. And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

545
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,920
Shakespeare ( Hamlet Act 5 Scene 2)

546
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:19,650
Jake!

547
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,870
Hasta la vista, baby!
-- Schwarzenegger ( 1991, Terminator 2)

548
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,820
You okay? -- I'm okay

549
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,770
Becca, you alright?

550
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,270
I'm okay

551
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,710
Did you do all this?

552
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:15,970
Yeah,

553
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:18,450
I explained to everybody what was going on

554
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:22,640
How they were being set up... I convinced them

555
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,350
Hey Barrett

556
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,200
Make sure you come in and file a statement

557
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:32,450
You'll find the statement forms,
right next to the re-instatement forms

558
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:41,050
I'll think about it
-- You do that

559
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,360
What do you got?

560
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,570
Officer Moe, will you please
get this creep out of here

561
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:04,650
This is a night, I'll never believe it

562
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,460
Like I said Fernandez,

563
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,460
One day at a time

564
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,820
One day at a time

565
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:59,820
