1
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:04,263
<i>My name is Toby.
I'm 17 years old.</i>

2
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:09,500
<i>I'm a scholarship winner.</i>

3
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,672
<i>And I started and ran
an international drug ring.</i>

4
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,543
<i>And I am fucked.</i>

5
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,788
<i>Sage Hall, it was in the same
town I grew up in.</i>

6
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,224
<i>But it might as well have been
in another country.</i>

7
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:38,562
<i>Preppies. That's what
they're called.</i>

8
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:41,333
<i>They all dressed the same,
looked the same.</i>

9
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,636
<i>Went to all of the same places
and schools.</i>

10
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:49,173
<i>Everything about them seemed
so easy, so effortless</i>

11
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:52,512
<i>already done... because it was.</i>

12
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,215
<i>That's Ingrid, my mom.</i>

13
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:00,818
<i>That's Mike, my dad.</i>

14
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,755
<i>This was her day,
Ingrid's day.</i>

15
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,724
<i>The day she got the letter.</i>

16
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,060
You got into Sage Hall.

17
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,396
I never applied. I thought you
said we didn't have the money.

18
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,898
It's a scholarship.

19
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,167
<i>She decided that I needed
to be sent to a place</i>

20
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,203
<i>that she was sure
would change everything.</i>

21
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,141
<i>Change me. And it did.</i>

22
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,145
<i>She was right.</i>

23
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,614
You didn't fill out
an application.

24
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,849
<i>As my mom tells it,
our family was</i>

25
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,918
<i>one of the richest
in all of Germany.</i>

26
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,621
<i>But when they ended up on the
wrong side of the Berlin Wall</i>

27
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>they lost everything.</i>

28
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>She's never stopped
wanting it back.</i>

29
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>Before I even started at Sage,
I was finished.</i>

30
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:53,738
<i>You mom got a call
from the registrar's office.</i>

31
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,340
<i>They said you didn't show.</i>

32
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,807
<i>No, I went. I just...</i>

33
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,676
I, I couldn't really
find the building.

34
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:02,380
And then, by the time
I got there they were closed.

35
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,854
Luckily, they agreed
to let you register tomorrow.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,621
What?

37
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm taking you there myself.

38
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,862
Ingrid, we're gonna
discuss this as a family.

39
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,697
This is Sage Hall.

40
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,299
I know.

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,834
Toby.

42
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,804
How do you feel about this?

43
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,472
I don't belong there.

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,376
You don't know
where you belong.

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,346
Someday you'll thank me
for this.

46
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,217
You can't make me go.

47
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,657
<i>It had happened before,
sometimes for days.</i>

48
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:49,793
<i>A dark room and TV.</i>

49
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:52,631
<i>And it only stopped when I had
something to offer her.</i>

50
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,504
<i>I'm gonna go back tomorrow.</i>

51
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:02,941
<i>I did it for her.</i>

52
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,609
<i>I did it for my dad.</i>

53
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,680
<i>Stay invisible. Stay out
of sight. That was the plan.</i>

54
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,351
<i>That is your charge.
We expect it of you.</i>

55
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,886
<i>Expect it of yourselves.</i>

56
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,489
I ask you now to intone
the Sage Hall oath

57
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,494
Then we'll invite our newer
students to make their mark

58
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,497
in our sacred tomb.

59
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,568
Fully aware, therefore

60
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,506
the importance of what
I'm choosing today within this...

61
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:38,042
<i>After taking an oath
to the principles and values</i>

62
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:41,046
<i>of Sage Hall, every student
as tradition dictated</i>

63
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,049
<i>signed their name in a book.</i>

64
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,019
<i>A 200-year-old book.</i>

65
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,824
Shit.

66
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,061
Look at this fucking idiot.

67
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,671
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah. God.

68
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,042
<i>Alright... settle down.</i>

69
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:15,380
Hey, spilling ink
is an ancient Chinese omen.

70
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:17,816
I'm Fidel.

71
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,817
<i>That's Fidel.</i>

72
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,818
Hi. I'm Toby.

73
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,051
<i>He's from Columbia.</i>

74
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,486
<i>But everyone here calls him</i>

75
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:24,556
<i>the King of Mexico.</i>

76
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,825
<i>He wanted to be friends so
badly that it occurred to me</i>

77
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,426
<i>that he was stuck here too.</i>

78
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,830
Well, my dad comes up
to America a lot.

79
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,030
He's the ambassador.

80
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,099
What's your dad do?

81
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,703
He's a delivery guy.
I'm here on scholarship.

82
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,804
You know, it amazes me
that this place with all its

83
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,742
nepotism and inbreeding
can actually pad its endowment.

84
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,044
Come on, let me show you around.

85
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:50,349
This is Woodhull.
It's where the jocks live.

86
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:57,356
And that's Cleve. Boozers.

87
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,061
This is Kennedy,
it's a bunch of stoners mostly...

88
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,636
<i>Alexandra Hayes
of the Charleston Hayes.</i>

89
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,607
<i>Alex as everyone called her.</i>

90
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,544
<i>Fidel let me know that I had
no business looking at her</i>

91
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,614
<i>or even thinking
I could speak with her.</i>

92
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,150
<i>Where's your dorm?</i>

93
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,419
-It's Griswold.
-It's over here.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>But I couldn't stop
thinking about her.</i>

95
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,159
<i>Being a day student
wasn't easy.</i>

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,828
<i>I didn't live in the dorm.</i>

97
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,028
<i>We were seen as someone
who's just passing through.</i>

98
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,465
<i>This is where I hang
between classes?</i>

99
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,134
You can always hang out
in my room, if you like.

100
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,537
Thank you.

101
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:49,441
Hey, you're,
you're new, right?

102
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,109
-Yeah.
-You wanna join me for a smoke?

103
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,047
yeah. Sure.

104
00:06:56,048 --> 00:07:00,184
Okay. Hold this. Thanks.

105
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,522
Hey, I got some stuff to do.
I'll catch you later, Toby.

106
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,926
<i>Ellis William Tynes III.</i>

107
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,030
<i>He was the fourth generation of
the Tynes family to attend Sage.</i>

108
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,465
<i>Later I had heard that his dad
was horseback riding buddies</i>

109
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:15,633
<i>with Reagan.</i>

110
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,669
Thank God for the soviets,
right?

111
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,138
You know, four generations
of my family had scribbled

112
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,574
their name inside that book
you thrashed.

113
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,844
Yeah, I'm really sorry
about that.

114
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,513
<i>I have to admit,
he had charisma.</i>

115
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,483
<i>Are you kiddin'?</i>

116
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,551
<i>Hell, I wanted to be
his friend.</i>

117
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:36,456
You should've seen what happened
to the last scholarship winner.

118
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,125
Why? What happened?

119
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,463
Hey, have you seen
the TV room yet?

120
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,900
You know, we got a new TV
which is pretty nice.

121
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,604
We got VHS too.
It's pretty sharp....

122
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:58,042
Hey.

123
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,812
Get him! Come on, get him!
Get that motherfucker! Come on!

124
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,949
-You little filth faggot!
-Motherfucker!

125
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,692
-Turn around!
-Come here, you piece of shit!

126
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,098
Gaines is coming! Hey!

127
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,100
Come on!

128
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,972
<i>Hazing, if you
took it personally</i>

129
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,743
<i>you got more of it,
and it got worse.</i>

130
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,584
<i>Fidel taught me
how to blend in.</i>

131
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,752
<i>The rules, their mannerisms</i>

132
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,120
<i>the preppie uniform.</i>

133
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,524
Take it.

134
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,158
What is this?
You jerk off to this?

135
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,028
I study it. I used to
be a wet back ear too.

136
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,163
This one too.

137
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,865
Shit, I got econ.

138
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,634
-One more thing.
-What?

139
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,639
You got a new nickname.

140
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,740
Flipper.

141
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,045
<i>So it comes to us
in the mind of one man</i>

142
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,713
<i>who lived about 200 years ago</i>

143
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,181
<i>and his name was Adam Smith.</i>

144
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,283
<i>Anyone? Adam Smith?</i>

145
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:17,589
Welcome Toby.
Hey, sorry I'm late.

146
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,325
I was just telling everyone about
our good friend here, Adam Smith.

147
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,060
Ever heard of him?

148
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah.

149
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:26,331
"Wealth Of Nations."
The invisible hand.

150
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,066
What our friend Tobias
is referring...

151
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,034
<i>Mr. Jennings was
nice enough.</i>

152
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:34,205
<i>After I fell off the stage, he
seemed to take an interest in me.</i>

153
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,339
<i>These markets are...</i>

154
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,777
<i>Kind of like
I was a project or something.</i>

155
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:41,045
Flipper.

156
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,325
<i>I take in my lumps.
I was adapting. Observing.</i>

157
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:59,196
<i>Putting the past behind me,
until the past showed up.</i>

158
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:03,368
<i>Dennis Carnell. My best friend.
We grew up together.</i>

159
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,704
<i>And he had the unique
personality trait of being</i>

160
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,973
<i>totally unaware
of his surroundings.</i>

161
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,341
Ellis.

162
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,711
What's up, man?

163
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:15,846
Hey, Dennis.

164
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,849
What the hell
are you watching?

165
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,987
It's rugby. -And what the
fuck are you wearing?

166
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:27,090
<i>You look like Pat Boone.
Man, what are you doing here?</i>

167
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,661
<i>What am I doing here? I live
like 3 blocks away, remember?</i>

168
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,797
My God, guys.
Flipper brought his boyfriend.

169
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:34,999
Look at that guy.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,401
You think they let him
keep the tool belt?

171
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,002
<i>Yeah, Apex Tech
guarantees it.</i>

172
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,805
You're such a dick sometimes.

173
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,774
Shit, honey.

174
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,276
Hey, man, you got any weed?

175
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,146
No. Dry as a bone.

176
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,346
Fuck!

177
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,349
<i>And then it happened.</i>

178
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,389
<i>My God...</i>

179
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,691
<i>There's a girl...
What?</i>

180
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:01,494
She's got tits.

181
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,428
She's coming over here
right now.

182
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,168
What?

183
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,169
<i>I will never forget</i>

184
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,269
<i>the back of her hand</i>

185
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,172
<i>against my neck.</i>

186
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,773
Keeping the tag on
is definitely a statement.

187
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,242
You might start a trend.

188
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:21,012
<i>-I'm Toby.
-I know.</i>

189
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,415
-You do?
-Yeah. We have econ together.

190
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,450
You came in late last time
and made everybody look stupid.

191
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,252
Yeah.

192
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,057
<i>I'm, I'm Dennis
by the way.</i>

193
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,460
Nice to meet you.

194
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,862
So, do you guys by any chance
happen to have any pot?

195
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,465
On me? Right now?

196
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,432
No. Do you?

197
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,301
Do you know
where to get some?

198
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,436
<i>Yeah, I-I can get it.</i>

199
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:49,072
<i>-He's kidding.
-No, fuck that.</i>

200
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,376
Is it just for you?
And my friends.

201
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,848
-45.
-That's a lot.

202
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,850
Ellis can afford it.

203
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,495
Okay, yeah,
we'll, we'll let you know.

204
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,932
Okay.

205
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,933
<i>We didn't have any way
to get weed.</i>

206
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>But I was determined
to figure out how to get it.</i>

207
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,441
<i>We drove all night
and all over New Haven.</i>

208
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,413
<i>We searched every alley,
every stoop, every corner.</i>

209
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,750
<i>It wasn't looking good.</i>

210
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,955
We should try those guys.

211
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,324
But you gotta make sure we're
close enough so they can see us.

212
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,527
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

213
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,994
I'm just gonna nod my head.

214
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,863
Nod your head?
What do you mean?

215
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,833
I saw it in this film.

216
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:53,537
They're not even
looking at you, man.

217
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,105
Just give it another second.

218
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,108
Just roll down
the fucking window, man.

219
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,518
Yo! Air Jordan.

220
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,152
What the fuck
did you call me?

221
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,955
We're just trying
to buy some green, blood.

222
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,523
<i>What the fuck?</i>

223
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,893
What the fuck makes you think
I deal drugs?

224
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:17,928
-Motherfucker?
-No, no, no.

225
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,163
That's not what we were
thinking. We were just...

226
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,032
We're just looking
to buy some marijuana.

227
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,003
We thought maybe you'd know
where we could get some.

228
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,047
You're such a fuck...
Shut up.

229
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,283
<i>Okay.</i>

230
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,385
You got the money?

231
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,455
Yeah. Yeah,
I have some money.

232
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:46,824
<i>Did he go with you?
What's his name?</i>

233
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,594
Dennis. Yeah. Yeah. He came...
You should've seen him.

234
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,564
He was doing all these signals to the dealer
that I-I guess he learned in some movie.

235
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,934
He's like, "Yo, we're here
to buy some green, blood."

236
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,034
Is your friend
mentally challenged?

237
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:01,272
<i>Ben and Laura were the other
half of Alex and Ellis.</i>

238
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,609
<i>But Laura was sweet, quiet.
She was always kind to me.</i>

239
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,345
<i>And Ben, her boyfriend, was a prick,
but I kind of liked him anyway.</i>

240
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,148
<i>Even though I was
the 5th wheel, it felt good.</i>

241
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,085
<i>And at the very least I was
speaking and they were listening.</i>

242
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,888
<i>Even if it was mostly
at my expense.</i>

243
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,858
We're blood brothers.

244
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,095
Stop. Toby, just stop.

245
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,063
You're high
as a fucking kite, man.

246
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,551
<i>Now!</i>

247
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,557
<i>Let's go!
Go. Go.</i>

248
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,394
Open up the door!

249
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,944
<i>I had my foot against
the door that our house master</i>

250
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,545
<i>Mr. Gaines was pounding on.</i>

251
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,546
Let's go.

252
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,547
<i>When she looked at me</i>

253
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,417
<i>I didn't even think about it.</i>

254
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,018
<i>If it had been a train
coming towards her</i>

255
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,988
<i>I'd have laid down
in front of it.</i>

256
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,995
He said he was sorry.

257
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,743
<i>In here.</i>

258
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,446
<i>You see all that in the front?
Yeah, I see it.</i>

259
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,981
<i>In front of the hedge
there's a lot of weeds here.</i>

260
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,951
Just push them to the side.
Make sure.

261
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:14,037
What are you doing here?

262
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,975
I heard
about your suspension.

263
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,609
I just wanted to come see you.

264
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,546
Toby. What are you doing?

265
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,148
Who are you talking to?

266
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,349
<i>She's selling
Girl Scout Cookies.</i>

267
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,718
<i>You want any?</i>

268
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,021
No, I don't want
any Girl Scout Cookies.

269
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,391
Get back to work.
Yeah, no, we don't want any.

270
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,228
My loss.

271
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,631
I just wanted to tell you
that what you did...

272
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:42,100
Thank you.

273
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,741
Welcome back.

274
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,747
<i>Everything felt different
the day</i>

275
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,717
<i>I got back from my suspension.</i>

276
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,518
<i>The preppies wanted
to get a look at me.</i>

277
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,619
<i>They were curious.
Who wouldn't be?</i>

278
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,256
<i>By the time I got back to
campus, I'd heard the stories.</i>

279
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,124
<i>I'd blown a cloud of ganja
smoke into Mr. Gaines' face</i>

280
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,460
<i>pushed him out of the room
and told him to fuck off.</i>

281
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,497
<i>None of it was true, but it
took some of the heat off me.</i>

282
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,665
<i>The preppies were appeased.</i>

283
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,235
Hey. Can I,
can I get a minute?

284
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:21,339
We should go. If not, Stan and
Fred will get the best eppets.

285
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,307
Yeah, I'll be right there.

286
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,810
Take it easy, Zorro.

287
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,813
What's up?

288
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:33,750
Listen, I-I just, I wanted to
thank you for what, happened.

289
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,420
I mean, I, look, man, I would've
stuck around with you.

290
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,622
But the thing is, I already got
one strike against me

291
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,257
and you know with the two strike
rule around here...

292
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,528
Well, discretion is often
the better part of valor.

293
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,665
Are you fucking with me?

294
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,736
What do you mean?

295
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,839
I mean, you're a local
bumpkin and all

296
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,709
but... sometimes

297
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,678
sometimes I get the feeling
that you're from far away.

298
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:08,552
Hey, a bunch of us
are, gonna meet up

299
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,489
on the golf course
after check in.

300
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:13,556
You up for that?

301
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,393
I mean, one more strike for
either one of us and it's...

302
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,168
Behind the green
on the seventh hole.

303
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,571
Midnight.

304
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,673
Don't be a pussy.

305
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,211
<i>"Don't be a pussy."</i>

306
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,782
<i>"Don't be a pussy."</i>

307
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,886
<i>But the truth was...</i>

308
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,856
<i>I wasn't afraid
of anything...</i>

309
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,259
<i>except losing her.</i>

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,352
I don't know, my mom said
she saw on the news that like

311
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,254
if you do this once
you'll get addicted.

312
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,923
-Your mom's a cunt.
-Her mom loves you.

313
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,394
My mom doesn't love anybody.

314
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,836
I'm guessing, you haven't
done this before.

315
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>Come on, Tobs.</i>

316
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:36,841
It's not gonna hurt.

317
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,261
<i>-Isn't that amazing?
-Look at the moon.</i>

318
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,231
<i>-You feel good.
-You feel really good.</i>

319
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,969
<i>-I don't feel...
-Laura's gonna get addicted.</i>

320
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,371
-No, I'm not.
-You're gonna get addicted.

321
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,572
<i>Shut up!</i>

322
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,374
Something you could
do every day, right?

323
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,310
Wait, the way
you talk is like...

324
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,444
It's like perfect.

325
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,313
It's...

326
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,682
That's exactly how I'm feeling.

327
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,856
Classic.

328
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,925
Fuckin', turn that fuckin'
thing off, you fuckin' moron.

329
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:29,960
Why is it so hard to get?

330
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:31,527
Because everybody wants it.

331
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:32,595
Yeah, man, you need...

332
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,797
You need like real...

333
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,968
Real connections to get
this shit, you know.

334
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,336
I... I could probably
get some more.

335
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,706
From who?

336
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:45,742
Y... You're bros in New Haven?

337
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,577
Shit, Jack, they wouldn't sell
you anything more

338
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:50,581
<i>than some stepped on
fuckin' Tide.</i>

339
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,851
Those aren't my
only connections.

340
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,618
Come on, man.

341
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,953
I mean...

342
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:59,957
<i>You'll never get your hands
on good coke.</i>

343
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,826
If anybody can get it
Toby can.

344
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,296
<i>Okay!</i>

345
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,896
<i>Okay!</i>

346
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,933
<i>So now I'm the bad guy?</i>

347
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,604
<i>Pussycat! Pussycat!</i>

348
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,274
<i>Come here, pussycat!</i>

349
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,780
<i>-Where are you going?
-I can't tell you.</i>

350
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,015
It's freezing!

351
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,749
What?

352
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,786
Don't worry.
He's from Maine.

353
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,920
You're crazy.

354
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,756
With the balls
of a polar bear!

355
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:35,360
It really makes you think.
You know?

356
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,696
It makes me stop thinking.

357
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:53,979
My God!

358
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,708
I'm in love with you.

359
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,010
I know.

360
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,654
<i>Where have you been?</i>

361
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:41,124
-School.
-Doing what?

362
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,393
Homework.

363
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,595
What you... hold on.

364
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,130
You want us to believe
you were doing homework?

365
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,365
<i>Your hair's wet.</i>

366
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,134
You know, I... I'm finally
making the kind of friends

367
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:52,069
you guys want me to make

368
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,537
a... and now, he's giving me
a hard time.

369
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,140
Doing what?
What were you doing?

370
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,607
I was studying!

371
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,608
Just with some friends.

372
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,411
That's a load
of malarkey.

373
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,145
Were you Tobias?

374
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,412
Yeah, I said I was, alright.

375
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:03,413
Stay out of my fuckin' business.

376
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,448
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

377
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,681
What?

378
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,718
You don't speak
to your mother like that!

379
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,486
You understand?

380
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,422
We have every right to ask
where have you've been.

381
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,624
<i>You just got suspended.</i>

382
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,626
<i>Now, look, you can't</i>

383
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:19,896
you just can't afford
this kinda trouble.

384
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:21,698
Then again, we can't really
afford anything.

385
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:22,801
Right?

386
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,916
<i>No money, no connections.</i>

387
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,118
<i>A pretender. A poser.</i>

388
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,421
<i>That's all I was.</i>

389
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,187
<i>-Hello?
-Dennis, hey.</i>

390
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:19,522
<i>Hey, man, what's goin' on?</i>

391
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:22,226
Hey, man. I need your help.

392
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,897
<i>He told me he'd handle it
and I didn't want to know how.</i>

393
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,931
<i>A good friend would've
probably stopped him.</i>

394
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,500
<i>But I wasn't a good
friend anymore.</i>

395
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:31,835
<i>I didn't know what I was.</i>

396
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,937
Shit! What happened?

397
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,040
Next time I'll just hide
the money first.

398
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,240
You alright?

399
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,710
Yeah, I'm okay.

400
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,844
-Good.
-Here.

401
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,146
Thanks.

402
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,184
What's this?

403
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,854
It's the coke.

404
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:51,989
-What?
-Yeah.

405
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,124
I stole it from 'em.
Fucking pricks.

406
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,493
Dennis!

407
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,796
My God!

408
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,198
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

409
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,267
God, okay...

410
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,134
When we go in there, I need you
to do something for me.

411
00:25:05,135 --> 00:25:06,269
Anything.

412
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,604
Here.

413
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:09,274
You just look like a badass.

414
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,574
That's it?

415
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,008
That's it.

416
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,278
-Alright.
-Okay, let's do it.

417
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,752
<i>Alright so it's about half
an eight ball.</i>

418
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,254
<i>Each line is a hundred bucks.</i>

419
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,858
Or you can do the whole thing
for five hundred.

420
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,858
Fuck you. Fuck you
and your mother.

421
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,761
You can get half an eight ball
in this town for two hundred!

422
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:32,762
Okay, then go get it.

423
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:33,963
You see my associate here

424
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:36,566
<i>went through to make
the purchase.</i>

425
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,768
Well, you know,
I take the whole bag.

426
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:42,172
No, no, no. I'll take
the whole thing for $550.

427
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,306
$600.

428
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,210
You know, we can divide
the lines.

429
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,278
No, no... I... I'll,...

430
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,047
I'll take the whole thing

431
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,616
for $700.

432
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:56,886
Okay, wait, hold on.

433
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,088
Going once.

434
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,826
Going twice.

435
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,331
$700 to Ellis

436
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,700
if he gives me the money.

437
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,302
Easy, man.

438
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:15,305
I mean, we're all,
we're all friends here.

439
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:17,308
That's okay. Yeah.
Just give me the cash.

440
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,760
It's a pleasure doing
business with you

441
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,864
Yeah, no problem.

442
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,674
Come on, let's go.

443
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,010
See you...

444
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:05,389
Get out.

445
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,864
This is my room.

446
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,845
We gotta get more
of this shit.

447
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:33,350
So what's it like
in Colombia?

448
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:36,886
Where my family's from,
it's beautiful.

449
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,354
-You should come with me.
-Really?

450
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:40,990
<i>Fidel was constantly
talking about Colombia.</i>

451
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:44,094
<i>Fidel, from Sage Hall.
I think I told you about him</i>

452
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,730
invited me to go to Colombia
with him... and his family.

453
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,765
Colombia?

454
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,900
Aren't you far away, kid?

455
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,436
It's not a safe place
to travel.

456
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:54,371
So is it true there's a lot
of cocaine down there?

457
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,272
There's so much of it

458
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:57,708
some people use it
as currency.

459
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,375
In the barrios,
that's how it is.

460
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,743
We don't know his family.

461
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,912
Well, his dad's
an ambassador.

462
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:04,047
An ambassador?

463
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:05,414
<i>A door was open.</i>

464
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,450
<i>I decided to go through it.</i>

465
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:09,452
How much is the ticket, Toby?

466
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:12,022
He offered
to pay for it.

467
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,324
What would you say

468
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,193
if we went down there
try to pick up a little bit?

469
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,732
You know, just enough
to party with.

470
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:24,334
<i>You mean with Ellis
and the guys.</i>

471
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,402
And Alex?

472
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:29,739
Well, yeah and you too.
You know, if we can get some.

473
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,208
You said yourself
you wanted to hang out with him.

474
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,178
And they're all over
that shit.

475
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:38,081
Well, if his parents are okay
with it, I... I...

476
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,281
<i>Yeah.</i>

477
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,750
We are too.

478
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,451
<i>We needed to raise money.
A lot of it.</i>

479
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:44,455
<i>So I started making my routes.</i>

480
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:46,789
<i>Ellis</i>

481
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,891
<i>Come in.</i>

482
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,959
<i>Ben.</i>

483
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
<i>Laura.</i>

484
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,497
It's my parents' donation.

485
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,200
<i>Alex.</i>

486
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,235
I'll put it to good use.

487
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,772
<i>Everyone put money
into the first trip.</i>

488
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,406
<i>We had almost $3000.</i>

489
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,377
<i>I did my research on Colombia.</i>

490
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,514
<i>Even stayed up late to watch
a night line on the drug war.</i>

491
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,985
<i>The drug cartel's had huge
amounts of money</i>

492
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,952
<i>weapons and influence.</i>

493
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:18,521
<i>Journalists and politicians
were killed.</i>

494
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:21,324
<i>Kidnapping and chaos
could pop off anywhere.</i>

495
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:24,260
<i>I knew what I was walking
into, but I didn't care.</i>

496
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,797
<i>Honestly, I was excited.</i>

497
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,500
So are you gonna help me
with this?

498
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:34,805
I mean just tell me
where I can get it.

499
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,545
<i>Fidel's house was pretty
much a palace.</i>

500
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,979
<i>Servants, bodyguards.</i>

501
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,816
<i>I'd never seen
anything like it.</i>

502
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:48,152
How much?

503
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,027
Just tell me how much it is.
I wanna get it, it's a gift.

504
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,261
-For who?
-For Alex.

505
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:01,163
<i>As the ambassador,
Fidel's father</i>

506
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:02,899
<i>was pretty strict
about where he let us go.</i>

507
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,835
<i>There were only
a few tourist spots</i>

508
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,303
<i>that he had thought
were safe enough.</i>

509
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,273
<i>He sent a bodyguard to keep
an eye on every move.</i>

510
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,168
Welcome to Colombia.

511
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,584
<i>The Edge.</i>

512
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:57,588
<i>One of Colombia's
most notorious drug barrios.</i>

513
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,633
What do you want, gringo?

514
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,970
Do you where
I could find...

515
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,605
<i>cocaine?</i>

516
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,515
I can get you
whatever you want.

517
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,585
Okay,...

518
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,319
Half a kilo.

519
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,655
$3000.

520
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,358
Yeah. Okay.

521
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,228
<i>You have the money?</i>

522
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,095
Yeah. Yeah, I got the money.

523
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,665
Show.

524
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:24,668
Show the cocaine.

525
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:31,240
Show the cocaine? Okay.

526
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,777
Okay. I'll show
you the cocaine.

527
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:37,382
I'll show you the cocaine.
Cocaine. Right away!

528
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:40,249
Where is it, gringo?

529
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,418
<i>Where is it?</i>

530
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:09,047
You know you should be
dead right now.

531
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:22,225
That was smart

532
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,061
but not that smart.

533
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:27,696
Why don't you just keep it?

534
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:29,165
Or kill me?

535
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,433
That is not my business.

536
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:33,837
I am not a thief.

537
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,506
Cocaine...

538
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:38,774
That's my business.

539
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,176
And you are Americano.

540
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:44,481
I love Americano.
You're full opportunities.

541
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:50,153
And you made me laugh. Come.

542
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,496
<i>It's okay.</i>

543
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:02,665
<i>I don't care what he wanted.</i>

544
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,603
<i>He's a boy and Manuel
was supposed to protect him!</i>

545
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,808
Look, I'm sorry.
It was my fault.

546
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,877
I went off on my own
a... and then these guys

547
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:16,879
just came out of nowhere
and jumped me in.

548
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,482
They took all my money
and then by the time I came back

549
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:22,219
Fidel and Manuel
were already gone.

550
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:32,761
<i>It was a really stupid idea.</i>

551
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,398
I don't ever wanna lie
to my parents like that again.

552
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:41,239
Yeah.

553
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,191
You left this.

554
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,792
Talked it down to
almost nothing.

555
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,495
Thanks.

556
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,935
<i>Passport?</i>

557
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:14,270
Countries visited?

558
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:15,872
Colombia.

559
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:16,906
Purpose of your trip?

560
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:19,209
Well, my friend
has some family down there

561
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,912
so we're just visiting them and
seeing the country which was great.

562
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,214
Did you buy anything you're
bringing back into the states?

563
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:27,518
Just this.

564
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,190
So what did you do
in Colombia?

565
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,299
<i>What did I do in Colombia?</i>

566
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,970
<i>What did I do in Colombia?</i>

567
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,977
<i>What did you do in Colombia?</i>

568
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,278
I...

569
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,218
I lost my virginity.

570
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:08,425
<i>Must've been quite
a trip, kid.</i>

571
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,261
Yeah. Thanks.

572
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,828
<i>The campus was empty.</i>

573
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:14,997
<i>Not everyone was back
from the long weekend yet.</i>

574
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:16,832
<i>It was my favorite time
in Sage,</i>

575
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,968
<i>when the students were gone.</i>

576
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,303
<i>Rather than spend another
weekend with her housekeeper</i>

577
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,672
<i>Alex never left.</i>

578
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,009
<i>I think she liked
the solitude.</i>

579
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,313
Hey.

580
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:32,717
-I got you something.
-What are you doing here?

581
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,585
-I thought you'd like it.
-Yes, it's...

582
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,021
That's okay.
You don't like it.

583
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,499
What's wrong?

584
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I can't believe you did it.

585
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,770
Yeah. Of course.

586
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,273
Eighth of a key.

587
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,308
Ever see that much?

588
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,009
That's some midnight
express shit, man.

589
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,611
Yeah, but he didn't
get caught.

590
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,446
Well, what the fuck
are we waiting for, right?

591
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:06,582
I mean, I'm just gonna take
a little bump, make it quick.

592
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,917
See how it will work in with.

593
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:10,820
Let's see. Here.

594
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,999
Well...

595
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,670
How is it?

596
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:31,073
It's pure, I mean,
there's, there's nothing in it.

597
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:32,142
<i>What do you mean?</i>

598
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,509
I mean, usually they mix
this shit with lactose

599
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,779
<i>soap, baking soda but this</i>

600
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,917
<i>This... this is... unique.</i>

601
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,951
Do you guys realize
how many schools there are

602
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,355
in a 20 mile radius from here?

603
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,957
Well, you're not thinking about
selling this shit. Are you?

604
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,392
Why not? I mean, you took
your share and the rest is mine.

605
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,694
I can do what I want with it.

606
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:52,830
Look, I... I'll buy
the rest of it.

607
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,696
How about that?

608
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:55,797
Okay, do you have the money?

609
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:57,567
Well, look man, I can't give
it to you right now

610
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,102
but I just need
a little bit of time.

611
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,370
That's what I thought.

612
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,906
I'm sorry, man. It's just...
Time's up. You know.

613
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,077
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

614
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,349
<i>Just a second.
Just a second.</i>

615
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:20,089
It's king of Mexico.

616
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,089
God.

617
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,592
Yeah, tell him to come in.

618
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,568
Hey, Fidel.

619
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,137
You ready to party?

620
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:39,043
What is it?

621
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,380
I mean, what's it look like?

622
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:48,586
Toby, Toby, where the fuck's
he going, Toby?

623
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,754
Hey. Hey, what's wrong?

624
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:53,156
You made me look
like an idiot.

625
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,158
<i>Look, I just...</i>

626
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,760
I never thought you'd make it
through customs.

627
00:39:58,594 --> 00:39:59,895
I thought that
this is what you wanted!

628
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,631
<i>You know... just hang out
with all of us.</i>

629
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,832
<i>You know, you can be
a part of this.</i>

630
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,901
I don't want
any part of this.

631
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,904
I... I'm Colombian.
Don't you understand?

632
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,173
I can't just be caught
dealing in cocaine!

633
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:12,008
Hey, hey, ssh, ssh.
Just calm down, okay.

634
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,176
What, so now you're just some
some kind of drug dealer?

635
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:16,746
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

636
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,448
Shut the fuck up.

637
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,116
My father was right
and you Americans

638
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:23,618
just use people
for what you want.

639
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,189
You know it must be easier
to be so self-righteous

640
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,192
when you're as rich as a king.

641
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,160
You never gonna
have her, Toby.

642
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,163
<i>No matter how hard you try.</i>

643
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,434
<i>She's gonna use you up
and spit you out.</i>

644
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,220
<i>No. No.</i>

645
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,553
<i>Just... just stop.</i>

646
00:40:58,554 --> 00:40:59,788
<i>Then ask him for a loan.</i>

647
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:00,957
He's my kid brother.

648
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,960
What do you
have to be proud of?

649
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,130
Now, you got me there.

650
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:15,171
<i>One hundred
and twenty five grams.</i>

651
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,939
<i>One eighth of a key.</i>

652
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,508
<i>The deal I made with
the Preppie's was that</i>

653
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,977
<i>for rescuing my neck
in Columbia I get half</i>

654
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,913
<i>or 62 grams for myself.</i>

655
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,584
<i>The purity of the coke I had
was medical grade.</i>

656
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,951
<i>Ellis was right.</i>

657
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,654
<i>This shit was unique.</i>

658
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,723
<i>Raoul schooled me on
how to cut my share into half</i>

659
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,658
<i>of Lactose to double my money.</i>

660
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,563
<i>I set out to make $50 a gram
or about $6000 total.</i>

661
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,863
<i>Word spread fast.</i>

662
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:43,867
<i>And the orders came
rolling in.</i>

663
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,870
I had a kid from every team
playing away games

664
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,272
spread the word last weekend.

665
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,274
So that's six schools.

666
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:55,076
Look, man, I don't know why he's
going through all this trouble

667
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:56,979
I mean, I... I've got the money.

668
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,247
I'll just buy it all myself.

669
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:00,750
Hey, I know a place
where you can get double

670
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,285
what Ellis can pay.

671
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,886
But the harder I work
the more I live.

672
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,288
A bunch of whacked up writers

673
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:09,091
throw some kinkfests
over in Litchfield.

674
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:12,095
I deal them hash, but when
I told them about your coke

675
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,296
they said they'd pay anything.

676
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,799
<i>I think the guys, like,
a Baron or something.</i>

677
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,970
I've always wanted
to meet royalty.

678
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:24,306
<i>Is possible before handing
it on to future generations.</i>

679
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,677
<i>I'd wanted to become
like them.</i>

680
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:31,914
<i>But in the process I'd become
something even better.</i>

681
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,317
<i>I was ready a drug dealer.</i>

682
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,319
<i>I exerted a level
of control over them</i>

683
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,921
<i>but I'd never
even panicked.</i>

684
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:42,659
<i>I didn't need an invite
to any of their parties.</i>

685
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,630
<i>I was the party.</i>

686
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,336
<i>This is the,
kid I told you about.</i>

687
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:58,040
<i>Chuck here tells me
that you've got some</i>

688
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,744
of the finest flake
in the Northern Hemisphere.

689
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:08,085
How is that even possible?

690
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,922
How about you show me
the money and I'll show you how.

691
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:17,126
A tooth full first perhaps.

692
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,619
Someone's been abroad.

693
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,788
How much do you want?

694
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,758
I'll take whatever you got.

695
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:57,768
Come through to the lounge.

696
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,704
I'll attend to your money.

697
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:27,664
Toby?

698
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,336
So what are you gonna do?

699
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,686
I like you, Toby.

700
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,453
You're very smart.

701
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:55,092
And you seem like a good person.

702
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,030
So listen closely.

703
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,165
<i>You need to be careful.</i>

704
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,937
<i>Very, very careful.</i>

705
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,773
Because if this thing
goes wrong...

706
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,946
you won't have the same out

707
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,182
<i>as anyone else involved.</i>

708
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,817
<i>Do you understand?</i>

709
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:23,920
Yeah.

710
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,500
You and I
never saw each other.

711
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:41,236
<i>We never saw each other.</i>

712
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,937
<i>That was fine with me.</i>

713
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,473
<i>I was sure in his mind
he thought</i>

714
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,509
<i>that was the end of it.</i>

715
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,979
<i>But I was determined
to sell it all.</i>

716
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,448
<i>And do that little ride
I could before.</i>

717
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,252
<i>Dearest Ingrid, please accept
this with a humble request</i>

718
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,221
<i>that you not let Mike know
I've sent this money along.</i>

719
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:02,359
Deepest regards,
your brother-in-law Todd Hammel.

720
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,288
This is the last of it.

721
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,299
Where are you coming from?

722
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,165
English Lit.

723
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,569
Had to recite a poem
in front of the class.

724
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,571
-Can I hear it?
-No.

725
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,038
Please?
I really wanna hear it.

726
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,573
-No, you don't. No.
-Come on.

727
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:55,511
You have it memorized, right?
Let's do it. I'm listening.

728
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,881
This is your stage.

729
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,883
God...

730
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,518
"When I have fears
that I may cease to be

731
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,455
"before my pen has gleaned
my teaming brain

732
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:10,593
"before high-piled books

00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,995
"rich garners
the full ripened grain.

734
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:18,200
"When I behold upon

735
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:21,437
"huge cloudy symbols

00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,272
"I may never live

737
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:26,609
"with the magic hand of chance.

00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,944
<i>" When I feel

00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:33,082

00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:38,087
"never have relish in the faery

741
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,357
"then on the shore

742
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,528
and think from love and fame
to nothingness do sink."

743
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,268
That was good.

744
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:54,605
I'm serious.

745
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:58,341
A bunch of us
are going to Ellis' place

746
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,508
in the city next weekend.

747
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,444
They have a place on,
on 5th Ave.

748
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:05,046
His parents are just
cool with that?

749
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:08,651
Yeah, his parents give even less
of a shit than my parents do.

750
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:12,155
You know, if you got more coke,
Ellis might let you come.

751
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,894
Yeah, I can get more.

752
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,662
How?

753
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:20,764
I just go back.

754
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:26,000
Think you guys can figure out
a way to cover for me?

755
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:27,335
Yeah. That's easy.

756
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:28,271
Ellis has this whole system

757
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,673
for how to change
the attendance sheets.

758
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,180
<i>Okay. Yeah, I can be
back in...</i>

759
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:39,515
<i>36 hours.</i>

760
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,053
You're a mad genius, Hammel.
You know that?

761
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,290
<i>When everybody heard that
I was going back to Columbia</i>

762
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:51,694
<i>students crowded into the
day lounge placing orders.</i>

763
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,932
<i>At one point, there were so many
I had to make them form a line.</i>

764
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,535
<i>Will you at least
be in a tent?</i>

765
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,703
Yeah, I mean, it's a ropes
course. It's not boot camp.

766
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:03,706
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

767
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,576
-Bye.
-Bye.

768
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,712
<i>My mom thought I had to go
on a leadership retreat.</i>

769
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,980
Careful.

770
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:11,848
<i>But the truth was</i>

771
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,582
<i>I had 36 hours
to catch a flight</i>

772
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,118
<i>to Columbia,
arrange a meeting with Raoul</i>

773
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,053
<i>make that buy
and get back to Sage Hall</i>

774
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,587
<i>before the end of the weekend.</i>

775
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:22,056
<i>All the while making sure
to avoid being robbed</i>

776
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:24,158
<i>beaten or killed.</i>

777
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,196
-It's for you.
-Thanks.

778
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,166
<i>Hola, Raoul.</i>

779
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,510
I wanna see Raoul.

780
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,371
You...

781
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:16,346
<i>Hey, lets have some fun
before we do business. Si?</i>

782
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,060
<i>You like this place?
It's like New York City. Si?</i>

783
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,527
<i>Si. Yeah, yeah.</i>

784
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:34,663
Wait until you see what I got
lined up for tomorrow night.

785
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,133
Well, actually I have
to leave tomorrow.

786
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,232
Why?

787
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,735
'Cause I have school.

788
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:51,113
Wanna do a line?

789
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,647
I'm going with you.

790
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:55,783
You've done this before, right?
You have girlfriend?

791
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:57,486
Yes. Yeah.

792
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:01,223
There is a girlfriend.
She blonde or brunette?

793
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,258
One.

794
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,127
<i>La rubia.</i>

795
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,796
<i>-What's la rubia?
-Blonde.</i>

796
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:09,565
<i>Yeah, la rubia.</i>

797
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,068
Okay.

798
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,072
<i>Yes.</i>

799
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:21,843
<i>-Good?
-Yeah.</i>

800
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:24,145
<i>Talk to me about this
girlfriend of yours.</i>

801
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:26,582
<i>-Well, she's never really my girlfriend.
-Why?</i>

802
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,183
We got to this school
with a bunch of really rich

803
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:30,451
she's really rich and,

804
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:31,854
<i>I don't... I don't
have a lot of money.</i>

805
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,589
<i>My family doesn't have
a lot of money. So?</i>

806
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,524
So I feel like, maybe there's
some other guys at school

807
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,125
they could, like, afford lot
of stuff

808
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,459
and support her
like, more that I could.

809
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,727
<i>I couldn't stop talking.</i>

810
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,462
You will be rich.

811
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:42,730
What do you...
What do you mean?

812
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:44,733
<i>I think I've said too much.</i>

813
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,470
Man.

814
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:51,573
<i>Raoul gave me cocaine.
Didn't even count my money.</i>

815
00:51:51,574 --> 00:51:53,341
<i>It wasn't like in the movies
where a bunch of guys</i>

816
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:56,145
<i>sit around with guns
glaring at each other.</i>

817
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,348
<i>It was a simple transaction.
Raoul made it kind of fun.</i>

818
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,151
<i>So Ricardo's
most famous idea</i>

819
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,218
<i>was his theory
of comparative advantage.</i>

820
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,854
He believed that if every nation
specialized in the production of the goods

821
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:07,756
it had a cost advantage
in producing

822
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,759
<i>then trade between nations would
be at it's most efficient.</i>

823
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,897
Now, can anyone of you think
of examples? Sarah?

824
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,364
-Wine from France?
-Good try.

825
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:18,901
But I don't think they have
a cost advantage anymore.

826
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,502
<i>-Timothy?
-Electronics from Japan?</i>

827
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,870
<i>Good one. Alice?</i>

828
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:24,807
Cocaine from Colombia.

829
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:28,643
Just shut up.

830
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:31,148
Alright, everybody
settle down.

831
00:52:57,907 --> 00:52:58,909
Shit.

832
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,276
We're cool.

833
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:02,412
<i>Should we go?</i>

834
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:33,903
A friend showed me this
place, couple of years back.

835
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:37,439
Fake IDs, man,
and they make 'em good.

836
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,441
-Yeah!
-So you're Charles Nobbs.

837
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,677
John Heliton...

838
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:33,996
<i>So all good?</i>

839
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,632
<i>Yeah.</i>

840
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,375
<i>You know,
you're a genius, Hammel.</i>

841
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,377
<i>An absolutely mad...
Come on...</i>

842
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,347
<i>-Come on.
-Genius.</i>

843
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:52,980
Does it taste good?

844
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:54,650
It taste delicious.

845
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,687
<i>-Hey.
-Delicious.</i>

846
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,721
Delicious. Delicious.

847
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:03,058
The finest four star restaurant.
Hey, how are you doin'?

848
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,560
What?
What are you doing, man?

849
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,662
You're just so goddamn
comfortable?

850
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:09,564
<i>Yeah, of course. Yeah.</i>

851
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:10,999
Get up here.

852
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,136
-What man?
-You're just so goddamn comfortable?

853
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,972
And so are you, aren't you?

854
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:21,676
<i>What's up, man?</i>

855
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:23,944
Trying to make
a fucking play?

856
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,881
<i>Is that what you're trying
to do, make a fucking play?</i>

857
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,482
-Why? What are you talking about?
-Fuck you, Hammel, okay?

858
00:56:28,483 --> 00:56:30,017
I've been seeing this.
I've been seeing this goddamn...

859
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:32,953
Stop fuckin' pawin' on him
like he's you're goddamn whore.

860
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,589
<i>You fucking love me. You fucking
love me for a long time.</i>

861
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,091
<i>Don't fucking act like...
Hey, hey, stop.</i>

862
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:38,426
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

863
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:39,428
I'm talking about
the dancing.

864
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,163
I'm talking about
the smiling, the singing.

865
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,499
All the perfect package,
sort of thing to do, right?

866
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,000
<i>Yeah. -Is that what you
trying to fucking do?</i>

867
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,134
-Yeah?
-Why are you being like this?

868
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:48,736
<i>What do you mean?
Why am I being like this?</i>

869
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,138
<i>How about just
having fun, man.</i>

870
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,040
<i>Come on, yeah. We're just
having a good time.</i>

871
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,975
<i>-We're having a good time...
-Don't be...</i>

872
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:55,144
<i>Don't make it weird.</i>

873
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,712
I'm not making it weird.
You know what? You're right.

874
00:56:57,713 --> 00:57:00,482
Let's all just have fun. Fuck each other,
act like a bunch of fucking animal.

875
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,651
<i>-What are you talking about?
-I have fucking respect.</i>

876
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,153
<i>Right, right, right?
Yeah!</i>

877
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,486
<i>Yeah.</i>

878
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:07,189
Let's have a fucking ball.
Yes.

879
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,191
Let's have a fucking
good time.

880
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,192
<i>Right. Just havin' fun!
Yeah.</i>

881
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:12,061
<i>-Right?
-Yeah.</i>

882
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:13,895
Yeah, we're gonna
have a great time.

883
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:15,198
<i>We're gonna
have a great time.</i>

884
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,931
<i>-Great time.
-Great time.</i>

885
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:20,901
<i>-Whoo!
-Let's all have some fun.</i>

886
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:22,803
<i>-Fucking fun?
-What are you doing?</i>

887
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:24,506
I'm having some fun!

888
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,806
What are you
doing, man? Stop!

889
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,210
<i>Alex.</i>

890
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,224
<i>Look...</i>

891
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:46,161
Ellis, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

892
00:57:48,931 --> 00:57:51,165
Calm the fuck down!

893
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,500
<i>Calm down!</i>

894
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,236
<i>You could have
killed somebody.</i>

895
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,837
Don't you hit me, okay?

896
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,208
You don't have that right.
Don't hit me.

897
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:02,076
<i>-Hey, hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.</i>

898
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:05,113
What the fuck, man?
Hey! Stop.

899
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,114
-Don't fucking try...
-Calm the fuck down.

900
00:58:07,115 --> 00:58:08,984
Calm the fuck down, okay?

901
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,718
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

902
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,721
<i>It's alright.
Fuck.</i>

903
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:16,924
<i>Just calm the fuck down.</i>

904
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:18,528
<i>Hey, man, I'm just trying
to have some fun.</i>

905
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:19,628
<i>Come on.</i>

906
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,098
<i>I didn't... I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it.</i>

907
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,100
I was... I was just...

908
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,703
<i>I just want us
to have some fun.</i>

909
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:31,006
<i>I'm sorry. I don't wanna lose you.
I know.</i>

910
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,274
<i>I know.</i>

911
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,942
I know.
Don't be scared of me.

912
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,044
I know.

913
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,914
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

914
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:45,521
I'm very sorry...

915
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:48,625
for everything.

916
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:55,564
<i>-Are you okay?
-Yeah.</i>

917
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:56,900
Are you sure?

918
00:58:59,268 --> 00:59:00,603
It happens.

919
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:07,776
-You're okay.
-I know.

920
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,243
<i>I better go look
after Ellis, okay?</i>

921
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:12,046
-You want me to come with you?
-No.

922
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:13,048
No.

923
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,552
Okay.

924
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,205
Not fun.

925
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:40,207
We have enough.

926
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:42,343
Fuck you.

927
00:59:42,344 --> 00:59:45,047
God, you can be
such a fucking prick!

928
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:04,799
I'm such a fucking idiot.

929
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,235
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

930
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,706
<i>I realized
that I had nothing.</i>

931
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,109
<i>All I have was my coke
and suddenly I was nothing</i>

932
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,913
<i>more than a servant to a bunch
of sad, rich orphans.</i>

933
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:14,902
I was wondering if you could hook
me up this weekend. I've got money.

934
01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:16,370
-Not here, man.
-Come on.

935
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,439
I'm not kidding.

936
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,442
Not here.
It's okay.

937
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:26,682
Toby.

938
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:29,685
Toby.
Fuck!

939
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:33,422
Shit. I can't. I can't.

940
01:01:58,146 --> 01:01:59,480
Come on.

941
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,082
You're not looking
so hard, Toby.

942
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,218
I was been fighting
this cold.

943
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,919
I mean, you look strung out.

944
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,187
We need to get more.

945
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:09,457
I don't think Philip is up
for the task, you know?

946
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,093
Then, why don't you get it?

947
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,962
<i>How the fuck
am I supposed to do that?</i>

948
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,765
Go to Columbia and buy it,
just like Toby did.

949
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,368
You've been traveling to Columbia,
is that where you getting it?

950
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:21,470
Why? You want some more?

951
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,071
-No, I want this to stop now!
-Yeah?

952
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,473
Yes.
Okay, dad.

953
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,910
I wanna know how big this is.
How many people know?

954
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,977
You could go with him.

955
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:31,513
<i>Are you insane?</i>

956
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,383
<i>Do you think I'm wanna go
to Columbia with Toby?</i>

957
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:36,317
<i>Well, that'd be a ball of fun.</i>

958
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:38,287
Maybe I will.

959
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,495
You're such
a fucking hypocrite, man.

960
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:49,997
You are going
to go to prison.

961
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:52,533
And you'll be the only one.

962
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,268
Do... do have any idea
that your life

963
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:57,337
will be completely destroyed
if you got caught?

964
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,406
But you're okay with Toby
risking his life

965
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:01,408
'cause he's the mule, right?

966
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:03,544
-Toby, you're gonna stop.
-Don't fucking touch me!

967
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,245
Don't fucking touch me!

968
01:03:05,246 --> 01:03:07,015
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

969
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,384
I don't care...

970
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,320
if he is the fucking...

971
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:18,426
You're not goin'.

972
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,797
Whatever you say.

973
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:31,305
<i>Mr. Jennings didn't wait
to see how big it was.</i>

974
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:33,241
<i>He packed up and resigned.</i>

975
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,109
<i>I wasn't his project</i>

976
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,079
<i>I was his liability.</i>

977
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:45,921
<i>The school infirmary said I was having
a panic attack and called my mother.</i>

978
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,055
<i>I'd never been so happy
to see Ingrid.</i>

979
01:03:48,056 --> 01:03:50,325
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

980
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,460
-And you are?
-I'm Alex.

981
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:55,462
It's really nice to meet you,
Mrs. Hammel.

982
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,900
Did you mention
it to her yet?

983
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,270
Mentioned what?

984
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:05,842
Don't worry,
we're not getting married.

985
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,544
<i>-She's joking.
-You could do a lot worse.</i>

986
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,546
Well, that's really nice
of you, Mrs. Hammel.

987
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:15,082
Thank you.
You must be so proud of Toby.

988
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,417
He's pretty much taken over
a Sage Hall.

989
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:20,888
Yeah. We'll see you
tomorrow, Alex.

990
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:24,259
Toby want's to ask if he can join
me in Palm Beach for Thanksgiving.

991
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,365
Palm Beach?

992
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:33,167
No, I'm gonna be home.

993
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:34,935
I'm gonna be home
for Thanksgiving.

994
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:36,904
See my dad
really wants to meet him

995
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,906
and all the Thurmond kids
are gonna be there

996
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:40,241
so it'll be really fun.

997
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:43,977
The Thurmond? -Storm Thurmond,
the senator of South Carolina.

998
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:45,980
<i>He and daddy are really close.</i>

999
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,317
Thank you, Alex,
but I just...

1000
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:51,186
I don't... I don't feel like

1001
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:55,055
making any... any trips...
right now.

1002
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:59,093
<i>I gotta lot of homework to do.
Four files are coming up and...</i>

1003
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,529
Why don't I talk
to Toby's father about it?

1004
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,999
But, you know, the expensive, it
probably makes it out of the question.

1005
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,334
<i>Don't worry.
The tickets are totally free.</i>

1006
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:10,505
Daddy has more frequent-flyer miles
that he knows what to do with.

1007
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,942
<i>It was really lovely
to meet you.</i>

1008
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:16,143
You too.

1009
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:17,445
-Bye.
-Bye.

1010
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:21,015
What?

1011
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,985
Florida, Palm Beach.

1012
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:36,663
<i>She wanted me to go.
She encouraged it.</i>

1013
01:05:36,664 --> 01:05:38,700
<i>She even used the money
that I send her to buy me</i>

1014
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,002
<i>a gift for the trip.</i>

1015
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,303
Mom, you can't afford this.

1016
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:44,606
Yes, I can.

1017
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,508
Go, be with her.

1018
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:49,177
Enjoy yourself.

1019
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:25,748
I meant to call.

1020
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:33,087
I can buy another room

1021
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,057
and get us
the honeymoon suite.

1022
01:06:37,425 --> 01:06:38,760
<i>She was fucking with me.</i>

1023
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,398
<i>Alex toyed with me people...</i>

1024
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:45,333
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

1025
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:03,753
Thanks.

1026
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:10,625
Play me something.

1027
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,460
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1028
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:15,495
I'm not very good.

1029
01:07:15,496 --> 01:07:16,632
Come on.

1030
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:28,043
What's that?

1031
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:31,412
It's a song.

1032
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:32,748
Really?

1033
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:09,536
That's why we're
the dealers.

1034
01:10:09,537 --> 01:10:10,672
It's in that room.

1035
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:12,807
I can't.

1036
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:18,578
Yes. Hi.

1037
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,447
<i>In two hours? Okay.</i>

1038
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:22,451
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.</i>

1039
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,489
Where do they
want to meet us?

1040
01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:30,626
Us?

1041
01:10:31,525 --> 01:10:33,560
<i>Raoul wanted me
to meet him at a party</i>

1042
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:35,497
<i>he ran near his place
in Al Borde.</i>

1043
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:52,247
Welcome.

1044
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:57,585
You got my money?

1045
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,618
Yeah.

1046
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:00,622
Do you have the stuff?

1047
01:11:02,556 --> 01:11:04,858
Same old gringo.

1048
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,359
Well, this time

1049
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,629
<i>you brought la rubia.</i>

1050
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,733
You didn't tell me
she was so sexy.

1051
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:13,901
Come.

1052
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,836
I don't walk around
with three kilos.

1053
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:18,806
<i>Let's have some fun.</i>

1054
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,444
Then you're going
to enjoy this party.

1055
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:41,728
<i>Raoul brought us
to his 24 hour party</i>

1056
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:43,997
<i>while he went off
to get the coke.</i>

1057
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:44,999
<i>He said it was all
there for us.</i>

1058
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,667
<i>Whatever we wanted.</i>

1059
01:12:49,463 --> 01:12:51,599
The guy who owns this place.

1060
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,800
The guy who owns this house!

1061
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,803
Where did he go?
Does anyone who know.

1062
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:56,804
Does anyone know
where Raoul went?

1063
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:57,971
Fuck, I have to find...

1064
01:12:57,972 --> 01:13:00,140
What? What?

1065
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:01,577
What?
Stop. No. No.

1066
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:23,042
Hey, Calista.

1067
01:16:23,043 --> 01:16:25,179
Is, is Alex home?

1068
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,680
No, Mr. Ellis.

1069
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:29,950
Well, will you be

1070
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:31,218
expecting her home soon?

1071
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,587
<i>No, Mr. Ellis.</i>

1072
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,224
<i>Why not? Where is she?</i>

1073
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,193
<i>She said she was spending</i>

1074
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,329
<i>the break with a friend.</i>

1075
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:49,203
May I use your phone?

1076
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:14,228
Get rid of it.

1077
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,830
-What?
-Right before, before we land.

1078
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:19,832
Go to the bathroom
and get rid of it.

1079
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:22,068
Why?

1080
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:24,404
I have a terrible feeling.

1081
01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:27,374
I don't want any part of this.

1082
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,310
We don't need it, Toby.

1083
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,655
<i>-And what about Ellis?
-What about it.</i>

1084
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,356
Please, get rid of it.

1085
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,729
Please.
That's what you want?

1086
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:50,865
Yes.

1087
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:05,245
Yes, hello, I'd like
to speak to Dr. Fielding.

1088
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:07,682
Yes, it's Ellis Tynes.

1089
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:10,351
It's important.

1090
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:12,888
Okay.

1091
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:14,456
Okay.

1092
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:17,826
Yeah.

1093
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,465
Excuse me, I need
to use the restroom.

1094
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,834
Sure.

1095
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:38,833
<i>-This one?
-Yeah.</i>

1096
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:44,605
Ready?

1097
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,967
Are you Tobias Hammel?

1098
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,233
-Yeah.
-DEA.

1099
01:21:14,234 --> 01:21:15,936
<i>Come with us, please.</i>

1100
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:20,072
Excuse me,
please tell me, what's...

1101
01:21:20,073 --> 01:21:21,407
What's going on?

1102
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:24,044
<i>Just gonna take a little
look through your things.</i>

1103
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,413
-Stay here.
-What's going on?

1104
01:21:31,618 --> 01:21:33,920
You're under arrest
for the possession of narcotics.

1105
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:35,354
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

1106
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:37,323
<i>Anything you say can
or will be used against you</i>

1107
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:38,457
<i>in a court of law.</i>

1108
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:39,660
Toby, what's...

1109
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,630
Toby, what's going on?

1110
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,001
<i>Let's take him.</i>

1111
01:21:48,002 --> 01:21:49,971
Toby!

1112
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:53,307
Toby!

1113
01:22:01,615 --> 01:22:04,550
They're saying he's going
to be tried as an adult.

1114
01:22:04,551 --> 01:22:05,952
He's gonna do
anything he can

1115
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,554
to get himself out of this!

1116
01:22:08,555 --> 01:22:10,957
He's gonna rat us out, Ellis.

1117
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,093
All of us.

1118
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,562
Doesn't matter.

1119
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,099
<i>How can you be so fucking
casual about this?</i>

1120
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,303
Don't you know that if Fielding
finds out...

1121
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:25,206
He finds out we're in on this,
we're fucked.

1122
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,009
Doesn't matter.

1123
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:30,612
Why not?

1124
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:33,447
Because,

1125
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:36,316
headmaster already knows.

1126
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:39,688
A... and how does the
headmaster already know, Ellis?

1127
01:22:41,322 --> 01:22:43,991
I covered our asses.

1128
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,059
You covered our asses?

1129
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:48,327
What does that mean?

1130
01:22:48,328 --> 01:22:50,263
I told them
what Toby was doing.

1131
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:52,431
Got the DEA involved.

1132
01:22:52,432 --> 01:22:53,733
So it's,

1133
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:56,169
it's a criminal matter.

1134
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,105
<i>It's on him.</i>

1135
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:00,975
You ratted Toby out.

1136
01:23:02,676 --> 01:23:04,211
It was you.

1137
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,214
Fuckin' scumbag.

1138
01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:09,583
Hey, man, look...

1139
01:23:12,086 --> 01:23:14,321
We'll get off with no more
than suspensions.

1140
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,488
Okay.

1141
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:16,757
It's gonna be cool.

1142
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:20,127
What about Alex?

1143
01:23:23,463 --> 01:23:25,331
<i>What the fuck.</i>

1144
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:27,268
My parents are gonna shit.

1145
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,271
There goes fucking Yale.

1146
01:23:34,775 --> 01:23:37,412
You were never
Yale material, Benny.

1147
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:43,116
<i>-Laura.
-Get away from me!</i>

1148
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:45,286
-Laura.
-No, leave me alone!

1149
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,727
You made it, cunt.

1150
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,129
<i>We understand the defendant's
prior lack of any record</i>

1151
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:58,665
In this young age,
your honor.

1152
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,268
But we believe the amount
of the illegal substance

1153
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,803
ceased is significant enough...

1154
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,407
<i>I was being charged
with federal drug trafficking.</i>

1155
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:12,813
<i>Word of what I had done
had spread across the country.</i>

1156
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,682
<i>And after "60 minutes"
picked up a story</i>

1157
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,649
<i>it was a national scandal.</i>

1158
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:17,751
Hi, Mary.

1159
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:19,786
I need to speak
with my mom, please.

1160
01:24:19,787 --> 01:24:21,289
Well, I don't care
if she's in a meeting.

1161
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,390
I need you to go get her, I...

1162
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:27,061
It's really important.

1163
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,597
Hey, have you seen Laura?

1164
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,510
<i>No one was safe now.</i>

1165
01:24:44,511 --> 01:24:45,578
<i>There was nowhere to hide.</i>

1166
01:24:45,579 --> 01:24:48,082
Okay. Okay.
Can I talk to my dad?

1167
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,117
Headmaster Fielding.

1168
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,184
Hi, I'm Ed Bradley
from "60 minutes."

1169
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:54,187
I have a few questions for you,
I'd like you to answer

1170
01:24:54,188 --> 01:24:56,288
do you have a minute?

1171
01:24:56,289 --> 01:25:00,160
<i>He had no idea how many students
in the schools were involved.</i>

1172
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,696
<i>Scope of it was overwhelming.</i>

1173
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,132
Concerning this issue,

1174
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:05,831
it's under investigation.

1175
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:06,867
We're looking at the facts.

1176
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,135
No.

1177
01:25:09,136 --> 01:25:09,871
No message.

1178
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,743
<i>The press was in a frenzy.</i>

1179
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:19,345
<i>I brought the scourge
of cocaine</i>

1180
01:25:19,346 --> 01:25:22,749
<i>into the midst of America's
most privileged progeny.</i>

1181
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,684
<i>The white kids were in danger.</i>

1182
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:26,721
But this
is a major investigation.

1183
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,790
-You have a good day.
-Dr. Fielding? Dr. Fielding?

1184
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,300
<i>Everyone was feeling.</i>

1185
01:25:41,301 --> 01:25:44,770
<i>Trying to stay ahead of what
was about to happen.</i>

1186
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:47,141
<i>But not everyone
could outrun it.</i>

1187
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,149
<i>Laura disappeared
for two days.</i>

1188
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:56,916
<i>Ben searched everywhere
for her</i>

1189
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,621
<i>but he wasn't the one
who found her.</i>

1190
01:26:24,945 --> 01:26:28,615
You fuck.
You killed her! You fuck!

1191
01:27:01,314 --> 01:27:05,452
<i>No, this judge, he wanted
to teach you a lesson.</i>

1192
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:07,953
<i>And our attorney is hopeful</i>

1193
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:11,724
that after little time,
he might grant bail.

1194
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:12,992
We'll have to put up
the house to cover it.

1195
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:14,228
Okay.

1196
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,297
I'm sorry.

1197
01:27:18,298 --> 01:27:22,469
You're going to have to make
a full confession.

1198
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,938
<i>You give him the names
of everyone that's involved</i>

1199
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:28,675
<i>and you might be able
to get some years back.</i>

1200
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,645
Toby, did you hear me?

1201
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:34,481
It was me.

1202
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:38,617
It was all me.

1203
01:27:38,618 --> 01:27:41,888
<i>I bought it, I smuggled it in.
I brought it to...</i>

1204
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,622
No, stop it, stop it,
right this instant.

1205
01:27:43,623 --> 01:27:45,626
And Laura died because of me.

1206
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:48,795
No.

1207
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,904
Where's Alex?

1208
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:03,309
Alex... What?

1209
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,312
Who's Alex?

1210
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,380
<i>It's the girl.
He's asking about the girl.</i>

1211
01:28:07,381 --> 01:28:09,049
Okay.

1212
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,884
Her father made a deal.

1213
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:14,019
If she stays in South Carolina,
she will not be extradited.

1214
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:14,921
Do you see?

1215
01:28:14,922 --> 01:28:17,056
And difference between us
and them...

1216
01:28:17,057 --> 01:28:18,625
Enough. That's enough.

1217
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,327
<i>The difference between us
and them.</i>

1218
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:23,862
She's okay?
Yes, yes.

1219
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:25,799
<i>I'd understood
that a long time ago.</i>

1220
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,801
<i>I saw it.
I'd measured it in grams.</i>

1221
01:28:28,802 --> 01:28:31,470
<i>But I don't think
Ingrid ever understood it.</i>

1222
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:33,440
Why didn't you dump it?

1223
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,378
I'm sorry.

1224
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:45,050
<i>I have to go.
Toby.</i>

1225
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:47,454
I'm sorry, mom, I have to go.

1226
01:29:37,137 --> 01:29:41,376
<i>No more lies,
only medical grade truth now.</i>

1227
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:45,111
<i>Mike and Ingrid split up.</i>

1228
01:29:45,112 --> 01:29:46,979
<i>Ingrid felt someone
had to be responsible</i>

1229
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,482
<i>for the monster I had become.</i>

1230
01:29:49,483 --> 01:29:52,484
<i>Ellis and Ben got expelled
with a whole bunch of people.</i>

1231
01:29:52,485 --> 01:29:55,390
<i>But Ellis' preordained path
wasn't altered one bit.</i>

1232
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,724
<i>Ben never got over Laura</i>

1233
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,126
<i>and I heard he dropped out
of the whole scene.</i>

1234
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:03,595
<i>It was my fault, all of it.</i>

1235
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:06,131
<i>When I look back at it,
now I have this funny feeling</i>

1236
01:30:06,132 --> 01:30:09,635
<i>remembering it all
while it was happening.</i>

1237
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:12,072
<i>Like a dream I couldn't stop
until I got to the end.</i>

1238
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:14,974
<i>Until I got caught.</i>

1239
01:30:14,975 --> 01:30:19,112
<i>And I know I'm supposed to feel
bad and tell everyone I'm sorry</i>

1240
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,781
<i>and I am for everything.</i>

1241
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:24,751
<i>But the truth is I miss it.</i>

1242
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,488
<i>Everything, everyone,
even Ellis.</i>

1243
01:30:28,521 --> 01:30:30,490
<i>I miss the moment
I had with her.</i>

1244
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,626
<i>And that's all I'll ever have.</i>

1245
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:36,563
<i>Because I never saw
Alex again.</i>

1246
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:59,186
Last spring, a student at one
of America's most prestigious

1247
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:01,554
prep schools,
Choate Rosemary Hall

1248
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:04,090
was arrested by police
at Kennedy Airport

1249
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:07,961
as he was returning
with $300,000 worth of cocaine.

1250
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,630
There was a lot of drug use.

1251
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,165
There were... there were
certain rooms

1252
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,701
where people would go
to a smoke or to drink.

1253
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,035
<i>The dorms were usually be</i>

1254
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:18,237
drug dorms
or not drug dorms.

1255
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:20,672
Or drinking dorms
or not drinking dorms.

1256
01:31:20,673 --> 01:31:23,175
<i>I assume that you no more
than I wish to be identified</i>

1257
01:31:23,176 --> 01:31:26,813
<i>with the newspaper language
used to invite us all</i>

1258
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:29,816
<i>spoilt preppies,
too much privilege,</i>

1259
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,084
<i>too much cash,</i>

1260
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:35,255
<i>adolescent pawns for criminals,
self-centered elites...</i>

1261
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,124
With about twice
as much money collected

1262
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:40,126
from even more students
would once again

1263
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,961
board a plane
with the cocaine hidden

1264
01:31:42,962 --> 01:31:46,131
but this time,
his luck was about to run out.

1265
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:48,268
We picked up the bags
and started to walk

1266
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:49,836
towards the checkout door

1267
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:53,273
and immediately we were stopped
by some of the badge.

1268
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:55,543
What did you think
when they put those cuffs?

1269
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:57,511
I felt really destroyed.

1270
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,151
I felt completely at the mercy.

1271
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:06,853
I mean, five minutes
before I thought

1272
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:08,888
I was on top of the world.

1273
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:11,157
And I was all set nothing
ever gonna get to me.

1274
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:14,161
And five minutes later,
I had no power.
