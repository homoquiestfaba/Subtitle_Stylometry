1
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,089
Hey, sweetie.

2
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:09,995
I'm at the farmhouse. Can't you tell?
Barely getting a signal.

3
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,664
Are you on your way?

4
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,504
Doug?

5
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,709
Okay.

6
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,882
God. Every time it rains.

7
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,471
Jesus.

8
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,249
Hello?

9
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,871
Is someone there?

10
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,030
Stop being such a wuss, Lori.
There's no one here.

11
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,385
Hello?

12
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,862
Is someone in there?

13
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,737
Oh, God! Doug!

14
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,105
What are you doing?

15
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:37,042
- I could've killed you! -How? With
your little key-in-the-fist trick?

16
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,010
Where is your car?

17
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,711
Behind the barn. I wasn't
gonna park next to you.

18
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:44,883
So you just drove all the way up here, so
you could wait in the dark and yell, "Boo"?

19
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,389
Real mature.

20
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,229
Boo.

21
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,537
Oh, my God!

22
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,974
This is exactly what we wanted.

23
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,149
Oh.

24
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,451
Big night planned?

25
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,020
Something like that.

26
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,792
Oh, wow.

27
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,729
I'm moving up here.

28
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,563
What?

29
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,170
I've gone stir-crazy since
I sold the company.

30
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:35,500
I need something to do.

31
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,304
I mean, plus, do you have any idea how
much faster this place is gonna get done,

32
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,139
if we move up here full-time?

33
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,274
Yeah.

34
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,043
You here alone?
By yourself every day?

35
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,379
You're gonna go nuts.

36
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,119
If we set up full-time?

37
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,788
Seriously?

38
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,378
Lori,

39
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,015
you are the most
perfect person for me.

40
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,353
And when I picture my life...

41
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,323
When I picture the future,

42
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,960
there's no version
that doesn't have you.

43
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,630
I promise,

44
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,700
wherever fate may take us,

45
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,370
it'll be together.

46
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,309
Will you marry me?

47
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,113
Yes.

48
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,244
I think the rose petals
were a bit much.

49
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,589
Hey!

50
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,791
You just going
to the hardware store?

51
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,226
Yeah, you need me
to pick something up?

52
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:45,230
No, I just thought
you might need your, uh...

53
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,500
You think?

54
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,471
Thanks.

55
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,280
Come here.

56
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,450
- Why?
- Just do it.

57
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,193
What do you want?

58
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,762
A little closer.

59
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,135
Tell me why.

60
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,507
No, stop!

61
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,009
Stop!

62
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,613
- Douger. How ya doin'?
- Hey, man, how are you?

63
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,348
- I got that stuff here for ya.
- Thanks.

64
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,150
Hey, you still plugging away
at that old rat trap up there?

65
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,487
Yeah. I'm actually moving up
there full-time pretty soon.

66
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,690
Really? Funny,
you don't look suicidal.

67
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,894
But, hey, everyone needs
a hobby, right?

68
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,961
Say, do you know Woody?

69
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:54,799
Woody, this is Doug. He just bought
the old Hegeman mansion up there.

70
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,135
Hegeman mansion?

71
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,770
True story.

72
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,238
That Hegeman widow?

73
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,807
She was one of the first
serial killers.

74
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,510
Oh, yeah, the, uh...
The urban legend.

75
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,711
It's not a frickin' legend.

76
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,948
Ilsa Hegeman brought over
young maids from Ireland

77
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,284
and killed them
in her basement.

78
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,487
- Get the hell out of there.
- Okay, okay.

79
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,557
No. She put a curse
on that place.

80
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,959
It sucks you in.
Gets a hold of you.

81
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,361
Thanks for the drama, Woody.

82
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,599
TJ's got that stuff on the back
dock, why don't you go take a look?

83
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,069
Listen to me.

84
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,979
Oh, come on!

85
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,663
I'm so sorry to bother you with this.
I'm just not mechanically inclined.

86
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,700
And I walked out
without my cell phone.

87
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,102
This is like
the last thing that I needed.

88
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,605
Your dad never taught you
to change a tire?

89
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,406
Uh, no.

90
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,342
Well, come watch me do this.

91
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,110
It's good to know, in case
you get stranded somewhere

92
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,480
without a handsome stranger
to help you out.

93
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,883
Yeah, or you.

94
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,153
Seriously, though, thank you.

95
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,923
Oh, uh, Doug.

96
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,992
Jamie.

97
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,426
- I'm sorry.
- That's...

98
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,630
So you live up at the
big old farmhouse, right?

99
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,200
- You a cop?

100
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,303
No, I, um...
I go jogging there every day.

101
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,338
I've seen you out working
a couple of times.

102
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,442
Yeah, it's really just a weekend
fixer-upper for us right now.

103
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,145
- Oh, are you...
- And you're done.

104
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,285
Thank you so much.

105
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,887
No worries.

106
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,956
- Here.
- Thanks.

107
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,126
So what do I owe you?

108
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,995
- First visit's free.
- No, seriously, I...

109
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,999
Don't worry about it.
Just repay the favor someday.

110
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,969
Well, thanks again.

111
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,739
You didn't learn
anything there, did you?

112
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,575
Uh, I could, like, lie to you.

113
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,746
Take care.

114
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,857
- Oh, God!

115
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,193
How long have you been
standing there?

116
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,961
Long enough.

117
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,130
Store took a while, huh?

118
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,567
Yeah. I had to stop and help a
girl with a flat on the way back.

119
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,204
Oh, yeah?
Little damsel in distress?

120
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,839
Aren't they all?

121
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,807
No.

122
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,212
Hey, we're gonna be late!

123
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,950
Lori, you ready?
We gotta get going!

124
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,785
I'm putting my shoes on!

125
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,996
- Lori!
- Coming!

126
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,508
- Hey!
- Hey!

127
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,978
Welcome back to civilization!
Hey, good to see ya.

128
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,780
So tell me, how's that little
shack in the woods?

129
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,581
Seriously, I still don't know
why you bought that shithole.

130
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,718
- To get away from you. -Oh, my God,
that's totally such a valid point here.

131
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,854
Look at this. The blushing bride.
How ya doin'?

132
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,189
So tell me everything
that happened.

133
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,524
Did he do a good job
with the proposal?

134
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,260
Did he do the rose petals?
'Cause that was...

135
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,128
Dude, that's next week.

136
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,430
Um...

137
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,199
You're an asshole.

138
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,400
Well, okay, you know what?
Look, it's not too late, okay?

139
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,738
We can run away together, get a little
place in the islands, just you and me.

140
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,339
Let me see it!

141
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,276
- Present the rock.
- Hey, Nay.

142
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,577
Ooh.

143
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,280
Round cut, good clarity.

144
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,714
Classic.

145
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,515
Good job.

146
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,885
Tomorrow we'll get it appraised.
Make sure it ain't fugaze.

147
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,020
Hey, Doug.

148
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,222
- For God's sake, Naomi.
- I ams what I ams.

149
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,490
I know. And I love your yams.

150
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,560
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Then springs
for the rings, <i> amigo.</i>

151
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,562
What are you doing? What are you,
like doing the Heisman here.

152
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,564
Yeah, I'm trying to show you
there's something missing.

153
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,599
Oh, is that right? Yes, there
is something missing, actually.

154
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,167
- It's the food.
- You guys ready to eat?

155
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,269
- I thought we were just grabbing drinks.
- No, no, no.

156
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,838
No, I got us a table.
Come on. Right this way.

157
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,607
Come right along.
Move it along.

158
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,309
Move it along.

159
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,778
Surprise!

160
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,947
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

161
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:14,319
to announce our newly engaged
friends, Doug and Lori!

162
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,755
All right, all right.

163
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,092
There you go, of course,
of course, absolutely.

164
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,428
And don't forget about you.

165
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,064
Doug.

166
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,699
Lori.

167
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,602
May the joy that you feel today

168
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,471
only be a fraction
of what's to come.

169
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,208
And as they say
in the old country,

170
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,279
here is to our wives
and our girlfriends.

171
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,482
May they never meet!

172
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,251
Cheers.

173
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,289
Wait, wait.

174
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,157
We need a picture.

175
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,793
All right.

176
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,232
Well, give us something good!
Kiss her!

177
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,838
Let's see the ring!

178
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,909
So he parked behind the barn
and surprised you?

179
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,511
He did, it was really cute.

180
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,347
- Fuck.
- What?

181
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,183
Alan.

182
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,218
What is he doing here?
Did you invite him?

183
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,342
We were talking about the
surprise party at work.

184
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,488
No, you didn't tell him.

185
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,790
- He overheard... Oh, my
God, he's coming over here.

186
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,426
Hey, hey, hey, there she is.

187
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,895
Alan, what are you doing here?

188
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,797
What? I can't come by
to congratulate you?

189
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,700
- You know, you could've invited me.
- Okay, can you please leave?

190
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,869
- Just could you... -Whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax, listen.

191
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,570
I just wanted to see you, okay?

192
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:43,841
I just wanted to...
Oh, hey, the lucky guy!

193
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,611
- What's going on?
- Congratulations.

194
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,682
- Doug, please don't.
- Oh, he's scrappy.

195
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:51,649
Why are you here, Alan?

196
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,818
Well, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

197
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,989
I mean, the course of true love
never did run smooth and all.

198
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,959
You have a lovely bride.

199
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,727
And Lori, well,

200
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,630
you could have been
with a future Congressman,

201
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,498
but instead...

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,569
Hmm. But I understand the two
of you acquired a nice little

203
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,305
fixer-upper in the country.

204
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,542
- Bravo.
- Hey, hey, hey.

205
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,712
- Is everything okay here?
- Yeah.

206
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,014
Alan was just leaving.

207
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,686
Yeah, so I was.

208
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,792
Lori, when this whole thing
falls apart,

209
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,494
and it will,

210
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,563
you look me up.

211
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,499
Doug.

212
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,703
Joke.

213
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,321
You want to talk about it?

214
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,890
I thought that was over.

215
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,357
It is.

216
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,396
It's been over. It was never really
even a thing in the first place.

217
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:11,863
Really?

218
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,567
'Cause those text messages I saw
sure made it seem like a thing.

219
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,170
Seriously, Doug?
I thought we were past this.

220
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,273
It was a year ago.
Nothing happened.

221
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,942
It was just some text messages.

222
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,049
I don't know
what else I can do.

223
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,152
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

224
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,720
And I know it's not an excuse,

225
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,623
but you were completely
wrapped up in work.

226
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,631
How long are you gonna
punish me for this?

227
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,432
I don't know.

228
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:51,602
How long will your ex-boyfriend be
showing up at our engagement parties?

229
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,472
Please don't be like this.

230
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,508
I don't want to be. You think
I like being this way?

231
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,210
I love you.

232
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:03,047
We're getting married. Doesn't
that count for anything?

233
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,719
I don't know.

234
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,291
Do you trust me?

235
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,596
Doug?

236
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,965
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

237
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,513
Slow down, Doug.

238
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,518
Doug, please slow down.

239
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,636
<i>So how much more packing?</i>

240
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,073
Just this and the bedroom.

241
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,178
Well, the bedroom's packed.

242
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,952
Look, don't go up there.

243
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,687
Just stay at my place
for a while.

244
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,691
You go out to that house and you're
gonna be surrounded by nothing but her.

245
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,526
And I'm not now?

246
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,030
What about the therapy?

247
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:03,100
You know, for your, um...
Your injury.

248
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,802
I'm fine.

249
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,741
What I don't need is a bunch of
people looking at me with pity.

250
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,711
Hey, man, look, come on.

251
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,080
It wasn't your fault.

252
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,349
It was an accident.

253
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,852
I know that you feel terrible,
but you can't dwell on it.

254
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,523
You have to move forward. You
can't just live in the past.

255
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,858
I'm not living in the past.

256
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,461
It's only been six weeks.

257
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,167
I just want to finish
the house the way Lori wanted.

258
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,104
<i>Hey, man, look,</i>
<i>I mean, we all miss Lori.</i>

259
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,068
Hello?

260
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,008
Someone there?

261
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,531
How's everything tonight?

262
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,166
Uh, okay.

263
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,535
I just needed
to get out of the house.

264
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,738
Little stir-crazy?

265
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,842
What can I get ya?

266
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,610
Scotch and soda.

267
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,852
Heard about your lady.

268
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,388
Condolences.

269
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,995
How's the house?

270
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,731
Seen anything yet?

271
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,167
Like what?

272
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,972
Like the old lady?

273
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,544
She was a nurse
in the Civil War.

274
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,314
After the war,
she come back here,

275
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,083
her whole family's gone.

276
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:09,253
Husband, the father,
dead in the war.

277
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:12,423
Mother and sister died
of influenza.

278
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,194
She took over the big house,

279
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,430
shut down the farm.

280
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:24,468
She placed ads for servants
in the newspapers in Ireland.

281
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,639
People would see the girls
at the train station.

282
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,408
They go up to the house to work

283
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,744
and then, poof!

284
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,580
Nobody ever sees them
ever again.

285
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,817
- Last call.
- Yeah.

286
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,522
So what happened
to the servants?

287
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,225
They worked for a while.

288
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,930
Then, one night when they're sleeping,
she comes at them with ether.

289
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,732
They wake up in the basement.

290
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:59,269
She'd keep them locked up in there,
so she could hear them screaming.

291
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:03,507
Then, when she felt like it,
when she'd heard enough,

292
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,244
she had this gas tap
she installed.

293
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,614
She'd turn it on

294
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:14,151
and listen
until the screaming died out.

295
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,357
How do you know
so much about this?

296
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,761
My brother used to
own that house.

297
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,296
Really?

298
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,968
I'd love to talk
to him about it.

299
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,738
- What?
- He died.

300
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,375
1970. In that house.

301
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,582
I'm sorry to hear that.

302
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,789
In the middle of the night,

303
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,626
his teenaged daughter
took an ax,

304
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,296
killed him,

305
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,467
killed my sister-in-law
as they slept.

306
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,639
Killed her little sister.

307
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,311
And used a shotgun on herself.

308
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,082
Oh, my God.

309
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,689
That house
took control of his mind.

310
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,459
My niece was an angel

311
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,628
the day they moved
into that house,

312
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,766
but in a couple of months,
she was different.

313
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,372
Right hand to God,

314
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,242
that house

315
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,111
is what made her...

316
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,273
Hello?

317
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,981
Hello?

318
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,619
Anyone here?

319
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,693
Lori!

320
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,265
Where are you?

321
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,375
I'm sorry!

322
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,931
I knocked.

323
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,799
Yeah.

324
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,670
Please don't ever
do that again.

325
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,807
How's the work comin' up here?

326
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,777
Good. So far so good.

327
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,077
Good.

328
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,514
Well, you know, maybe it'd be a good
idea then to get away for a while.

329
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:32,582
You know,
maybe get back in the game.

330
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,651
I got a couple deals cookin'.

331
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,854
I wanna get this done.
I can't leave yet.

332
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,957
Yeah.

333
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,528
What is, uh... What's this?

334
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,497
Uh, a gift.

335
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,600
Grad student
lives down the street.

336
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,104
Really?

337
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,906
It's not like that.

338
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,875
I helped her with a flat tire.

339
00:32:59,077 --> 00:32:59,977
Oh.

340
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,279
Yeah, well, you know, I mean,

341
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,314
that's good, that's good.

342
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,385
It's good to make some friends up here.
Someone to talk to.

343
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,163
- Who are you?

344
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,799
Jesus!
You scared me to pieces.

345
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,335
- Who are you?

346
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,737
Keep quiet, you'll wake her.

347
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,175
Please, help me.

348
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,779
She's going to kill me,
I know it.

349
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,783
For the love of God,
find someone to help me.

350
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,787
Patricia!

351
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,857
Please.

352
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,561
Coming, ma'am!

353
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,847
Hi.

354
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,118
I just wanted to see
if you got the pie I made you.

355
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,827
I'm so sorry.

356
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,963
How did it...

357
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,100
- I mean...
- Car accident.

358
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,671
Oh, my God. That's horrible.

359
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,242
So why are you up here
all alone?

360
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,011
Shouldn't you be
with your family?

361
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,949
My mom passed away.

362
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,518
My dad...

363
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Who knows where he is.

364
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,857
It's hard when you lose
someone young.

365
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:31,027
It's like you have to mourn the life
you were going to have together.

366
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,333
Sometimes I feel
like she's still here.

367
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,037
That's totally normal.

368
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,840
Is it?

369
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,776
It doesn't feel normal.

370
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,149
Feels like my mind's
playing tricks on me.

371
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,854
You should spend time
with other people.

372
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,957
That's what Connor says.

373
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,392
Well, yeah.

374
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,562
Too much time alone,
you get stuck up in your head.

375
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,999
Your brain becomes like a maze.

376
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,771
So what about you?
What's your deal?

377
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:19,376
Well, I get my master's degree
in May.

378
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,444
Family therapy.

379
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:25,081
Just the person I needed
to be talking to.

380
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,852
Yeah, right.

381
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,388
So what do you do?

382
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,194
Before the accident,

383
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,429
I was in finance.

384
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah, we basically bought
the entire estate as is.

385
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,403
- Pretty impulsive, I guess.
- No.

386
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:49,706
All these old buildings,
the history.

387
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,577
If I lived here,
I'd never want to leave.

388
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,381
So when will you be finished
with all the restoration?

389
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,318
I don't know. A while.

390
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,555
I'm talking too much.
I'm sorry.

391
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,958
No. It's fine.

392
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,363
Listen, I feel like I need
to tell you something.

393
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,402
I appreciate you
coming over here

394
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,838
with the pie and everything.

395
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,275
And I don't know
what you're thinking,

396
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,044
but I need to let you know
that I'm not interested

397
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:32,082
in any sort of dating
or relationship or anything.

398
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:37,754
Oh, no. Look, I'm not in any way
capable of dating anyone right now.

399
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,326
I just thought we could,

400
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,396
you know, be friends.

401
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,967
You seem like you could
use someone to talk to,

402
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,170
and I probably could, too.

403
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,444
Anyway, I should get going.

404
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,985
I want to get a run in
before it gets dark.

405
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,353
Okay.

406
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,657
Well, thanks again for the pie.

407
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,292
No problem.

408
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,663
Hey, wait.

409
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,769
I think I really could
use a friend.

410
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,696
<i>Do you miss me?</i>

411
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,565
<i>I do.</i>

412
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,268
<i>I miss you, Doug.</i>

413
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,671
<i>I'm falling apart.</i>

414
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,642
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what's real anymore.</i>

415
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,911
<i>Are you okay?</i>

416
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,046
Lori?

417
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,283
Connor? Connor?

418
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,887
It's Doug. I don't know,
he's talking to himself.

419
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,260
- Doug?
<i>- Connor?</i>

420
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,429
<i>What is it?</i>

421
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,799
You called here.
Is everything okay?

422
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:37,934
I'm fine.

423
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,005
- Look, I'm coming out there.
- Don't. I'm fine.

424
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,742
Just go back to sleep.

425
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,330
Just so you know, I'm not
stalking you or anything.

426
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,366
You okay?

427
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,002
Yeah, I just...

428
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,740
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

429
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:29,546
Listen, if I have to eat dinner alone
one more night, I'm going to go nuts.

430
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:33,283
Let me cook dinner for you
tomorrow night. Around 5:00?

431
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,418
Do us both some good.

432
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,722
- I couldn't ask you...
- That's why I'm asking you.

433
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,193
I'll take that as a "yes."

434
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,955
Big night planned?

435
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,491
Something like that.

436
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,617
Is this why you killed me?

437
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,052
Stay away from him!

438
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,634
She's late.

439
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,027
Lori?

440
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,351
Hello?

441
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,058
Hey, what are you doing?

442
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,502
Please, please! Let me out!

443
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,903
Please!

444
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,038
Come on!

445
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,289
Jesus.

446
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,494
Help me.

447
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,880
<i>I'm sorry about today.</i>

448
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,550
<i>Where were you?</i>

449
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,187
I was home. I heard you.

450
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,588
<i>Oh.</i>

451
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,127
I wouldn't have been
a very good host.

452
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,862
<i>Why?</i>

453
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,965
I was thinking about Lori.

454
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,738
Anyway,
I just wanted to apologize.

455
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,508
I hope you weren't too upset.

456
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,245
I poured my angst out
into my diary.

457
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,384
I'll get over it.

458
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,790
If you still want to come by,
I'm free tomorrow.

459
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,760
<i>I promise to answer</i>
<i>the door this time.</i>

460
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,498
<i>Your turn to sweat.</i>

461
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,772
So you've actually seen her?

462
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,075
The widow?

463
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,778
I don't know, maybe.

464
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,350
It could be a lot of things. You've
been through so much stress.

465
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,620
You're cooped up there
all alone.

466
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,758
This old guy, Woody,

467
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,794
he thinks the place is haunted.

468
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,798
Maybe it's putting thoughts
in my head.

469
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,738
Uh-oh.

470
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,107
You know what?

471
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,843
I've got an idea.

472
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,399
Doug! It's ready!

473
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,410
Smells great.

474
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,315
Here's what we're going to do.

475
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,750
Slumber party.
We stay up all night,

476
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:16,986
wait for the ghosts
to come out.

477
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,822
It'll be fun.

478
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,029
Every time it rains.

479
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,899
The place looks great.

480
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,536
Sure, by candlelight.

481
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:36,172
How's the renovations going?

482
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:39,241
It's slow. A lot of work.

483
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,050
So...

484
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,720
Ghosts.

485
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,322
Where are we looking?

486
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,596
Seriously?

487
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,033
Down here?

488
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,506
Oh, my God.

489
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,353
Could you have
a creepier basement?

490
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,425
- I don't know.

491
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:30,359
Oh, my God!

492
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,229
- I'm sorry. -You scared
the shit out of me.

493
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:34,630
Sorry.

494
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,969
This place is horrible.

495
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,272
But no ghosts.

496
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:47,777
I hate to break it to you,
but so far, you're crazy.

497
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,580
Thanks.

498
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,817
So what about you?

499
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,087
What do you mean?

500
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:02,024
Well, you don't talk about
yourself much.

501
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,126
You picked up on that, huh?

502
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:09,999
I don't like to talk much
about my personal stuff.

503
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,102
Yeah, I kinda got that.

504
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,870
It's cool. I mean...

505
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:19,175
You're here trying to help me figure
out if my house is haunted, so...

506
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,110
We all have issues.

507
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,147
No. I need to be
more open with you.

508
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,683
Or, like, in general.

509
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:32,721
Let's just say I'm attracted
to the wrong type of guy.

510
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,429
I grew up in Arizona.

511
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,466
My dad was a contractor.

512
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,769
Sometimes.
Mostly he sold drugs.

513
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,673
Coke, meth, oxy.

514
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,845
My mom tried
to take care of us,

515
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,814
but I think she was
from an abusive family.

516
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,385
In any case, she was in
an abusive marriage.

517
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,321
He beat her,

518
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,857
beat me up.

519
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,926
Begged us to forgive him.

520
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,264
I'm sure you know Chapter 2. A
series of fucked-up boyfriends.

521
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:16,465
A constant search
for a new daddy,

522
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:21,570
always ended in a substitute that
was just as bad as the original.

523
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:26,275
Then I met the total package,
addiction, uneducated,

524
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,912
emotionally abusive,
physically violent.

525
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,084
One day I didn't want
to do it anymore.

526
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,721
I stood up to him.

527
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,003
He came after me
with a kitchen knife.

528
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,107
That's when I decided to leave.

529
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:03,145
I have something
I need to tell you.

530
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,084
The car accident.

531
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,955
Lori...

532
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,827
We were having an argument.

533
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,800
I was driving fast.

534
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,770
Angry.

535
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,042
I should have known better.

536
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:39,615
I just wanted you
to know that...

537
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,652
That it was my fault.

538
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:57,967
It's really normal
to feel that way.

539
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,142
But you can't control
everything, Doug.

540
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:13,649
Ninety-nine times out of 100, you
could do the exact same thing,

541
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,852
and it would be fine.

542
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,422
Life is full of accidents.

543
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,495
They aren't punishments.

544
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,000
You can forgive yourself.

545
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,781
Are you here?

546
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,259
Doug!

547
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:37,479
Oh, my...
I didn't see you.

548
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,848
Lemon or cream?

549
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,684
I don't care.

550
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,887
Something wrong?

551
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,629
I get it.

552
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,064
It was too soon.

553
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,835
Maybe I should go.

554
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,206
Of course I should go.
Obviously.

555
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,823
I'm so sorry I did that.

556
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,096
I would never hurt you.

557
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,168
And I would never leave you.

558
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,073
And our baby.

559
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:04,232
- Can I see?
- No. It's not finished yet.

560
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:05,767
- I'm changing the plans.
- Hmm.

561
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,836
- Get out of here.

562
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,618
Hey.

563
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,990
You wanna see it?

564
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,833
What do you think?

565
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,171
This will be the baby's room.

566
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:26,715
What?

567
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:31,420
It's all going to work out,
isn't it?

568
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,561
Of course it is.

569
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:52,941
Hello.

570
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,443
So how's life in the sticks?

571
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:56,144
- Did you go Amish yet?
<i>- It's good.</i>

572
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:59,881
Yeah, no, I'm sure. I can actually
smell the manure through the phone.

573
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,450
<i>I'm in the middle of something.</i>

574
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,385
What? Are you blowing
me off already?

575
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:07,656
<i>Look, listen, man,</i>
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

576
01:02:07,658 --> 01:02:10,892
Why don't you just come into Philly?
Stay with us,

577
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,194
forget about the house
for a while...

578
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:14,696
I don't want to forget
about the house.

579
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:17,232
No, I didn't mean it that way,
I just meant that you...

580
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,867
You don't get it.

581
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:19,835
So let me spell it out for you.

582
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,903
<i>This house means</i>
<i>everything to me.</i>

583
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,372
I am never leaving this house.

584
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:26,041
<i>Okay. I'm sorry.</i>

585
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:30,212
<i>Well, then when can I come out</i>
<i>and see what you're doing?</i>

586
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,390
Something on your mind?

587
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:16,691
You.

588
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,729
I don't care
if this isn't real.

589
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:28,270
Remember the last time you
made love to me in this bed?

590
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,210
Remember my touch?

591
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,522
My lips?

592
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,894
My mouth?

593
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,436
Look at me.

594
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,305
No!

595
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:08,877
Why did you do that?

596
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:11,112
You needed to see the truth.

597
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,149
The truth?

598
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,386
If you wanted to be with me,
then why did you kill me?

599
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:20,288
It was an accident.

600
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,993
You want me to leave,
don't you?

601
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,304
What's holding you here?

602
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:37,672
Jamie?

603
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:39,140
Stop it.

604
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,311
You're not real.

605
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,448
Suddenly it matters again?

606
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,189
- I've had enough of this!

607
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,446
<i>- Hey, it's Jamie.</i>
- <i> Leave a message.</i>

608
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,281
Hey, it's me.

609
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,719
I know this phone call should
have come sooner.

610
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,655
<i>But here goes...</i>

611
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,092
<i>I got scared that morning.</i>

612
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,027
<i>You were right.</i>

613
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:11,132
<i>But you're the only one</i>
<i>I can talk to.</i>

614
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,502
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

615
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,340
<i>This house is tormenting me.</i>

616
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,710
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

617
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,212
<i>Lori.</i>

618
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,949
<i>I need help.</i>

619
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,994
Doug, what are you doing?

620
01:08:19,996 --> 01:08:21,696
You won't return my calls.

621
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,565
Figure it out.

622
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,869
I'm sorry about what happened,
okay?

623
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:30,171
Doug, I heard all this before.

624
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:31,573
Jamie.

625
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,508
I can't.

626
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,909
Okay.

627
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,679
Look, I know I'm screwed up.

628
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,248
I've been having some problems,

629
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,719
and I'm begging you
for your help.

630
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,223
I'm sorry.

631
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,730
Get in.

632
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,603
- No!
- What?

633
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,834
Shh.

634
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,536
It's okay.

635
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:12,373
Do you still think
I should trust you?

636
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,210
I have to move on.

637
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,245
I'm sorry.

638
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,716
Don't you see what's coming?

639
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:30,391
Every experience will
be poisoned with guilt.

640
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,462
Every accomplishment.

641
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,236
Everything we should have had.

642
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:46,107
I'm not listening
to this anymore.

643
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,820
Your daughter.

644
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,588
Doug?

645
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,496
What's wrong?

646
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,666
Nothing,
I just think you should go.

647
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,334
- No.
- What?

648
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,504
No.

649
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,306
I'm not leaving you.

650
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,708
You're grieving.

651
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,645
You can't keep
pushing people away.

652
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,046
Make her leave, Doug.

653
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:25,747
Don't tell me what to do.

654
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,349
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm trying to help you.

655
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,785
I don't need your help.
I need to be left alone.

656
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,053
No, you don't.

657
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:36,090
I'm not leaving you. You need
someone to stay with you.

658
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,793
You've lost so much.

659
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,461
Lori.

660
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:42,764
Lori didn't leave me.

661
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,400
I don't mean it that way, Doug.

662
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:47,669
- You've suffered a tremendous
amount of...

663
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:48,903
I think the baby is sick.

664
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,972
- What?
- You're suffering.

665
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,940
Would you stop trying to
psychoanalyze me.

666
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,242
I'm not trying to pressure you.

667
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:55,877
I'm here for you.
Whatever you need,

668
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:58,479
I just don't think
you should be alone.

669
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:01,883
I'm not alone.

670
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,926
I'm confused.

671
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,796
It's okay.

672
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,532
It's okay.

673
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,734
I promise.

674
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,904
How could you do this to me?

675
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:24,672
Don't you touch her.

676
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,709
Who are you talking to?

677
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:29,344
The baby.

678
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,113
Don't run from me!

679
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:33,581
Stop!

680
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,217
I have to protect our family.

681
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,453
I hate her!

682
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,161
Let me in!

683
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,663
Stay there!

684
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:49,330
Doug!

685
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,799
- Doug!

686
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,379
No!

687
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:30,638
Get off of me!

688
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,874
Jamie?

689
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:42,283
Doug!
- Jamie!

690
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,391
Jamie?

691
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:54,962
Lori?

692
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:02,136
No.

693
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,719
Come back.

694
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,022
Come back, come back.

695
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,530
Shh.

696
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,267
Why did you do this?

697
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,057
Jamie?

698
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,100
Is anyone here?

699
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,140
Thank God.

700
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:51,946
<i>Hey, it's Jamie,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

701
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,814
Um, hey, Jamie.

702
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:55,516
It's Doug.

703
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,818
Please call me.

704
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,990
Call me. Text my cell.
Anything.

705
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,826
Just let me know you're okay.

706
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,050
Hey.

707
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,289
I was just about to knock.

708
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:39,293
The place, uh...
Looks good.

709
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,603
Look, I, uh...
I brought you something...

710
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,374
Why are you here?

711
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:55,876
I was just checking in on you.

712
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:57,311
I just wanted to give you this.

713
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:00,381
- It was all I could think of.
- Checking in?

714
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,817
Like I'm too incompetent
to take care of myself?

715
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,853
Doug, no one's heard from you.

716
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,788
You're all alone up here...

717
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,024
I want to be alone.

718
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:17,298
Look, if you ever
get yourself together again,

719
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,033
give me a call sometime.

720
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,802
I'd love to catch up
with my friend.

721
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:57,138
She's not coming back, Doug.

722
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,273
You don't know that.

723
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:00,474
We both know that.

724
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,243
I don't know anything!

725
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,378
Stay away!

726
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,180
You're not even real.

727
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:08,949
I'm not?

728
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:09,684
What's that supposed to mean?

729
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:12,887
Like it's a question? Like, you
don't know if you're real?

730
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,692
I can't take it anymore!

731
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,094
I can't live like this!

732
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:24,932
I was just trying to make myself
feel better, and I don't.

733
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,023
Stay with me.

734
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,894
Stay with us.

735
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,518
Stay with us.

736
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,559
<i>Hey, it's Jamie,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

737
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:29,230
I know it's hopeless
to try to reach you,

738
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,165
I just...

739
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:36,137
I want to let you know
you've meant a lot to me.

740
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:42,076
I don't want you to feel guilty
for what I'm about to do.

741
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,515
I've tried everything
I can think of,

742
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:50,284
I just don't see any answers.

743
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:56,524
This needs to end.

744
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,163
Maybe this way
everyone can be happy.

745
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,368
Anyway...

746
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,805
Thank you.

747
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,716
What's going to happen?

748
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,619
It'll be cold at first.

749
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,689
Dark.

750
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,261
Then what?

751
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,398
And then I'll find you.

752
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:42,963
I didn't want to
leave you here all alone.

753
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,601
I wanted to help.

754
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:01,882
I was afraid that I couldn't
do anything for you.

755
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,695
Yeah, hey, man,
I just wanted to apologize

756
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:49,830
about our conversation
the other day.

757
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:50,831
Yeah, it's no problem.

758
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,068
- Is everything okay? <i>-That's
just what I wanted to tell you.</i>

759
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:57,504
<i>I'm doing a lot better. I think
I'm gonna get through this.</i>

760
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,306
Woody!

761
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,742
<i>Anyways, I just wanted to say</i>
<i>I appreciate it, man.</i>

762
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,945
<i>- Thanks, man.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

763
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,515
I just wanted to let you know

764
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:10,884
I'm getting out of
that house up there.

765
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:12,219
Okay.

766
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,355
Selling it.

767
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:15,255
Good for you.

768
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:18,625
Screw over some
other poor bastard.

769
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:39,947
I should probably go to class.

770
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:42,216
You gonna learn how to
help crazy people?

771
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:43,117
Yeah.

772
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:47,054
You know, you'll probably learn
a lot more by staying here.

773
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,857
Oh. Look who got funny.

774
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:50,290
Is that a joke?

775
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,893
- No. -Are you making
jokes now, Doug?

776
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:55,295
No. I'm not funny.

777
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,865
I'm depressed.

778
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:00,200
You look depressed.

779
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,873
Hmm.

780
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,411
Maybe class can wait.

781
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:29,563
Doug, what is it?

782
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,868
I thought you were hurt.

783
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,870
It was a dream.

784
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:39,273
Shh.

785
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,844
I'm here.

786
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,425
Hey!

787
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,328
- You forgot your keys.

788
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:06,467
You know most people around
here don't carry pepper spray.

789
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:08,135
Oh, yeah?

790
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:10,270
Well...

791
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:13,073
Maybe I'll get rid of it.

792
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:16,410
- Call me after class?
- Hmm.

793
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:19,279
- See you.
- See ya.

794
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,377
You're such a liar.

795
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,279
You promised me.

796
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,883
I love you.

797
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:57,684
You'll always be with me.

798
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,419
That's what I promised you.

799
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,323
But my life has to change.

800
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,865
- This is the end?

801
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,601
I need to focus on reality.

802
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:17,337
On things I can change.

803
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,843
Don't come back.

804
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,613
I know what's real now.

805
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,120
Do you?

806
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:37,090
Enjoy reality, Doug.

807
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:08,555
Jamie?

808
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,476
Jamie, are you here?

809
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:06,613
Jamie?

810
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,917
What's wrong?

811
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:11,918
Nothing.

812
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,720
Nothing, I think you should go.

813
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:14,688
- No!
- What?

814
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,223
I'm not leaving you.
Don't you see?

815
01:28:16,225 --> 01:28:19,293
This is what you did last time.
You're grieving.

816
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:21,795
You can't keep
pushing people away.

817
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:22,729
Don't tell me what to do.

818
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,599
I'm not telling you what to do.
I'm trying to help you.

819
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:27,601
I don't need your help.

820
01:28:27,603 --> 01:28:28,869
I need to be left alone.

821
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:30,304
No, you don't.

822
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:33,940
I'm not leaving you. You need
someone to stay with you.

823
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:37,611
You've lost so much.

824
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:39,780
Lori.

825
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,214
Don't say her name!

826
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,916
What are you doing?

827
01:28:42,918 --> 01:28:44,151
Doug!

828
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:02,969
Don't you touch her!

829
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:05,038
Who are you talking to?

830
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,373
Lori, don't!

831
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:08,342
Lori's dead!

832
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:12,846
Don't you see what's coming?

833
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:15,515
Get away from me!

834
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:19,920
<i>That house</i>
<i>took control of his mind.</i>

835
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:21,288
Join me, Doug.

836
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,860
<i>Too much time alone, you
get stuck up in your head.</i>

837
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,664
<i>Your brain becomes like a maze.</i>

838
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,299
<i>You're not even real.</i>

839
01:29:32,301 --> 01:29:34,468
- I'm not?
- Hello!

840
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:37,337
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

841
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:39,673
Enjoy reality, Doug.

842
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,243
<i>This will be the baby's room.</i>

843
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:55,081
It's all going to work out,
isn't it?
