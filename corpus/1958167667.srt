1
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:49,575
- Oh, Ray, honey. Thank you
for taking me out tonight.

2
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,777
This is so much fun.

3
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,546
- It was a nice change
of pace, wasn't it?

4
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,347
- Yes, it was.

5
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,782
- We need to do this more often.

6
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,885
- I think we should.

7
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,721
You know, I wish we
didn't have to celebrate

8
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,457
our anniversary a week early.

9
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,426
But the opera was a
wonderful surprise.

10
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,295
Thank you so much.

11
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,767
- Well, I figured this way
you couldn't be too mad at me.

12
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,135
- This is true.

13
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,673
- Want a drink?

14
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:21,809
- Sure, why not?

15
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,402
So, where did you
find this place at?

16
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,539
- This is the kind of
place you get when you wait

17
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,541
till the last minute
to book a romantic

18
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,210
anniversary gift for your wife.

19
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,179
- Gotcha.

20
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,485
Well, at least there
isn't a heart-shaped

21
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,722
tub in the middle of
the room.

22
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,957
- Yeah, that would
have cost extra.

23
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,229
- You know, honey,

24
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,467
you really need to stop taking
on such a heavy workload.

25
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,437
I wanna spend more
time with you.

26
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,438
- I know.

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,907
I know.

28
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,477
After the new year,
things will ease up.

29
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,814
Hey, I'm here now, right?

30
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,682
- Right, I know.

31
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,417
- Let me get this last
case out of the way,

32
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,522
and then I'm all
yours, I promise.

33
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,525
- Yeah, but for how long?

34
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,427
Ray, you always say that.

35
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,731
The girls and I miss seeing
you at dinner, honey.

36
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,333
Your daughters need you.

37
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,770
- I'll tell you what.

38
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,573
Let's go on a vacation,

39
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:00,773
the four of us.

40
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:01,909
- Oh my, yes.

41
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,309
Yes, that, that, we can escape

42
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,011
from all of this as a family.

43
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,982
- I'll make you a deal. We'll
go wherever you want to go.

44
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,819
- I am going to pick
the perfect spot.

45
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,688
- Oh, I know you will.

46
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,257
To us.

47
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,258
- To us.

48
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:35,674
- Well, I feel like living
a little dangerous tonight.

49
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,477
Let me go check
out the facilities.

50
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,347
- Okay.

51
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,946
Who is it?

52
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,848
- Room service.

53
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,951
- Room service?

54
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,459
- Just.

55
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,702
- Sh, you gotta be very

56
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:38,338
quiet.

57
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,474
Where's your husband, huh?

58
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,112
Where?

59
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,513
- Bathroom.

60
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,685
- Honey, are you okay?

61
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:53,552
Teri.

62
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,654
- Sh sh, sh sh.

63
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,656
- What do you want from us?

64
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,126
- I want your wallet, Old
Man. Hand it over, right now.

65
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,564
- Okay, okay, I'm
reaching in my back pocket

66
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,666
and giving it to you, okay?

67
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:13,908
- Hey, what do you say,
Old Man? Will you share?

68
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,143
- Here, just take it. Take
it and let her go please.

69
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,079
- That's real nice of you.

70
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:22,848
- You have what
you want. It's all yours.

71
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,153
Now just please leave us alone.

72
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,689
- Nah.

73
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,926
I want more. This
isn't nearly enough.

74
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,594
- What else?

75
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,464
- Well, um, let me have
your wife.

76
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,399
- No!

77
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,773
- One more step, Old Man, and
I'll slit her fucking throat.

78
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,177
- Fuck you!

79
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,553
- Not bad, Old Man.

80
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,355
- No, no get off! No, get off!

81
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,222
Get off!

82
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,723
- Mom? Mom?

83
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,260
Mom?

84
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,029
Mom, Mom, Mom, wake up. It's me.

85
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:31,930
It's me!

86
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,834
You were just dreaming.

87
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:39,338
- Oh my God, Cassie,
I'm so sorry, honey.

88
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,174
- It's okay. Are you okay?

89
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,776
- Oh my God. I didn't
mean to scream.

90
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,978
Honey, did I scare you?

91
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,246
- No, I'm fine.

92
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:48,814
- Oh my God.

93
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,683
Oh!

94
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,217
- Does it hurt?

95
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,955
- Yes.

96
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,695
It doesn't help that
I slept funny too.

97
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,930
What time is it, honey?

98
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:05,900
- It's after two.

99
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:07,902
- Oh my God.

100
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,202
I slept all day?

101
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,037
- Yeah.

102
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,438
I guess the doctor wasn't
joking when he said

103
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,940
the pills were gonna
make you drowsy.

104
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,875
- No, no, Cassie.

105
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,813
Honey, I can't sleep all
night and all day too.

106
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,117
- Mom, the doctor said
it was good for you.

107
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,352
You need your rest. It'll
help you heal faster.

108
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,690
- Honey, I have a
memorial to plan.

109
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,827
- Mom, there's no rush.

110
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:35,863
- No.

111
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,768
It shouldn't have to wait.

112
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,938
Regardless of how I feel.

113
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,739
I'll wrap myself in plastic.

114
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,976
I'll take a shower.

115
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,278
And like always, I'm gonna
take care of your father.

116
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,847
He's all by himself
in an urn downstairs.

117
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,116
- Mom, I know. I know you're
gonna take care of it.

118
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,319
But everyone
understands. It's okay.

119
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,995
- You know, we discussed
this a couple of times.

120
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,867
You know, what would happen
if one of us went first and

121
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,337
he said if it was him,

122
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:21,974
he wanted his ashes
spread over by the lake,

123
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,944
because he thought
it was pretty there,

124
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,146
and it was peaceful and quiet.

125
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,517
- And we're gonna do that,
as soon as you get better.

126
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,252
Okay?

127
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,920
- All right, honey.

128
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,855
Can you get me my
pain pills please?

129
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:37,889
- Of course.

130
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:38,759
- Thank you.

131
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,931
It's the Oxycontin.

132
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:46,934
- I know, I got it.

133
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:05,917
- Oh, can I have two?

134
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,386
- Prescription says just one.

135
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,190
- Oh. Thank you, Doctor.

136
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,365
Hey, I found something.

137
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,468
- What is it?

138
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,069
- It's under the bed.

139
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,203
- Under the bed?

140
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,341
- It's in a box, under the bed.

141
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,517
- Oh my God, what is it?

142
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,589
Oh my God.

143
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,491
Lizzie?

144
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,160
- Yes.

145
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,262
- Oh my God, I thought I
got rid of all my toys.

146
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,397
- Oh you did.

147
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,468
But I wasn't gonna let
you get rid of her.

148
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,204
- I'd forgotten.

149
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:02,209
- Your dad brought her home
when he was in Charlottesville.

150
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,579
- He missed my recital, right?

151
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,015
- Oh my goodness.

152
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,217
Our Cassie

153
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,320
was Clara in the "Nutcracker."

154
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,257
And it was the
beautiful Christmas one.

155
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,128
- It was his way of
making it up to me.

156
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,398
- Yes. He was so good at that.

157
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,435
- Some of your handiwork?

158
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:34,041
- Yes, you put poor
Lizzie through the ringer.

159
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,376
You took her
everywhere with you.

160
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,646
I have an idea.

161
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:44,182
You have not left my
side this entire week.

162
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,085
- You need help.

163
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,620
- I know, honey,

164
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,921
and I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

165
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,657
Really, I do.

166
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,660
But your job is to be a
teenager, not a caretaker.

167
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,930
- Mom, I don't mind.

168
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,498
- Well I do.

169
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,269
You have been bound in
this house this whole week.

170
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,505
Why don't you give Mitch a call?

171
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:08,073
Mitch is dying to
see you, I know this.

172
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,543
- Mom, Mitch can wait.

173
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,979
I don't wanna leave you here
alone. It might not be safe.

174
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:18,450
- Honey, detectives
are working on this.

175
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,621
They have a composite,
they have a description.

176
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,658
That's all we can
do right now, okay?

177
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,561
- But he knows where we live.

178
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:32,665
And if he's seen the news, he
knows that you told the cops.

179
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,035
- Oh, Denise.
Oh God, oh my God.

180
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,136
- I'll go talk to her.

181
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,007
- Honey, please do.

182
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,442
I don't want you two
girls to worry about this.

183
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,443
It's not your job.

184
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,244
- But, Mom, it's ...

185
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,114
- You know what?

186
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,383
Look.

187
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,688
You know what today is?

188
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,222
- Your anniversary?

189
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,091
- Yes.

190
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,262
20 years.

191
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,065
We were so happily married.

192
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,670
We were so in tune
with each other.

193
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:11,639
And we almost made it.

194
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,142
So I ...

195
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:20,979
I kinda wanna have
the house to myself.

196
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,717
And I wanna be alone
with your father.

197
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,719
I hope I didn't
hurt your feelings.

198
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,421
- No, no, I
completely understand.

199
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,423
This is your day.

200
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,124
- Okay.

201
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,359
Honey, do me a favor?

202
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,761
- Of course.

203
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,362
- Will you take Denise
to Amanda's house?

204
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,531
I told her she could
spend the night.

205
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,165
- Yeah, of course.

206
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,200
- Okay. I'll pick her
up in the morning, okay?

207
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,068
- Okay.

208
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,770
- Okay, honey.

209
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,672
- Is there anything else you
want me to do before I go?

210
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,510
- No, honey, you've done
so much for me. Thank you.

211
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,710
I love you.

212
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,177
- I love you too.

213
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,646
- Be safe, okay?

214
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,146
- Okay, I won't stay
out too long, okay?

215
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,550
- Okay, honey
. You have fun.

216
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,416
- I will.

217
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:23,778
- Can I come in?

218
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,649
- No, but you will anyway.

219
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:29,751
- That's true.

220
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,518
- Did Mom send you in?

221
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,154
- No, it was my idea.

222
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,757
- Okay, well, let's
get it over with.

223
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,424
- What?

224
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,495
- Whatever speech
you're about to give.

225
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,462
- Can I sit down?

226
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,332
- Guess so.

227
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,205
- Why are you so upset?

228
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,675
- I'm scared.

229
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:56,811
- About what you heard?

230
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:01,112
- I didn't know he
knew where we lived.

231
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,616
Why doesn't anyone tell
me what's going on?

232
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:06,251
Everything's a secret. I'm
not a little kid anymore.

233
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,555
- You're right. You're not.

234
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,258
- Will you tell me?
How does this guy know?

235
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:13,795
- He, um,

236
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,862
he took Dad's wallet.

237
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,398
It had his ID in it.

238
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,234
- So he could come
in then, right?

239
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:27,405
I mean, he didn't kill Mom,
but what if he wants to?

240
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,809
And then what if
he kills us too?

241
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:32,377
- Denise, he just
wanted the money.

242
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,647
He doesn't care about
anything or anyone else.

243
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,584
I bet he's ditched it already.

244
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:42,320
His face is all over the
news. He wouldn't risk it.

245
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,224
We're as safe as
we've ever been.

246
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,630
- I just can't believe
this is happening to us.

247
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,396
- Hey, listen, get dressed
up and I'll take you

248
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,164
over to Amanda's, okay?

249
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,600
- Okay.

250
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:57,670
- I'm gonna go call
Mitch. Be ready in 10?

251
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:59,304
- Yeah.

252
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:03,176
- Yeah, all right,
all right.

253
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:28,770
- Oh.

254
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,348
Oh.

255
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,328
Oh.

256
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,570
- Yeah, my mom thinks
it's a good idea

257
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:07,540
for me to get outta
the house for a while.

258
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,644
Sounded like it was
better for her than me.

259
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:11,944
- What do you mean?

260
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,979
- I'll tell you about it later.

261
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,881
- Okay.

262
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,215
Let me ask my dad right now
if I can borrow the truck,

263
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,684
and then I'll come get you.

264
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,987
- Think he's gonna let you?

265
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,622
- It was one speeding
ticket, one time.

266
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,725
Plus I paid that
shit off already.

267
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,827
He can't hold that against
me forever, can he?

268
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,862
- Well hurry up, I'm starving.

269
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:32,565
I'm dying for a
burger and a shake.

270
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:33,866
- You buying?

271
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:35,268
- Very funny.

272
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,904
- All right, all right,
I'll be right there.

273
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,640
- Okay, cool, and ...

274
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,808
Hey, there's something
important I need

275
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,944
to talk to you about, okay?

276
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,581
- Yeah. Sure.

277
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:48,983
- Okay.

278
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,709
- Mom? We're leaving.

279
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:20,848
Okay.

280
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:47,840
- You're not going anywhere.

281
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:50,509
Not before I get a taste.

282
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,613
Shit.

283
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:01,720
There's something
to remember me by.

284
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,967
I'll be seeing you.

285
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,718
- Ray!

286
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:12,820
No!

287
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,746
Yes?

288
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,581
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Luna.

289
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,518
I'm Detective Calderon.

290
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,919
May I come in please?

291
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,021
- Oh sure, absolutely,
come on in.

292
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,122
- Thank you.

293
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:51,125
- Here, have a seat.

294
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:05,873
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

295
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:11,276
- The funeral home
wanted a photo of Ray

296
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,546
for the obituary in
the newspaper, so.

297
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,818
I haven't had the heart
to put them all away yet.

298
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:22,089
So what can I do
for you, Detective?

299
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:24,525
- I wanted to tell you

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,829
that we believe we caught the
man who killed your husband.

301
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,533
- Wait.

302
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,969
You believe?

303
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:37,905
So you mean you're not sure?

304
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,079
So you have nobody in custody?

305
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,182
- We received a call

306
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,951
of a man wearing the
same kind of clothes

307
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,720
and matching the description

308
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,223
in the sketch that you provided.

309
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:01,260
- But you haven't
seen him yourself?

310
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:02,129
- No, ma'am.

311
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:07,833
- And did you find
my husband's wallet?

312
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,971
Did you find the knife
that killed my husband?

313
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,939
- No, ma'am.

314
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:17,109
But we are confident
that this is the man.

315
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:19,945
So I wanted to personally
come by and let you know

316
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:22,915
that you and your
daughters are safe now.

317
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:29,688
- Detective, have
you ever seen someone

318
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:34,695
that you love die
right in front of you?

319
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,800
Have you ever seen their
soul leave their eyes?

320
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,671
Do you know what
that feels like?

321
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:45,973
- Yes, ma'am.

322
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:47,741
I do.

323
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,843
I better go.

324
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:54,146
- Unless, unless you can
come here and tell me

325
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:57,883
that you found my husband's
killer, get outta my house!

326
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:58,884
- I didn't mean to upset--

327
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,752
- Get out! Shut up!

328
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:04,056
Get out! Don't you ever
come here again, ever!

329
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:07,862
Ever! You've done nothing,
you sorry ass cop!

330
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,091
- Ray.

331
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,135
Ray?

332
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,204
Ray!

333
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,540
Oh.

334
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:41,448
Ray?

335
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:43,982
Ray?

336
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,052
Ray, no. Ray!

337
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,454
Ray!

338
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:49,490
Raymond!

339
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,292
No, Raymond, Raymond!

340
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,292
What happened?

341
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:58,223
- You okay?

342
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:02,160
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I just have
a lot on my mind right now.

343
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:04,530
I need to talk to
you about something.

344
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,966
Like, a serious talk.

345
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,602
- You're not gonna
yell at me, are you?

346
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:11,236
- No.

347
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:13,872
I just don't want you
to freak out, okay?

348
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,408
- Well telling me
not to freak out is

349
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,910
kinda making me
want to freak out.

350
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:19,581
What's going on?

351
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,049
- It's just that

352
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:25,653
I'm pregnant.

353
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:28,155
- What?

354
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:30,956
And it's mine?

355
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,393
- Of course, I haven't
been with anyone else.

356
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,262
- Shit.

357
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:39,567
- What are you thinking?

358
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:42,403
- Um.

359
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,938
I'm gonna be a dad.

360
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,609
I'm gonna be a
motherfucking dad.

361
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:51,544
- Whoa, don't get too excited.

362
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:54,279
I don't even know if
I'm gonna keep it yet.

363
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,947
With everything going on,

364
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,152
I don't know if I
can handle a baby.

365
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:03,625
- Listen, I know you've been
through so much this week, so

366
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:08,462
whatever you decide,
I completely support
your decision.

367
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,097
I love you.

368
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:12,966
- I love you too.

369
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,003
I'm so relieved. I ...

370
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,274
I was worried about how
you were gonna take it.

371
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:24,679
- No, babe, you're
never in this alone.

372
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,481
And, if you decide to keep it,

373
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,317
we can name the baby
little Mitchie Junior.

374
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,452
- Oh.

375
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:36,288
- Or, Michelle, if it's a girl.

376
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,625
See what I did there?

377
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:42,730
- Yeah, you're definitely
not naming the baby.

378
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:45,731
- Have you told your mom yet?

379
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,399
- No.

380
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,369
It's the last thing she
needs to hear right now.

381
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,140
- How's she doing?

382
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,677
- I honestly don't know.

383
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,111
I think she's just putting
on a brave face for us.

384
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:02,214
It's only been a week.

385
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:05,452
I'm just scared how she's
gonna react to this news.

386
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:08,422
I'm gonna tell her
after the funeral.

387
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,491
- And do you know
when that is yet?

388
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:15,393
- I don't know. I told her
to wait until she's better.

389
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,164
She's still in a lotta pain.

390
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,634
- And you? How have you been?

391
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:26,641
- I'm just still processing
that I don't have a dad anymore.

392
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:32,143
Like, it doesn't feel real and

393
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,146
I just wanna curl up in a
ball and cry all the time,

394
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,482
but I can't because
I have to be strong

395
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:40,318
for my mom and for Denise.

396
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,055
And it's gonna be really hard
if we decide to keep the baby.

397
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:44,792
- How do you mean?

398
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,226
- My dad would have
been an awesome grandpa,

399
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,330
and now that's
never gonna happen.

400
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:54,634
- Babe, no, that's
why we have pictures,

401
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:57,337
and videos and memories
that we can share.

402
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:01,041
Make sure that he
isn't ever forgotten.

403
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,378
- Thank you so much
for being so wonderful.

404
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:12,152
Can we go get that
burger now? I'm starving.

405
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,621
- Yeah, but one more thing.

406
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,222
- What?

407
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,357
- Do you think a quickie
would hurt the baby?

408
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,327
- Seriously?

409
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,230
- Hey, I had to try.

410
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,333
Fine. Let's go.

411
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:35,677
- Ho.

412
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:45,085
Oh.

413
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,162
Hm.

414
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:31,799
Oh, Lizzie.

415
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:33,735
Hm.

416
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,228
Okay, Ray.

417
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,766
I can't believe
I'm gonna do this.

418
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,902
But I need to talk to you, so.

419
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:13,508
Let me see what, what
this is all about.

420
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,711
The rules of the spirit
world are simple.

421
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,647
Be polite, keep it simple,

422
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:23,518
and be careful
what you wish for.

423
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,386
Place your index fingers
and middle fingers

424
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:29,590
on the planchette.

425
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:34,261
To wake the board up
and prepare for its use,

426
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:37,699
slowly move the
planchette in circles.

427
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,767
Concentrate on what you want

428
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:46,371
to ask and speak in
a clear, loud tone.

429
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,577
It may take several
attempts to reach a spirit.

430
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,346
When you've finished using the
powers of the spirit board,

431
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,482
you must close the portal

432
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:59,554
on the other side
by saying goodbye.

433
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:07,294
Okay.

434
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:10,531
My fingers,

435
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,767
and go in small circles.

436
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,575
And be clear.

437
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:22,643
Ray?

438
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:29,449
Baby, if you can hear
me, say something.

439
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,587
Show me a sign, anything.

440
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:50,605
Okay.

441
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:53,775
Okay.

442
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:57,812
Ray.

443
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,415
Ray, I'm serious. Please.

444
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:06,652
Please come to me.

445
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,690
Ray?

446
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,467
Ray?

447
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:24,437
Honey?

448
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:30,576
Honey, it's, it's Teri,
honey. I called you.

449
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:47,560
I know I heard.

450
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:48,428
Oh my God.

451
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,798
Oh, oh my God.

452
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,335
Ray.

453
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,005
Ray, you're here!

454
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:02,710
Okay.

455
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:05,847
Talk to me.

456
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:09,650
Ray.

457
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm here, Ray, talk to me.

458
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,923
Ray, I know you're here.

459
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,827
Come on, baby, come on!

460
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,064
Ray, tell me what to do!

461
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,449
- Do you know why you're here?

462
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,630
You were seen by witnesses

463
00:39:58,733 --> 00:39:59,867
at the scene of a crime

464
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,905
where a man was
stabbed to death.

465
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:09,675
Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

466
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:13,748
As a matter of fact,

467
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,519
the description matches
the clothes you're wearing.

468
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:21,889
And I'm sure that
stain on your shirt

469
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,890
would match Mr. Luna's blood.

470
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,594
- Man.

471
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,666
I found these clothes.

472
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:36,737
- No, I don't believe you.

473
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,108
Where were you a
week ago tonight?

474
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,110
- I aint saying shit.

475
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,812
I know my rights.

476
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:47,715
I'm innocent.

477
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,519
This don't even look
like me. Are you blind?

478
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:54,920
- Okay.

479
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,588
- Are you blind? My face
isn't all fucked up.

480
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,057
- You're under arrest
for the murder of--

481
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,525
- I didn't do it!

482
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,609
- What the hell?

483
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:21,749
Cassie! Turn down the music!

484
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,186
Turn it down now please!

485
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,931
What is going on down there?

486
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:38,733
My God.

487
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:40,801
Oh.

488
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:55,216
Stop it, Cassie!

489
00:41:57,551 --> 00:42:00,019
I'm trying to get some rest!

490
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,578
Oh, this is ridiculous.

491
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,581
Cassie?

492
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:35,890
How?

493
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:39,060
What in God's name?

494
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:43,162
How did you get here?

495
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:50,938
Who's in my house?

496
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:55,209
Who's here?

497
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,344
Get out!

498
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:00,612
Get out!

499
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,259
Hey.

500
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:15,294
- Teri.

501
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:27,975
- Cassie?

502
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:31,610
Cassie?

503
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:38,385
Oh no.

504
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:47,359
Where's the flashlight?
Where's the flashlight?

505
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,229
Oh.

506
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,704
Cassie, honey?

507
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,208
Honey, please tell me
it's you. Honey, please.

508
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:09,717
Oh.

509
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:11,685
Oh my God!

510
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:15,055
What?

511
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:17,856
Oh.

512
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:28,836
Oh.

513
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:31,939
Oh God.

514
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:34,675
Oh God.

515
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:41,882
Hey!

516
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:44,351
Hey, hello?

517
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,023
I'm calling the police.

518
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,390
Who are you?

519
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:11,011
- I guess you can say
I'm a friend of Ray's.

520
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,951
I told you I'd be seeing you.

521
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:25,057
- No.

522
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,058
No.

523
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,919
- Why are you doing this to me?

524
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:57,124
- Because you're
mine, bitch. All mine.

525
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,395
Recognize the blood?

526
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:06,999
- No, no!

527
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:13,939
No.

528
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:15,543
No, no no, no no, no!

529
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:24,883
- Where do you think
you're going, huh?

530
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:30,789
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

531
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:10,230
- What?

532
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,466
How?

533
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,157
Oh, Ray.

534
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:39,893
You're so cold.

535
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,464
But, I can touch you.

536
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,070
I can feel you. I ...

537
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:54,106
I can actually smell you.

538
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:56,176
I can actually smell you.

539
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh, Ray. Ray, it was horrible.

540
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:04,483
He was chasing me.
He's in the house.

541
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,153
- Sh, sh sh, sh sh.

542
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,624
It's all going to be okay now.

543
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,092
Nobody's going to hurt you.

544
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:17,431
- I have dreamt of this moment

545
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,299
where you would comfort me

546
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:24,071
and tell me everything
is gonna be okay.

547
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:28,041
I begged God to let you come.

548
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,912
- I've wanted to come before,
but I couldn't until tonight.

549
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,616
I don't know what you did,

550
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,985
but it's allowed
me to visit you.

551
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:47,961
- Ray?

552
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:51,965
What does it feel like

553
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:54,401
to be dead?

554
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:59,239
I mean, is it wonderful
like we thought?

555
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,709
Or is it scary?

556
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:05,310
- It's not like anything at all

557
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:08,048
and everything else all at once.

558
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:11,351
It's a feeling.

559
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:15,590
Have you ever just
about fallen asleep

560
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:19,527
and you feel like you're
falling down a long, long well?

561
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:22,961
- Yeah.

562
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:23,698
- It's like that.

563
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:26,967
Except it never ends.

564
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,371
And you don't know
where you're falling to

565
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:34,374
or where you're falling from.

566
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:36,544
You're just

567
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:38,580
there.

568
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:40,481
It's lonely

569
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:42,483
but crowded.

570
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,652
It's not like anything
I thought it would be

571
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:48,690
or what it's made out to be.

572
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:54,562
Death is really just death.

573
00:49:56,463 --> 00:50:01,001
The only difference is,
it's not totally lights out.

574
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:05,507
You're still aware
of the nothingness.

575
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,209
- Ray.

576
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:11,613
I'm so sorry.

577
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:14,381
- Teri,

578
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,650
my time here is limited.

579
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,284
- Limited?

580
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:22,590
No, you cannot leave
me again, please.

581
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,528
- Let's not waste our time
being caught up in our sorrow

582
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:31,363
and celebrate the fact
that we are here now.

583
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:32,266
Together.

584
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:39,306
If I'm not mistaken, it's
still our anniversary.

585
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:42,744
- You remember.

586
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:48,650
- How could I forget the
happiest day of my life?

587
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,054
- Mine too, Ray, mine too.

588
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,143
- May I have this dance?

589
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:36,531
- Oh, honey, I've
always loved this song.

590
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:38,800
- It's our song.

591
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:01,856
- Mm.

592
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,526
This is so nice.

593
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:11,833
Oh.

594
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:15,735
What is ...

595
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,641
What is this?

596
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:25,544
Ray, what is, where
did this come from?

597
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:26,413
Ray?

598
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,819
What did you do with him?

599
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:35,721
Stop!

600
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,257
No. No, Ray, Ray!

601
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,201
Ray?

602
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:23,871
Ray?

603
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:26,204
Ray?

604
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:30,408
Ray, you're, help me, Ray.

605
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,546
No, no!

606
00:54:47,622 --> 00:54:48,488
Ow!

607
00:54:49,857 --> 00:54:50,725
Oh!

608
00:55:09,777 --> 00:55:11,010
Fuck.

609
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,780
God.

610
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,347
Fuck!

611
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,018
Oh!

612
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,921
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

613
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,068
Cassie?

614
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,938
Cassie?

615
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:01,662
Come on, Cassie.

616
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:05,099
- Mitch, stop!

617
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:10,603
Stop.

618
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:11,837
- Come on, Cassie.

619
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,074
Cassie, Cassie, pick up, Cassie!

620
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,609
Oh God no!

621
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,677
Oh God, oh God.

622
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,045
Oh.

623
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:27,613
Our Father, who art in heaven.

624
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:29,748
Hallowed be Thy name.

625
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,687
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.

626
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:35,955
On Earth as it is in heaven.

627
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:37,224
- Teri.

628
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:43,898
- Who is it?

629
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:46,667
Who said that?

630
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,170
Who said that? Answer me.

631
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,640
- Teri.

632
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:57,776
- What?

633
00:57:57,778 --> 00:57:59,645
What do you want from me?

634
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:02,482
- It's me, honey.
It's your beloved Ray.

635
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:05,784
Don't you recognize my voice?

636
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,119
- No.

637
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,888
No it's not.

638
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,724
No it's not.

639
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:15,563
You're, you're that thing,
you're that monster!

640
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:18,032
- Was I
that convincing?

641
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:21,902
- Everything.

642
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:25,172
Everything you said.

643
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:28,073
How did ...

644
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,709
Who, how did you know?

645
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:33,014
- I just said
what you wanted to hear.

646
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,949
- No.

647
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:37,818
No.

648
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,120
You tricked me. You tricked me!

649
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:43,655
Stop using his voice!

650
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:47,895
Stop!

651
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,133
Stop it, stop it!

652
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:54,769
Stop!

653
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:00,741
Why me?

654
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:05,277
- I have been freed.

655
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:06,213
- What? No.

656
00:59:07,615 --> 00:59:08,282
No.

657
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:10,816
No, this isn't real.

658
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:13,118
- The door was opened,

659
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,125
and now you must
let the darkness in.

660
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:21,060
- I don't believe in you.

661
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,928
- You can sit
for the rest of your life

662
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:27,635
in your bed, wallowing in
your life of sins and regrets,

663
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:32,704
or I can help you end
the pain, quickly.

664
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:45,119
- Help me. Help me.

665
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,286
Help me.

666
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,235
For the Word of God

667
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,737
is living.

668
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:08,209
And it's powerful.

669
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:12,713
And it's sharper!

670
01:00:14,048 --> 01:00:17,618
Than any two-edged sword!

671
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,795
The vision of what?

672
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:33,934
Soul and spirit.

673
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,036
And ...

674
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:41,073
Where am I, where am
I? I lost my place.

675
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,947
No.

676
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,348
No.

677
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:52,818
No, stay awake.

678
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,754
Stay awake!

679
01:00:58,192 --> 01:00:59,093
To ascend

680
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,695
of our thoughts

681
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:06,865
and the intent of our hearts.

682
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:19,807
- Stop it!

683
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:22,107
Stop!

684
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,108
Stop it, stop it!

685
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:23,978
Stop! It!

686
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:29,917
God!

687
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:32,784
God!

688
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,023
Stop it!

689
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:39,193
Stop it please!

690
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,797
Oh please.

691
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:10,188
- What are you looking for?

692
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,058
- My phone.

693
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:13,827
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

694
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:17,498
What time is it?

695
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:23,268
- 3:30.

696
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,403
- In the morning?

697
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:26,273
Shit, my mom is gonna kill me.

698
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,576
- She wanted you to go
out and have a good time.

699
01:03:30,578 --> 01:03:32,277
- I never stay out this late.

700
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:34,815
She needs me. What if
she got into trouble?

701
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:38,016
- I'm sure everything is fine.

702
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,554
- Oh, got it.

703
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:44,956
Oh my God.

704
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:45,924
- What is it?

705
01:03:45,926 --> 01:03:47,359
- She called.

706
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:49,129
She called me, and
I didn't answer.

707
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:53,566
Oh my God, Mitch,
what if she's hurt?

708
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,967
- She was probably just
checking up on you?

709
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,236
- God, I'm so stupid. I
never shoulda left her alone.

710
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:00,606
I knew better.

711
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:01,907
I need to call her.

712
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,188
- Ah!

713
01:04:15,557 --> 01:04:16,423
Oh.

714
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:23,428
Ah!

715
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,458
- Where the hell is she?

716
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,093
- What's going on?

717
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:56,463
- My mom, she isn't
picking up her phone.

718
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:00,298
- She's probably
sleeping already.

719
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,168
- No.

720
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,970
That's not it.

721
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:06,405
- Well, then what?

722
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:08,608
- I don't know. I just,
I have a bad feeling.

723
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,042
She's not that
heavy of a sleeper.

724
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:12,413
The ringer should wake her.

725
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:17,084
I don't know. I
have a bad feeling.

726
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:21,253
Take me home please. I
think something happened.

727
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:23,658
- All right. Let me
just find my keys.

728
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:57,389
- I'm here.

729
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:59,124
Just like you wanted.

730
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:01,094
Hello, Beautiful.

731
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:05,565
- You stay away from me!

732
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:09,669
- Baby, if you can
hear me, say something.

733
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:11,739
Show me a sign, anything.

734
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:15,643
- No.

735
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:18,544
You're not my Ray!

736
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:21,448
- Come down here, Teri.
Give me a kiss.

737
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,658
- Help me.

738
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:32,991
Help me!

739
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,028
- That isn't how phones work.

740
01:06:36,698 --> 01:06:39,231
- Hello, hello,
this is the Luna residence.

741
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:42,434
We're not at home right now
and so sad we missed your call.

742
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:44,369
Please leave your
name and number,

743
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,471
and we'll try to get back
to you as soon as we can.

744
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:48,106
Bye.

745
01:06:48,108 --> 01:06:49,542
- Mom, if
you can hear me,

746
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:50,543
I've been trying
to call your cell.

747
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:52,077
- I can hear you.

748
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,478
- Is
everything all right?

749
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,479
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

750
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,147
I'm on my way home.

751
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,583
- No!

752
01:06:57,585 --> 01:06:58,452
No!

753
01:06:59,554 --> 01:07:01,154
Cassie, stay away!

754
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:06,592
Cassie, don't come home.
Don't come home please.

755
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:10,362
- Hear that? Our baby girl
is finally coming home to us.

756
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:13,298
The four of us can be
together as a family,

757
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,801
just like you wanted, huh, Teri?

758
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:18,171
This is what you've
been praying for.

759
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:21,574
- Shut the fuck up already!

760
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:23,709
Shut the fuck up!

761
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:27,312
- I can hardly wait to get my
hands on our sweet daughter

762
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,517
and that baby growing
inside of her.

763
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:32,452
- That what?

764
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:37,155
- Oh, she didn't tell you?

765
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:38,325
She's a slut!

766
01:07:39,594 --> 01:07:40,828
- Stop that!

767
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:45,098
You stop putting words in
his mouth! Don't you dare!

768
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:47,835
- Mm.

769
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:49,771
That body.

770
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:54,776
Just beckons for me to have
my way with it.

771
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:57,645
- You sick fuck!

772
01:08:00,113 --> 01:08:01,446
Oh!

773
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:16,496
- There's gotta
be something I can do.

774
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:19,667
Something to stop all of this?

775
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,837
What am I doing wrong?

776
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,271
What am I doing wrong?

777
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,648
The rules.

778
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:36,884
I didn't follow the rules.

779
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,487
Oh my God, you said it yourself.
You let the darkness in.

780
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:44,592
Now you have to shut
the fucking door.

781
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:06,646
Oh.

782
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:34,542
Oh.

783
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:44,917
Hm.

784
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,265
Mm.

785
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,538
Oh.

786
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:26,892
Oh.

787
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:00,762
Come on!

788
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:05,263
Please!

789
01:11:13,306 --> 01:11:13,975
Ah!

790
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:16,609
Oh.

791
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:17,910
Hey, thank God.

792
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:22,850
Hold on, hold on.

793
01:11:23,785 --> 01:11:24,652
Hold on.

794
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:28,754
Easy does it.

795
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:30,290
Come on, come on.

796
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:37,029
- Listen, I know you're worried,

797
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:40,498
but everything's
gonna be okay, okay?

798
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,401
I promise.

799
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:45,604
I bet this is all nothing.

800
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:49,575
- I've called like 10
times. She hasn't answered.

801
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:53,444
I know something is wrong.
This isn't like her, Mitch.

802
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:55,380
She used to say all the
time that she could never

803
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,917
fall asleep until
she knew I was home.

804
01:11:57,919 --> 01:11:59,752
A part of her was always awake,

805
01:11:59,754 --> 01:12:02,320
even if her eyes were closed.

806
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,891
Tonight wouldn't
be any different.

807
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,863
- Don't get yourself all worked
up. It isn't good for you.

808
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:10,798
Or the baby.

809
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:15,368
God knows you've been
through enough this week.

810
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,504
That's it.

811
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:20,775
This is all just the
weight of the week

812
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:24,779
crashing down on
you, and on her.

813
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,850
She's probably just asleep.

814
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:32,383
And that's good for her.

815
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:35,453
- It's too late to tell
me not to get upset.

816
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:36,922
You know, she wanted
to have dinner

817
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:39,024
because it was their
anniversary tonight.

818
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:40,995
She wanted me outta the house.

819
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:45,030
What if?

820
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,532
- What?

821
01:12:46,534 --> 01:12:47,967
Oh, no.

822
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:50,736
Cassie, you can't
think like that.

823
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:52,470
That, that man wouldn't ...

824
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:54,874
- What if he found us, Mitch?

825
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:57,475
What if he broke in and
did something to her?

826
01:12:57,477 --> 01:13:01,949
What if, what if she tried
calling and I didn't pick up?

827
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:05,017
- No.

828
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:08,120
No. It has to be something else.

829
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,889
- Just hurry, okay?

830
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:42,657
- Oh.

831
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:12,685
- Where's the planchette?

832
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:13,819
Oh my God.

833
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,606
- Goodbye!

834
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,852
- Mom!
- Cassie!

835
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:46,754
- Honey.

836
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:49,724
Honey, I need you.
I need your help.

837
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:53,892
Cassie, help me!

838
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:55,694
- Mom!
- Please!

839
01:14:55,696 --> 01:14:57,796
- Mom, what the hell happened?

840
01:14:57,798 --> 01:14:59,231
Oh my God.

841
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:02,134
Mom, you're bleeding. Oh my God.

842
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:04,570
Where does it hurt? Be careful.

843
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:06,038
What happened?

844
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,073
- I can't explain,
honey, right now.

845
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:10,075
- Did you hurt yourself, Mom?

846
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:11,076
- Yeah.

847
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:12,678
Honey, call the police.

848
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,646
- Okay.
- And call me an ambulance.

849
01:15:21,055 --> 01:15:21,922
- No! No!

850
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,800
- Come on, Cassie.

851
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:47,374
- Mom, Mom! Hold on to me!

852
01:16:49,043 --> 01:16:50,845
Please hold on to me!

853
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,683
- No, you can't
have my daughter!

854
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:00,085
You can't have her!

855
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:00,955
Fuck you!

856
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:08,093
Cassie, hold on to me!

857
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,122
What did you do to her?

858
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,160
What did you do to her?

859
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:41,695
Cassie!

860
01:17:49,069 --> 01:17:49,937
No. No!

861
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:55,707
Come here. Cassie, get
up, get up, get up!

862
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,109
Get up, get up!

863
01:18:15,229 --> 01:18:16,363
Oh sweet girl.

864
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:20,901
Cassie.

865
01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:24,803
Cassie, I need you
to find Daddy for me.

866
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:29,376
I need you to find Daddy.

867
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:31,278
Oh my God.

868
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,960
- Stay away from me!

869
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:24,365
- Teri, please listen to me.

870
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:26,333
It's me.

871
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:30,402
It's really me this
time, I promise.

872
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:31,272
It's Ray.

873
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,809
- You're trying
to trick me again.

874
01:19:38,379 --> 01:19:40,279
It won't work.

875
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,380
It won't work.

876
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:43,282
- This isn't a trick.

877
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:46,785
I managed to get away, but
I don't have much time.

878
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:48,088
It'll find me.

879
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:55,127
- But, how do I know
it's really you, Ray?

880
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:56,797
Who will find you?

881
01:19:57,565 --> 01:19:58,832
What is it?

882
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,068
- Abilash.

883
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:04,405
- What?

884
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,107
What are you talking about?

885
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:09,808
- I came to tell you the truth.

886
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,579
It's the only way I
know how to save you.

887
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,481
This is all my fault.

888
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:16,483
- No.

889
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:18,586
No, Ray.

890
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:21,355
You can't blame
yourself.

891
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:24,458
- Listen to me.

892
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,462
Do you remember the
first day we met?

893
01:20:32,567 --> 01:20:35,903
You hated me. You wanted
nothing to do with me.

894
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:38,870
I must have asked you
out a dozen times,

895
01:20:38,872 --> 01:20:40,441
and every single
time you said no.

896
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:43,410
- No.

897
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:47,147
That isn't right, Ray.

898
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:51,249
- It is, my love.

899
01:20:56,156 --> 01:20:59,891
- I don't understand.
I don't understand.

900
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:01,128
- I went to see someone.

901
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,932
Someone who can help with
these kinds of things.

902
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:30,090
- Welcome. I've
been expecting you.

903
01:21:31,925 --> 01:21:32,594
- You have?

904
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:34,529
- Of course.

905
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:39,498
- I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

906
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,670
- Yes, you do.

907
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:45,673
What is her name?

908
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,908
- Whose name?

909
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:51,979
- The woman you
are in love with.

910
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,517
That is why you are here, no?

911
01:21:58,018 --> 01:22:00,118
- It's, uh, it's Teri.

912
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,988
- Ah.

913
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:03,357
Teri.

914
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:08,395
And she does not love you back?

915
01:22:10,632 --> 01:22:11,498
- No.

916
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:15,068
- But you want her to?

917
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:19,473
- I know that's not possible.

918
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:24,344
- Nothing is impossible,
my new friend.

919
01:22:27,448 --> 01:22:29,082
Have you heard of Abilash?

920
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:32,986
No, of course not.

921
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:38,058
Abilash is a hell
hound, a fallen angel.

922
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:43,430
A forsaken beast we
usually do not mettle with.

923
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:46,534
- Then why are you
telling me this?

924
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:52,473
- Because, what you desire
can only be obtained

925
01:22:53,575 --> 01:22:56,341
with the help of Abilash.

926
01:23:14,428 --> 01:23:17,295
This is what you came for.

927
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:21,536
- It's uh ...

928
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:23,403
It's a toy.

929
01:23:24,772 --> 01:23:29,744
- No, my friend.

930
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:33,679
This is Abilash.

931
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,548
He is trapped in here.

932
01:23:39,621 --> 01:23:43,756
And as long as he is,
whoever possesses the board

933
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:46,993
has complete control over him.

934
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,736
He will make your deepest
desires come true.

935
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:56,704
A wish maker.

936
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:01,275
He will make sure that

937
01:24:02,644 --> 01:24:04,411
Teri falls madly
in love with you.

938
01:24:08,816 --> 01:24:10,417
- How much is this gonna cost?

939
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:13,120
- There is no cost.

940
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,423
Only one condition.

941
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:18,292
- What?

942
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:24,564
- You must never, ever,
under any circumstances,

943
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:29,467
let the glass eye in
the planchette break.

944
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:32,370
If it does, you, my new friend

945
01:24:32,372 --> 01:24:36,143
and everyone in your life
will be in grave danger.

946
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:41,516
Do you understand?

947
01:24:46,186 --> 01:24:47,587
- I do.

948
01:24:47,589 --> 01:24:50,625
- Then let his powers
flow through you.

949
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:54,562
By accepting this gift,

950
01:24:56,598 --> 01:24:57,763
from Zaheer.

951
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:14,381
- Everything was perfect.

952
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,886
We had 20 wonderful years
together, didn't we?

953
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:20,822
Two daughters.

954
01:25:22,824 --> 01:25:24,389
And then it happened.

955
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,506
- Ray?

956
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:26,921
- I broke it, Teri.

957
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:29,857
I unleashed it on us.

958
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:35,697
- You're a murderer, Ray.

959
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:38,900
Do you know that?

960
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:41,669
You killed our baby!

961
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:45,907
And you lied!

962
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,712
For 20 years, you lied to me!

963
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:56,216
It's all on you, Ray!

964
01:26:57,952 --> 01:27:00,220
It's all your fault, Ray!

965
01:27:02,322 --> 01:27:03,321
- I'm so sorry.

966
01:27:03,323 --> 01:27:04,357
- Don't you touch me!

967
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:07,893
- Teri, please.

968
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:09,296
- Just stop!

969
01:27:10,464 --> 01:27:12,533
Just stop! Can't you see?

970
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:17,772
Can't you see how
selfish you've been?

971
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,911
What if we were never
meant to be together?

972
01:27:27,347 --> 01:27:29,483
It's all one big, fat lie!

973
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:34,822
- No, don't say that.

974
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:37,992
I've tried to make
this all right.

975
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:41,794
It has a hold on my soul.

976
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:45,265
I'm trapped, Teri.
Trapped in its grip.

977
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:47,334
But the doll.

978
01:27:49,003 --> 01:27:50,970
I was able to move Lizzie
when I could to help you.

979
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:52,507
That was me.

980
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:57,477
Don't you see, I never
wanted any of this to happen?

981
01:28:01,414 --> 01:28:04,984
- I want you gone, Ray!

982
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:07,287
I want you gone for good!

983
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,657
- Teri.

984
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:27,608
- The sun will be out soon,
and our time together will end.

985
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:32,013
I know you don't have
much time to live.

986
01:28:34,882 --> 01:28:37,018
That is what's keeping me.

987
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:42,723
Why don't you just
give up, Teri?

988
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:46,561
And be with your family forever?

989
01:28:53,466 --> 01:28:54,467
Join me now.

990
01:28:57,805 --> 01:28:59,406
- Mom, where are you?

991
01:29:02,475 --> 01:29:04,444
It's so dark, and I'm so scared.

992
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:07,014
I need you, Mom.

993
01:29:08,481 --> 01:29:10,516
Me and my baby need you.

994
01:29:21,662 --> 01:29:22,530
- No!

995
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:25,664
It's not gonna end this way!

996
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:43,684
Honey, I'm so sorry.

997
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:47,121
I love you.

998
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:07,942
Oh.

999
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:54,989
I made it.

1000
01:31:14,575 --> 01:31:15,242
- Hello?

1001
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:18,946
Hello. Anybody here?

1002
01:31:22,883 --> 01:31:24,516
Hello?

1003
01:31:24,518 --> 01:31:25,586
Mrs. Luna?

1004
01:31:27,254 --> 01:31:30,189
It's Detective Calderon,
Valley View PD.

1005
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:31,192
Are you here?

1006
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:33,761
Hello?

1007
01:31:37,264 --> 01:31:38,132
Hello.

1008
01:31:39,934 --> 01:31:41,567
Police, anybody here?

1009
01:31:51,846 --> 01:31:52,913
Anybody here?

1010
01:31:54,582 --> 01:31:56,081
Hello?

1011
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:57,983
Make yourselves known.

1012
01:31:57,985 --> 01:32:00,185
Valley View PD. Come on out.

1013
01:32:05,693 --> 01:32:06,560
Come out.

1014
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:10,798
Police. I know you're up there.

1015
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,534
Come on out.

1016
01:32:15,036 --> 01:32:16,835
Make yourselves known.

1017
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:59,013
- Mom? Cassie?

1018
01:33:00,181 --> 01:33:01,680
Where are you guys?
