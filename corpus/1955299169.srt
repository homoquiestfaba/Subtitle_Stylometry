1
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,944
Huh!

2
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,110
Hey!

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,571
Hey!

4
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,315
Huh!

5
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,066
Right, yeah!

6
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,947
Whoo!

7
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,787
Hey, melea.

8
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,279
Go, girl!

9
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,581
Whoo!

10
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,350
Whoo!

11
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,399
Whoa!

12
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,384
Yeah!

13
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,212
Whoo!

14
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,638
<i>Ow.!</i>

15
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,399
Check her out! Yeah! Yeah!

16
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,398
Ha!

17
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,318
Shake it! Yes!

18
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,860
Ha! Ha!

19
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,063
Come on, shake it!

20
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,518
Whoo!

21
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,939
Yeah!

22
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,108
Yeah.

23
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,363
You and your drama, Nadine.

24
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,985
Do you always have to
make such an entrance?

25
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,032
Lam nothing if not dramatic.

26
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,834
How long have
you known me for?

27
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,541
Well, since our mothers
grew up here together,

28
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,332
I would have to say
before we were born.

29
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,995
Mm-hmm. And that's how
it's gonna stay.

30
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,035
From womb to tomb, baby!

31
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,877
I know that's right.
Got this tonight.

32
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,342
You guys are crazy.

33
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,299
And you love it.
Yeah, I do. I do.

34
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,933
You know, being around them, it makes
me miss being with someone special.

35
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,473
And, baby, you are so on my...

36
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,716
Okay. You...

37
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,059
You need to not touch me. I'm not
trying to hear that. On!

38
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,686
Yo, give it up,lasen
whatever, man.

39
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,022
I'm ready to go, anyway.

40
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,776
Yeah, we should go, too.
We have class in the morning.

41
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,859
You go ahead.

42
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,534
I'm gonna hang outwith Nadine
for a little while.

43
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,606
Come on,
I'll see you tomorrow.

44
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,197
Don't be too late.
I won't.

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,278
Bye, ladies.
Bye.

46
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,198
Have fun. Not too much.

47
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,254
Yeah, he's a good one.

48
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,627
Maybe I should come to your fancy
university and snag me a cutie, too.

49
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,460
Been trying to tell you.

50
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,756
Girl, I have a job.

51
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,009
I'm just saying, you have other
talents besides teaching.

52
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,853
You can't let all of this go to waste.

53
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,759
Oh, no, it won't,
'cause, um...

54
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,728
<i>See that guy at the 'oar'? Yeah.</i>

55
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:54,269
Yeah, well, he's about to pay
for my drinks all night. Oh-ho!

56
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,563
Can I get you something?

57
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,647
I'm not drinking.

58
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,651
You know, meme,
we give the people a show.

59
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,903
The least they can do
is buy our refreshments.

60
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,534
Have fun.

61
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,827
It's time for a real battle.

62
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,334
What?

63
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,419
Come on, guys.
Let's kick some ass.

64
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,092
Yeah!

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Yes!

66
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,145
All right.

67
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,822
Who are they?

68
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,571
I have no idea.

69
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,745
Okay, you gotta
take this for me.

70
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,340
Let's do this.

71
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,982
Yeah.

72
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,944
Yeah!

73
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,301
Come on, please.

74
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,312
<i>Not tonight, guys.</i>

75
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,232
<i>Security, security!
Take this out.</i>

76
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,731
Damn. Every time.
This ain't over.

77
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,693
Oh, we're just
getting started.

78
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,316
Yo! Hey, hey!

79
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,736
What are you doing? Stay out of it.
Hey!

80
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,455
Let's go. What are they
even fighting for?

81
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,830
I told you!

82
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,922
It wasn't
that big a deal.

83
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,672
Things just get a little crazy
between cliques there sometimes.

84
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,134
I knew I shouldn't
have left you alone.

85
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,801
I wasn't alone. I was
with Nadine and my crew.

86
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,180
Your crew?
Yeah.

87
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,894
Just 'cause you spent
your summers growing up here,

88
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,313
does not make you from here.

89
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,892
And you need to relax.

90
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,727
Nothing bad happened.

91
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,152
In fact,
i learned some new moves

92
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,770
from this girl that I battled.

93
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,572
She was dope.

94
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,151
I think I might
use some of the moves

95
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,896
in my Romeo and Juliet thesis.

96
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,945
You have such
a one-track mind.

97
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,162
Is it always
about dance with you?

98
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,542
No, occasionally,
it's about you.

99
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,198
Occasionally?
Mm-hmm.

100
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,287
Oh, okay.

101
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,081
Well, you know, I'm busy.
Got a lot of stuff to do.

102
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,206
You're so busy.

103
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,746
Are you too busy for this?

104
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,340
Nope. I'm late for class.

105
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,592
Okay, cool.

106
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,008
Oh, you have some new tracks
for me later, right?

107
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,854
Yes, captain.

108
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,138
Stupid.

109
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,689
<i>Five, six...
Five, six, seven, hit it.</i>

110
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,945
Yes!

111
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,407
Yeah!

112
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,250
Whoo!

113
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,510
Go, go!

114
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,125
Yeah!

115
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,716
Yeah!

116
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey!

117
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,981
Hold on. I need to take this.

118
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,435
Yeah?

119
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,947
Yo, melea, that was hot.

120
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,949
And I'm gonna need you
to run it by me again later.

121
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,410
Why? You jealous that
i got some moves you don't?

122
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,992
He is.
Hey.

123
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,157
What?

124
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,155
Melea. Administrator
wants to see you.

125
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,377
So, go.

126
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,417
Okay, guys, let's take it
from the top.

127
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,836
Do I have to tell you twice?

128
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,474
Let's go.

129
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,322
Melea, whatever it is,
we'll figure something out.

130
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,653
There's nothing
to figure out, Erik.

131
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,107
I'm getting kicked
out of school,

132
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,077
and I won't be able to
present my thesis project.

133
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,619
It's our thesis project, and
I'm just as upset as you are.

134
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,213
No, you're not.

135
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,167
Come over,
and we'll talk about it.

136
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,038
Please? I can't.
I'll call you later.

137
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,813
So, what's the problem?

138
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,185
My tuition is overdue, and i
can't return to class until it's paid.

139
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,033
And what about
your scholarships?

140
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,362
Not enough.

141
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,617
And you weren't
going to tell me?

142
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,662
I mean, you already let me stay here.
You put food on the table.

143
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,664
The least l can
do is handle this.

144
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,379
Melea, you know I will do
anything to help you.

145
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,842
But you have to talk to me.

146
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,802
Well, you know I promised mom
that I would get my degree.

147
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,100
Ever since I started doing this
Romeo and Juliet thesis...

148
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,639
Phew.

149
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,983
I thought it was the perfect
way to honor her memory.

150
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,609
I'm pretty sure that giving up is
a lousy way to honor your mother.

151
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,572
You're probably right.

152
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,238
And I'm pretty sure
you're gonna beat this.

153
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,531
What makes you so sure?

154
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,991
I screwed everything
up so much already.

155
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,207
Well, you're a smart young lady.
And that's important.

156
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,961
But mostly, you're very
stubborn and thick-headed.

157
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,962
Gee, thanks.

158
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,466
I think we need to do less
talking and more eating.

159
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,893
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

160
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,643
I'm gonna get a job,
figure it out.

161
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,024
H ow?

162
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,478
I don't know.
I'll find a space.

163
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,319
I'll mount it myself.

164
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,574
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

165
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,201
'Cause I have
something to say, Erik.

166
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,490
<i>'Cause Romeo and
Juliet hasn't been done</i>

167
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,622
in the way that
i want to do it.

168
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,492
And dance is the way I speak.

169
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,326
I want to be able
to tell this story,

170
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,285
and have it reach
out to people.

171
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,591
It's my mom's favorite play, and
i want to honor her with it.

172
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
You will.

173
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,465
Why does it have
to be right now?

174
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,756
I mean, I get it. I'm the
same way with my music,

175
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,853
but I think you need to focus on
money and getting back into school,

176
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,350
and then worry
about your show.

177
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,515
I'm gonna figure
out a way to do both.

178
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,018
And costumes, and sets.
It's not cheap.

179
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,977
How're you gonna
afford all that?

180
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,109
Ticket sales, eventually. Oh!

181
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,116
Um... and you're still gonna
help me with the music, right?

182
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,494
You're serious?

183
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,197
I'm dead serious.

184
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,044
But if you pull this off,
then, yes, I'll do the music.

185
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,169
Great.

186
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,995
Now, all I have
to do is find a job,

187
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,174
so I can afford paper to print tickets.

188
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,554
Wish me luck.
Yeah, you don't need it.

189
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,635
And look, if all else fails, i
mean, at least you got Romeo.

190
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,219
You can
be so corny sometimes.

191
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,556
Yeah, that was corny. All
right, I'm out of here. Bye.

192
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,708
Hello.
My name is melea Martin.

193
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,999
I'm a hip-hop choreographer,

194
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,832
and I'm interested in interviewing
for your open position.

195
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,338
<i>Hip-hop? Oh, no. We only
teach ballet and jazz here.</i>

196
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,173
Okay, I see you. Get it.

197
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,831
Oh, you like what you see?

198
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,335
Come and get some.

199
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,460
Oh, it's like that? Okay.

200
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,547
Whoo!

201
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh, crystal, you do not want
to mess with my friend.

202
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,388
Melea is no joke.

203
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,063
Yeah, right.

204
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,102
Okay, everybody,
get back to class now.

205
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,517
I don't want
anyone being late.

206
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,768
Go hit those books
like you hit those moves.

207
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,363
Zam, you, too.

208
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,162
I've seen you before.
You are good.

209
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,409
Thank you.

210
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,997
Wow! You really impressed him.

211
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,041
That was his version of rambling.
He never says anything.

212
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,586
He seems like a cool kid.

213
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,961
Oh, he is.
He's just hard to reach.

214
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,167
Hmm.

215
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,836
What are you doing today?

216
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,385
Oh, just a job search, but
they don't have anything here.

217
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,312
Yeah, budget cuts.

218
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,598
Why the need for
money all of a sudden?

219
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,851
<i>F or school</i>

220
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,693
all my scholarships ran out.
And now they want cash.

221
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,234
Welcome to the real world.
Tell me about it.

222
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,145
Okay, well,
i better get inside

223
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,864
before my students
form a coup. Good luck.

224
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:08,994
Okay, thank you.
Call me.

225
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
All right.
Ooh, give me my phone?

226
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,280
Oh, shoot,
i almost forgot.

227
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,334
Here you are. Bye.
Thanks, girl.

228
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,620
Don't ever give up.

229
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,787
Hey, yo, check it.

230
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,178
What happened?
You playing hooky?

231
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,139
Not that
it's any of your business,

232
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,759
but I'm taking
a break from school.

233
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,969
Oh!

234
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,345
So, now you back in the hood.
Bumped down to our level.

235
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,939
For your information,
i live in this neighborhood.

236
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,771
I don't consider
it a bump-down.

237
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,110
What's your name, girl?

238
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,069
Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

239
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,162
I'm lshani.
Everybody knows me.

240
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,869
I'm melea.

241
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,741
And you should get to know me
before you judge me.

242
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,121
So, what? You want to have me
over for tea or something?

243
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,536
This girl's a trip.

244
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,337
Everything all right, melea?

245
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,633
Yeah, taariq.
We're cool.

246
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,644
If you're looking for friends,
go back to America,

247
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,641
'cause you won't
find them here.

248
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,894
Come on, let's go.
We got better things to do.

249
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,897
Yeah.
She's a waste of time.

250
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,995
- Where to?
Bo-kaap.

251
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,709
Bo-kaap.

252
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,960
You know,
i don't need security.

253
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,837
Are you sure about that?

254
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,217
We just came here
to dance, man.

255
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,608
Yo, yo! 'Sup, boys?

256
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,490
Yo, what's up?
Boy!

257
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,991
Yo, what's happening?

258
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,492
What's up?

259
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,964
Yeah, go! Hit it!

260
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,590
Yeah!

261
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,064
I like your style, taariq. It's
pretty dope. I'll catch you later.

262
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,226
Peace,taaflq.
You guys are great.

263
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,935
Thank you.
Yeah! Sweet.

264
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,605
All right, let's do it.

265
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,413
You are making the best decision, Mr.
Wright.

266
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,785
Well, I sure hope so.

267
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,921
Mr. Wright.
Yes?

268
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,923
Oh, my goodness.
It's melea. Isn't it?

269
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,666
Yeah, I can't believe
you remember me.

270
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,758
Well, you look
just like your mother.

271
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,103
How's she doing?
Ls she with you?

272
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,929
Um, no. She passed.
About a year ago.

273
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,726
Oh, lord. Lam sorry.

274
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,063
She was one fine lady.

275
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,017
Yeah, she was.

276
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,820
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about working here at bijou.

277
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,775
Is there anything i
can do around here?

278
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,413
Melea, you're too late.

279
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,867
The lady who
just left, uh, miss Lee,

280
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,621
she's thinking
of buying the place.

281
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,998
Well, you're gonna sell it?
Like, why?

282
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,170
Because I'm old.

283
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,629
And I ain't made
a dime in years.

284
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,338
Hey, this might sound crazy,
but can I ask you a favor?

285
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,471
Okay, now, close your eyes.

286
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,676
Step.

287
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,181
Don't look yet!

288
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,687
How can I look? Your hands
are covering my eyes.

289
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,562
Oh, wow!

290
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,357
This place is amazing.
I know, right?

291
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,613
Well, it needs
a lot of work, but...

292
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,945
Nothing a mop
and nails won't fix.

293
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,701
That's being optimistic.

294
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,537
So, are you in, for real? Phew.

295
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,673
'Yeah.Yeah, let's do this. Yeah?

296
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,128
Grab the mop.
Okay.

297
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,974
Perfect. And one, and two...

298
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,639
And one. Point your feet.

299
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,771
One more time.

300
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,389
Thank you.
Yeah, you should...

301
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,113
Hey.

302
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,976
Oh, melea,
where have you been?

303
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,146
Hey.

304
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,244
Just because
you're a dropout

305
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,988
doesn't mean you can't hang
with us intellects.

306
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,990
I promise we
won't use big words.

307
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,202
You're an idiot, and I've been busy.
Check this out.

308
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,414
<i>Romeo and Juliet? Yo,
i have to be a part of this.</i>

309
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,872
I was hoping you
would say that,

310
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,915
'cause you could
seriously rock mercutio.

311
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,127
Yeah, you know it.
Which one is that?

312
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,342
It's Romeo's friend.

313
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,801
He gets in between the families
and ends up getting killed.

314
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,342
Well, I don't want to die.

315
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,795
No, dude, it's a tragedy.
Everyone dies.

316
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:08,887
Oh.

317
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,101
How about lord capulet?

318
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,270
Lord'? Yeah, I'm on it.
Yes.

319
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,439
One more time, please.

320
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,653
Yo, melea!
Hey.

321
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,565
How's it going?
Good, how are you?

322
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,485
Yeah, good. Passing all right?
It's going.

323
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,577
You gotta see some
of these dancers, though.

324
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,905
I mean, look at that guy.
He is dope.

325
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,670
Wow!

326
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,674
You know that guy?
Yeah, dajon.

327
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,684
Whoa!

328
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,677
Mema, he is sick.
He's killing it.

329
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,058
Hey, excuse me.

330
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,348
<i>Damn'?</i>

331
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,606
Yeah, that's me.

332
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,789
Oh, my god. It's taj.
Boy 1; That taj?

333
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,326
Boy 22 hey, it's taj!
Boy 32 is that taj?

334
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,668
Hey, how's it going, taj?

335
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,670
Hey, it's taj.
Hey, man.

336
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,382
<i>Hey, ta},

337
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,053
Erik, I found my Romeo.

338
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,682
His name is dajon bell.
He's from the states, and...

339
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,089
Look, who do you...

340
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,466
Oh!

341
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,224
Shit. Not you again.

342
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,232
Erik, let me
call you back.

343
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,886
What's this?

344
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,152
<i>It's a hip-hop r and j.</i>

345
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,270
A what?

346
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,109
<i>Amp-hop Romeo and Juliet.</i>

347
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,952
Okay, that's not just crazy,
that's stupid crazy.

348
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,908
What's stupid crazy?

349
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,292
Hey, girl. I see you're
still holding it down.

350
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,329
Where you been? Man, you're
all over the charts.

351
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,004
Yeah, good times.

352
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,130
Hey, I'm taj.

353
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,170
Melea. I know who you are.
Everyone knows who you are.

354
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,167
We pretty much grew up in the
same neighborhood, actually.

355
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,643
You're from New York? Yo,
what are you doing out here?

356
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,774
Going to school. Or at least I was.
It's a long story.

357
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,099
Uh, you out here on
tour or something?

358
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,856
Nah, I got a home out here. Visited
once and fell in love with the place.

359
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,530
So, when I'm not touring, I come
and hang out with my people.

360
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,525
Like lshani, here.

361
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,572
She's not your people. Why are
you telling her your business?

362
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,156
Why you throwing shade?

363
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,701
'Cause this crazy-ass
bitch got it in her head

364
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,706
<i>to do a hip-hop
Romeo and Juliet.</i>

365
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,629
Why I gotta be a bitch,
and a crazy-ass one at that?

366
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,923
Yo, don't mind lshani. All right?
She has a short fuse.

367
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,586
<i>But listen, that r and j,
built for hip-hop.</i>

368
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,885
All them rich folks
killing each other.

369
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,969
It's perfect.

370
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,139
Would you think that you
could do some music for us?

371
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,852
Well, I have been looking
to spread my wings a bit.

372
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,896
You know, get into TV, film, whatnot.
But I don't have the time.

373
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,363
Gimme your phone.

374
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,538
Here's my number.
Text me.

375
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,498
Come through, and if you like what
you see, please get involved.

376
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,420
I'll think about it.

377
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,499
Thanks.

378
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,543
Nice to meet you, melea.

379
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,014
Hit me later, all right? Got some
business I gotta take care of.

380
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,551
Just wanted to show
my face real quick.

381
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,472
It's bad enough you guys
hang out at our spots

382
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,846
and steal our moves.

383
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,772
Oh, yeah.

384
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,021
You didn't think we knew why
you college kids were there?

385
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,274
We're not stupid.

386
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,897
And you can have the dances.

387
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,363
But taj is off limits.
Understood?

388
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,534
You like him. Wow!

389
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,698
It's funny, because the way
that he kissed you

390
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,865
is the way a brother
kisses his little sister.

391
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,333
Think about it, lshani.

392
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,705
A rich and
famous guy like that

393
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,541
could have any girl
that he wants.

394
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,961
Why would he want to be
with a bully like you?

395
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,466
Hey,
can I fit two more?

396
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,716
We need
at least one more.

397
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,067
Hey, did you get to check out
those videos I sent you?

398
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,649
Oh, yeah, balcony scene.
All over it.

399
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,355
Okay, let's give it a shot.
Hit it, zam.

400
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,165
Oh, you must be Erik.

401
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,344
Uh, you must be Mr. Wright. You
have a beautiful theater, sir.

402
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,474
Well, she's seen better days.

403
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,684
Butsoon,
it won't be my problem.

404
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,624
That was great.
Okay.

405
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,406
Thanks, thanks.

406
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,537
Erik, finally.
Where have you been?

407
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,705
Sorry.
I got caught up at school.

408
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,460
What's up? I'm Erik.

409
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,581
Dajon. How's it going?

410
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,668
Good, yeah.

411
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,592
He's my boyfriend
and composer.

412
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,211
Act one, fight scene.

413
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,087
It's just the first take.

414
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,550
What's wrong?

415
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,894
I mean, this scene
is just not working.

416
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,314
Yeah.
Yeah.

417
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,135
What's not working?

418
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:34,107
I mean, I don't know. It's... these
kids are in rival gangs, right?

419
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,149
Right, right, and we should
be playing into that, right?

420
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,034
Well, yeah, because when their parents
find out, they're gonna freak.

421
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,112
Yep.

422
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,236
So, maybe we can
sex it up a little?

423
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,494
It's a love scene.

424
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,575
No, he might be right.
Play into the tension.

425
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,662
Yeah.

426
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,616
So, maybe, we can add something
like this, you know, like...

427
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,208
Like there,
and then, maybe, you know...

428
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,383
Mm-hmm.
Something like that.

429
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,593
Yeah? No, it's supposed
to be romantic.

430
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,512
You should do
something like this.

431
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,891
Okay.

432
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,265
All right, well,
that's not bad.

433
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,388
Yeah. It was...
It was perfect.

434
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,274
Oh, if you say so, Romeo.
Melea, let's take five.

435
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,773
Yeah, good idea.
Yeah, take five.

436
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,935
Thanks.
All right.

437
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,113
Take 10.

438
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,026
What was all that about?

439
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,489
What? I don't like the way
you're dancing with him.

440
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,236
You're jealous?

441
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,361
No, I'm not jealous.

442
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,874
Okay, maybe a little.

443
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,989
I'm not exactly his type.

444
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,997
What are you talking about?
You're everyone's type.

445
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,959
Not the kind of guy
that likes other guys.

446
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,496
Oh, right.

447
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,553
Ah, yes. I... I missed that.

448
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,510
Yeah, that's obvious.
Yeah. Sorry.

449
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,216
Cool. Can we get out of here? Grab
a bite or something? Anything?

450
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,475
I can't. I have to keep
practicing with dajon,

451
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,598
if I want our chemistry
to be believable, you know?

452
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,145
We're new partners.
Mm-hmm.

453
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,438
So we have to
feel each other out.

454
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,481
Right.

455
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,284
Promise after all this is over,
everything will be different.

456
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,779
Cool. All right.

457
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,280
Bye, guys.
Bye.

458
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,992
Ready to hit it again?
Let's do it.

459
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,092
<i>Hey-
hey.-</i>

460
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,931
what are you watching?

461
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,138
The ballet, for inspiration.

462
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,887
You know, when nureyev did
this, they applauded for 40 minutes.

463
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,225
Don't compare yourself. I mean,
you're doing hip-hop, right?

464
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,734
Yeah.

465
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,034
But this is a classic.
It sets the bar.

466
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,609
Yeah, but it
was written, when?

467
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,737
You have to speak
to your audience.

468
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,584
I mean, you got romeos and
juliets all over the flats.

469
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,162
You're right.

470
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,748
Hmm.

471
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,296
Hey, man.
Yo, what's cruisin', man?

472
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,594
Good, man.

473
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,346
What's up?

474
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,135
Why are we
here, again?

475
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,270
Because I want to change the
tone of our Romeo and Juliet.

476
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,151
I want the reality of
this place to inspire us.

477
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,476
We've got company.

478
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,943
Do you know who that is?

479
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,447
Yeah, I know him.
Who invited him?

480
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,660
Who cares?

481
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,991
My view just got 100% better.

482
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,459
Hey, I didn't know
you would make it.

483
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,292
I listened to that
score you sent me.

484
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,587
Oh, you did?

485
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,380
Oh, like that's not what
you wanted me to do.

486
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,125
I mean, I was hoping so.
Yeah, I figured.

487
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,137
I took a shot at that parting
scene, where you and Romeo split.

488
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,470
Yeah. And I came up with this.

489
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,694
Okay.
Yeah?

490
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,440
I feel it.
A'ight.

491
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,522
You want to try it?

492
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,817
Hell, yeah.

493
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,900
Come on.

494
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,579
Meleai Erik.

495
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,248
Erik.

496
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,575
Erik.

497
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,038
Want me to go after him?

498
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,711
No, it must not
have been important.

499
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,797
Hey- hey-

500
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,721
who was that?
Oh, her boyfriend.

501
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,095
Trouble in paradise.

502
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,684
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

503
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,107
Phew!
Nice session, yeah?

504
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,280
Yeah.

505
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,815
All right.

506
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,367
I'll see you tomorrow, melea.

507
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,028
<i>Thank you, dawn.</i>

508
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,041
Thank you.

509
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,788
Bye, guys.

510
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,830
Bye, ta]- .

511
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,588
Thank you so much for the song, taj.
It was perfect.

512
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,644
It's no problem. Just glad
everything worked out.

513
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,393
Listen,
i gotta hit a session,

514
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,311
but I'm having a party Saturday,
if you all wanna stop by.

515
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,561
I'm there.

516
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,853
You can apologize to your
other guests in advance,

517
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,807
'cause you won't be
able to resist me.

518
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,858
Wow, Nadine. Really?

519
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,953
Shush. He has a private jet.
I can come visit you.

520
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,119
I'm flattered,
but I'm kinda seeing someone.

521
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,241
Damn.
All the good ones are taken.

522
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,498
Hey. I'm a good one.

523
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,171
Ew. You're like my brother.
Don't be weird.

524
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,337
You two are funny.

525
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,381
What about you, melea?
See you at the party?

526
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,554
I don't know, I have
a lot to do with the show.

527
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,973
I don't know if I can
make it, but I'll try.

528
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,932
Yo, you might meet some folks
who could help you.

529
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,472
And your girl
lshani will be there.

530
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,928
That's the girl you've been telling
me about? The one we battled?

531
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,018
Yeah.

532
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,612
Now I know
i can't make it.

533
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,478
A'ight, come on.
She's cool.

534
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,610
Talks a lot of trash, but she's
going through some deep shit.

535
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,531
Like what?

536
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,164
Her little brother, Emmanuel,
was killed last year.

537
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,410
Some messed-up gang thing over
a fancy chain he was wearing.

538
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,115
I didn't realize.

539
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,207
Yeah, I know a lot of kids
going through the same thing.

540
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,209
Yeah, it's bad.

541
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,593
So, cut her some slack, maybe.

542
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,715
She could use more
good people in her life.

543
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,840
See ya.

544
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,138
Bye.

545
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,595
I know that look.

546
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,515
That's your "i want to
save the world" look.

547
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,189
I heard that.

548
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,528
It was nice.

549
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,358
Come in.

550
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,236
I had already written
music for that scene.

551
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,411
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

552
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,539
Babe, you know i
can't do this without you.

553
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,424
You sure seemed like
you were doing fine earlier.

554
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,796
You know what taj
brings to this project.

555
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,220
Yeah, credibility. I know, I get it.
He's an established artist.

556
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,971
Yeah, but that doesn't change
how I feel about you.

557
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,433
It just seems like
the only thing you care about

558
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,933
<i>is this Romeo and Juliet show.</i>

559
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,060
Well, it is important to me.

560
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,734
Especially without school, and
being where my mom grew up,

561
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,784
seeing how it is here,
it makes me feel obligated.

562
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,401
Yeah, so you want
me to play the role

563
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,988
of the understanding
boyfriend?

564
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,081
If you don't mind.
Okay. Yeah.

565
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,500
Love you when you're crazy.

566
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,908
I've had plenty of
practice for that.

567
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,916
So, we should be okay.
Thanks.

568
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,628
Besides, there's one thing I know
i can do way better than taj.

569
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,170
Really? What is that?

570
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,803
Dance.

571
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,145
<i>And five, six, seven, eight.</i>

572
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,119
Bring the energy
up, guys. Ready?

573
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,503
Yes, laser!

574
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,173
Go for it, Nadine.

575
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,648
Okay, break it up,
break it up.

576
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,149
Stop the music.
Stop the music.

577
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,108
Look, I like you guys' attitude,
but let me ask you something.

578
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,363
Do you really know
what this play is about?

579
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,776
No.

580
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,704
That's what I thought.
Sit down.

581
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,952
All right, so I'm gonna
give you the lowdown.

582
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,868
So, the capulets
are Juliet's parents.

583
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,588
They don't get along
with Romeo's parents.

584
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:25,298
You guys hate each other. It's kind
of like rival gangs in the flats.

585
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,345
<i>Everyone knows
the basic plot of the story.</i>

586
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,435
<i>Boy and girl fall in love,
and die in the end.</i>

587
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,153
<i>But it's so much
more than that.</i>

588
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:53,701
<i>It's a story of forbidden love surrounded
by violence, revenge, and death.</i>

589
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:59,831
<i>People died basically for no reason,
just like here in the flats.</i>

590
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,343
<i>And Juliet is in
the middle of it all.</i>

591
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,295
<i>Alone, confused, and afraid.</i>

592
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,806
So, benvolio and mercutio,
they're Romeo's friends.

593
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,565
And they get into it with
tybalt, who is Juliet's cousin.

594
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,779
He's one badass dude.

595
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,647
<i>Our version of the story opens</i>

596
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,157
<i>on a big rumble
between the families.</i>

597
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
Everyone's fighting like it's a
Saturday night in the flats.

598
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,158
<i>And these fights are sick.</i>

599
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,405
<i>During one of the fights,
Romeo ends up getting killed</i>

600
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,497
<i>by Juliet's
badass cousin, tybalt.</i>

601
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,292
<i>Eventually,
Romeo gets run out of town</i>

602
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,996
<i>and that makes
things much worse.</i>

603
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,046
<i>But during our
opening fight, this cop,</i>

604
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,631
better known as
the prince of verona,

605
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,546
shows up and
breaks up the fight.

606
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,305
<i>He tells them that
the next guy to start a fight</i>

607
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,520
<i>is gonna be punished
with death.</i>

608
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,889
<i>So, they all scatter.</i>

609
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,362
But let's get back to the
capulets and the montagues.

610
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,363
<i>Juliet's parents are
talking to this guy, Paris.</i>

611
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,649
<i>He's one of their own,</i>

612
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,658
<i>but he's just a rich guy
that's got his eye on Juliet.</i>

613
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,289
<i>And right then and there,</i>

614
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,585
<i>they tell her that she has to marry
the guy, without even asking.</i>

615
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,375
<i>So, they send out
invites for a party</i>

616
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,177
<i>to get the two
of them together,</i>

617
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,100
<i>and it's capulets only.</i>

618
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,202
<i>And my man, Romeo, shows up,
steals the invite,</i>

619
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,411
<i>and has the bright idea
of crashing the party.</i>

620
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,703
<i>That's where he meets Juliet.</i>

621
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,497
<i>And it's love at first sight.</i>

622
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,128
And that, folks,
is just the beginning.

623
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,963
Yeah!

624
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,129
Yes.

625
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,795
<i>L like it.</i>

626
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,842
Bye, melea.
Bye.

627
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,217
Great stuff today.
Yeah, you, too.

628
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,763
Thank you. Thank you.

629
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,885
All right, see you soon.
Bye, see you soon.

630
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,483
Bye, girl.
Bye.

631
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,729
See you later.
Bye.

632
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,021
Melea?

633
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,404
Just wanted to tell you I'm proud of you.
You're doing a great job.

634
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,904
Thank you, Mr. Diego.
You're welcome.

635
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,614
And I think you can
call me Eduardo now.

636
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,315
Especially since you're in charge.

637
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,742
Thanks.

638
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,122
But I just can't shake the feeling
that I'm missing something.

639
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,963
The piece needs more.

640
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,286
Edge.
Yes.

641
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,875
A lot of shows have
more than one choreographer.

642
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,341
You need someone with a fresh set of eyes.
A different flair.

643
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:59,176
Someone with a raw passion. You
find them, and this show will sing.

644
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,351
Thank you.

645
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,365
Yes, you said it.

646
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,912
- Really?
- Yeah.

647
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,663
I've been spending time there.

648
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,504
I just think you could find something
better to do with your time.

649
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:30,671
Ishani, you keep telling me I could
do so much to help the flats,

650
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,091
and now that I'm doing it,
you're still not happy.

651
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,222
How is helping that
American chick helping us?

652
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,589
Whoa!
Forget I'm American, too?

653
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,006
Not like her.

654
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,349
Look, melea's got
a lot of kids dancing for her.

655
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,482
Kids who would usually
be out on the streets

656
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,519
getting into trouble
like your...

657
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,979
I'm... yo, I'm... I'm sorry.

658
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,725
Yeah, you should be.

659
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,002
Rented out a private...

660
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,538
Probably, yes.

661
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,586
Great, right on cue.

662
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,880
Sniffing around
for taj, I guess.

663
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,009
No, I was actually
coming to see you.

664
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,814
Girl, you need to stay out of
my face before I hurt you.

665
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,309
Nadinei meme.

666
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,810
Hey, you made it.

667
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,692
Yeah, I came
to talk to lshani.

668
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:32,153
Oh. The kind of talk
where I need

669
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,400
to take off my
shoes and earrings?

670
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,692
Wasn't planning on it.
That's on lshani.

671
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,276
You need to leave before
you both get a beatdown.

672
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,566
Okay, girl.

673
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,871
You're not the only one
with friends around here.

674
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,751
Okay, you guys, it's
not going down like that.

675
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,828
Mm.

676
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,418
You need to accept the fact
that I'm not scared of you.

677
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,091
You should be.

678
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,878
Whatever.

679
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,513
Look, I need you
to work on my show.

680
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,013
What?

681
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,089
No, thanks.

682
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,220
Why not?

683
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,056
Do you have
something better to do?

684
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,891
I know your type,
and you're not gonna play me.

685
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,398
You put on a show,
and when it's over,

686
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,820
you take off back to America,
and we're still here.

687
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,160
Nothing changes. No jobs, no
money, no hope, nowhere to go.

688
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,329
Kids getting killed
over a goddamn necklace.

689
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,081
So, what would you suggest?
What would work for you?

690
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,707
What would make you happy?

691
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,254
I don't know.

692
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,919
Maybe a rec center,
or a dance hall.

693
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,299
Some place a kid could go and
do something besides drugs.

694
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,677
Then let's do it.

695
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,308
And there's that
"save the world" shit.

696
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,273
I'm serious.
Let's make a difference.

697
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,650
You don't have to stop
at one night, one show.

698
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,775
I want to help.

699
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,702
Are you in?

700
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,038
There's love in the house!
Yeah, baby!

701
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,588
Hey, heads up, everybody.

702
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,803
This is our new
co-choreographer, lshani mfeke.

703
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,803
She will also be dancing
the role of tybalt,

704
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,768
so if you think
she ain't man enough,

705
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,928
I'd watch my back
if I were you.

706
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,399
Well, melea.
You sure this is a good idea?

707
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,943
No,but l haven't been sure of
anything since I started this.

708
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,114
Okay.

709
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,323
But I'm watching you.

710
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,700
Okay, guys, let's set it off.

711
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,656
And make sure to
hit this hard, okay?

712
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,895
All right, get low.

713
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,355
And five, six, seven, eight.

714
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:33,616
And one, and two, and three, and
four, and five, six, seven, eight.

715
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:39,169
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and eight.

716
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,790
- All right, hit it from the top.
- All right.

717
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,609
See, now, that's old school.

718
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,324
Think you have something better?
If they can bring it.

719
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,155
Well, that's what you're here for.
Go out there and show 'em.

720
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,742
No problem.

721
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,327
Follow my lead.

722
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,303
Five, six, seven, eight.

723
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,543
Damn.

724
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,576
She's good.
Hmm.

725
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,880
I'm not gonna tell
her that, though.

726
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,378
It's okay. She already knows.

727
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,011
And five, six, seven, eight.

728
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,969
What's up?
Hi, how are you?

729
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,308
Good.

730
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,272
I see you guys
are hard at it.

731
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,515
It's going well.

732
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,402
You have something
for me?

733
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,993
Not yet, but I listened
to your boyfriend's track,

734
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,820
and I'm gonna
lace it with lyrics.

735
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,775
Might want to tell him to add a
horn, just to kick it up a bit.

736
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,656
I will. Thank you.

737
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,618
- Your girl over there is amazing.
- Yeah, I know.

738
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,207
She's not my girl.

739
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,706
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

740
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,255
Hmm.

741
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,509
Hmm?

742
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,090
What was that?

743
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,702
Whoa!

744
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,569
Hey, meme?

745
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,655
What?

746
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,580
Come here. We got a problem.

747
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,490
What's up?

748
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,405
Tickets aren't selling
as fast as we had hoped.

749
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,787
At this rate,
we won't have a full house.

750
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,245
That's not an option.
We have to sell out.

751
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,206
We have to make enough
to pay rent on the rec center.

752
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:21,103
Melea, this is my mama
and my sister, Kiara.

753
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,390
Pleased to meet you,
Mrs. mfeke. Kiara.

754
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,185
They're both seamstresses,

755
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,149
so mama was thinking
they could help out

756
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,769
with the costumes
we still need.

757
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,106
That would be great.

758
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,611
Let me show you
what I borrowed

759
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,112
from the college's
wardrobe department.

760
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,198
Um...

761
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,790
I truly appreciate you giving
'shani this opportunity.

762
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,205
She's been needing
something like this.

763
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,464
They both have.

764
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,922
I couldn't do it without her,
believe me. Thank you.

765
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,549
I think Juliet's family
should wear red.

766
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,387
Sounds great.

767
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,219
Everyone take five.

768
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,429
Melea, can I talk to you?
What's up?

769
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,944
<i>You know the whole Romeo
and Juliet theme? Hmm.</i>

770
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,021
It's all about the dumb stuff
people pull, beginning to end.

771
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,940
Yeah, but in this scene,
these guys are family.

772
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,903
So, they don't act dumb?

773
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,453
You ever been to a party
and someone wasn't acting out?

774
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,827
Not lately, no.
Exactly.

775
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,161
Even the ladies should be
trying to one-up each other.

776
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,077
Like when we first met.

777
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,082
So, what you're saying is...

778
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,958
Get over here.
Let's show 'em how it's done.

779
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,512
Okay.

780
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,552
Zam, give us something
we can work with.

781
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,262
What you want?

782
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,978
Quit playing around.

783
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,021
Come on, let's bring it.
You ready?

784
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,603
Whoo!

785
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,759
Yes!

786
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,017
That's what I'm talkin' about.

787
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,809
You pushed Juliet, and she pushed back.
L love that

788
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,436
okay. That was hot.

789
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,570
You're okay by me.

790
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,571
Man,
you girls are soft.

791
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,702
You love it.

792
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,766
And five, six, seven, eight.

793
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,479
Cue Romeo.

794
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,863
Really get into it.

795
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:28,701
Feel it.

796
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,420
- Dajon, are you all right?
Mm-mm.

797
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,461
It was an accident.

798
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,924
I'm sorry, man.
It's okay.

799
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,343
Don't... it's okay.

800
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,671
Just need...
Oh, no!

801
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,836
No, it's not okay.

802
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,384
We have to get
you to a hospital.

803
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,427
I'll take him.
My car's out front.

804
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,243
Eduardo, how is he?

805
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,488
It's fractured.

806
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,735
You're definitely
gonna need another Romeo.

807
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,212
I need you.

808
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,376
Whoo!

809
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,416
Yeah.
Yeah.

810
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,631
That was good,
but that song gotta go.

811
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,965
What are you talking about?
I thought it was perfect.

812
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,681
Really? Do you think
that's the best he can do?

813
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,021
Let me guess. You got
something better in mind?

814
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,812
As a matter of fact,
i do, man.

815
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,186
Yeah.

816
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,732
Play it, zam.

817
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,616
Whoo!

818
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,701
Whoo!

819
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,127
Now, that's something new I've
been working on for you, melea.

820
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,007
Because I think
you can do better.

821
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,889
Are you kidding me?

822
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,222
You know,
I'm gettin' really sick

823
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,466
of you running your
mouth all the time.

824
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,807
Shut up, man.
What?

825
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,765
Stop it!

826
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,022
No,no,no.
Stay out of this, lshani.

827
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,555
It's between me and him.

828
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,398
What, I'm stupid?

829
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,863
I'm not.
You're fighting over melea.

830
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,114
What?

831
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,945
We're fighting over the music.

832
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,530
Music? I'm fighting
over my girlfriend.

833
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,987
What... what? No...
Then stop it.

834
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,695
This is insane. Come on, taj is
just trying to help, you guys.

835
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,957
Melea, don't be stupid.

836
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:24,384
You said it yourself.
He can have any girl he wants.

837
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,539
And he wants you.

838
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,209
Hey, lshani.

839
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,756
Ishani, wait.

840
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,352
Hey, where are you going?

841
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:39,472
Anywhere.

842
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,768
Away from here, away from him.

843
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,274
Ishani, look at me.
I'm not into taj.

844
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,185
I'm in love with Erik. Besides,
i wouldn't do that to you.

845
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,475
I know how much you like him.

846
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,818
Do you?

847
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,322
Look, I'm not
playing this game with you.

848
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:57,075
We both know you want taj. You're
always throwing yourself at him.

849
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,366
I'm not gonna be a deooy so you
oan cheat on your boyfriend.

850
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,464
What?

851
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,078
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

852
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,035
Yeah. Yeah, I'm crazy.

853
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,174
Crazy for letting
my guard down

854
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,252
with a girl who's used to
getting whatever she wants.

855
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,418
Crazy to get involved
with you, this show.

856
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,181
Good luck with your
fantasy world, melea.

857
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,260
I'm going back
to the real one.

858
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,601
Hey.

859
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,610
Look, I just want to
let you know that I'm done.

860
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,729
I'm done with us,
I'm done with the show.

861
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,687
If I'm not gonna be
your Romeo in real life,

862
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,608
why am I gonna be
him in your musical?

863
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,071
L just need a break,
all right?

864
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,367
I'm gonna focus on myself.
That's what I'm gonna do.

865
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,451
Erik...
No. Bye, melea.

866
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,279
Meme.

867
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:14,817
Hey.

868
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,775
Hey, girl.

869
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,908
So sorry about all this.

870
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:21,872
But I think it's a sign.

871
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:27,372
Erik said he's out.
Tickets are just not moving.

872
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,577
Mm-mm.

873
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,957
Can't make this happen
out of thin air.

874
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:36,383
So, I think we need to regroup and try
and make this work at another time.

875
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,585
Okay, baby girl?

876
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,604
Wait, Erik didn't bail
on you as well, did he?

877
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,062
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
I'm cool.

878
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,192
Hit me later?

879
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,811
Get in.

880
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,858
I'm not
going anywhere with you.

881
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,947
Girl, I said get in.

882
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,491
What is your problem?

883
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,490
I don't have a problem.

884
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,332
You're the one hung up on a girl
who doesn't care about you.

885
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:34,158
Strutting around here like a fool,
and she ain't even into you.

886
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,825
You're right. She's not.

887
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,249
I guess being rich and famous
doesn't work on everybody, huh?

888
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,853
Apparently not.

889
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,494
Let me ask you somethin'.

890
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,360
Why'd you get so mad?

891
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:13,196
Because I'm your friend, and i
was just looking out for you.

892
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,452
Is that all?

893
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:16,617
Yeah.

894
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:22,214
Damn, that's too bad,
because, um, you're right.

895
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:27,126
Lam crazy about this girl and she
acts like I don't even exist.

896
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,143
That's too bad. Maybe you
should give up on her.

897
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,969
I don't think I can do that.

898
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,017
Not when I'm
this close to her.

899
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,814
What?

900
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:43,476
Ishani, I'm hung up on
somebody, but it's not melea.

901
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:45,362
It's you.

902
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,647
Taj, don't play with me.
I'm not.

903
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,656
Why do you think I come back
here every chance I get?

904
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,367
Ishani, I come to see you.

905
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,365
I don't believe you.
You've never said anything.

906
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,665
Because I didn't want
to ruin our friendship.

907
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,748
And then, your brother...

908
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,631
Hey, lshani, look at me.

909
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,094
I'm tired of waiting
and playing games.

910
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:14,097
I bought a house
to impress you.

911
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,679
I got involved
with the community.

912
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,600
Now, I'm just
gonna flat-out say it.

913
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,063
Ishanlllove“.

914
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,187
Me, too.

915
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,026
Yeah?
Yeah.

916
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,908
Hey, Erik.

917
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,119
We need to talk.

918
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,552
<i>This is zubair khumalo,</i>

919
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,598
<i>and we are live from goodhope
fm studios in cape town.</i>

920
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,812
We got taj in the studio,

921
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,652
and taj has got a brand-new
album coming out this year,

922
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,978
and he's got something
very interesting as well.

923
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,114
Tell us
about it, dawg.

924
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,320
Yeah, man. A hip-hop
performance

925
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,280
<i>of Romeo and Juliet.</i>

926
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,218
Lshani, where have you been?

927
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,468
<i>Shut up.
Put on the radio. 94.0.</i>

928
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,301
What?

929
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,854
Just do it. 94.0.

930
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,852
<i>That is radical, man.</i>

931
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,015
<i>So, musically, what?</i>

932
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,983
<i>All right, are you merging
the two worlds together</i>

933
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,193
<i>like a yin and a Yang?</i>

934
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

935
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,725
but I can't take
all of the credit.

936
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,359
<i>This is a passion project of melea Martin.
A'ight?</i>

937
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,275
And I got my man here with me,
Erik wildwood,

938
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,784
and we did a collabo' together
to make it super-dope.

939
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,077
Yo, tell 'em, e.

940
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,498
I want everyone to know
that I put my heart and soul

941
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,500
<i>into this music, because melea
is the love of my life.</i>

942
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,213
On, my god.

943
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,793
And also that i
will be dancing

944
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,457
the part of Romeo
to her Juliet

945
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,956
at the big show
at the bijou theater.

946
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,224
Love of my life.

947
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,510
Guys, that's amazing, man.

948
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,553
Can we drop this beat?
Can we, like, hear it guys?

949
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,636
<i>Taj". Yo,
ready when you are, man.</i>

950
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:21,722
All right, here it is.

951
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,386
A song by taj,
produced by Erik wildwood.

952
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,725
It's the opening scene

953
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,440
<i>in melea Martin's
hip-hop r and j.</i>

954
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,521
<i>Boo-yam!</i>

955
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,989
Uncle Simon,
what are you doing?

956
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,832
It's for my niece's show, man.
With the youngster, taj.

957
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:42,989
Oh, taj!

958
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,166
Come on, mama. Let's see those moves.

959
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:59,222
You guys are so whack.

960
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,004
Whoo!

961
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:10,003
You said they were only
using it for rehearsals.

962
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:14,091
But there's no rule against the
theater operating, Ms. Lee.

963
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,764
Don't believe me?
Check the contract.

964
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,799
Lam this close
to killing this deal.

965
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,052
If you want
this thing to work,

966
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,764
you had better
start playing ball.

967
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,144
If you want
this thing to work,

968
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,351
best you start considering the
community and what they want.

969
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:34,314
They don't want you,
or your theater.

970
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,437
They've proved that.

971
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,654
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

972
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,900
We'll see.

973
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,429
So, I'm the love
of your life, huh?

974
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,930
Yeah,
i know, it's pretty corny.

975
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,514
No, actually,
it's pretty awesome.

976
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,935
Huh?

977
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,733
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Thatone.

978
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,237
Now, now, move it a bit to the left.
Yeah. Little more.

979
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,911
Little... that's it. Good.

980
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,659
That's perfect.
Now, this one.

981
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:32,794
Hey- hey-

982
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,539
I can't believe it.
Neither can l.

983
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,298
Shoot, I can.

984
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,835
Thank you, guys,
for not giving up on me.

985
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,764
Looks like we're gonna need
to add another performance.

986
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,017
So, you get to change
the world after all.

987
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:55,729
The world? I'll
settle for that dance space.

988
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,192
Me, too.

989
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,272
But we still need
to find a new place.

990
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,649
Wow.

991
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,863
You really know how to suck
the life out of everything.

992
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:03,954
Right?

993
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,908
I don't know how you've
been her friend for so long.

994
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,698
Yeah, neither do I.

995
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,960
Phew.

996
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,096
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Why?

997
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,392
He's great. It's the ending.
I don't like it.

998
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,805
Melea...

999
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,397
No, seriously. I mean, we all
end up dead, and that's it?

1000
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,940
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir.

1001
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,864
You killed me off
in act 3, remember?

1002
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,275
I still don't like it.

1003
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,611
So,changeil

1004
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,530
I can't.
Why not?

1005
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,912
Prokofiev wanted to
change the ending, too,

1006
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,082
but his investors
wouldn't let him.

1007
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,285
So, you're saying
just change the story?

1008
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,370
Why not?

1009
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,672
You already changed the dance.

1010
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:45,496
Yeah, melea. Haven't we all had
enough tragedy in our lives?

1011
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,128
Let's take back control.

1012
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:50,799
Yeah.

1013
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,640
You're right.
Yeah.

1014
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,774
Okay, everybody.
It's gonna be a long night.

1015
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,520
Careful with that, man.

1016
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,737
'Shani, come on!
We gotta go!

1017
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,322
Yeah, coming!

1018
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,500
Wish me luck.

1019
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,692
Thank you.
Thank you.

1020
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,032
And this must...
This little one. Okay?

1021
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,702
Phew.

1022
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,871
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

1023
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,922
Right. You do this
all the time, bro.

1024
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,882
I feel like I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

1025
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:11,045
Then before you die,
you should know something.

1026
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:13,723
What?

1027
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:15,965
You hit like a girl.

1028
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,221
Thanks.

1029
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,635
Better?
Better, yes. Thanks.

1030
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,765
All right.
Gotta get to my seat.

1031
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,152
All right. Enjoy.

1032
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,438
Phew.

1033
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:30,399
Then it's like...
Okay, round...

1034
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,236
So, you ready to get serious?

1035
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,700
Yeah!

1036
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:38,825
Ow!

1037
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,584
Thank you, mama.

1038
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:47,253
Yes, thank you,
Mrs. mfeke, so much.

1039
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,262
So, any last words
for the troops?

1040
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,336
Let's do this.

1041
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,350
Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats,

1042
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,693
turn off your cell phones,
and enjoy the show.

1043
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:05,769
Sit down.

1044
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:18,872
For never was a story
of more woe than this,

1045
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,289
of Juliet and her Romeo.

1046
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,998
Two young people from
different sides of the track,

1047
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,500
two lovers star-crossed.

1048
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:31,054
Now, Romeo, being a montague,
and Juliet, being a capulet,

1049
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,458
meant that their love
could never be accurate.

1050
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,344
Their families
were sworn enemies,

1051
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,344
so them being in love
would just add to it.

1052
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,764
The ongoing fights about
who's wrong and right,

1053
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,966
but after all these years, still,
two wrongs don't make a right.

1054
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,351
Sharing a love strong
enough to die and kill for,

1055
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,607
the kind of love that everyone
should try and live for.

1056
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:54,027
So, please, if you will,
open eyes, all attend,

1057
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,780
the show must begin, but
I'll be back before it ends.

1058
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,192
They gettin' into it already.

1059
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,489
Whoa!

1060
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:35,877
Ooh!

1061
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:29,389
Whoo!

1062
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,709
Go, Juliet! Mm!

1063
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,478
Whoo!

1064
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,188
That's what we came to see!

1065
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,226
Oh!

1066
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,361
Yeah, all right!
Whoo!

1067
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:22,804
Ooh!

1068
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,606
It's just a dance, baby.

1069
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:48,606
No, mama. It's so much more.

1070
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,083
Guys, can you believe this?

1071
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,253
Ifsinsane.

1072
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,575
Ishani, you okay, baby?

1073
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,586
You want me to get some
revenge on Romeo over there?

1074
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:45,918
Nah, it's cool.

1075
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:48,554
Hey, you okay?

1076
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:52,890
What's wrong? Nothing at all.
I'm fine.

1077
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,845
Guess I just can't believe that
this is all finally happening.

1078
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,064
I wish my mom
could've seen it.

1079
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:06,863
Um, you lovebirds need to save
all of this for the stage.

1080
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,730
The intermission is over.

1081
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:11,025
Okay, people!

1082
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:13,819
It's time to rock.

1083
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:15,066
Yes!

1084
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,367
Let's go!

1085
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,510
These violent delights
have violent ends,

1086
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:34,264
drawing swords,
spilling blood.

1087
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,143
Vicious brawls over grudges.

1088
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,680
Vengeance and
rage lead to death,

1089
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,603
leaving no room
for discussions.

1090
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,055
Banished for his actions,
Romeo has got to leave.

1091
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,857
Will they ever be together? We'll
just have to wait and see.

1092
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:53,945
Whoo!

1093
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:10,619
They want her
to marry that guy.

1094
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,463
It's not good.

1095
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:00,876
Did she really kill herself?

1096
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:02,256
Nah, she's just faking.

1097
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,680
But then she can't be...
Come on, show respect.

1098
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,760
Okay.

1099
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,237
Whoo!

1100
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:33,037
Things have come full circle
in the state of despair.

1101
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,375
Juliet holds the solution in
her hand and just stares.

1102
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,091
Slowly dancing
with the potion,

1103
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,761
yeah, she's going
through the motions.

1104
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:44,719
A selfless sacrifice, hoping
the gates of love will open.

1105
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:47,931
Ready to die for her love,
ready to rise up above.

1106
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,890
Putting an end to all the pain is
all she's hoping that it does.

1107
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:56,271
So, will Romeo oome save his
only love before her time's out?

1108
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,324
Will true love prevail?

1109
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,742
The time has come
for us to find out.

1110
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:08,157
Whoo-hoo!

1111
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,568
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

1112
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:35,059
You know, when nureyev danced this,
they clapped for 40 minutes.

1113
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,470
Ls that right? Mm-hmm.

1114
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:56,834
I don't even know what to say.

1115
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,202
Say you did it.
We all did it.

1116
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,459
Well, I imagine you
won't have much trouble

1117
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,831
selling tickets
from here on out.

1118
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:08,252
I hope not, but we
still don't have a space.

1119
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,972
Actually, I don't think
that will be a problem.

1120
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,603
How would you like to establish
a permanent dance center,

1121
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,219
here at the bijou?

1122
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,305
You're serious?

1123
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:22,482
The community
needs this place.

1124
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,850
That's great, but what
made you change your mind?

1125
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:29,647
Consider it
a charitable gesture.

1126
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,574
Yeah. Her company wants
to have the appearance

1127
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:33,664
of being good people.

1128
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:38,702
Well, whatever the reason,
thank you.

1129
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:40,786
Meleai uh...

1130
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,960
Except I'd like to ask
for a favor, please.

1131
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,421
Which is?

1132
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:50,376
I'd like to name it after my
mother and 'shani's brother.

1133
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,470
All right, yeah.

1134
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:53,969
- Done.
- Thank you.

1135
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,140
You're welcome.

1136
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:56,428
Yeah!

1137
01:31:58,388 --> 01:31:59,808
Are you okay?

1138
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:04,483
Thank you.

1139
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:11,112
Melea! 'Shani! Melea! 'Shani!
