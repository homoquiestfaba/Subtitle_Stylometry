1
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:13,621
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

2
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:18,658
Tell me everything is gonna be
okay.

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,832
It's gonna be okay.

4
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,637
Everything's gonna be okay.

5
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,108
(ominous music)

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,576
(gun fires)

7
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,995
(loud upbeat music)

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,735
Let's go over our game plan.

9
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:03,436
We gotta make sure he doesn't
sneak off

10
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,171
to the bathroom or anywhere else

11
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:08,709
until we're sure he has
absolutely no drugs, okay, Simon?

12
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:11,177
We've been through this, man.

13
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,655
I don't understand why
it always has to be me

14
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,882
taking care of Adam.

15
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,251
[Drew] I mean, you see him all
the time.

16
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:19,687
He can take care of himself.

17
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,156
Yeah, obviously not.

18
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:24,057
My mom said he got kicked outta
school.

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,925
[Simon] Isn't she well informed?

20
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,028
Yeah, well,

21
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:30,997
at least now we have our
opening.

22
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,639
Oh, no way! (Laughs)

23
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,671
Adam!

24
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,251
It's been a long time, buddy.

25
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,144
Who's fault is that?

26
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,713
Man, you should a stayed here and
gone

27
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:47,548
to Tri-C with me and Simon.

28
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,615
[Drew] Yeah?

29
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:49,691
Yeah, you're missing out.

30
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:50,650
Well, you can tell me all
about it

31
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,852
on our way to Terra stock.

32
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,254
And I'm so pumped.

33
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:55,822
Great music, beautiful women.

34
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:56,656
Absolutely.

35
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,625
But we should a hit the road
earlier.

36
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:01,128
Nani said it's gonna
be like 10-hour drive.

37
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:02,963
Nani's coming?

38
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:04,765
I told you that.

39
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,734
Thought you were joking.

40
00:02:07,768 --> 00:02:08,769
Hey, Adam.

41
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,638
(Drew laughs)

42
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,305
Come on, man.

43
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,306
Give me your bag.

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,610
Yeah, we're not
stopping for Indian food.

45
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:18,187
You know, she's not gonna
be too happy about this.

46
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,914
Happy about what?

47
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:23,917
I sort of invited Logan and
Erika.

48
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,318
What?

49
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:26,528
Well, they've never been to
Terra stock

50
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:28,298
and they didn't have plans,
so I figured what the hell.

51
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,657
Adam, come on, man.

52
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,858
Uninvite them.

53
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,093
Little too late now.

54
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,796
(music blares)

55
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:42,201
[Logan] Uh, Terra stock,
anybody?

56
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,571
Hi, Logan.

57
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:44,572
What's up, y'all?

58
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:47,106
Who's ready to get their
freak on with the arts?

59
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,107
What are we driving here?

60
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,619
[Drew] Well, I didn't
know you were coming.

61
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:51,312
[Logan] You could a emailed me.

62
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:52,645
Who's this?

63
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,980
Oh, Nani, this is Logan.

64
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:54,848
Logan, Nani.

65
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,182
Hi.

66
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,284
Hi.

67
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:57,918
Listen, you wouldn't
happen to have a Pomeranian

68
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,086
named Ali Baba, would you?

69
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:01,888
I was just checking.

70
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,132
I think I ran it over on the way
here.

71
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:03,991
I'm just kidding.

72
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:05,925
I'll be right back.

73
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,162
Erika, get outta your coma.

74
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,731
So apparently, Logan and
Erika are coming with us.

75
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:12,599
Yeah, I can see that.

76
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:13,634
There goes your plan.

77
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,867
Got the drugs!

78
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:15,769
He's joking, okay?

79
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,670
[Logan] No, I'm not.

80
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:20,808
No, listen, okay, this is
just a little speed bump, okay?

81
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,651
We'll make sure Logan and
Erika get their own room...

82
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:23,977
[Logan] Terra stock!

83
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,812
We can still talk to Adam
alone, okay?

84
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:26,680
You know the only reason

85
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:27,381
- I came on this trip...
- Terra stock!

86
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:28,247
Was so...

87
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:29,116
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
I know.

88
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:31,185
You're here to help me, okay,
but...

89
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,251
[Logan] Terra stock!

90
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,284
Quiet!

91
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,123
Everything's gonna be fine, all
right?

92
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,625
(Erika clears her throat)

93
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,125
[Logan] Terra stock!

94
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:39,993
[Drew] Quiet.

95
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:41,194
[Logan] Terra stock.

96
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:42,371
We're gonna have fun, okay?

97
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:43,830
[Logan] Hey, Nani!

98
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:46,265
[Erika] I call window.

99
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:47,299
Come on.

100
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,670
Do ya trust me?

101
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,706
Could you give me my purse?

102
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,209
It's just right there.

103
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,310
Drew.

104
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:57,677
[Logan] All in back, yo.

105
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,379
Let's go.

106
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,681
We're not all gonna (sighs).

107
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,216
This is so illegal.

108
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:05,019

(car jolts)

125
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:46,418
Ow.

126
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,462
[Nani] Where are we?

127
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,538
We weren't supposed to
get off the interstate

128
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:58,197
until Simon's shift.

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,233
It's fine.

130
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,834
Go straight past this bridge.

131
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:02,969
Hello?

132
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:04,237
Give me the map.

133
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,939
Hey, is this some kind of
shortcut?

134
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:06,639
I'm gonna go see a friend of
mine.

135
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,776
I have some stuff to pick up.

136
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:09,710
[Adam] Here?

137
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,880
[Logan] Right here on the
left, Adam.

138
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:24,490
[Adam] Wow, your friend
really likes his privacy.

139
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:25,324
Right?

140
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:28,262
And there's a lake right out
back.

141
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,798
(mellow music)

142
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,019
Stay here.

143
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,193
[Erika] Such a dick.

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,796
[Drew] Simon.

145
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,612
What's he picking up again?

146
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:19,445
[Simon] How should I know?

147
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:20,313
[Logan] Hey, Mondo!

148
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,114
Where are we?

149
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:24,185
Looks like the middle of
nowhere.

150
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,487
Who's this friend he's
picking stuff up from?

151
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,121
Mondo.

152
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:30,056
Mongo?

153
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,089
Mondo!

154
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:32,625
(knocks)

155
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:33,658
Mondo.

156
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:39,298
Mondo.

157
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,036
It's short for Armando, but he's
white.

158
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,205
You're fine.

159
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,510
Hey, Simon.

160
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,045
Check out these trucks.

161
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,913
I know.

162
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,014
Crazy, right?

163
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,618
That Jeep was working two months
ago.

164
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,586
Oh, yeah?

165
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:00,988
You been here before?

166
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,021
Few times.

167
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,533
Well?

168
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,234
He's not here.

169
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,535
Great.

170
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's get back out on the road.

171
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,342
I need my stuff.

172
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,120
[Drew] Logan, we can get
your stuff on the way back.

173
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:26,480
No, we need to get it
right now for this trip.

174
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:28,114
Let's just wait here a little
while.

175
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:29,383
- Logan...
- Drew...

176
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:33,086
If we wait any more,
Terrastock's gonna start without us.

177
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,055
Well, great, then we'll
just stay here tonight.

178
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,322
Adam, go get the bags.

179
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,024
(huffs) Wait, I thought you said

180
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,692
your friend wasn't even here.

181
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:39,625
Point taken.

182
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:40,293
Um, everybody raise your hand

183
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:43,062
if you're happy Nani's here.

184
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,173
Mondo happens to be a friend of
mine,

185
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:48,034
and friends let other
friends borrow their houses.

186
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,602
Logan, this is pretty weird,
okay?

187
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:50,570
Listen, we're gonna leave right
now,

188
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:53,240
and we'll make it to
the hotel by what, one?

189
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,141
Two in the morning, right?

190
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:54,942
Drew, shut up.

191
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,509
We're staying here for the
night.

192
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:57,586
We can leave first thing in the
morning,

193
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,455
and we'll have all day
tomorrow at the festival.

194
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,514
Okay, Nani?

195
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,615
Let's go.

196
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:02,716
You better have booze.

197
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,218
Lots of booze!

198
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,490
(mellow music)

199
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,625
No you remember, okay,
(laughs) remember that time

200
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:15,461
you got so stoned, and Simon
went

201
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,365
and creeped out by your window

202
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,399
and pretended to be Chupacabra...

203
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,436
[Adam] It's not fucking funny,
man.

204
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:24,604
You know I'm standing
(murmurs)...

205
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:26,572
I will suck you dry.

206
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,183
And he hides in the
closet for like two hours,

207
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:30,209
and he's like Chupacabras were
Spanish.

208
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:34,681
[Logan And Adam] Why
is he speaking English?

209
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,249
Chupacabras, man.

210
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,352
(clears throat) Attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

211
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:39,619
I have some excellent news.

212
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,485
[Adam] Here he is.

213
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,359
(inhales dramatically and pops
lips)

214
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,995
Well, Drew, come on, you're up
first.

215
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,464
Man, we did some crazy
shit back then, huh?

216
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:52,298
Yeah, no shit, man.

217
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,103
Drew, quit stalling.

218
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,570
You're up first to bat, come on.

219
00:09:57,604 --> 00:09:59,072
He doesn't want to.

220
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,507
I wasn't asking you.

221
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,708
But you are welcome to join us
as wlell.

222
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,544
I'm fine with beer.

223
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,653
Mondo, Mondo, Mondo.

224
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,357
Ew.

225
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,392
Oh my God.

226
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,161
Bite me, princess.

227
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,566
Oh, no don't leave.

228
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,434
Please.

229
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,268
Logan.

230
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:29,436
Come back.

231
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,739
[Drew] Simon, weren't you
gonna ask Logan something?

232
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,408
[Logan] Ask me what?

233
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,274
What?

234
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,243
Are you sure Mondo's okay with
this?

235
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:38,245
Yes.

236
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,081
I already told you guys,
I'm good for the money.

237
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:41,748
He knows that.

238
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,282
Let's have some fun.

239
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:44,518
It's on me.

240
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,719
[Drew] Adam.

241
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,562
I mean, for fuck's sake,
are you gonna take it or not?

242
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:48,654
Yeah, yeah.

243
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,227
I mean, normally, I only snort
with 20s,

244
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:54,927
but I guess (murmurs).

245
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,297
[Logan] Oh, you're so fancy.

246
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,233
(muffled music)

247
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:01,634
[Adam] Eh, do another?

248
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,336
Mondo, man.

249
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,670
Come on, man, is this a PSA?

250
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:06,105
[Drew] Fuck you.

251
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,442
(exhales) Mondo.

252
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:11,745
Feel like a better person?

253
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,779
Well?

254
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:17,883
Andrew!

255
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:23,056
Don't you have anything to say
to me?

256
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,727
Oh, wow, okay, now I get it.

257
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,163
Now I realize why you didn't
want me

258
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,566
to tag along on your
trip in the first place.

259
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,533
You just thought this was gonna
be

260
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,534
some big fun drug binge
weekend, didn't you?

261
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,303
(laughs) What?

262
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:39,105
Nani, no, that's not what this
is.

263
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,249
And that trip down memory lane

264
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:41,240
with you, Adam, and Simon?

265
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,309
Wow, that was enlightening
about how you guys

266
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,176
were stoned all the time.

267
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:44,978
Yeah, but you had to have been
there.

268
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,279
Chupacabra was like the
pinnacle...

269
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:48,682
Oh my God, stop!

270
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:53,586
Be honest with me, is this what
you want?

271
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,254
Because five minutes with them,

272
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,858
and I feel like you don't
even know that I exist.

273
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,368
Nani, you need to calm down,
all right?

274
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:01,294
Remember who you're talking to.

275
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,662
I'm here to help Adam.

276
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,132
Oh, ah, yeah, Adam, I forgot.

277
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:07,433
How's that working out for you,
Drew?

278
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:08,300
Mondo!

279
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,502
Mondo!

280
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:12,238
He'll be here, no, seriously.

281
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,105
I was lucky.

282
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,707
I had you in my life to help me
through

283
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,278
all the rough things, but Adam,

284
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:22,282
he doesn't have anyone like
that, okay?

285
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:23,817
Except for maybe me.

286
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,822
(soft music)

287
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,563
(sighs)

288
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:57,350
You shouldn't'a let Logan come
along.

289
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,184
(exhales)

290
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,052
He's just making everything
worse.

291
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:02,389
Yeah, well, Logan is a dick,
okay?

292
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:05,524
And once we get to Terra stock,

293
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:07,302
I'm sure Erika and him
will vanish into thin air

294
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:08,729
like vampire bats.

295
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,631
(chuckles)

296
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:16,702
And we'll be back with Simon
helping out Adam, okay?

297
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:19,271
Just forget about those two.

298
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,304
Okay.

299
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,309
Hey.

300
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,248
You think Mondo would mind if
we,

301
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,317
uh, borrow his bed for a couple
minutes?

302
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,620
Wow, really, a couple minutes?

303
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,355
That's all you got?

304
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,860
Mondo really is my hero.

305
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:45,566
I could spend the rest
of my life out here.

306
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,572
Adam, get me another beer.

307
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,544
What kind?

308
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:00,246
Surprise me.

309
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,423
Well, I mean, we got more lite
beer,

310
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:02,625
but there's that German stuff in
there,

311
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,616
that ale, it's, it's really
good.

312
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,788
Adam, just get me a
fucking beer. (Sighs)

313
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,655
I love him.

314
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:15,327
What if this guy doesn't come
back?

315
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,462
Mondo?

316
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,398
The guy's a fucking hermit.

317
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,600
He never walks farther than
it takes to get to the beach.

318
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,769
He'll be here.

319
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,456
I'm not going to Terra stock

320
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,691
and hanging out with some
punk rock teeny boppers

321
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,750
unless I'm on something.

322
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:40,419
How much are you getting?

323
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,452
Enough.

324
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:43,623
Enough for what?

325
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,292
Enough for two months' rent.

326
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,327
You're selling it?

327
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,529
Fuck yeah, I'm selling it, man.

328
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:54,466
Selling DMT at Terra stock
is like selling candy

329
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,568
at an orphanage.

330
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,304
Everybody wants it.

331
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,409
Try selling DMT at an orphanage.

332
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,442
Yeah.

333
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:07,680
(laugh)

334
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:09,015
What is this?

335
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,418
(ominous music)

336
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:13,586
What the fuck?

337
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,326
(screams)

338
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,359
What is it?

339
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:22,394
[Nani] No!

340
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,096
(screams)

341
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,764
[Drew] Fuck!

342
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,432
It's okay.

343
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,334
What are you guys doing in here?

344
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:28,735
In there.

345
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:32,072
(ominous music)

346
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,539
What the fuck?

347
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,639
It's Mondo.

348
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,077
[Adam] What?

349
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,944
It's Mondo.

350
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:39,778
It's Mondo.

351
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,647
[Adam] Oh, Fuck, Man.

352
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,515
Somebody killed Mondo.

353
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,384
Somebody killed Mondo.

354
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:51,624
Mondo is dead in the bathroom.

355
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:53,626
Yeah, Logan, we fuckin'
heard you, all right?

356
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:54,626
Well, how did this happen?

357
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:55,627
Like we fuckin' know.

358
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,662
Ya found him!

359
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:57,529
Yeah, we found him.

360
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:58,163
Like that.

361
00:15:58,197 --> 00:15:59,030
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

362
00:15:59,065 --> 00:15:59,966
let's just everybody think about
this,

363
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,403
just take a second, collect
yourselves.

364
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:05,572
Everybody shut the fuck up

365
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,448
and let's just think about
it (chuckles sarcastically),

366
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:08,140
ya know?

367
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:08,841
I'll go call the police.

368
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,143
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

369
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:10,810
Well, excuse me.

370
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,511
- Let them go!
- Okay, yes,

371
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:12,511
we are going to call the police,

372
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:15,048
but first let's get this
place cleaned up, okay?

373
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:17,149
What the fuck are you
talking about, Logan?

374
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:18,626
[Logan] Erika, Simon, you go
downstairs,

375
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,618
you get all the luggage and put
it back

376
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:20,920
in my car, go.

377
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,956
Adam, go get some trash bags.

378
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,890
Adam!

379
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,793
Go get some fucking trash bags!

380
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:27,870
Logan, I don't know what
fucking game

381
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,762
you're trying to play here,

382
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:29,596
but we need to call the cops
right now

383
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,764
before we destroy this crime
scene.

384
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,000
We're not the fucking
Hardy boys, okay, Drew?

385
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,076
And I'm not gonna go to jail

386
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,812
because you feel like
playing fucking detective!

387
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,138
Logan.

388
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,038
Fuck!

389
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:39,705
Logan!

390
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,142
God damn it, come on, Nani.

391
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,052
Do you have any idea what
this is going to look like?

392
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:46,522
I know exactly what
this is gonna look like,

393
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,148
which is why we have to clean
up.

394
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,524
No, we have to call the cops
right now.

395
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:51,617
I heard you, and I said not yet.

396
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,927
[Drew] Logan, this is
not your decision to make.

397
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:55,489
And yet somehow, I made it!

398
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,663
(phone crunches)

399
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,198
What the hell, Logan?

400
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,733
What are you doing?

401
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:08,877
I'll tell ya what I'm doing.

402
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:09,945
I'm dealing with your asshole
friend

403
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:10,937
that just broke the phone!

404
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,706
Would you grow the fuck up?

405
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:16,142
What exactly were you going
to tell the cops, anyway?

406
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,911
Yeah, we just broke into a
house,

407
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,778
got high as a kite, and then
happened

408
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,514
to find a dead body!

409
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,483
Good luck in prison.

410
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:25,018
I'll pay you a conjugal visit.

411
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,186
Now, if you wanna keep us out of
jail,

412
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,189
you will help us clean up.

413
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:30,221
Move!

414
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,233
Andrew.

415
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:44,971
You are not seriously
going along with this?

416
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,072
I'm gonna go get dressed.

417
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:52,812
Women.

418
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:53,845
Am I right?

419
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,129
(ominous music)

420
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,634
[Nani] Are you stealing from a
dead guy?

421
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:16,502
What, you think the world's full

422
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,671
of trust fund babies?

423
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,039
Yeah, you never had to
worry about that, did you?

424
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,885
People like you don't have
to worry about scrounging

425
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:25,812
through people's pockets for
valuables.

426
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,714
You know, I never had that
luxury.

427
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,215
Hey!

428
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,186
Oh, this is great.

429
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:36,523
The two of you can clean up this
room.

430
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:39,625
You know, if one of you's gonna
be naked,

431
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,862
I much prefer it to be her.

432
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,035
You're not even gonna say
anything.

433
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:49,902
[Drew] Listen, let's just
finish up

434
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:51,213
as quick as we can and get outta
here.

435
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,171
Ah, doesn't it even bother you

436
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,874
that he was threatening me?

437
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,242
Geez, Nani, what was
I supposed to say, huh?

438
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,853
We got a lot bigger
problems to worry about

439
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:01,548
other than the fact that
Logan is an asshole.

440
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,051
Things'll go a lot smoother
if we just work together.

441
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,153
Look, let's just leave.

442
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,021
That's what we're trying to do.

443
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,590
No, I mean now.

444
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,564
Fine.

445
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:21,067
But you can do this without me.

446
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,744
Don't strain yourself
too much helping out.

447
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:34,713
I think I can get the
stuff out of Mondo's safe.

448
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,649
It's probably locked.

449
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:40,353
Yes, thus fulfilling
its purpose as a safe.

450
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,921
I stole Mondo's keys.

451
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,690
One of 'em is bound to work.

452
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:45,692
And we can just take the stuff?

453
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,626
It's not like Mondo's gonna
miss it.

454
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,195
Might as well go to a good
cause.

455
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:50,228
Like me.

456
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:53,999
Okay.

457
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:58,971
So what's our plan?

458
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,845
Our plan is, as soon
as they come downstairs,

459
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:01,974
you keep them here.

460
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:06,645
I'll go upstairs, grab the
stuff, put it in our bags.

461
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,816
Hey, upstairs is all clean.

462
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:11,025
[Logan] Okay, are Aladdin
and Princess Jasmine

463
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,184
done yet?

464
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,353
I think so.

465
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:13,720
[Logan] Why don't you guys
head into the next room...

466
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,654
(banging)

467
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:16,990
What the fuck is that?

468
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,323
Should we, should we hide?

469
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,501
I'm pretty sure they saw us.

470
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:24,230
Stay here, clean the rest
of this shit up right now.

471
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:27,634
Hi, can I help you guys?

472
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,400
[Man] We were hiking in the
woods,

473
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,037
and my sister hurt her leg.

474
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,705
Whoa, that does not look good.

475
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:34,774
I tripped.

476
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,343
She fell, and, and hurt
her leg on some rocks.

477
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:40,312
Look, we've been walking around for hours,
and this is the first house we've found.

478
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,383
Of course, um, Erika,
don't just stand there.

479
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:46,918
Why don't you grab some
towels or something, huh?

480
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,154
(chuckles)

481
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:50,123
[Woman] Thank you very much.

482
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:51,323
No problem.

483
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,235
It wouldn't be very American
of us to turn you guys away.

484
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,926
I mean, what does the Bible say?

485
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,296
Give unto others.

486
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,266
So, can we come in, or?

487
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,167
Oh!

488
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,201
Yes, right.

489
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,905
The kitchen is right there if
you guys

490
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,242
just wanna have a seat.

491
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,110
We'll take a look at that leg,
okay?

492
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:11,978
Thank you.

493
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,078
No problem.

494
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:22,288
So, what'd you say your names
were?

495
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,123
I'm Brian.

496
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,290
Alison.

497
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:26,324
Logan.

498
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,326
I'm sorry.

499
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,830
Ah, this does not look good.

500
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,701
Wonder what happened to Erika.

501
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:40,239
Is there someplace I
can go to wash my leg off?

502
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,206
Oh, yeah.

503
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,442
Yeah, yeah, of course.

504
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:45,944
Um, the bathroom is straight
through here.

505
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:47,022
Let me check with Erika and see

506
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:49,882
if she's found any bandages for
you.

507
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:50,750
You should be able to
find everything you need

508
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:52,718
straight through there.

509
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,962
It's a nice place you got here.

510
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:54,987
(laughs) I wish.

511
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:55,820
It's a friend of mine's.

512
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:58,958
We're actually watching it right
now.

513
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,228
Let me know if I can get you
anything.

514
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,998
(ominous music)

515
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:08,800
[Erika] What the hell are you
doing?

516
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,970
I am trying to play this smart.

517
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,105
You saw that leg.

518
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:12,805
It's gonna look a little
suspicious

519
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,173
if we kick her out on her ass.

520
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,039
It's gonna look a lot more
suspicious

521
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:16,776
when they find a dead body
upstairs.

522
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:17,509
Exactly!

523
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,810
We are so fucked!

524
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:20,212
Sh!

525
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:21,922
If we can heal her and
get them out of here,

526
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:23,782
everything is going to be fine,
okay?

527
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,017
They've already seen us.

528
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,951
How's it gonna look when they
hear about a murder in here?

529
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:28,286
Would you try and keep a
positive mind?

530
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,531
Now, did you find anything we
can use

531
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,690
to bandage up her leg with?

532
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:34,961
No, I came in here to find
out what you wanted to do.

533
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,394
Un-fucking-believable.

534
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,199
(ominous music)

535
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,105
[Nani] What are you doing now?

536
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:49,908
Nothing, Nani, just stay
upstairs.

537
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:50,576
Drew.

538
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,810
What the hell's going on?

539
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:53,312
Here, come on.

540
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:54,413
Logan, Logan!

541
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:57,350
What the hell is happening?

542
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,851
Will you stop with the touching?

543
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,195
You let two random people
inside?

544
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,120
What?

545
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:01,988
What?

546
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,255
I have it under control.

547
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:04,222
Who are these people?

548
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,291
They're hikers.

549
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:06,325
So they claim.

550
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:09,060
One of them is injured,
and needs our help.

551
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:10,897
(groans)

552
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,597
[Adam] We're fucked.

553
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:12,498
[Erika] You already said that.

554
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:14,399
Don't you realize, once we
help them,

555
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,335
then we can get rid of them.

556
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,003
Whoa, get rid of them?

557
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:19,939
Not like that.

558
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:21,941
Get them to their car or
whatever.

559
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,017
You know, we really do not need
them

560
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,910
to find you tweaking out.

561
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,979
Why don't you go upstairs?

562
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:27,913
You serious?

563
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:30,148
Yes, there's a dead body in
the house.

564
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:31,258
We don't want them poking around

565
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:32,083
- and (words covered)...
- Come on,

566
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:32,984
Adam, just go upstairs, all
right?

567
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:33,586
Sh!

568
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:34,452
Go.

569
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:35,521
All right.

570
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,557
This is stupid, Logan.

571
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,863
Hey, good news.

572
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:44,529
Looks like we found some stuff

573
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,565
to bandage up your leg.

574
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:46,432
Oh.

575
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:49,167
Everybody this is Alison and
Brian.

576
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,036
Hello!

577
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:50,903
[Drew] Hello!

578
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:51,570
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi.

579
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,438
Welcome.

580
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:53,105
Why don't you have a seat on the
couch?

581
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,216
Her leg looks pretty bad.

582
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,474
I can imagine.

583
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,413
(exhales)

584
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,248
Why don't you put your leg right
here?

585
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,082
All right, ready?

586
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,051
- Here you go.
- Easy, easy, easy.

587
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,254
(gasps) Good night!

588
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:09,521
Yeah.

589
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,489
You guys were hiking?

590
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,490
Yeah, actually.

591
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,362
(soft exclamation) Did
you run into a critter

592
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,460
or something?

593
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:17,529
Uh, she fell and, uh,
hit her legs on some rocks.

594
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:20,199
(hisses) That's jacked.

595
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:22,234
Think you guys can
make it back to your car?

596
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,937
Oh, we've been hiking for miles.

597
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,247
It would take hours to get back.

598
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,415
She probably wouldn't make it.

599
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,307
Well, you can't stay here.

600
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,942
[Drew] Logan?

601
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,810
I mean, think about it, these
bandages

602
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:33,154
are gonna hold up for now, but
you guys

603
00:24:33,178 --> 00:24:34,981
really need to see a doctor.

604
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,024
Maybe we can drive you to your
car

605
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,250
or the nearest hospital.

606
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:39,384
[Erika] I'll bring the car
around.

607
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,218
Great.

608
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,520
Simon, why don't you come with
me?

609
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:43,489
Sure.

610
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:44,322
Thank you very much.

611
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,391
No problem.

612
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,357
I mean, I would suggest
we call an ambulance,

613
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,894
but we don't really
have a phone right now.

614
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:51,530
(laughs) Yeah, our
friend's kinda stupid.

615
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,531
Bit of a scatterbrain.

616
00:24:52,564 --> 00:24:54,042
He forgets to pay the
phone bills sometimes.

617
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:57,670
Yeah, we could totally use a
phone.

618
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:00,105
Well, why don't we get
you guys to the car port?

619
00:25:00,138 --> 00:25:01,039
All right.

620
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,350
It's gonna be straight
out the back door.

621
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:03,241
Here we go, kiddo.

622
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,110
Got it?

623
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:04,977
I'm right behind here

624
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:05,644
Thanks.

625
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:06,880
Of course.

626
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,950
Hey!

627
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:13,619
What's up?

628
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:14,286
Thought you guys were
bringing the car around.

629
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,655
Yeah, the car won't start.

630
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:20,635
What do you mean, the car
won't start?

631
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:21,494
(ominous music)

632
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:22,361
Let me see.

633
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:24,263
[Erika] Be my guest.

634
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:28,600
(sighs)

635
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,337
(Erika murmurs)

636
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:33,940
Do me a favor?

637
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:35,040
Pop the hood.

638
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:43,048
Hey, hey, Logan, what
are you doing to my truck?

639
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:45,051
[Logan] Your truck won't start.

640
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,152
[Drew] What?

641
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:50,255
[Logan] I said your
Classic here will not start.

642
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,392
Erika, can I get in here,
please?

643
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:55,360
Sorry about that, guys.

644
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,563
You think you can fix it?

645
00:25:57,596 --> 00:26:00,031
I used to watch those
NASCAR pit teams on TV.

646
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,232
It's beautiful.

647
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,970
It's like a redneck (murmurs).

648
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:05,412
Yeah, well, I watch a lotta
football,

649
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:06,104
but that doesn't mean I'm Troy
Aikman.

650
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:06,804
[Drew] It was working before.

651
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:07,881
You know anything about cars?

652
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:08,874
I know that asking a
bunch of stupid questions

653
00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:11,476
is not gonna get the car
fixed, all right, bud?

654
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,177
Hey, guys?

655
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,254
[Simon] Did it make a sound?

656
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:14,113
I actually, uh, used
to work at the dealership

657
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:16,281
if you don't mind me taking a
look?

658
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:17,750
Oh, great, man, no problem.

659
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:18,616
You probably know what I'm doing

660
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,451
a lot more than you do.

661
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:20,385
You, yeah.

662
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:21,419
I got it.

663
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:23,756
Hey, what are you thinking
bringing

664
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:25,490
a lemon on a road trip?

665
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:28,360
Listen, it was working fine
before we got here, okay?

666
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,071
Before we came to visit
your stupid friend.

667
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,597
Oh, yeah, it was probably
Mondo's ghost.

668
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:35,101
Is that what you were thinking?

669
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:35,801
[Brian] You know, guys,
I really don't know.

670
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:37,635
I mean, it could be anything.

671
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:38,704
I just can't see.

672
00:26:38,737 --> 00:26:40,272
It's so frickin' dark out here.

673
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,273
Oh, we should get a flashlight.

674
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:43,109
Okay, listen, listen,
one of us can go walk

675
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:45,378
to the nearest house and ask for
help.

676
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:46,612
You wanna get murdered?

677
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:48,780
(chuckles) That's not funny,
Logan.

678
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:49,715
Hey, why don't we let
Alison and her brother

679
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:51,317
stay here tonight, and then
we'll worry

680
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:52,284
about the car in the morning?

681
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,118
No, I have not checked that
with Mondo...

682
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:53,818
- Yeah, and...
- We need to make...

683
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:54,996
And if he can't fix the car,

684
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,797
then we'll just walk down
the road and get some help.

685
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,899
Look, your leg is badly injured,

686
00:26:57,923 --> 00:26:59,533
and I don't feel comfortable
leaving you here tonight

687
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:00,792
without seeing a doctor, okay?

688
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:04,163
Well, if you can get her to
a doctor, then go right ahead.

689
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:07,000
I don't think we have a choice.

690
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,201
Sleep well.

691
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,135
Hope that feels better.

692
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:11,170
Thank you.

693
00:27:13,238 --> 00:27:15,408
Man, are you really gonna
let them spend the night?

694
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:16,542
What was that?

695
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,085
You were the one who let
'em in in the first place.

696
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:19,244
You're a fuckin' idiot.

697
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:20,112
[Simon] Hey, man...

698
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:20,812
Do not get me started on you
either.

699
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:21,814
Okay, I still don't understand

700
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:23,615
why we just didn't take
them to the hospital.

701
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:24,750
My truck wouldn't start.

702
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,519
The truck wouldn't start!

703
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,753
Now does anyone else find
that a little suspicious?

704
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:31,190
That two hikers come
bounding out of the woods,

705
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:32,399
we are nice enough to give them
some help,

706
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:35,193
and miraculously, the car won't
start?

707
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:37,430
Yeah, I'm sure that after
they cut open her leg,

708
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,097
they stopped to disable our car

709
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:40,374
so we couldn't take them to the
hospital.

710
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:41,599
That makes perfect sense.

711
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:43,311
If I was a serial killer,
I'd think it was a great idea.

712
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:44,537
We are so fucked.

713
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:45,746
We didn't have another option.

714
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,074
We had plenty of options
until somebody broke the phone.

715
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:50,475
It's not like calling the
cops was gonna do anything.

716
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,278
Yeah, but we could've
called the ambulance.

717
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,346
Yeah.

718
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:54,112
They would a gotten them
out here forever ago.

719
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:55,145
Okay.

720
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,183
This is what we're going to do.

721
00:27:58,217 --> 00:27:59,393
We will stay up, and we will
make sure

722
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,819
they don't do anything.

723
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,229
(scoffs) So wait, we're
gonna stay up all night

724
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,154
and just watch them?

725
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:05,458
We're gonna do it in shifts,
you idiot.

726
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,660
Me and Erika will take
the first watch, okay?

727
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:08,527
I'm not tired.

728
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,394
I'll stay up, too.

729
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:10,363
Yeah, I will, too.

730
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:11,805
I think you should get some
sleep, Adam.

731
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,499
Yeah, Adam, come on, get some
rest.

732
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,166
Here, you can do second shift
with me.

733
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,034
Yeah, I'm gonna sleep real easy

734
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,836
knowing these three are keeping
watch.

735
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,270
No way, I am staying awake.

736
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,681
I'm not staying up if she's
staying up.

737
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:21,673
Well, she's not staying up.

738
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:23,318
I'm not staying up if
Simon's not staying up.

739
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:24,143
Simon...

740
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:24,777
Wait, why doesn't Drew stay up?

741
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:25,644
Well, Drew can't stay up

742
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:25,945
- if I'm not staying up...
- Adam, I can't

743
00:28:25,978 --> 00:28:27,413
stay up.

744
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:28,113
He's staying up.

745
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:29,157
[Erika] I'm not staying up.

746
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:29,981
Oh my fucking God.

747
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:31,126
Me, Erika, and Simon will stay
up.

748
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,085
Drew, you put a muzzle on her,

749
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,761
or I swear to God I will
find some duct tape.

750
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:34,620
Calm down.

751
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:35,320
Calm down?

752
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:36,154
Am I the only one who remembers

753
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:37,723
there's still a dead body up
there

754
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:39,758
and two complete
strangers across the hall.

755
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,259
Nani, stop.

756
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,428
Okay, we're all really
tired and stressed out,

757
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:45,364
and there are two people
who we don't even know

758
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:46,331
staying here, okay?

759
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:48,134
Take two of those.

760
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:54,140
Hey...

761
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,316
[Drew] They're just
sleeping pills, Adam.

762
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,284
What you think, I'm gonna
give her my Scooby snacks?

763
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:58,277
[Nani] No, thank you.

764
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,644
It's gonna be a long night.

765
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:00,746
Whatever.

766
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,314
Take 'em if you want.

767
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:05,585
But we need to get some rest
either way.

768
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:09,429
Now why don't you
guys go get some sleep?

769
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:12,290
We'll wake you up in a few
hours.

770
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:13,324
Go on.

771
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,170
(strums guitar)

772
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:35,780
Does Drew have a problem with
me?

773
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:37,816
How should I know?

774
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:39,551
You're his friend.

775
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:42,455
Drew hates me.

776
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,894
Do not roll your eyes at me.

777
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:53,532
You think that's what I need
right now?

778
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,271
Hey, where're you going?

779
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:02,340
I'm gonna go take a piss.

780
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,879
May I take a piss, Logan?

781
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:07,912
Sure.

782
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,781
Thank you.

783
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:31,568
What?

784
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:34,606
Come here.

785
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:36,574
No.

786
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,711
Why not?

787
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:40,478
Stop it, Logan.

788
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:41,913
I'm not fucking around with you,

789
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:42,747
stop it.

790
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,882
I said get off!

791
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:44,782
- Get the fuck off me.
- What the fuck

792
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:45,784
is your problem?

793
00:30:45,817 --> 00:30:46,551
[Erika] I'm not
fucking around right now!

794
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:47,419
(slap)

795
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:50,455
(angry exclamation)

796
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:07,472
(soft eerie music)

797
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,388
Erika.

798
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:45,844
(keys rattle)

799
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:19,077
They're less annoying
when they're asleep, huh?

800
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:22,514
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

801
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,048
It's been a rough night.

802
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,718
Not just tonight.

803
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:40,965
I can do better than him, can't
I?

804
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,404
Erika.

805
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:52,778
(dramatic music)

806
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:05,023
Nice, Mondo.

807
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:35,987
(mosquito buzzes)

808
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:17,730
(dramatic music)

809
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,737
(metal clangs)

810
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:31,143
(dramatic music)

811
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:39,485
(muffled voices)

812
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:44,822
Adam.

813
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,559
Adam!

814
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:52,195
What?

815
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,565
You don't hear that?

816
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:55,601
Hear what?

817
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:58,838
[Erika] Help me!

818
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:00,806
It's Erika.

819
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:05,176
(eerie music)

820
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,780
[Erika] Help!

821
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,282
Oh my God!

822
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,218
(sobs)

823
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Logan!

824
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:18,588
Oh my God!

825
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:21,092
What happened?

826
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,561
We don't know.

827
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:24,929
Somebody attacked him, man.

828
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:25,964
Well, what do we do?

829
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,266
What are we supposed to do, man?

830
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,134
Help me!

831
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,235
What are you doing?

832
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:31,737
He's dying.

833
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:34,105
What do you mean, someone
attacked him?

834
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,579
What the fuck happened to him,
Simon?

835
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:36,608
I don't know, man!

836
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:37,275
[Adam] Logan.

837
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,176
[Erika] Oh my God, he's...

838
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,143
I just found him here.

839
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:40,144
I don't think he did
this to himself, do you?

840
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:43,114
[Erika] (sobs) Oh my
God, he's fucking dying.

841
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:43,782
He's not moving.

842
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:45,016
Oh, he is fucking dead, man.

843
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,952
Oh, we are so fucked.

844
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:47,786
Adam, look at me.

845
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:48,487
[Adam] What are we supposed to
do...

846
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,188
Look at me, Adam, look at me!

847
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,056
Is there a phone in that house?

848
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:51,923
[Adam] What?

849
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:52,958
What?

850
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:53,826
[Drew] Is there another
phone in that house?

851
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:54,259
You've been here before, just
think...

852
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:54,693
[Adam] Yeah.

853
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:56,060
[Drew] Yeah?

854
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:56,929
[Adam] Uh...

855
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:58,030
[Drew] No?

856
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:00,032
[Adam] No!

857
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:00,898
(Erika sobs)

858
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:02,033
[Drew] Think.

859
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:02,900
No, no!

860
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:03,402
Just, just the one that Logan
snapped.

861
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,237
He's right, man.

862
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,672
(Erika sobs)

863
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:09,141
(eerie music)

864
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,612
Where are the hikers?

865
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:20,351
(Erika sobs)

866
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:21,687
Adam!

867
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,321
[Simon] Let him go, man!

868
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:23,989
What?

869
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:25,990
Weren't you just in there?

870
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:26,857
Yeah, but...

871
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:27,992
Did you see them inside?

872
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:28,826
No, but they could've slipped...

873
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,070
If those people are responsible

874
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,196
for this, they're long gone.

875
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,867
(eerie music)

876
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,673
(thumping)

877
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,578
(Erika sobs)

878
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,650
Okay...

879
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,356
We can't leave him like this,
okay?

880
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:03,827
Come on.

881
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,168
Get his legs.

882
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:12,670
Come on, Simon!

883
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:16,373
Fuck.

884
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:22,313
(eerie music)

885
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,751
[Simon] Don't, fuck me.

886
00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:28,653
Ah, it's getting all over me.

887
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,755
Jesus Christ, his head's on me,
man.

888
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,958
(Simon grunts)

889
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,193
Oh fuck, Simon.

890
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,128
Oh, God.

891
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:44,168
Jesus!

892
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,678
Well, shouldn't we cover him up?

893
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:55,146
What?

894
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,348
You know, cover his face.

895
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,254
Use your shirt.

896
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:07,224
What the fuck are you talking
about?

897
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:10,027
You're the one who wants
to cover him up, man.

898
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,698
(Drew mutters)

899
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:16,065
Oh, God.

900
00:38:18,168 --> 00:38:20,304
(muffled shout)

901
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:22,408
What the hell was that?

902
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:24,852
[Erika] It's the hikers.

903
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:26,078
Adam's with 'em.

904
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,744
[Simon] They're still here?

905
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:27,579
Oh my God, Adam has a gun.

906
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,789
[Drew] Adam should not have a
gun!

907
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:29,646
[Simon] Okay, what...

908
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,849
I found these sick fucks
rummaging

909
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,117
through Mondo's closet.

910
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,351
Listen, Adam, where's Nani?

911
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:35,754
Turn the fuck around.

912
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:36,387
Look!

913
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,355
Look, that is my friend.

914
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:38,989
Look what you did to him!

915
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,501
I don't know what you're
fucking talking about!

916
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:43,228
Adam, where did you get that
gun?

917
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,929
The voodoo man.

918
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,004
[Brian] Oh, that sounds good.

919
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:46,063
What?

920
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:46,932
Will someone please get
this crazy motherfucker

921
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:47,865
away from us?

922
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:48,866
Everybody shut up!

923
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,102
Okay, Adam, relax.

924
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,037
We're gonna let the police
handle this.

925
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,205
We're gonna call the police.

926
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:54,071
What police, Drew?

927
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:55,340
There are no fucking cops!

928
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,409
Okay, listen, we're
gonna get some, okay?

929
00:38:57,442 --> 00:39:00,211
We don't have a phone!

930
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:01,322
Listen, 'member the,
the convenience store?

931
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:03,124
There's a convenience store
two miles up the road.

932
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:04,850
I'm gonna walk there right now,
okay?

933
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,851
It's closed by now, man.

934
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,454
Okay, listen, Adam.

935
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:13,257
I'm gonna stay here.

936
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,934
I'm gonna stay here all
fuckin' night, all right?

937
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,862
They're not gonna go anywhere,
all right?

938
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:20,132
[Alison] Please don't let him
kill us.

939
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:21,266
You killed Logan!

940
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:21,967
[Drew] We don't know that!

941
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,110
And they fucking killed Mondo,

942
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:25,302
and they're just waiting
around to kill us, too, Drew.

943
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:27,004
Drew, look!

944
00:39:27,038 --> 00:39:28,106
That is Logan!

945
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,039
That is our friend!

946
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:30,509
God damn it, Adam!

947
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:32,477
Fuckin' touch me, man.

948
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,046
Fuckin' touch me.

949
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:37,215
I'm your friend.

950
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,150
I don't want you to do something

951
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:40,494
that you're gonna regret for the
rest

952
00:39:40,518 --> 00:39:42,186
of your life, okay?

953
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,023
Just put down the gun.

954
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,358
Please.

955
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,426
(eerie music)

956
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,537
We need to get outta here, Drew.

957
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:51,561
I know.

958
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:53,431
We're gonna get outta here.

959
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:54,463
Just...

960
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,835
Put down the gun.

961
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:03,909
(sighs)

962
00:40:05,976 --> 00:40:06,976
Nani.

963
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:11,614
Shit!

964
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,100
(soft music)

965
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:38,844
(pants)

966
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:50,889
(pant)

967
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:01,166
Was that Logan?

968
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:04,368
(Drew pants)

969
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:06,302
Is he dead?

970
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,278
What happened?

971
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:16,914
We don't know.

972
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:19,116
Is that why Adam was pointing
a gun

973
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,186
at those people, because he
doesn't know?

974
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,120
We think it was the hikers.

975
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:24,332
Adam was pointing a gun at
them, Drew.

976
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,259
Yeah, I know, he lost his
head, but it has to be them.

977
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,994
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

978
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:30,394
Oh my God, you keep saying that.

979
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:32,963
Everything is just gonna get
worse.

980
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:36,333
No, no, no, it's not
gonna get worse, okay?

981
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:39,037
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

982
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,605
Let's just go, okay?

983
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:43,641
Let's just, let's just get
up and start walking, okay?

984
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,243
And someone'll find us.

985
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:46,076
It's gonna be okay.

986
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,778
No, you are not listening to me.

987
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,213
We don't have to be here, Drew.

988
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,648
Let's just leave, okay?

989
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:52,483
Or, or, or let's just stay
here until morning, okay?

990
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:55,319
I just don't wanna go back.

991
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:58,490
(soft dramatic music)

992
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:02,126
I can't leave Adam behind.

993
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,230
He was pointing a gun at you,
Drew.

994
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:08,033
Please.

995
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,065
I know.

996
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:12,537
He's just scared.

997
00:42:15,505 --> 00:42:17,408
He's just scared, Nani.

998
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:30,555
Tell me everything is gonna be
okay.

999
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:37,528
(gun fires)

1000
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:42,199
(Alison screams)

1001
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,171
(Alison yells)

1002
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:47,205
What the fuck?

1003
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:49,942
(ominous music)

1004
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:51,509
(Alison sobs)

1005
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,045
What the fuck, Adam?

1006
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,213
What happened?

1007
00:42:56,313 --> 00:42:58,082
Everything was fine.

1008
00:42:59,083 --> 00:42:59,718
What the fuck, Simon?

1009
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:00,419
I left you in charge!

1010
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,461
What do you want from me, man?

1011
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:02,420
He had a gun.

1012
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,522
He wanted to tie 'em
up, so we did the girl,

1013
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:06,090
and then this guy started
arguing,

1014
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:07,058
so he fuckin' shot him.

1015
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:08,235
[Drew] Why, why, why
did you tie them up?

1016
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:09,027
Ask Adam.

1017
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,027
Okay, why were you doing
anything

1018
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:11,196
that Adam had to say?

1019
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:12,740
Because Adam was high as
shit with a gun in his hand.

1020
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:14,164
Look who's talking.

1021
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,132
Fuck you.

1022
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,744
Can I just point out
that there is a girl

1023
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:19,003
tied up in our shed right now,

1024
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:20,347
and this guy is gonna bleed to
death

1025
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:23,208
unless we do something right
now.

1026
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,288
So let him die.

1027
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:39,356
He killed Logan.

1028
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:40,257
I didn't kill him.

1029
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,359
Bullshit!

1030
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:41,925
You killed my boyfriend,
now we're gonna let you die,

1031
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,028
you sick son of a bitch.

1032
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:43,695
Erika, stop.

1033
00:43:43,728 --> 00:43:45,096
[Brian] Fuck you!

1034
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:46,331
You don't care?

1035
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:47,364
Fine.

1036
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:49,742
Guess you don't care
about your sister either.

1037
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:50,734
[Brian] She didn't do anything
to you.

1038
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:51,436
Just let her go.

1039
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:52,135
Why, so she can go to the cops

1040
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,438
and pin this whole thing on us?

1041
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,271
Enough, okay?

1042
00:43:54,304 --> 00:43:55,572
We need a plan.

1043
00:43:55,606 --> 00:43:56,541
Let's go through our options.

1044
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:57,242
Options?

1045
00:43:57,275 --> 00:43:59,443
Yeah, how the phone is broken,

1046
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:02,579
how the car won't start, how
there's a dead body upstairs.

1047
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,315
(chuckles sarcastically)

1048
00:44:04,347 --> 00:44:05,215
Hey, thanks, Simon,
a lotta good options.

1049
00:44:05,248 --> 00:44:06,248
Adam?

1050
00:44:07,351 --> 00:44:10,155
Do you have anything to
contribute?

1051
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:13,157
Do you want this on your
conscience?

1052
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,492
He's gonna die!

1053
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,228
There's nothing I can do about
that.

1054
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:19,331
He's right.

1055
00:44:20,197 --> 00:44:21,199
Look at him.

1056
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:27,305
I can fix it.

1057
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:28,673
The car.

1058
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,749
So you couldn't do anything
about it

1059
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:30,273
when you were fine, but
now that you've been shot,

1060
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:31,809
you can fix the car?

1061
00:44:31,842 --> 00:44:33,545
Obviously I can't move on my
own,

1062
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:36,280
but with some help, I
can give another look.

1063
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:37,481
Isn't that just convenient?

1064
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:42,386
Okay, listen, a bad plan's
better than no plan at all.

1065
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:47,759
[Brian] Uh, check the, uh,
spark plugs.

1066
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,326
Okay.

1067
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,128
Uh, where are those?

1068
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,365
They should be the sixth,

1069
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:58,469
no, it's on the top of the
engine block.

1070
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:00,505
Which one's the engine block?

1071
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:02,539
It's the giant metal block

1072
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,641
that looks like a middle finger.

1073
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:06,678
Make sure there's no dirty
connection.

1074
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,646
It needs to be cleaned.

1075
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:12,349
Okay, how do I do that?

1076
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:17,389
(sighs)

1077
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:23,494
I guess we should a paid
attention in auto shop, huh?

1078
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:28,699
(eerie music)

1079
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,314
Brought you some water.

1080
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:45,182
Where's Brian?

1081
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:46,317
He's in the house.

1082
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:47,719
I wanna see him.

1083
00:45:49,353 --> 00:45:50,188
I can't.

1084
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:50,889
I can't.

1085
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:51,922
Why?

1086
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:55,827
We killed Mondo!

1087
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,463
(dramatic music)

1088
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:02,766
The guy who was here, the guy
you found in the bathroom?

1089
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,303
Brian killed him, but he didn't
mean to.

1090
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:06,445
Why are you telling me this?

1091
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:07,571
Because you need to know.

1092
00:46:07,605 --> 00:46:08,472
'Cause I don't wanna know.

1093
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:09,339
I wanna get home.

1094
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:10,541
Stop!

1095
00:46:10,574 --> 00:46:14,345
I'm telling you this because
we didn't kill your friend.

1096
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:15,413
You're lying.

1097
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:16,748
Why would I lie about this now?

1098
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,918
Because you're tied up,
because you wanna get outta here.

1099
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:21,719
I know, but,

1100
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:22,963
but just hear me out before you
decide

1101
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:24,956
whether to believe me or not.

1102
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,492
You owe me that for what
your friend did to Brian.

1103
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:28,860
He is not my...

1104
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Fine.

1105
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:34,865
I'm listening.

1106
00:46:34,898 --> 00:46:38,435
Me and Brian, we broke
in here to rob Mondo.

1107
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,713
We bought drugs from him before,

1108
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:41,439
been here to pick it up, and
knew

1109
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:43,942
he kept it all in a safe in his
room.

1110
00:46:43,974 --> 00:46:46,310
We thought we'd just get it
outta there,

1111
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:47,653
take it back, and have plenty of
time

1112
00:46:47,677 --> 00:46:49,614
to bust it open, but...

1113
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:52,992
We were still trying to get
it loose from the closet

1114
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:55,719
when Mondo came back and saw us.

1115
00:46:57,722 --> 00:47:01,259
He pulled a knife, and Brian
just fought.

1116
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:04,929
It was self-defense, you know?

1117
00:47:05,797 --> 00:47:07,798
But before we could even
think about what to do,

1118
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,268
we heard your car pull
up, so we got outta there.

1119
00:47:11,302 --> 00:47:13,838
Well, then, why didn't
you just wait until we left?

1120
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:15,273
Why did you come in?

1121
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:16,574
Well, that was the plan.

1122
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:17,684
We didn't know you guys were
gonna decide

1123
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,344
to fuckin' move in.

1124
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:25,516
Look, you saw what Mondo
did to my leg, right?

1125
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:26,951
We thought that...

1126
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:29,620
You could get us to a hospital,

1127
00:47:29,653 --> 00:47:33,992
or at least call an
ambulance, or something?

1128
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:36,561
You wanted us to take you to a
hospital?

1129
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:40,264
Well, why did you disable the
car?

1130
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:42,500
We didn't touch your car.

1131
00:47:44,335 --> 00:47:46,304
Did you hear anything I just
said?

1132
00:47:46,336 --> 00:47:47,405
I needed a doctor.

1133
00:47:47,438 --> 00:47:48,438
I still do.

1134
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,517
Do you think that if we knew
what was wrong with your car

1135
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:54,612
that we wouldn't tell you
when Brian's been shot?

1136
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:56,980
What happened to Logan?

1137
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:59,983
I don't know, and that's the
truth.

1138
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:01,994
But you weren't in your
room when they found him.

1139
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:03,062
We though that you were all
asleep,

1140
00:48:03,086 --> 00:48:06,824
so we went back to finish
the job with the safe.

1141
00:48:06,856 --> 00:48:08,968
We didn't know you were gonna
start killing each other.

1142
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:11,528
(ominous music)

1143
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:12,972
Look, you wanna believe me or
not, fine,

1144
00:48:12,996 --> 00:48:14,407
but we didn't kill that guy
right there,

1145
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:17,434
which means one o' your friends
did!

1146
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:27,411
Least I know where I stand.

1147
00:48:36,753 --> 00:48:38,822
(grunts)

1148
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:42,057
Shit!

1149
00:48:43,126 --> 00:48:44,862
I can't fix it, man.

1150
00:48:47,364 --> 00:48:48,532
Fuck!

1151
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:51,502
(soft eerie music)

1152
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:56,474
Drew, I need to talk to you.

1153
00:48:58,943 --> 00:48:59,944
(gasps) Can it wait?

1154
00:48:59,976 --> 00:49:01,645
It's important.

1155
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,449
(grunts) Okay.

1156
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:11,423
You wanna give this thing a
shot, Simon?

1157
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:17,795
Okay, I talked to Alison.

1158
00:49:17,827 --> 00:49:18,862
Okay.

1159
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:21,399
And she told me that she
and Brian killed Mondo.

1160
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:23,033
[Drew] No surprise there.

1161
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:27,003
She also told me they didn't
kill Logan.

1162
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:28,906
Well, who did, then?

1163
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:31,608
I don't know.

1164
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,983
Nani, listen, you gotta
understand,

1165
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:44,021
she's going to say whatever she
thinks you wanna hear, okay?

1166
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:48,135
Okay, well, I'm gonna
talk to Brian at least,

1167
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,628
so I can see if their stories
match up.

1168
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:55,065
Okay, I'll keep working on the
truck.

1169
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,702
(murmurs wordlessly)

1170
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:01,438
(ominous music)

1171
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:06,775
Simon!

1172
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:12,949
Is he dead?

1173
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:16,186
Simon!

1174
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:19,021
Simon!

1175
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:24,061
Brian's dead.

1176
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:27,398
(soft dramatic music)

1177
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:32,403
Adam needed you, and you weren't
there.

1178
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:35,472
And this happened.

1179
00:50:36,907 --> 00:50:37,907
Me?

1180
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:40,778
What about you?

1181
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:43,814
What about me?

1182
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,622
What do you want me to say, man?

1183
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,831
(door slams)

1184
00:51:00,731 --> 00:51:01,666
Where are you going?

1185
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:02,699
Upstairs.

1186
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,140
[Drew] Where's Adam?

1187
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:13,510
(sighs)

1188
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:14,543
Drew, I.

1189
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:33,565
(sighs)

1190
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:37,168
[Drews] Adam?

1191
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:39,803
(chuckles)

1192
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:40,836
Oh, shit!

1193
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:43,139
Ah, shit.

1194
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:45,108
How many did you take?

1195
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:47,511
(chuckles) One or two.

1196
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:48,179
Bullshit.

1197
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:49,614
How many, Adam?

1198
00:51:50,947 --> 00:51:52,750
Four or five.

1199
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:54,251
Four and five, nine, Adam?

1200
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:55,118
How many?

1201
00:51:55,152 --> 00:51:56,653
Three beers.

1202
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:58,121
Four beers.

1203
00:51:58,155 --> 00:52:00,658
Fuck my ass, Adam, come on.

1204
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,527
No thanks, Drew.

1205
00:52:04,661 --> 00:52:06,730
Gonna take four or five more for
that.

1206
00:52:06,764 --> 00:52:08,833
(laughs)

1207
00:52:32,922 --> 00:52:33,922
What?

1208
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:39,730
(sighs) Can I talk to you?

1209
00:52:39,762 --> 00:52:40,941
Why the fuck are you whispering?

1210
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:41,999
[Nani] Sh.

1211
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,601
Can we go outside?

1212
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:46,235
Why?

1213
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:48,048
I feel like they can hear us
in here.

1214
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:50,106
Just come outside with me.

1215
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,308
It's important.

1216
00:53:04,621 --> 00:53:05,631
There's something wrong with
Simon.

1217
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:06,289
What are you talking about?

1218
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:07,157
He's acting funny.

1219
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,024
As opposed to what?

1220
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,057
You?

1221
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,263
I think Simon killed Logan.

1222
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:17,835
(soft dramatic music)

1223
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:30,914
What makes you think that?

1224
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:33,817
Well, I talked to Alison, and
she said

1225
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:35,260
that they killed Mondo,
but they had nothing

1226
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:37,253
to do with Logan.

1227
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:39,222
Wait, the tied-up junkie said

1228
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:42,125
that she didn't kill my
boyfriend?

1229
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,361
I'm shocked, Nani.

1230
00:53:43,393 --> 00:53:44,961
Yeah, she did.

1231
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:46,364
And I believe her.

1232
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:49,199
Simon let Brian die.

1233
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,268
What do you mean?

1234
00:53:52,302 --> 00:53:54,639
When we were walking back,
he was standing over him,

1235
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:57,273
and oh my God, that look he gave
me,

1236
00:53:57,306 --> 00:53:59,976
I am never gonna be able to
get it out of my head, okay?

1237
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,979
There's just something
not right about him.

1238
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:04,148
And who else could've killed,
Logan, huh?

1239
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:05,682
It wasn't me or Drew, it wasn't
you,

1240
00:54:05,715 --> 00:54:07,427
and I don't think that
Adam could've done it

1241
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:10,721
without completely wigging out.

1242
00:54:10,753 --> 00:54:12,690
We are so fucked.

1243
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:14,291
(laugh)

1244
00:54:14,324 --> 00:54:16,860
Hey, if I die, I die drunk.

1245
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:19,963
He died as he lived.

1246
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:24,068
He was a man of simple tastes.

1247
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,872
He liked "Boys to Men," Super
Soakers,

1248
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:29,841
and "Home improvement."

1249
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:34,412
(laughs)

1250
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:39,784
Oh, you smell like blueberries.

1251
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:44,022
Why are you telling me this?

1252
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:48,025
Because Drew won't listen to
me anymore,

1253
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:49,393
and Adam is Adam.

1254
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:54,030
(ominous music)

1255
00:54:54,063 --> 00:54:55,699
(sighs)

1256
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,735
[Erika] What do we do?

1257
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:03,374
[Nani] Okay, we need to
convince Drew and Adam,

1258
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:05,142
and then we need to get a hold of
the cops,

1259
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:09,881
and if we can't do that, then
we need to confront Simon.

1260
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,016
[Drew] Come on, one.

1261
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:13,983
[Adam] One, two, three.

1262
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:15,318
Yeah, go, number,

1263
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:16,219
- three, four...
- You ever just like

1264
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:18,122
wanna ride on a moose?

1265
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,092
Actually pretty often, yeah, I
do.

1266
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:25,463
[Erika] Hey, coke head,
what's going on here?

1267
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:26,463
Lasagna.

1268
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:27,330
[Drew] An and a.

1269
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:28,231
[Nani] Nani.

1270
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:29,099
[Adam] Amacondas!

1271
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:29,966
[Nani] Nani.

1272
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,434
Okay,

1273
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,737
okay, I can do it.

1274
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:34,439
I can do it.

1275
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,273
What the hell happened to him?

1276
00:55:36,306 --> 00:55:37,974
It's fine, just relax, okay?

1277
00:55:38,007 --> 00:55:38,842
Oh, seriously?

1278
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,044
Relax?

1279
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:42,780
[Drew] Adam isn't exactly
feeling his best right now.

1280
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:46,184
[Adam] Dude, I didn't feel any
of that.

1281
00:55:48,351 --> 00:55:50,887
You know, they're very
territorial animals.

1282
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,491
[Simon] So what's our
plan to get outta here?

1283
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:57,795
Simon! (Chuckles)

1284
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,305
Well, it's way too
dark to go outside now,

1285
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:00,931
and besides, the road's way too
far.

1286
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:04,400
Those are problems, not
solutions, Drew.

1287
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:06,003
Well, I'm sorry, man.

1288
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:06,836
You wanna come down here,

1289
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:08,048
maybe fix that phone in the
kitchen?

1290
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:10,048
Yeah that, (chuckles derisively)
that would help out a lot.

1291
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:11,509
Come on, give it a shot, Simon.

1292
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,277
Why don't we take the boat?

1293
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:16,079
Yeah? (Laughs)

1294
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:18,315
Are we going fishing?

1295
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:19,416
Hey, wait.

1296
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:21,452
Is there a radio?

1297
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:22,787
Uh...

1298
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,221
No, on the boat.

1299
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:26,790
Is there a radio on the boat?

1300
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:30,194
(ominous music)

1301
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:31,161
Simon, Simon!

1302
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:32,238
Do you even know how to work a
boat radio?

1303
00:56:32,262 --> 00:56:33,798
[Simon] Do you?

1304
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:36,865
Drew.

1305
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:41,305
Simon, wait!

1306
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:46,210
What's wrong?

1307
00:56:52,382 --> 00:56:53,382
Simon!

1308
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:59,222
Where the fuck is Alison?

1309
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:00,857
(Alison cries out)

1310
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,860
(Erika cries out)

1311
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:03,527
Where's Brian?

1312
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,228
Where's my Brother?

1313
00:57:05,262 --> 00:57:06,130
(dramatic music)

1314
00:57:06,163 --> 00:57:08,032
What's on your mind?

1315
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:18,108
It was Simon.

1316
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:18,943
(laughs)

1317
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:19,610
Simon killed Logan.

1318
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:20,878
What?

1319
00:57:20,911 --> 00:57:23,047
(laughs)

1320
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:23,913
Where is he?

1321
00:57:23,947 --> 00:57:24,582
What'd you do to him?

1322
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:25,448
He's fine.

1323
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:26,282
Just calm down...

1324
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:27,559
Shut up and tell me where he is!

1325
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,986
Drew took him to the hospital.

1326
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:30,688
You're lying.

1327
00:57:30,721 --> 00:57:34,190
No, no, I'm telling the truth.

1328
00:57:34,224 --> 00:57:35,893
He's gonna be fine.

1329
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:39,495
When we came back, and Brian
was dead,

1330
00:57:39,528 --> 00:57:41,364
that look in Simon's eyes,

1331
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:44,869
- I could just...
- Wait, that look?

1332
00:57:44,902 --> 00:57:48,405
Nani, I've known Simon
my entire life, okay?

1333
00:57:50,373 --> 00:57:54,878
And he is not capable of
anything like that, trust me.

1334
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:56,880
They fixed the car, and they
took him.

1335
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,382
He's gonna be fine.

1336
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:00,617
I swear.

1337
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,119
I didn't hear a car.

1338
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:04,187
They took him.

1339
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:06,123
Just tell her the truth already!

1340
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:06,990
Shut up.

1341
00:58:07,023 --> 00:58:07,991
Stop it.

1342
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:08,858
She doesn't deserve
to be lied to like this.

1343
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:10,169
[Alison] What's she talking
about?

1344
00:58:10,193 --> 00:58:11,028
Nothing, nothing, just...

1345
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:13,264
Brian's dead, Alison.

1346
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:14,097
[Simon] Shut up.

1347
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,130
What?

1348
00:58:15,932 --> 00:58:19,302
He died hours ago
failing to fix the car.

1349
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:22,171
He didn't even make it to the
hospital.

1350
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:23,340
That's not true.

1351
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,242
Tell me he's not dead.

1352
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,445
Stone cold.

1353
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:33,317
So you can just quit with
the little bullshit act.

1354
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,217
Shut up.

1355
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:36,120
Just shut the fuck up!

1356
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:45,663
Ask Simon.

1357
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:49,066
He was there.

1358
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,099
What?

1359
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:55,439
What do you think's taking 'em
so long?

1360
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,041
I don't know.

1361
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:02,413
Stop.

1362
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:03,445
Yeah.

1363
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:06,049
He watched Brian die.

1364
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,352
He let him die.

1365
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:12,722
Please.

1366
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:15,568
Oh what, now do you feel bad?

1367
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:17,528
It's a little late for that.

1368
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:21,731
You didn't feel bad when Brian
was begging for his life!

1369
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:25,435
You knew he was dying,
and you let him die.

1370
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:31,008
You just stood there.

1371
00:59:35,612 --> 00:59:37,347
He just stood there.

1372
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:43,686
And watched as your brother bled
to death,

1373
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:45,221
gasping for air.

1374
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:51,228
I'm gonna go check on 'em.

1375
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:54,565
Take care o' Adam.

1376
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:58,669
(dramatic music)

1377
01:00:07,143 --> 01:00:11,014
Do you wanna know
what his dying wish was?

1378
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:13,016
No matter what happened to him,

1379
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,722
he just wanted to make sure
that his sister would be okay.

1380
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:25,663
You were there.

1381
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:28,165
Weren't you?

1382
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:33,436
Is it true?

1383
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,476
Did he ask about me?

1384
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:44,682
And, and now he's dead?

1385
01:00:51,755 --> 01:00:52,755
Yes.

1386
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:56,327
(sobs)

1387
01:00:58,295 --> 01:00:59,630
It's her fault.

1388
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:01,465
She told me to do it.

1389
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:04,567
If you're gonna go down that
road,

1390
01:01:04,601 --> 01:01:07,805
why don't you just tell
her the whole thing?

1391
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,273
[Alison] What do you mean?

1392
01:01:09,306 --> 01:01:12,509
You know exactly what I'm
talking about.

1393
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,852
How you were the one who killed
Logan

1394
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:18,248
and got them blamed for
it in the first place!

1395
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,317
If he hadn't gotten your
fucking brother tied up,

1396
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:22,353
he wouldn't be dead now.

1397
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,655
(cries out)

1398
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:25,823
[Drew] Stop!

1399
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:33,297
(Erika grunts)

1400
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:36,166
(metal clatters)

1401
01:01:39,802 --> 01:01:41,270
Are you guys all right?

1402
01:01:41,304 --> 01:01:42,506
Simon, are you okay?

1403
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:43,707
I've been better.

1404
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:44,573
Erika?

1405
01:01:44,608 --> 01:01:47,277
Oh shit, you're bleeding like
crazy.

1406
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,144
Are you okay?

1407
01:01:48,177 --> 01:01:49,045
I'll manage.

1408
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:50,681
Did you guys try the boat
radio yet?

1409
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:51,547
[Erika] We came in here...

1410
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:52,883
No.

1411
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,586
She attacked us before
we could do anything.

1412
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:57,354
Okay, I'm gonna give it a try.

1413
01:01:57,387 --> 01:01:58,388
Just hang in there.

1414
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,824
I'm gonna get some help, okay?

1415
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:04,360
(sighs)

1416
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:17,775
This is all your fault.

1417
01:02:20,177 --> 01:02:21,445
What are you talking about?

1418
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:22,746
You killed Brian.

1419
01:02:22,778 --> 01:02:24,681
That was an accident.

1420
01:02:24,713 --> 01:02:26,616
You were high on cocaine
waving a gun around.

1421
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,693
What did you think was gonna
happen?

1422
01:02:27,717 --> 01:02:28,928
Well, you know what, I
wouldn't a had the gun out

1423
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:31,320
if he hadn't a killed Logan in
the first place, all right?

1424
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:32,398
Well, we wouldn't have even
been here

1425
01:02:32,422 --> 01:02:34,332
in the first place if you
and your stupid friends

1426
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:35,659
didn't need to stop for drugs!

1427
01:02:35,692 --> 01:02:36,659
You know, we got along just fine

1428
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:37,803
before you were around, Nani.

1429
01:02:37,827 --> 01:02:38,662
Just fine?

1430
01:02:38,695 --> 01:02:39,530
Yeah, just fuckin' fine.

1431
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:40,396
Like you're doing fine?

1432
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:41,931
You're a loser, Adam.

1433
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:42,965
Wake up.

1434
01:03:02,686 --> 01:03:03,487
[Adam] Nani.

1435
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:04,519
What?

1436
01:03:07,623 --> 01:03:09,559
I just wanna go home.

1437
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:41,792
(breathes shudderingly)

1438
01:03:47,563 --> 01:03:48,563
Me, too.

1439
01:03:53,936 --> 01:03:56,673
(ominous music)

1440
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:01,777
Smart move.

1441
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,747
What if he gets the radio going?

1442
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,984
What if he gets in touch with
the cops?

1443
01:04:20,797 --> 01:04:22,331
(radio beeps and buzzes)

1444
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:23,399
Hey, Simon!

1445
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:27,371
(radio beeps and buzzes)

1446
01:04:27,403 --> 01:04:28,403
Hey, Simon!

1447
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:30,973
I think I got it working, man.

1448
01:04:31,007 --> 01:04:32,842
You hear that?

1449
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:35,379
(laughs)

1450
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:37,513
I think I got it!

1451
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:38,548
Do you copy?

1452
01:04:40,983 --> 01:04:42,052
Hello?

1453
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:43,287
(dramatic music)

1454
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,356
(crunch)

1455
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:09,812
[Drew] Nani.

1456
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:10,646
Adam!

1457
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,081
Oh my God.

1458
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:13,883
Drew, Erika, what happened?

1459
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,085
Are you guys okay?

1460
01:05:15,117 --> 01:05:17,621
You were right about Simon.

1461
01:05:18,655 --> 01:05:20,391
He tried to kill me.

1462
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,393
Lucky Erika was there.

1463
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:26,028
[Adam] Holy fuck.

1464
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:27,061
Shit!

1465
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:31,735
You killed Simon?

1466
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:32,768
I had to.

1467
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:34,603
What happened to him?

1468
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:35,839
He had a gun.

1469
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,916
Did you call the police?

1470
01:05:45,949 --> 01:05:47,727
I mean, did the radio
work on the, on the boat?

1471
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,386
No, it's broken.

1472
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,758
But why would, why
would Simon wanna hurt us?

1473
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,096
Leave me alone.

1474
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:00,864
(exhales)

1475
01:06:00,896 --> 01:06:02,498
[Nani] What now?

1476
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,669
We wait till morning?

1477
01:06:06,702 --> 01:06:07,503
What?

1478
01:06:07,536 --> 01:06:08,137
It's almost sunlight.

1479
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:10,006
We can start walking.

1480
01:06:15,445 --> 01:06:18,015
Fuck this, I need a cigarette.

1481
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:29,626
(soft dramatic music)

1482
01:06:39,802 --> 01:06:40,804
Stay here.

1483
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:44,607
[Erika] Such a dick.

1484
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:47,277
What was that?

1485
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:48,144
We didn't have another option.

1486
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:50,413
You're a fuckin' idiot.

1487
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:54,718
[Logan] Oh fuck, it's Mondo.

1488
01:06:56,085 --> 01:07:00,023
I'm not staying up if
Simon's not staying up.

1489
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:04,795
You were right about Simon.

1490
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:05,929
He tried to kill me.

1491
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:07,164
Lucky Erika was there.

1492
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,064
You killed Simon?

1493
01:07:08,097 --> 01:07:09,097
I had to.

1494
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,469
The truck wouldn't start.

1495
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:15,872
Now does anyone else find
that a little suspicious?

1496
01:07:15,905 --> 01:07:17,641
We didn't touch your car.

1497
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:18,909
I'll bring the car around.

1498
01:07:18,942 --> 01:07:19,876
[Logan] Great.

1499
01:07:19,909 --> 01:07:23,513
[Erika] Simon, why
don't you come with me?

1500
01:07:24,514 --> 01:07:25,182
You killed Simon?

1501
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:26,215
I had to.

1502
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:29,452
There's something wrong with
Simon.

1503
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:30,920
He's acting funny.

1504
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:33,932
We didn't kill that guy right
there,

1505
01:07:33,956 --> 01:07:36,492
which means one o' your friends
did!

1506
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:37,726
You killed Simon?

1507
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,129
Lucky Erika was there.

1508
01:07:39,161 --> 01:07:40,161
I had to.

1509
01:07:41,797 --> 01:07:42,797
I had to.

1510
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I had to.

1511
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:47,871
(gasps)

1512
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:48,903
Nani?

1513
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:54,144
(gagging)

1514
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:56,680
(water runs)

1515
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:00,081
Come on.

1516
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:02,885
You okay?

1517
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:07,090
Lay down for a little bit.

1518
01:08:07,123 --> 01:08:08,692
Upstairs.

1519
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:09,726
Okay.

1520
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:10,759
Come on.

1521
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:15,230
Easy, Nani.

1522
01:08:19,735 --> 01:08:21,505
No, not in there.

1523
01:08:21,537 --> 01:08:22,738
Right, sorry.

1524
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:26,842
Just sit down.

1525
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:27,876
No.

1526
01:08:28,444 --> 01:08:29,279
[Drew] Listen, everything's
gonna be,

1527
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,180
it's all over.

1528
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:31,046
No, it isn't.

1529
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:31,914
(ominous music)

1530
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:33,884
Yes, it is, okay?

1531
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:34,751
The police are gonna be here.

1532
01:08:34,783 --> 01:08:35,618
We're gonna tell them...

1533
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:36,520
Drew, Drew!

1534
01:08:36,552 --> 01:08:37,688
It's not over.

1535
01:08:38,587 --> 01:08:39,587
What?

1536
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:43,126
What are you talking about?

1537
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:45,895
(ominous music)

1538
01:08:51,568 --> 01:08:53,704
Where are Drew and Nani?

1539
01:09:06,849 --> 01:09:07,684
Hey.

1540
01:09:07,716 --> 01:09:08,551
Hey.

1541
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:09,819
Where's Nani?

1542
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:11,921
She wasn't feeling well.

1543
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:15,525
I came in here just to think a
little bit.

1544
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,762
Listen, Adam's a little shaken
up.

1545
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:22,198
Maybe we should go check on him,
yeah?

1546
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,341
We should probably
get our story straight

1547
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:25,167
before we go to the cops.

1548
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:29,238
I just wanna make sure that
we're all saying the same thing.

1549
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:30,950
[Drew] I think we should
tell them the truth.

1550
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:31,909
They don't need to
know that I killed Simon.

1551
01:09:31,942 --> 01:09:33,218
We could just say that
the hikers did that.

1552
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:34,110
No,

1553
01:09:34,143 --> 01:09:34,978
- Erika...
- No, please,

1554
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:35,845
Drew...

1555
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:36,679
[Drew] Erika.

1556
01:09:36,712 --> 01:09:37,380
I really don't wanna go to jail.

1557
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:38,246
No, Erika, I think its' best

1558
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:38,914
if we tell them the whole truth,
okay?

1559
01:09:38,948 --> 01:09:39,782
Simon was going to kill me,

1560
01:09:39,815 --> 01:09:41,192
so you killed him to protect me,
right?

1561
01:09:41,216 --> 01:09:41,750
Fuck you!

1562
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:42,617
I see what you're doing.

1563
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:43,586
You don't wanna think that your
friends

1564
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:44,286
could do anything wrong, so
you're trying

1565
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,719
to blame this whole thing on me!

1566
01:09:44,753 --> 01:09:46,590
Erika, relax!

1567
01:09:46,622 --> 01:09:48,257
No, screw you, Drew!

1568
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:48,958
Maybe you don't know your
friends

1569
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:51,828
as well as you thought you did.

1570
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,131
Erika, we need help, okay?

1571
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:02,605
Just come with me downstairs,
all right?

1572
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:04,007
Come on.

1573
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:04,975
Just come with me.

1574
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,842
(exclaims in disgust)

1575
01:10:06,876 --> 01:10:07,711
(slap lands)

1576
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:08,377
Erika, come on!

1577
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:09,244
Shit!

1578
01:10:09,278 --> 01:10:10,146
(gun fires)

1579
01:10:10,179 --> 01:10:10,980
(gasps)

1580
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:12,014
Oh, shit!

1581
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:16,186
(dramatic music)

1582
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:18,188
Fuck!

1583
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,590
(exclaims)

1584
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:32,101
(gun fires)

1585
01:11:08,938 --> 01:11:12,307
(breathes heavily)

1586
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:14,778
(whimpers)

1587
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:17,878
Hey.

1588
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:21,818
Where're you going, Nani?

1589
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,299
You think if you go far enough,

1590
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:32,995
you can get back to your
perfect little world?

1591
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,464
It was you.

1592
01:11:34,497 --> 01:11:35,365
The whole time, it was you.

1593
01:11:35,398 --> 01:11:37,668
No, Simon killed Logan.

1594
01:11:39,202 --> 01:11:41,237
Because you told him to.

1595
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,306
That asshole deserved to die!

1596
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:44,338
And Drew?

1597
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:48,712
I didn't have a choice.

1598
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:51,279
And me?

1599
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:57,187
(gasps)

1600
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,222
It's nothing personal.

1601
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,793
I'm just cleaning up.

1602
01:12:05,828 --> 01:12:07,898
(grunts)

1603
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:12,969
(cries out)

1604
01:12:13,002 --> 01:12:15,072
(coughs)

1605
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,380
Erika!

1606
01:12:30,987 --> 01:12:32,063
Oh, we both know that you're
not gonna.

1607
01:12:32,087 --> 01:12:34,323
(gun fires)

1608
01:12:52,341 --> 01:12:55,112
