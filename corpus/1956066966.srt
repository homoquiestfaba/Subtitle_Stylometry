I guess I wouldn't believe
the story

it, but, I'm telling it

56 years ago,

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,716
but the real story
began when I was 19 years old

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,558

about 110 miles
from where I grew up.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,037
So, I drove up there alone.

I used to have this really

This wasn't some longstanding

All these station wagons

29

I didn't know anybody.
I was a freshman.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,076
I was never the captain of the
football team in high school,

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,551
so I was never really
like popular.

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,479
So, I'm walking around
trying to find where my dorm is.

34

are coming up to me

I mean, claps on the hack
and high fives.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,915
And I was a little hit
bewildered by this

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,554
because no one gets
this kind of a welcome

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,829

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,510

like fully kissing me saying,
"I'm so glad you came hack."

from right behind me.

hair, the same expressions.

was 'Were you adopted?"

I said. "Come with me."

into (h is phone booth.

to put the coins in

(he coins.

"Yes."

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,678
we are not gonna
believe this story,

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,917
and my first reaction,
"Ah, it's a hoax."

171
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,954
So, Hold our reporter,
"I wanna rem a plane."

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,911
In those days we had
enough money to do this.

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,238
"I wanna rent a plane, I wanna
see these two kids face to lace

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,554
"or I don't believe this."

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,110
We flew lhejoumalist up
to Sullivan Community College

176
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,710
and he called me and he said,
"Howie, it's true, it's true.

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,878
And I remember saying, "Oh my
God, this is a great story.

178
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,959
"This is a memorable
heart-warming story."

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,233
And then the story went from
being amazing to incredible, OK,

180
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,759
from amazing to incredible.

181
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,396
[Ellen] I was
on the New York Subway.

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,795
Quite late at night.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,199
Read an article about two boys
who found each other.

184
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,072
That were twins
separated at birth

185
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,269
and found each other

186
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,914
alSullivan County
Community College.

187
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,793
There was no picture.
but the story was fascinating.

188
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,113
I came home,
and went to sleep.

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,714
My mother came into the room

190
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,832
and said, "Wake up, wake up,
I have to show you something."

191
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,030
And she shows me a newspaper

192
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,470
with a picture of two boys

193
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,160
and I had to like, focus
and I looked a! the photograph

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,237
and I said, "Is that David?"

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,195
And she's like, "No,
but look at (he hands.“

196
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,958
And I was like, "Holy mackerel.
This is beyond amazing."

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,436
It was a picture
in the newspaper of two guys,

198
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,598
in (he "Post" and
I picked up the picture

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,358
and I looked at it,

200
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,516
and I was like in shock,

201
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,269
cos the two guys in the "Post"
looked exactly, exactly

202
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,279
like, like my friend David.
I shred a! it.

203
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,596
And it wasn't even just
the look on their face.

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,438
It was the way that they
were holding their hands.

205
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,717
They have these big meaty hands.
And David always had this,

206
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,916
these hands
that looked like baseball mitts.

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,115
And when I saw their hands,
I just knew that this is David.

208
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,398
[David] It was just
a normal day.

209
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,750
I got to school,
ran into my buddy Alan.

210
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,633
He said, "David,
take a look a! this.“

211
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,115
And he's got a copy
of the "New York Post“.

212
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,310
And, er...
he opens it up

213
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,237
and says,
"Look a! this.

214
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,679
"Look, look familiar?"
Something to that efiecl.

215
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,189
And I said, "Yeah, right. Sure."

216
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,036
But then we looked at it
a little bit more closely.

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,549
It was an article, it said,

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,911
"Twins reunited
after more than 19 years."

219
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,430
And it had a picture of two
of what looked like me.

220
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,838
L! all started to sink in.

221
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,998
"Holy shit, oh my God.

222
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,634
"Do you? This is un...
this is not believable,

223
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,990
"this is, this is unbelievable.
Wow!

224
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,077
"This is big,
this is serious,

225
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,999
"this is just not some kind
of crazy coincidence.

226
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,316
"This is not
a minor resemblance.

227
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,237
'This is real,
this is happening,

228
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,873
"this is really,
really serious."

229
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,271
I ditched classes
and got home.

230
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,436
My mother was waiting
at the kitchen table

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,515
with a cup of coffee.

232
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,676
And I said, "Mom, you see this?"

233
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,634
She said, "You see this?" And
we kinda exchanged newspapers.

234
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,394
Il had, "...bom Long Island
Jewish Hospital."

235
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,954
"July 12th, 1961."

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,675
And it was Louise Wise
adoption agency.

237
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,678
Imean, I always knew growing
up that I was adopted,

238
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,836
My parents were always
open about it.

239
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,998
Bu! it said Eddy Galland
of New Hyde Park, Long Island,

240
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,316
Robert Shafran
of Scarsdale, New York.

241
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,794
I remember it said,

242
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,753
"Son oi prominent Scarsdale
physician Mort Shaimn"

243
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,916
and, er... my first thought,
I said,

244
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,951
"He's got the wealthy family.

245
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,160
"That 805's probably driving
a Benz! He go! a donor!"

246
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,711
[Alan] And I remember being
with David in (he kitchen.

247
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,156
We were like, really nervous.

248
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,238
I mean we were, you know,
jumping around, it was...

249
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,875
You know, we were 19 years old.
I mean this was surreal.

250
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,391
And David picked up the phone
and he called Information,

251
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,233
and he reached Eddy's mom.

252
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,157
And I said, "Hi, is Eddy home?"

253
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,113
She says, "No,
who's calling, please?"

254
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,719
And I thought, 'OK,

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,114
“now I've gotta go into
this whole thing on the phone."

256
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,518
lsaid, "Well, my name
is David Kellman,

257
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,552
"and I was born July 12th 1961

258
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,716
"and I'm looking
a! a newspaper

259
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,311
"and, er... basically I think
I'm looking at two of me.

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,397
"I think I might be the third."

261
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,239
And I think she dropped
the phone, actually.

262
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,796
And I remember hearing
her voice over the phone,

263
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,150
"Oh my God, they're coming out
of the woodwork!"

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,829
[Hedy] It was a miracle.

265
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,269
The first time
that the boys met together,

266
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,472
the three together
was at my house.

267
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,999
And the three of them ended up

268
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,749
like puppies wrestling
on the floor.

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,555
Il was the most
incredible...

270
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,352
it was the most
incredible thing.

271
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
They belonged to each other.

272
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,239
They knew each other. There
was no formal introduction.

273
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,557
I mean, when you meet somebody
for the first time

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,634
you don't end up rolling around
on the floor with them.

275
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,389
It was truly
no! fully believable.

276
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,517
Even though it was happening
it was still surreal.

277
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,437
You think you're dreaming.

278
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,074
You're looking and
you're still "Oh my God."

279
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,838
You look at the other one,
"Oh my God."

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,837
And then you realize
that they're looking at you

281
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,598
or everybody else
is looking at you loo.

282
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,200
To have all three of (hem
in the house at onetime...

283
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,674
[Gasps]

284
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,280
It... it was
really madness.

285
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,156
My emotions were shock,
shock and more shock.

286
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,717
I mean,
I can'! explain it,

287
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
I haven't got
the terminology.

288
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,794
One of our reporters came
running over to me and said

289
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,036
'You're not gonna believe (his,

290
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,313
"you are not gonna believe
the call we just got.

291
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,829
"You know the two kids
on the front page today?

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,190
"Well, there's a third."

293
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,834
They even moved (he same way.

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,794
All of us just sat back

295
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,710
and watched three separate
lives becoming one.

296
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,240
The way I put it was

297
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,715
I looked more like Eddy
than I did David,

298
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,990
and more like David
than I did Eddy,

299
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,032
and more like either of them
than they did like each other.

300
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,832
Does that make sense?

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,158
And then we started
comparing notes.

302
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,760
What do 19-year-olds compare?

303
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,391
Booze, cigarettes, food,
women, music, cars.

304
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,751
I had just broughta brand new
Mercury Capri, which I loved.

305
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,590
And Bobby had this,
Maroon beat up old Volvo

306
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,756
with cracked leather seats
and I'm thinking,

307
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,590
"Hmm, son of a prominent
Scarsdale physician, huh?"

308
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,755
[Schneider] I think
it was Eddy who said

309
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,393
right at the beginning,

310
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,879
"I don't know if this will turn
out to be great or terrible."

311
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,551
So, there was always a question
mark, a big question mark,

312
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,070
about where the story
eventually was going.

313
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,158
We didn't realize
from (hen on

314
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,352
just how much
things were going to change.

315
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,596
'Now one of the most remarkable
stories I've seen in sometime:

316
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,675
'a story about triplets.

317
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,560
'Eddy and Robert and David
reunited after 19 years.'

318
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,830
'We have a story about triplets
that gives new meaning

319
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,393
'to the phrase
long lost brothers.'

320
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,676
We went on everything.
Everything.

321
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,313
'You're not seeing double

322
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,112
'you are perhaps in a moment
going to be seeing triple.'

323
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,434
'I don't know who's who here.

324
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,792
'Come on out here, gentlemen,
come on out.'

325
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,433
You just had to stop
what you're doing

326
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,832
and watch (hem
on every different show.

327
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,440
[Schneider] It became a circus,
it became a media circus.

328
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,359
Talk about viral, I mean this
was... it was viral even then.

329
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,676
'You guys have been on the
front page of every newspaper

330
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,916
- 'in the world.'
- [Triplets] True.'

331
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,752
"People Magazine",
'Time Magazine",

332
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,077
even the "New York Times",
"Good Housekeeping".

333
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,514
'David, let's begin with you.

334
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,675
'Which one': David,
I keep forgetting?'

335
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,119

- 'Right!

336
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,389
'OK, who are you,
are you David?'

337
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,714
- 'I'm Bobby.'
- 'Oh, you're... I'm sorry.

338
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,394
'You're Robert, all right.
Robert and Edward.'

339
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,670
- [Audience laughing]
- 'Come on.'

340
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,669
ll was a fairy tale story.

341
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,156
And people need to hear
wonderful things.

342
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,191
'These three young men,

343
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,437
'they're all seated
in the same position.'

344
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,835
[Audience laughing]

345
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,713
It was kind of amazing.
They really were strangers.

346
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,955
They looked identical
to each other

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,798
but they were strangers, right?

348
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,239
You know, they really
didn't know one another.

349
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,318
But their behaviors
were so similar.

350
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,000
'Our lives are parallel
toa phenomenal degree.

351
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,951
'It's, it's ridiculous.'

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,479
'We're all the same,

353
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,840
'as soon as we started
discussing our personalities.'

'Personalities are the same,
our gestures are the same.'

355
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,800
'We always talk
a! the same time.'

356

'I'll start a sentence
and he'll finish it.'

[Eddy] 'We all like
Chinese load.'

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,876
[Brokaw] 'You were all
wrestlers at one time?'

359
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,240
[Triplets] 'Yes.'

360
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,509
'You all smoke the same brand
of cigarettes?'

361
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,954
[Triplets] 'Yes.'

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,638
[Donahue] 'What kind
of cigarettes do you smoke?'

363
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,670
'Marlboro!

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040

the same brand?'

[Triplets] 'Yes.'

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,200
- 'Do you like the same colors?'
- [Triplets] Wes.'

367
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,117
'Yeah, I was curious,
how's their taste in women,

368
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,720
- 'is it similar?'
- [Triplets] 'Yes. Definitely.'

[Audience laughing]

370
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,670
Il seems they all liked
older women.

371
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,836
'Somebody said
you all liked older women.'

372
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,359
[Triplets] 'Well...'

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,151
[Newsreader] 'Another
astonishing coincidence

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,352
'is that each of the brothers

'How long did it take for you
to have that feeling?'

- 'Like that.'
- [Triplets snap fingers]

386
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,474
[Schneider] They were
more like clones

387
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,070
than they were like brothers.

388
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,909
It was just absolutely
astounding because they grew up

389
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,349
it would appear to be
pretty different households.

390
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,469
We'd been adopted
by a blue-collar family,

391
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,036
a middle-class family
and a more affluent family.

392
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,269
Bobby's parents, Bobby's father
was a medical doctor.

393
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,433
And his mother was an attorney.

394
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,312
So they were very well educated
and they were living

395
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,554
in one of the most prestigious
areas of the country.

396
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,190
Eddy's father was a teacher,
he had a college education.

397
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,392
And they lived
in what would be considered

398
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,511
a middle-class neighborhood.

399
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,240
My family on paper
were the least educated,

400
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,195
they were immigrants, English
was a second language to them,

401
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,436
they had a little store,

402
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,429
they were the more
blue-collar family.

403
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,551
Hmm, but my father was just

404
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,356
this incredibly generous
warm guy.

405
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,234
David's father, Richard was,
uh... was larger than life.

406
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,956
If you could imagine this guy
was a big guy,

407
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,670
with a big cigar always
hanging out of his mouth.

408
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,319
We referred to him
as 'bubalai

409
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,237
[Ellen] He was Buhala.

410
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,033
If you know Yiddish,
'bubala' it's like love,

411
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,232
it's hugging and it's kissing.

412
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,396
[Bobby] We spent more time
a! David's house

413
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,750
than any place else.

414
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,556
Bubala celebrated us
like no other person.

415
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,432
He said, "I have two more sons."

416
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,639
When the boys found each other

417
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,479
it just sort
of happened

418
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,954
(hen and there.

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,798
Here is this
wonderful story

420
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,592
and that's it.

421
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,473
Nobody questioned
what was going on

422
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,238
except the parents of course.

423
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,832
When the families met up
(he first time

424
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,838
there was great anger
in all a! them

425
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,316
about the tact that the parents
had never been told

426
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,351
that there were
two other children.

427
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,594
[Elliott] They didn't tell us
a word when we were adopting.

428
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,790
We knew nothing
about the other two

429
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,311
until, <i>er...</i> the boys met
at, at school,

430
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,556
that was 20 years later.

431
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,200
[Hedy] The first thing
that hit me was what they lost.

432
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,676
I believe they were six months
old when they were separated.

433
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,395
If you imagine those three
little bodies lying together

434
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,709
and suddenlythe coldness
of being alone in a crib.

435
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,232
It's a terrible deprivation.

436
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,357
I remember being (old
by my mother

437
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,399
when I was a baby that I would
slam my head against the wall,

438
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,397
I would basically
knock myself out.

439
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,954
My mother said
that I would bang my head

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,434
on the inside of the crib...

441
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,230
...and I would hold <i>my</i> breath
until I passed out.

442
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,354
I believe it was absolutely
separation anxiety

443
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,836
All of us had been adopted
from Louise Wise Services.

444
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,871
[Reporter]
'Louise Wise Services,

445
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,312

They were the pre-eminent
adoption agency

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,753
on the East Coast
for Jewish babies in particular.

451
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,314
That was the place to go.

452
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,670
What we have felt

453
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,631
at Louise Wise
Services

454
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,159
where I have
been active

455
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,192
for a great
longtime,

456
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,232
is that adoptive parents
should be told

457
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,831
as much about the background
of a child as is reasonable.

458
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,839
Our parents they, they, they
wanted answers, they were angry.

459
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,839
And they arranged a meeting
and they... the six of them

460
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,875
went in to Louise Wise Agency
to try to get some answers

461
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,912
in terms of piecing together
what happened.

462
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,439
[Thunder clapping]

463
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,715
[Alice] There was a meeting with
the top brass at the agency.

464
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,512
And they were asked,

465
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,678
"Is it true that you separated
these boys at birth?"

466
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,430
And they said, 'Yes, we did."

467
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,672
Why?

468
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,790
How could you not tell us?

469
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,559
What did you do?

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,910
Why and how could you?

471
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,554
[Alice] They said the reason was

472
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,312
because it was hard to place
three children in one home.

473
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,397
The parents had been told that

474
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,512
it was in our best interests
that we'd been split up.

475
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,077
That not every parent
would welcome triplets,

476
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,990
and that triplets would be
difficult to place.

477
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,718
Which... I think at that moment
my father blew his shack.

478
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,832
And just said,
"We wouldWe taken all three.

479
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,829
'There's no question."
And he was furious.

480
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,394
[Sighs] Well, the meeting
came to an end.

481
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,716
[Thunder clapping]

482
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,398
[Bobby] They all left.

483
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,512
They felt like
they had gotten nothing.

484
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,916
And my father realized that he
had left his umbrella in there.

485
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,837
And he went back
to gel the umbrella.

486
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,958
And he walked inlo the room

487
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,914
to see them breaking open
a bottle of champagne...

488
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,116
and toasting each other
as if they had dodged a bullet.

489
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,869
They looked like they'd
just missed getting hurl

490
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,514
or killed or what have you.

491
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,236
It was a, er...
that was memorable.

492
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,998
[David] All of our parents came
away from that meeting angry.

493
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,117
The parents went to some pretty
prestigious New York law firms

494
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,438
and initially they were met
with a lot of enthusiasm,

495
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,195
and, er... invariably within
a shun period oiiime

496
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,119
were told, er...
there's a conflict

497
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,754
and they could not
take the case.

498
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,430
The'; said, "We have
a number of associates

499
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,871
'who are trying to adopt
through Louise Wise,

500
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,959
"and we don't wanna ruin
their chances."

501
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,395
So, that lawsuit was out.

502
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,110
[David] We were too happy
being together to be that angry.

503
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,358
We didn't understand it and to
a degree we almost didn't care.

504
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,717
Our heads were in the clouds,

505
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,592
we knew our parents
were pissed off

506
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,951
but it was almost like, "Well,
that's our parents' thing to do"

507
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,037
while we were out partying.

508
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,229
[I KIM WILDE: "Kids In America"]

509
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,197
I' Friday night
and everyone's moving...

510
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,035
[Bobby] This was New York
in 1880.

511
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,673
Drugs were different,
people were different,

512
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,757
sex was different,
music was different.

513
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,158
Phew! We just, we just wok
advantage of all those things.

514
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,079
Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.

515
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,954
I We're the kids in America,
whoa... J?

516
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,116
They were running amok
in New York, I'll say.

517
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,229
Studio 54 was cooking.
Limelight. Copacabana.

518
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,238
They were hitting them all.

519
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,874
[David] New York loved us.
New York lowed us.

520
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,633
All the newspapers
were following the boys around

521
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,750
no matter where we went.

522
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,440
I remember one morning
walking in

523
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,395
and my mother throwing
the "New York Post" at me,

524
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,239
at the kitchen table saying,
"I gotta look a! the paper

525
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,794
"to find out where you were
last night?"

526
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,437
The boys thought
they were gonna be stars,

527
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,395
and actually they did star
in one movie.

528
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,717
Walking down the street,
all of a sudden we hear,

529
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,798
"Guys, guys, you're the guys!

530
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,353
"Could you please be
in our movie?

531
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,470
"Please be in my movie."

532
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,479
We didn't know who she was,
and she was, she was Madonna.

533
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,399
The stood on the side
and ogled her.

534
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,431
Pretty soon we got
an apartment together,

535
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,757
the triplets apartment.

536
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,313
[Ellen] The triplefs apartment.

537
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,719
Hmm, ifs like if you had
the most bachelor apartment

538
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,034
times three.

539
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,878
The liquor store
used to deliver the liquor,

540
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,878
At one point
Eddy had appendicitis.

541
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,752
He had no insurance.

542
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,350
And so he checked
into the hospital as Bobby.

543
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,960
And had his appendix taken out.
As Bobby.

544
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,958
I hope to this day Bobby's
appendix stays pretty healthy.

545
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,710
Between working together,
playing together,

546
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,070
going out together,
going on dams together,

547
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,599
living together,

548
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,079
from the time we me! till...
well (ill later

549
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,829
there was nothing, nothing
that could keep us apart.

550
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,111
[Ilene] I feel like I was
the firs! serious girlfriend.

551
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,872
Initially I couldn't really
tell them apart

552
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,274
and I would bump into them

553
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,118
and I waswtquite sure

554
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,437
which one I was
going outwith, so...

555
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,600
Bob has this very raw, natural,
type of intelligence

556
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,870
that I think
I was attracted too.

557
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,836
I always thought David
was the best, right,

558
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,279
of the three of them.

559
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,436
L, I've said it
before, you know,

560
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,949
"I got the pick of the litter."

561
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,437
Without a douM, Eddy
wasthe, er... handsomest

562
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,632
of all the three
triplets, you know.

563
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,432
Of course, I'm partial

564
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,120
but, you know,
I adored him.

565
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,315
When I met him,
he was the last holdout.

566
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,673
The Casanova of the three
and, er... I said,

567
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,838
"Oh boy, this guy's
a real bachelor, like player."

568
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,471
But he was so warm
in his smile

569
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,150
and he had wonderful
beautiful hands, soft hands

570
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,880
and when I shook his hand
I mean, I just, l...

571
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,558
You know, I just
loll in love with him.

572
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,432
I'm from a big colorful
Irish catholic family

573
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,710
and he was a Jewish guy.

574
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,479
When he came (u the house
for the first time,

575
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,673
he looked at my dad
and he said,

576
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,912
"I don't know if you know this,
Mr Shanley,

577
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,236
"I've been seeing Brenda
every night pretty much

578
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,918
"since the first day I met her."

579
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,678
And I thought, "Oh <i>my</i> God,

580
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,155
"my dad knows that, you know,
we're together every night."

581
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,909
And my dad just son of, you
know, looked at me like, "OK"

582
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,075
and that was Eddy.

583
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,872
-'I do.'
-'l do.'

584
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,232
[Clapping]

585
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,635
'We love you.'

586
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,234
[Brenda] Everyone loved him.

587
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,878
If there was a scale,
Bobby would be reserved,

588
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,354
David would be middle

589
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,711
and Eddy was just
the loveable, mushy,

590
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,876
huggahle, funny,

591
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,151
you know, he just exuded
warmth and love.

592
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,596
[Miming baby laughter]

593
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,350
[Mrs Shanley] 'Jamie's first
Thanksgiving with Daddy.'

594
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,358
- 'Hi, look who's here.'
- 'Yes, Daddy.'

595
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,913
'Daddy decided to show up

596
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,197
'and make a special
guest appearance.'

I 'Happy birthday, dear Jamie

J"Happy birthday to you?

599
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,957
[Brenda] He loved
family gatherings.

600
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,073
[Cheering]

601
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,509
[Alan] You know, Eddy
really, really loved

602
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,871
being around David
and Bobby.

603
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,471
Eddy seemed to gel the most out
of the three of them meeting.

604
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,079
For whatever reason.

605
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,754
[Brenda] He wanted his brothers
and him to have a beautiful life

606
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,998
and everyone to gel along

607
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,352
and he wanted everyone
to he one big family.

608
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,833
Eddy was absolutely
the driving force

609
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,874
in terms of leading the search
for our birth mother.

610
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,230
He got a fever
and he just wanted to do it.

611
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,998
And Alan was also rallying,

612
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,316
because it was just
an exciting (hing to do.

613
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,476
We figured what are the chances

614
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,960
of having triplets
born in New York

615
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,236
on July 12th 1961.

616
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,353
We figured out
that New York public library

617
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
shaved birth records.

618
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,270
We each grabbed a book

619
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,472
<i>and um! page by page
W W3“! W?!“ “W,</i>

620
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,273
and within a couple of hours,
it was, "Bingo!"

621
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,871
Male, male, male.
Three in a row.

622
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,877
All horn July 12th 1961.

623
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,837
[David] Right next lo it,
birth mother's last name.

624
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,430
The first meeting was a bar
on like, 47th Street.

625
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,791
It was like, her local
neighborhood watering hole

626
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,720
on the East side,
and I! was awkward.

627
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,718
She told the story
of what happened.

628
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,479
Unfortunately it wasn't
a romantic story.

629
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,557
She was a young girl.

630
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,833
Basically, prom night
knock up type thing.

631
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,117
[Alan] I don't think
she ever go! over the fact

632
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,994
that she had triplets
and had to give them up.

633
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,436
You know, to us at 19,

634
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,118
you drink like a fish,
you think you're invincible.

635
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,953
But we found it
a little concerning

636
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,392
that she was pretty much
keeping up with us, you know.

637
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,717
Er... the apple doesn't fall
that far from the tree

638
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,754
and it that's the tree,
I was less than thrilled,

639
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,557
and we had our parents already,
so we met her and I! was OK.

640
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,597
But she was not a particularly
close pan of our lives.

641
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,876
We were all young and starting
our marriages and careers.

642
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,593
'Hi, welcome to Triplets.'

643
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,439
[Newsreader] 'David Kellman,
Eddy Galland and Robert Shafran

644
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,357

[Journalist] 'Welcome. Hello.
Welcome, welcome.'

648
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,590
[David] We had a lot of people
who were coming for us.

649
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,029
They came to see the triplets.

650
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,196
They wanted to be waited
on by one of the triplets.

651
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,356
We sewed vodka frozen
blocks of ice,

652
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,835
and we'd get the whole roam
up and dancing.

653
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,678
It was like this
big party going on,

654
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,949
it was like this big
Bar Millvah.

655
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,476
'Triplets become
wildly successful

'in the Soho district
of New York City.'

We did over
a million dollars firs! year.

659
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,838
That's when things
kinda got funky.

660
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,194
[Wright] In the mid-90s
I started working on a story

661
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,311
for "The New Yorker" magazine

662
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,318
about identical twins
reared apart.

663
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,794
I've always thought,

664
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,035
"What would it be like
if you turned

665
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,835
"the corner one day
and you saw yourself?"

666
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,713
In the process of my research,

667
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,152
I came across (his obscure
scientific article.

668
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,075
Il referenced this secret study

669
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,556
in which identical siblings
had been separated.

670
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,109
I was shocked and intrigued.

671
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,472
They were separating
identical babies a! birth

672
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,115
for the purpose
of this scientific experiment.

673
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,554
And these babies had all come

674
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,195
from one adoption agency
in New York City.

676
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,439
'was, "Were you adopted?'

[Bobby] There I am,

[Brokaw] 'Eddy and Robert and

680
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,995
'It's beautiful.'

681
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,236
[David] 'Blue-collar family,

682
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,839
'and a more affluenl family.'

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,078
'Adoptive parents should be (old
as much as is reasonable.'

684
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,838
[David] 'Something
was just no! right.'

685
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,759
[Alice] 'They were breaking

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,355
[David] 'All of us were adopted
from Louise Mse.'

689
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,069
'And these babies had all come
from Louise 'Wise Services.'

690
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,914
Lawrence Wright called me

691
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,272
and he told me
all about the experiment.

692
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,630
And I said, "This is
like Nazi shit."

693
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,994
ll was kind of like reality
hitting like a tidal wave.

694
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,756
We were a science experiment.

695
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:47,070
These people split us up
and studied us like lab rats.

696
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,875
We didn't recognize this stuff
until it was put in our face.

697
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,319
Until it was in newsprint.

698
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,115
But there were clues
in the past,

699
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,839
I remember
from a very young age...

700
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,152
mpeople would come
to the house...

701
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,440
"usually a young man
and a young woman.

702
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,436
And they had me taking tests.

703
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,439
They did IO tests,
personality inventory tests,

704
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,393
they did eye hand
co-ordination tests.

705
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,072
I do remember people coming
to the house, having tests done,

706
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:43,356
square pegs and round holes,
and Rorschach ink block tests.

707
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,074
"What does (his mean to you?"
that kind of stuff.

708
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,910
Eddy told me
that when he was younger,

709
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,273
he remembers people
watching him and taking notes,

710
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,072
and they would ask him questions

711
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,436
and he would get frustrated
with (he questions.

712
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,355
And he remembers
they were videotaping him.

713
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,755
I remember the filming
more than anything else.

714
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,433
I remember having
superflmm films taken of me

715
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,313
when I was on the swing set,
or on the slide.

716
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,954
Every single time they came
they filmed.

717
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,991
Riding my bike,
throwing a ball,

718
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,838
and they wanted to see
how many times I could,

719
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,315
you know, go on my pogo stick,
roller-skating,

720
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,630
throwing a Frisbee,
shooting a how and arrow,

721
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,079
you know,
they had my attention.

722
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,349
I was performing.

723
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,596
The stuff they did would be
more complex as I got older.

724
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,758
Hell weird about it,
I didn't really understand

725
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,757
why they needed
to some so often,

726
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,314
why were they asking me
all these questions.

727
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,237
Somewhere around age
of nine or ten

728
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,237
I started becoming
less comfortable with it,

729
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,874
and it was kinda like, "Mom,
do I still have to do this?

730
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,273
"Do I still have to do this?"

731
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,751
When our parents adopted us

732
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,918
they were each (old
that we were being followed

733
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,394
as pan of a normal study

734
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,518
of the development
of adopted children,

735
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:18,000
They had no idea
that we'd been separated.

736
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,637
The agency said the children
born in this period of time

737
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,958
were all gonna be in a normal
study of adopted children.

738
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,629
And, as far as we knew,
(hat was it.

739
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,240
Thai this was a new thing
they were going to follow up

740
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,673
with all the children
and at the time we accepted it.

741
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,231
[David] You're talking
about a group of people

742
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,353
that went and held a baby

743
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,951
and did psychological testing
on a six-month-old baby,

744
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,551
and then went to another house
to see his brother,

745
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,956
and then went to another house
to see his brother,

746
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,359
and did this over years
and years and years and years

747
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,198
with full knowledge

748
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,231
that we were within
a 100-mile radius.

749
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,717
And not knowing each other.

750
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,435
It's just unconscionable.

751
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,429
Who would think that anybody
would he evil enough

752
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,269
to come up
with something like this?

753
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,637
In the process of my research,

754
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,560
I learned is that the person
really in charge o! (he study

755
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,673
was Dr Peter Neubauer,

756
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,033
very distinguished psychiatrist
in New York,

757
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,754
director of the Freud archives.

758
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,759
He was an Austrian refugee
from the Holocaust

759
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,719
and he set up shop in New York
and became, you know,

760
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,000
one of the great men
of psychiatry in America.

761
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,271
What I learned is that people
at the Louise Wise agency

762
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,631
were separating
identical siblings

763
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,877
and then a beam o! scientists
led by Neuhauer

764
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,389
would follow them.

765
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,990
But it wasn't just the triplets.

766
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,673
There were others.

767
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,676
After my article came out

768
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,917
another twin set
discovered themselves.

769
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,519
'And here they are now.

770
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,675
'I appreciate you coming
on the show today.'

771
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,836
- 'Our pleasure.'
- 'Paula and Elyse.'

772
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,390
[Audience applauds]

773
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,991
'The story is incredible.
Is that the way to tell it?'

774
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,680
'It's funny. I mean, we say
I! I! hadn't happened to us

775
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,997
- 'we wouldn't believe it.'
- 'This is a Disney movie.'

776
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,792
'It's a little darker
than a Disney movie.

777
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,831
'I was at home
in my apartment in Brooklyn

778
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,518
'with my two-year-old daughter,

779
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,712
'and the phone rings
and I answer the phone

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,239
'and it was the adoption agency.

“We've got some news for you,

782
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,674
"And she's looking for you!"

'Well, it's funny because I
don't know if you noticed...'

786

'Our mannerisms are inherited.'

787
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,751
'I contacted the adoption agency

788
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,030
'and I asked them, "Well,
why we were separated?“

789
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,514
'That's the million-dollar
question of this story.'

790
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,959
'And they said,
"For a twin study."

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,957
'We felt that our lives
had been orchestrated

'before the needs of us,

'and other twins and triplets

797
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,035
[Wright] Nobody is sure
of how many identical twins

798
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,832
were involved in this study.

799
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,431
I was told six to eight,
but we don't really know.

800
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,919
When you have
a study like this,

801
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,156
normally you produce
the results

802
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,158
and you show how large
(he sample is

803
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,111
and all this son of thing.

804
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,676
But this study
was never published,

805
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,156
Which makes it all
the more intriguing.

806
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,716
[David] We did have an attorney

807
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,071
try to get us
some of the study records.

808
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,431
We received a small amount
of information.

809
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,797
Il was very dry,
technical data,

810
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,433
that didn't really shed
any light

811
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,040
on the reasons for the study.
It was garbage.

812
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,472
I don't know
what the results were,

813
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,672
or if there ever were results
because I never saw them.

814
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,710
[Wright] They're trying
to conceal what they did

815
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,195
from the people
they did it to.

816
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,992
Why?

817
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,600
[Aline] I mean, what was
the purpose of it?

818
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,598
The study was never
published. Why?

819
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,877
My name is
Natasha Josefowilz...

820
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,673
...and I was PelerNeubaueFs
research assistant.

821
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,479
So, come on in.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

822
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,318
Here are some of my buddies.

823
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,830
Michelle Obama and I.
She is very tall.

824
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,678
I'm like a little shrimp
next to her,

825
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,711
I come up to her right here.

826
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,433
This is Obama three years ago,

827
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,830
and here he is holding
my latest hook.

828
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,190
I have lo bell you.
lsaid, "Barack, I love you."

829
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,551
He said, "I love you too", and
he gave me a kiss on this cheek.

830
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,071
Yeah. This is Robert Redford
and Al Gore.

831
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,829
And this is Errol Flynn and me
when I was 18.

832
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,473
I thought he was a hoot.

833
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,271
Picasso's.

834
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,357
When are we gonna talk
about the twin study?

835
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,155
[Clears throat]

836
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,989
You need to know
lam no! part of the team,

837
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,510
lam a peripheral person.
I just do the hearsay.

838
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,076
The first time I heard
about the twin study,

839
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,398
it was still just a dream
in Peter's head.

840
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,034
[Interviewer] What was he like'!

841
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,756
Hmm... sexy,
nice looking, interesting.

842
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,349
His background
was very Freudian.

843
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,357
Anna Freud,
Freud's daughter,

844
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,040
would often some
and visit with him.

845
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,309
He was very focused on wanting
to make a diflerence

846
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,397
in children's lives.

847
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,355
Peter started thinking,
wouldn't I! be interesting

848
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,710
to have a study of mothers

849
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,717
who wanted to give up
their children.

850
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,797
Who happen
to be identical twins

851
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,475
and then could he
separated at birth?

852
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,718
If we could put (hem in two
totally different environments,

853
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,673
we would put to rest
the dilemma,

854
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,678
nature or nurture,
forever.

855
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,915
Now you may think,
"Oh, (his is terrible, you know,

856
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,678
"how could you do this?"

857
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,998
You have lo put yourself back
in the late 50s and 60s.

858
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,396
This was not something
that seemed to be bad.

859
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,910
Nobody said, "To take children
apart, how terrible."

860
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,079
That was not at all
in anyone's thoughts.

861
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,512
This was a very exciting time.

862
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,995
Psychology was just beginning
to be the big deal

863
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,236
that everybody
was talking about.

864
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,551
This was all in terms
of research. An opportunity.

865
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,551
One of the great questions
that science has ever asked

866
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,069
is "How do we become
(he people we are,

867
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,112
"how much of nature
versus how much of nurture

868
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,720
"shapes us into the people
that we become?“

869
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,279
[Josefowitz] I did not go
and do the research.

870
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,914
But I would hear about it
because I was in the office.

871
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,470
What they found out,
was incredible.

872
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,154
'Our lives are parallel
toa phenomenal degree.

873
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,476
'It's, it's ridiculous.'

874
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,999
'We're all the same,

875
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,314
'as soon as we started
discussing our personalities.'

876
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,317
'Personalities are the same,
our gestures are the same.'

877
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,430
'We always talk
a! the same time.'

878
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,437
'You were raised
in different homes?'

879
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,153
[Triplets] True.'

880
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,320
I did not believe that it'd be
as much hereditary as it was,

881
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,317
that was more
than any of us thought.

882
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,078
'I'll start a sentence
and he'll finish it.'

883
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,269
[Eddy] 'We all like
Chinese load.'

884
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,549
'You were all wrestlers
at one time?'

885
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,034
[Triplets] 'Yes.'

886
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,070
- 'You all smoke cigarettes?'
- [Triplets] Wes.'

887
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,554
'Do you all smoke
the same brand?'

888
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,034
[Triplets] 'Yes.'

889
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,469
- 'Do you like the same colors?'
- [Triplets] Wes.'

890
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,272
'How's their taste in women,
is it similar?'

891
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,436
[Triplets] 'Yes. Definitely.'

892
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,039
[Audience laughing]

893
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,071
We are moved l0 behaviors

894
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,952
that we are totally
unconscious about.

895
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,950
'You were hath editors
of your high school paper,

896
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,832
'you both went to film school.'

897
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,234
'I don't know ii you noticed...'

898
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,396
'Our mannerisms are inherited.'

899
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,397
It's disturbing,
we don't like that.

900
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,477
People don't like to hear,
they say, "I have free will."

901
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,350
We would prefer that we have
some influence over our lives.

902
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,232
Wouldn't you rather know that'?

903
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,476
Thai you have
some control over this

904
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,558
and so finding out, never mind,
doesn't matter what you do.

905
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,275
So, I think
it's upsetting to people

906
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,550
to see how little influence
they have,

907
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,670
how little control they have.

908
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,792
We don't like that,
we fight that.

909
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,030
If the conclusions of the study
were so shocking

910
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,720
and so earth-shaking,

911
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,070
why haven't you published
your study?

912
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,750
There is a lot
that we don't know.

913
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,555
We have anecdotes
that are very provocative,

914
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,950
but we don't know,
we don't have the data.

915
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,120
[Josefowitz] I don'! know
what happened to the sludy.

916
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,994
I moved to Switzerland
in 1965

917
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,795
and lost touch
with what was going on.

918
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,071
All that research
should be seen.

919
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,959
This study was the first,
and it's also the last,

920
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,311
it will never be done again,
il will never be replicated.

921
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,510
It's monumental,
it's a monumental study.

922
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,350
In terms of the motivation
that they used

923
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,118
c» justify what they did,

924
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,515
I don't even care
because, I...

925
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,198
It's natjustifiahle
what they did.

926
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,037
[Hedy] You know what?

927
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,799
Coming from the Holocaust,

928
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,472
our family
has a knowledge

929
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,275
that when you play
with humans...

930
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,876
...you do something very wrong.

931
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,039
And I really believe that
because of this research,

932
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,551
these three boys
did no! have happy endings.

933
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,678
'What were some
of the similarities

934
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,757
'you found that you had
as you were all growing up

935
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,509
'in your own respective
households?'

936
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,676
'We all smoked the same
cigarettes when we met,

937
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,870
'we all wrestled
in high school and junior high,

938
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,036
'we all loved
the same food, er...

939
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,400
'our taste in women
was similar.'

940
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,078
'What are some
of the stranger things

941
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,231
'you found out
you had in common?

942
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,269
'Any other more
surprising discoveries?'

943
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,515
'Well, sometimes
when you think

944
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,119
'you're having
a unique though! or idea

945
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,276
'and you go to share it
with someone

946
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,152
'and they say, "Your brother
just told me."

947
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,349
- 'It's a little annoying.'
- [David] 'It's funny.'

948
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,799
'It's a little annoying,
it's unnerving.'

949
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,436
[David] Being in business
with my brothers

950
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,949
damaged our relationship.

951
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,597
There were conflicting
work ethics,

952
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,713
and my father
had passed away.

953
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,392
He really anchored us together
as a group

954
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,239
and kepi (he peace
so lo speak,

955
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,159
They started to argue
like kids would argue, you know.

956
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,511
And they didn't have
that opportunity,

957
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,518
that gilt of being able
to be brothers for 18 years.

958
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,680
When you are living
in a family of children

959
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,270
you learn how <i>w</i> adjust
to each other.

960
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,951
If I don't like the way
you do this, I can get angry,

961
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,038
or I can learn to compromise.

962
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,995
But they met as adults.

963
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,999
And had never learned
how to live with each other.

964
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,078
As things went on,
things go! more complicated,

965
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,238
and as things
got more complicated,

966
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,238
what ended up happening
was I left.

967
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,680
[David] When Bobby
left the business

968
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,918
Eddy and I felt
that we were being betrayed.

969
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,715
Bobby felt that
he was being pushed out.

970
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,314
Either way, it did major, major
damage to the relationship.

971
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,590
[Alan] I think that took
an extreme loll on Eddy

972
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,076
more sothan I think
David and Bobby.

973
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,679
Eddy was always the one

974
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,634
who just wanted to have
everybody he at peace together,

975
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,671
and Eddy was, was very
upset about it.

976
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,234
He was kind oi crushed
about it. Ii was eating at him.

977
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,120
[Brenda] He dearly loved them,

978
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,197
and he wanted his brothers
to be together.

979
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,313
He was just not really sure
how lo deal with it all.

980
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:30,709
You're just seeing a lat more
kind of up and down behaviors,

981
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,234
erratic behaviors.

982
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,118
[Mrs Shanley] 'Eddy's
growing a heard.'

983
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,958
'Fur face, that's me.'

984
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,354
[Brenda] 'Jeez, wake the child.'

985
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,358
[Mrs Shanley] 'Jamie,
your daddy is fuzzy.'

986
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,439
You're just seeing a lot more
unnatural highs and lows.

987
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,079
He would call people and...
a! bizarre hours 01 the evening,

988
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,112
and then they would say,

989
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,229
"I haven't seen or heard
from Eddy in ten years.

990
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,556
"Why is he picking up
the telephone and calling me

991
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,477
"at two o'clock
in the morning?"

992
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,399
You know, those are,
those are signs.

993
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,795
This was just...
this was more

994
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,349
than just somebody
who needed counselling.

995
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,756
This was, like, really
something very, very serious.

996
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,312
[David] He could be
unbelievably chamuing.

997
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,998
'Hello?

998
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,112
Bu! the downswing
was a lot of anger.

999
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,437
Er... there was just
deep, deep darkness.

1000
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,195
[Brenda] Manic depression

1001
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,074
I think was what
they eventually said.

1002
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,272
Il made sense in hindsight

1003
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,513
I didn't walk down the aisle

1004
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,278
thinking, you know,

1005
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,394
"I have a man who is suiferi ng
from manic depression."

1006
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,279
People will say, "How
could you not know?", but...

1007
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,438
...he was so unique
and so wonderful and special,

1008
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,477
you just... that was Eddy,
you know.

1009
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,390
I was advised that he needed
to he in a... a facility.

1010
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,755
I mean, I felt bad that
I put him through this trauma

1011
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,473
of going into a psych ward

1012
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,750
because I had been in a psych
ward and I know how hard I! is.

1013
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,839
When I was a kid, I spent my
16th birthday in a psych ward.

1014
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,119
We all were really
disturbed kids.

1015
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,232
We were all under psychiatric
care when we were teenagers.

1016
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,194
[David] We all had
very challenging

1017
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,716
and dysfunctional teenage years.

1018
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,069
Could we ask about personal.

1019
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,434
One of you were involved
in a murder,

1020
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,629
is that right?

1021
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,113
Ah, it's uptn you guys.

1022
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,116
No. No.

1023
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,514
People Magazine...

1024
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,951
One was accused of
being involved in a murder.

1025
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,558
And it was me,

1026
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,718
who never met this person
who was killed,

1027
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,752
never was present
or anything like that.

1028
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,438
Il was peer pressure.

1029
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,040
Friends pressuring me
into covering for them,

1030
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,071
telling a story for them
lathe police

1031
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,713
and that pulled me
right into it.

1032
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,558
I've never hurt anyone
in my life.

1033
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,035
We know it,
we can feel it.

1034
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,593
We can feel it.

1035
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,716
A lot of people in this study
had dysfunctional childhoods

1036
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,115
and some mental problems

1037
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,357
and it raises questions,
you know.

1038
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,518
If you are a person
who has devoted your life,

1039
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,951
like Dr Neubauer has
to the study o! menial illness,

1040
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,994
then is that a factor
that you are researching?

1041
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,679
'The story is incredible.
This is a Disney movie.'

1042
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,711
'It's a little darker
than a Disney movie.'

1043
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,913
When we first met we realized
we had all these similarities,

1044
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,349
we had similar
man nerisms,

1045
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,550
we both had
studied film.

1046
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,516
And then we also found out

1047
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,949
we both had suffered
from depression.

1048
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,119
So, this is the lefler

1049
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,596
that I received
from Louise Wise Services.

1050
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,237
"You were born at 12.51 pm
on October 919GB

1051
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,318
"to a 29-year-old Jewish
single woman.

1052
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,000
"She was very intelligent
with a high IO.

1053
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,839
"She entered college
on a merit scholarship

1054
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,510
"but emotional problems
interrupted her attendance,

1055
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,393
"She had a history
of voluntary hospitalizations

1056
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,477
"for emotional problems.

1057
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,318
"Although I have not
been able lo locate

1058
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,433
"the original medical reports,
secondary sources noted

1059
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,915
"that your mother's diagnosis
was schizophrenia."

1060
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,114
It was really disturbing
to read that my birth mother

1061
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,630
had been in and out
of institutions.

1062
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,752
I started finding out more

1063
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:25,038
about the other twins
and triplets in the study,

1064
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,594
and it turns out that
not only had many of them

1065
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,320
struggled with mental
health problems.

1066
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,240
But that their birth parents
had mental health issues.

1067
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,272
And their adoptive families
had never been told.

1068
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,194
[Interviewer] How possible is it

1069
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,756
that your mother
had mental health issues?

1070
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:51,873
Er... I don't think
they were severe.

1071
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,515
L, I think that she was, er...

1072
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:01,397
She may have had some minor,
minor issues, er...

1073
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,156
She may have had some, a little
bit more than minor issues.

1074
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,989
Were (he scientists
purposefully choosing children

1075
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,237
whose biological parents
had a mental illness,

1076
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,479
and placing them
into different homes

1077
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,912
to see, is mental illness
hereditable.

1078
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,313
[David] Eddy was in the hospital

1079
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,431
for I think
it was three weeks.

1080
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,474
And then he came back to work
at the restaurant.

1081
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,957
I wasn't there. David
was with him, all the time.

1082
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,270
I think maybe he can give you
better detail about it.

1083
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,438
I was running the kitchen.

1084
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,756
Eddy wasn't in.
I was running the kitchen,

1085
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,438
he was running
the from 01 the house.

1086
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,278
That's the way it worked.

1087
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,915
And I didn't know where he was,
and he lived across the street.

1088
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,871
[Janet] So, David called me
from the restaurant

1089
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,039
and he asked me
to look out the window

1090
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,710
to see if Eddy's car
was in the driveway,

1091
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,717
because if it were
in (he driveway,

1092
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,398
we knew that he was home.

1093
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,070
So, (he car
was in the driveway,

1094
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:37,069
and I said to David, er...

1095
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,556
"Do you want me
to go over there?"

1096
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,798
And David said, "Yes."

1097
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,433
[Clears throat]

1098
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,837
And she called me back
a few minutes later

1099
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,076
and her voice
was trembling and shaking.

1100
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,509
She said,
"You've gotta come home."

1101
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,517
And I said, "Why?"

1102
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,279
And she said, "Please,
you've just gotta come home."

1103
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,313
Er...

1104
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,237
And I, er... I pulled up
we lived across the street.

1105
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,238
Ipulled up, kind of, just...
cop cars were all there

1106
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,159
and I just kind of,
pulled up on... you know,

1107
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,476
blocking half the street,
left the door open

1108
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,670
and started running
into the house

1109
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,554
and the cops grabbed me and
they wouldn't let me come in.

1110
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,511
They said, "You don't,
you don't wanna see this.

1111
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,120
"You can't see this,
you don't wanna see this.

1112
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,720
"You, you don't wanna see this."

1113
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,673
And that's when I knew
he was gone.

1114
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,676
I told Bobby, "I need
to talk to you."

1115
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,949
And it's as if he,
he kind o! knew.

1116
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,393
He kind of knew, before
the words came out of my mouth.

1117
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,954
Eddy committed suicide.

1118
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,994
Eddy shot himself.

1119
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,516
He look his own life.

1120
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,797
I don't remember who told us.
I just remember darkness.

1121
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,359
Buried him on Father's Day,
I gave the eulogy,

1122
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,394
and I don't remember
everything I said,

1123
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,911
but I do remember saying
(ha! my brother Eddy

1124
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,952
could light up a room
with his smile.

1125
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,270
W“? Edd? wh ' I' Edd ?
why not n19? Y

1126
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,516
I've asked myself
that a hundred times.

1127
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,996
I'd rather it was me
than Eddy.

1128
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,999
I, I don't know why Eddy
and why no! me.

1129
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,429
Maybe just because...

1130
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,039
I don'! know,
I just don't know.

1131
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,232
L, I, I can't answer this.

1132
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,034
[Interviewer] Thank you, Bobby.

1133
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,151
Oh, you're welcome.

1134
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,632
[David] I'd like to know
the lruth about the experiment.

1135
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:32,154
My understanding, within
this small group of twins

1136
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,838
that were separated
and studied,

1137
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,831
(here was more
than one suicide.

1138
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,713
It's almost impossible
just to be a coincidence.

1139
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,954
Given Eddy's mental illness...

1140
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,751
...who knows
what's in their DNA.

1141
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,398
[David] If they have
anything conclusive

1142
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,876
that is in any way predicting
anything in the future

1143
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,197
that I need to know about,
I wanna know about it.

1144
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,672
[Bobby] There is still so much
that we don't know.

1145
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,876
I have more questions
than I have answers.

1146
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,717
[Wright] One v1 the things
about being a joumalisi

1147
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,479
is that you don't know
what you are gonna find out.

1148
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,955
Sometimes you know
what you didn't find out

1149
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,073
which is frustrating
like with this story.

1150
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,239
Well, I didn't get
to the bottom of it

1151
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,430
because I never got
to see the study.

1152
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,278
As no one has, you know.

1153
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,470
That would be the bottom of it.

1154
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,557
But that's why
this is so tantalizing.

1155
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,118
Here's the research
that I kept

1156
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,754
from when I was writing
about twins.

1157
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,076
It's been a while since
I've had a look at this box.

1158
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,430
Oh, this is interesting.

1159
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,356
Mini cassettes.

1160
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,519
Before he passed away I managed
to talk to Dr Neubauer.

1161
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,437
He was reluctant,

1162
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,269
he had not ever spoken about it
to my knowledge.

1163
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,880
All right, M's see
what he has to say.

1164
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,031
[Switches player on]

1165
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,391
'OK, I've got it on now.

1166
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,909
'How did (his study
come about?'

1167
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,234
[Neubauer] 'I tell you,

1168
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,079
'I would rather
not want to speak about it.'

1169
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,919
[Wright] 'Oh, really? Why?'

1170
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,349
[Neubauer] 'Until
we have published it.'

1171
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,279
[Wright] 'Oh, uh-huh.
When do you plan to publish it?'

1172
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,950
[Neubauer] 'Well, maybe,
we would publish

1173
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,958
'in about a year,
a year and a half from now.'

1174
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,718
[Wright] He was certainly
illusive,

1175
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,990
he was protecting something.

1176
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,749
'Well, tell me a little bit
about the scope of the study

1177
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,918
'and how many people
were involved in it?'

1178
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,476
[Neubauer] 'The study was only
based on a small number

1179
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,912
'of identical twins
separated at birth,

1180
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,110
'for many, many reasons.

'I don! want to talk
about that now.

01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,269
'We had to stop it because
it became too expensive.'

1183
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,119
[Wright] 'Who was
your primary support?'

1184
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,549
[Neubauer] 'Oh. some private
family foundations.

1186
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,634
'We gm some money
from Washington.'

1187
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,718
[Wright] 'OK.'

1188
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,469
Private charities and
Washington, what does (ha! mean?

1189
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,273
And I don't know where
theirfunding came from.

1190
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,674
[Wright] 'OK, (hanks again
for your time.'

1191
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,676
[Neuhauer] 'Bye!

[End of recording]

1193
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,080
[Wright] I think that there's
a great deal of sensitivity

1194
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,316
about this story.

1195
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,158
There's a lot of powerful people

1196
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,352
who would like
to have this story silenced.

1197
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,879
[Interviewer] What happened
to the study

1198
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,638
as far as you're aware?

1199
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,991
Before Neubauer died in 2008,

1200
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,316
he left
all (he research materials

1201
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,079
in an archive
at Vale University.

1202
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:29,511
Neubauer placed it under seal,
for decades and decades.

1203
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:34,031
So far as I know
nobodfs been able to access it.

1204
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,038
[David] Er...
what do we have here?

1205
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,993
Wow.

1206
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,834
This is the Vale University
website, and this appears to be

1207
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,678
the Guide to Adoption
Study Records

1208
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,075
of the Child Development Center.

1209
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,956
68 boxes filled
with information:

1210
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,392
charts, films and tapes
and research findings.

1211
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,034
Home visits, that's a big one.

1212
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:13,199
It says that the dates of the
study were from 1960 to 1980.

1213
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,076
I guess our reunion,
kind of closed the study.

1214
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,112
"Information about access.

1215
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,996
"The records are restricied
until 2065."

1216
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,718
It's sealed!

1217
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,958
So, they did
all that they did

1218
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,799
to have this whole list
tucked away

1219
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,835
in a dusty library somewhere,
where nobody can touch it.

1220
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,477
"Researchers wishing
to use these records

1221
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,874

"of Family and Children's

1224
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,393
The Jewish Board
was the parent organization

1225
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,673
of the Child Development Center
run by Peter Neubauer.

1226
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,634
My understanding is that

1227
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,877
they are a very, very
powerful organization

1228
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,709
with very deep
political connections,

Yes, hi. My name

01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,432
and apparently, I was a,
one of the subjects of a study,

1235
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,598
run by the Child Development
Center many years ago,

1236
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,359
and it's being kept
at Yale University.

1237
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,030
- [Man] Wes?'
- And on their website it says

1238
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,435
that I would need permission
from (he board

1239
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,040
in order to gain access
to those records,

1240

1241
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,870

'hut I can...'

1244
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,354
There have been
a number of journalists

1245
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,710
and as far as I know,
some of the twins

1246
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,558
that were involved
in (his study

1247
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,876
who have tried to gain access
to this material.

1248
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,834
So far as I know
they haven't been able lo see

1249
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,440
the results of this study.

1250
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,313
Is there a way that I can go
directly to someone

1251
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,397
that would he able
to provide access to me,

1252
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,750
as I was one of the subjects
within the study?

1253
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,555
If anybody should have the right
to see all this material,

1254
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,999
it's the people
that were actually

1255
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,394
the subject oi the study.

1256
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,078
They should know
what was learned.

OK, so you're the first line
of delense, so (o speak.

01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,358
- [Man] 'l guess, yeah.'
- [Both chuckle]

1262
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,756
OK, I will send an email to you.
I'll pulaflhe subject line,

1263
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,759

"Twin Studies".

1266
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,199
Peter Neubauer passed away.

1267
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,037
And yet we still
don! know exactly

1268
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,916
what they were looking for,
or what they found out.

1269
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,117
[Perlman] I'm a Clinical
Psychologist

1270
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:52,634
and I was a research assistant
on Peter Neuhauefs study.

1271
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,593
I believe I am the only person

1272
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,631
who worked
on this study

1273
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,273
who is
willing

1274
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,914
to go
on record

1275
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,394
about what
was done.

1276
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,353
I was 24.

1277
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,711
This is essentially
my first job.

1278
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:21,272
You know, you had to be careful
to not let on that, er...

1279
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,393
"Gee, you lookjust
like your, your twin brother."

1280
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,435
I would've been fired
on the spot, right?

1281
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,039
Il was a little tempting, yeah,

1282
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,593
there was, there was
a little bit of temptation.

1283
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:37,076
It's like,
"Hey, I, I know your twin.

1284
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:43,196
"I saw somebody a week ago
who was exactly like you."

1285
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,749
The question whether
I feel guilty is interesting

1286
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:54,317
because I never felt
a responsibility.

1287
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:59,270
I came on
after this was designed.

1288
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,397
However. I was a participant,

1289
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,991
so you could say I was
ethically compromised by (hat.

1290
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:12,912
In retrospect I think it was
undoubtedly ethically wrong.

1291
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,756
I got some notes here. OK.

1292
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,873
OK.

1293
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,431
[Sighs]

1294
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,280
These are my actual
original notes,

1295
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,756
copies of psychologicals
(ha! I did.

1296
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,031
[Interviewer] And who in, who in
particular are in these files?

1297
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,390
Well, I have the triplets.

1298
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,549
Hmm... Oh, here we go.

1299
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,160
I, I'm not gonna mention
the name. but, er...

1300
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,554
[Clears throat]

1301
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,477
"He's a loud, energetic boy.

1302
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,477
"His need to establish
his autonomy

1303
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,079
"takes to the form
of showing off,

1304
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,714
"both his intelligence
and his strength,

1305
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,355
"and putting clown others
including his parents."

1306
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,350
Yeah, this one's eager
to show off his new bicycle

1307
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:14,349
and all of his sports equipment
while I filmed him.

1308
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,119
He was very intense
in his play

1309
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:22,394
and got quite... rough.

1310
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,192
This kid had some problems.

1311
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,269
Hyper aggressiveness.

1312
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,435
OK, so apparently,

1313
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,834
these parents
are not cognizant

1314
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,315
of his problems,
nor are they able to help him

1315
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,873
understand his weaknesses

1316
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,470
and establish more appropriate
control over his actions.

1317
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,832
So, I didn't think the parents
were very tuned in

1318
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,520
to the struggles
this youngster was having.

1319
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,397
What were (he findings
of [he study?

1320
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:59,389
I have no idea because
I left the study after 10 months

1321
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,791
and the results
were never published,

1322
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,518
All I have is my Iiltle,
tiny piece.

1323
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,110
It's a mystery,
it's a huge loss.

1324
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,555
All this important
scientific data

1325
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,434
is just buried
in these archives.

1326
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,595
[Interviewer] So, some people
have speculated

1327
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:24,280
that the purpose of the study,
ultimate purpose,

1328
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,197
was looking at mental health.

1329
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:32,350
I... there was, there was never
a mention of mental health

1330
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,874
of the biological parents
when I was in the study.

1331
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,438
We were not interested
in mental health,

1332
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,359
that's no! what
we were interested in.

1333
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,040
We were looking
for differences in parenting.

1334
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,594
We wanted to understand
parenting practices

1335
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,075
and how it would affect
development.

1336
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,717
So, you're saying
they were interested more

1337
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,637
in the family dynamics?

1338
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,832
But they couldn't have
known that. The}; didn't know

1339
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,837
how the families
were going to interact

1340
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,235
with this newly-adopted child.

1341
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,556
The only way
they could possibly know

1342
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,836
about (he family dynamics

1343
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,999
was if they already had a child
placed in that family.

1344
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,951
[Newsreader] 'Another
astonishing coincidence

1345

01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,231
'all the girls
now 21 years old.'

1348
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,159
[Camera shutter clicks]

1349
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,477
[Perlman] The triplets,
they all had an older sibling.

1350
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,715
They were placed in families

1351
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,229
where there was an older
adopted child

1352
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,159
that had been placed with,
by Louise Wise.

1353
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,469
That was pan of the design.

1354
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,600
It's good to see you.

1355
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,790
It's good to see you.

1356
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,516
[Interviewer] I'd just like
to show you guys a clip.

1357
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,713
It's Lawrence Perlman, who was
a Researcher on the study.

1358
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,509
[Perlman] 'What were
the findings of the study?

1359
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,509
'I have no idea because
they were never published.

1360
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,791
'We were looking
for differences in parenting.

1361
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,073
'We wanted to understand
parenting practices

1362
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,872
'and how it would affect
development.

1363
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,275
'The triplets
were placed in families

1364
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,960
'where (here was an older
adopted child

1365
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,959
'that had been placed with,
by Louise Wise.

1366
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,870
'Thai was pan of the design.'

1367
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,957
[Interviewer] How do you feel
watching that?

1368
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,994
- [Sniggers]
- Like a lab rat.

1369
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,070
It, it only just makes it
that much... it just only...

1370
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,440
ll just makes it...

1371
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,199
- That much worse.
- ...much more duplicitous.

1372
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,275
Er...

1373
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,799
They're not just
studying the kids,

1374
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,037
but they're studying
(he parents.

1375
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,950
So, they did in fact know the
parenting style of each parent.

1376
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,274
So, this was not, you know...

1377
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,358
Obviously it was far
from a random selection.

1378
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:32,354
They knew exactly
who (hey had chosen

1379
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:38,237
lo place each one of us with
when they called the Gallands,

1380
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,989
and the Kellmans,
and the Shafrans.

1381
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,913
In terms of how
they parented their children

1382
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,553
(he three families

1383
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,160
were quite,
quite diflerenl.

1384
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,918
Er...

1385
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,759
David's father stood out.

1386
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,474
There was nobody in the world
like his son.

1387
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:12,476
He was so proud of him.
Whatever he did was wonderful.

1388
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:18,630
Bobby's father
was very busy as a doctor

1389
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,516
and didn't have the time
to he with Bobby

1390
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,676
that David's father had,

1391
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,395
but was as devoted to him
as possible.

1392
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,193
The most traditional
was Eddy's father...

1393
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:40,637
...who was rather strict.
He was (he boss.

1394
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,758
He made the rules and Eddy
was supposed to follow.

1395
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,635
Eddy's relationship
with his father...

1396
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,279
...il couldn't have been good.

1397
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,475
And that mailers.

1398
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,672
[Interviewer] And why do you
say it couldn't have been good?

1399
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:10,476
Because otherwise,
I would have known him,

1400
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,874
we would have seen him,

1401
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,316
Eddy would have talked
about him.

1402
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,278
This was the last picture
we ever had of Edward.

1403
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,470
He was very gregarious.

1404
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,353
He got into all the things
young hays do.

1405
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,596
He wrecked a car

1406
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,599
and a few things
like that, but...

1407
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:48,476
I mean, occasionally
ldisciplined him.

1408
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,230
[Brenda] Eddy and his dad
were very different as people.

1409
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,673
Eddy was more artsy, kinda kid,
you know, he wasn't into sports.

1410
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,838
Elliott had a very
strong militaristic

1411
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,157
kind oi approach to life,
very traditional.

1412
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,760
He was a teacher,
he was all about punctuality.

1413
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,960
I was a strict disciplinarian,

1414
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,312
and my children
unfortunately

1415
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,119
had me as a strict
disciplinarian too.

1416
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,511
[Brenda] Eddy said he always
sort of didn't feel

1417
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,713
like he fit in with his family.

1418
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,797
He always felt like, like
he wasn't in the right place.

1419
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,797
[Interviewer] How much
did you have any sense

1420
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:48,356
that Edward was unhappy?

1421
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,916
He didn't discuss
his problems with me.

1422
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,994
We were a rather quiet family.

1423
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:05,035
We didn't tell our problems
to one another.

1424
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:11,831
We protected each other.
ll was a nice family.

1425
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,232
Some people
are just no! a good fit.

1426
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,517
It wasn't his father's fault.

1427
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,636
Elliot did what he believed
to be best as a parent.

1428
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,877
They were just different people.

1429
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,040
I got the phone call from...
I believe it was Bobby.

1430
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:47,233
And he told me to sit down

1431
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,238
and I said no need to.

1432
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,557
And he told me about it.

1433
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,800
And then standing right there

1434
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,151
I went over to my wife

1435
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:07,070
and told her Edward
had committed suicide.

1436
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,115
And we stood there
for quite a while, crying.

1437
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:23,035
And... that was it.

1438
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:40,150
I often wondered whether
I didn't teach him something...

1439
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,236
"because of the way he left.

1440
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,040
I don't know.

1441
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,391
Maybe I didn't teach him
something,

1442
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,831
how to live life or something.

1443
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,430
Thai bothers me occasionally.

1444
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:14,590
[Ellen] Why did the boys' lives
turn out completely different?

1445
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,119
I don't need to read any hooks,

1446
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,515
I don't need to read
any studies.

1447
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,073
I saw I! first hand
with those three boys.

1448
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,351
It's all about nurture.

1449
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,519
[Audience applauds]

1450
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,914
'These three young men

1451
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,679
'they are all seated
in the same position.'

1452
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,949
[Audience laughing]

1453
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,559
[Schneider] We found
a lot of similariiies

1454
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,240
because that's what people
were looking for.

1455
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,873
They smoke the same
kind 01 cigarettes.

1456
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,194
You say, "Oh my God,

1457
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,800
'They're smoking Marlboros,
that's amazing.'

1458
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,229
What you're not looking for
are their differences.

1459
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,237
'I can't get over it,
I'm telling you.

1460
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,714
'You all wrestled
at one time?'

1461
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,830
[Triplets] 'Yes.'

1462
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,753
We found the ways
(ha! we were alike

1463
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,196
and we emphasized them
and we wanted to he alike.

1464
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,673
We were falling in love
with each other.

1465
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:20,236
[Brenda] I think there
were superficialities.

1466
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,274
They liked the same things
and they had similar interests,

1467
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,199
but deep down
they were different.

1468
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,954
They were not a case study
of biology being destiny.

1469
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,719
I've come to believe
genes and the environment

1470
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,230
are close competitors.

1471
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,718
You could say that we drift
in (he direction

1472
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,719
that our genes (ell us to go

1473
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,400
but it doesn't mean
you are destined

1474
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:01,432
to be one person or another.

1475
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,318
[David] I believe
that I'm still here today

1476
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,758
because of (he foundation that
was given to me by my parents.

1477
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,317
I believe that absolutely
made a difference

1478
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,237
in terms of snuggling

1479
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,112
with whatever demons
I struggle with.

1480
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:31,351
[Hedy] I believe nature
and nurture both matter.

1481
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:38,989
Bu! I think nurture
can overcome nearly everything.

1482
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,673
Because the sludy's
never been published

1483
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,677
we simply don't know
definitively

1484
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,038
how many people's lives
were separated in this fashion.

1485
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,639
There may still be twins
out there

1486
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,433
who still don'! know
(hey are twins.

1487
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,719
There are probably
at least four individuals

1488
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,036
who were subjects
of (his study

1489
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,869
who don't know
that they have a twin.

1490
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,231
If they know that there
are still twins out there

1491
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:46,593
that are missing out on life,
it boggles the mind.

1492
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,756
There's two ways
of thinking about it.

1493
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,077
These people really should know
(ha! there is a twin,

1494
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,589
or, "Oh my God, these people
should not know

1495
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,032
"that they were used this way,
that will make them so upset."

1496
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:03,199
Maybe this is why the study
cannot be published as yet,

1497
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,390
until they're gone.

1498
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,790
Il really opens up
the possibility.

1499
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,956
Anybody can just
walk around the comer

1500
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,675
and discover that you
have a twin out there.
