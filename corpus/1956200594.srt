00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:50,422
I look forward to the
opportunity to tell my story.

890
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,890
Well, the DA alleges that
you performed abortions

891
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:57,361
past the legal limit.

892
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:01,633
I was a close friend of
George Tiller, you know.

893
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm sorry?

894
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:06,035
He was a sweet, gentle man.

895
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:07,736
A martyr, really.

896
00:46:07,738 --> 00:46:10,841
But they said that he
performed late abortions too,

897
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:15,646
and for that, he was struck
down by an assassin's bullet.

898
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:22,685
Well, to get back
on point, Dr. Gosnell,

899
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:26,990
let's say a woman came
to you, desperate,

900
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,825
past the 24-week limit.

901
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,794
Would you be inclined
to give her an abortion?

902
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:33,162
Yes.

903
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:36,064
I've asked myself what
if your own daughter

904
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:37,667
were in this situation?

905
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,870
Would you want her to have
access to an abortion?

906
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:43,975
To not have her life
changed forever by a baby?

907
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,109
I looked at all
the women I treated

908
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:49,013
as if they were my own daughter.

909
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,080
Many of the files
in your office

910
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:54,817
you had written 24.5 weeks.

911
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:56,718
Are you aware that 24.5 weeks

912
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,754
is past the legal
limit for abortion?

913
00:46:58,756 --> 00:47:03,392
(CHUCKLES) I suppose I
assumed as in mathematics,

914
00:47:03,394 --> 00:47:06,664
that the number would be
rounded down to 24 (LAUGHS).

915
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:10,732
(CHUCKLES) Well, actually,
in mathematics that number

916
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:12,535
would be rounded up,
but are you saying

917
00:47:12,537 --> 00:47:15,004
that that number
was an estimation

918
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,173
and not a scientifically
deduced fact?

919
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:19,676
If you read the law, it states

920
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:23,645
that the measure of viability
is up to the physician.

921
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,852
So, if I assessed that it is
of a lower gestational age,

922
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:30,854
then that's what rules today.

923
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:33,388
So your interpretation
of the law

924
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,125
is that whatever you
decide to write down

925
00:47:36,127 --> 00:47:37,459
should be accepted.

926
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:38,329
Yes.

927
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:44,133
You kept the feet of
aborted babies in jars.

928
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:45,633
Why?

929
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:50,272
It's often necessary
to preserve the DNA

930
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:52,142
for later identification.

931
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:54,276
It's customary for
physicians to preserve

932
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:57,113
a small sample, but
not a whole foot.

933
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:59,117
See, these are
scientific matters.

934
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:02,151
I can't expect a
layman to understand

935
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:05,122
the complex nature
of my research.

936
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:08,357
Is it true that you
allowed your unlicensed

937
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,127
and untrained staff to
administer anesthesia

938
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:14,629
and even to perform medical
procedures in your absence?

939
00:48:14,631 --> 00:48:16,799
They were properly trained.

I trained 'em myself.

941
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:19,801
But you are aware
that there are laws

942
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:23,772
governing the licensing and
training of medical personnel?

943
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:25,309
These laws.

944
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:27,343
They've always struck me

945
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:29,948
as being politically motivated.

946
00:48:30,848 --> 00:48:33,682
The enemies of
abortion erected them

947
00:48:33,684 --> 00:48:38,256
to create barriers between
women and my services.

948
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:42,461
I have no respect for
these laws whatsoever.

959
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:14,756
We were told not
to do any inspections

960
00:49:14,758 --> 00:49:16,892
unless we received complaints.

961
00:49:16,894 --> 00:49:19,763
And you received no
complaints about Gosnell?

962
00:49:28,506 --> 00:49:30,341
Can you tell me what these are?

963
00:49:32,176 --> 00:49:33,341
I'll tell you what they are.

964

They're complaints.

965
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:36,414
Why didn't you do an inspection?

966
00:49:37,147 --> 00:49:39,015
We had instructions directly

967

from Governor Ridge's office

968
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,984

00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:53,495
I believe so, yes.

975
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,798
Is it true the DOH
requires nail salons

976
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,801
to be inspected at
least once a year?

977
00:49:58,803 --> 00:50:00,002
Yes.

If someone had
died at a nail salon,

979
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:03,973
would you have
inspected it then?

I mean, to hear the
Commonwealth talk,

1065
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:16,584
you'd think people
were just dropping dead

1066
00:55:16,586 --> 00:55:18,654
right in front of
that clinic every day,

1067
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,890
the corpses just piling
up on the sidewalk,

1068
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:23,325
right there in front of
3801 Lancaster Avenue.

1069
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:27,462
But no, this man's clinic has
been in operation for years,

1070
00:55:27,464 --> 00:55:29,566
in '78, '79, '80, '81,

1071
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:31,970
'82, '83, '84.

1072
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:35,537
Year after year after
year of this man

1073
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:38,341
successfully treating his
patients and giving them

1074
00:55:38,343 --> 00:55:40,042
the services they requested.

1075
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:41,410
Some of them even coming back

1076
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,145
for a third or fourth procedure.

1077
00:55:43,147 --> 00:55:46,618
Why would they come back if
this man was such a monster?

1078
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,020
The Commonwealth
wants to tell you

1079
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:53,488
that this is not a
case about abortion.

1080
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,823
(LAUGHS)

1081
00:55:54,825 --> 00:55:57,292
This absolutely is a
case about abortion,

1082
00:55:57,294 --> 00:55:58,362
ladies and gentlemen.

1083
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:02,830
And if you stay true to your
oath and you look at the facts,

1084
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:04,200
you will see what I see.

1085
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,837
An overly zealous
Catholic investigator

1086
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,307
in a police department
dominated by Catholicism

1087
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:15,044
and a targeted, racist,
prosecutorial lynching

1088
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:17,946
of a man who has done nothing
but serve the citizens

1089
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:21,015
of West Philadelphia for
decades in neighborhoods

1090
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:22,952
they wouldn't even set foot in.

1091

he convinced me.

gonna play this?

1096
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:37,165

religion into this, really?

1097
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,299
- Woody, back off!
- Is that you

1098
00:56:38,301 --> 00:56:39,368
wanna make this about,

1099
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,502
- you asshole?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1100
00:56:40,504 --> 00:56:41,870
- Do you?
- Stop it!

1101
00:56:41,872 --> 00:56:43,138
Woody, hey, calm
down, all right?

1102
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,406
Hey, keep your mouth
quiet, all right?

1103

1104

he was arrested,

1107

Dr. Gosnell told

1108
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,116
he will be fully vindicated.

(SOMBER MUSIC)

1110
00:56:55,385 --> 00:56:57,017
I hadn't been aware
of how hard I'd been

1111
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:58,687
working until I got
a couple of days off.

1112
00:56:58,689 --> 00:57:00,589
(LAUGHS)

1113
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:03,357
My feeling is that if
you're not making mistakes,

1114
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,164
then you're not really attempting
to do anything of value.

1115
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:10,098
So I think my patients are aware

1116
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,169
that I'm doing my
very best by them.

1117
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,506
I provide the standard of care

1118
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,178
for them that I would
want for my own daughter.

NEWS REPORTER: Dr. Gosnell's
considered by authorities

1120
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:26,013
to be a flight risk.

1121
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,649
Currently, he's being
held without bail

1122
00:57:27,651 --> 00:57:29,654
in the Philadelphia County Jail.

1123
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:32,854
Dr. North, can
you tell the jury

1124
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:35,089
why you decided
to testify today?

1125
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:37,392
I didn't want anyone to
think that Dr. Gosnell's clinic

1126
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:40,261
represents what women's
clinics are really like.

1127
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:43,031
Do you ever
perform non-emergency

1128
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:45,466
pregnancy terminations
after 24 weeks?

1129
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:47,002
No, never.

1130
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:49,004
Always we stop at 20 weeks.

1131
00:57:49,006 --> 00:57:52,174
Do you reuse instruments
on different patients

1132
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:53,676
that haven't been sterilized?

1133
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,979
No, never.

1134
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,779
Do you ever allow
untrained personnel

1135
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:01,716
to say, administer anesthesia?

1136
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:03,084
No.

1137
00:58:03,086 --> 00:58:05,287
Everyone in our office
is a registered nurse

1138
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:07,892
and I administer the
anesthesia myself.

1139
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:14,798
Dr. North, have you ever cut
a baby's spine with scissors?

1140
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:18,167
No, we would not do that.

1141
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:19,901
Do you know any
doctor that would?

1142
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:20,937
No, I do not.

1143
00:58:21,906 --> 00:58:23,441
Thank you, no
further questions.

1144
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,211
MIKE: Dr. North,
how many abortions

1145
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:32,046
would you say you've
performed in your career?

1146
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:34,851
I have performed
over 30,000 abortions.

1147
00:58:35,653 --> 00:58:36,486
Wow.

1148
00:58:37,687 --> 00:58:41,223
In the second trimester, what
method of abortion do you use?

1149
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:44,158
Mostly D&E, dilation
and evacuation.

1150
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,060
Yes.

1151
00:58:45,062 --> 00:58:47,029
Dilation is where you soften

1152
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:50,131
and widen the woman's
cervix, correct?

1153
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:51,700
That is correct.

1154
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:53,401
Once the fetus grows
larger, it's very important

1155
00:58:53,403 --> 00:58:55,837
that we do that to
prevent the cervix

1156
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:58,207
from tearing as the
fetus is removed.

1157
00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:00,843
And then you
evacuate the fetus.

1158
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:02,678
You remove it from the womb.

1159
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,279
Yes.

1160
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:06,548
But first, we have to make sure
that it's not a live birth.

1161
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:09,951
Oh, of course, of
course, how do you do that?

1162
00:59:09,953 --> 00:59:11,787
Well, we inject
potassium chloride

1163
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:14,223
into the heart of the fetus.

1164
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:15,059
Hmm.

1165
00:59:17,995 --> 00:59:20,064
With one of these, correct?

1166
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:22,966
Yes.

1167
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:28,535
Your Honor, I'd like to
introduce defense exhibit 1A

1168
00:59:28,537 --> 00:59:29,404
on the screen.

1169
00:59:29,406 --> 00:59:30,138
May I publish?

1170
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,274
You may publish.

1171
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:39,450
Now, this is a sonogram
of a 23-week-old fetus.

1172
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,283
And so when you
inject the fetus,

1173
00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:44,553
do you put the needle here?

1174
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:45,423
No.

1175
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:48,557
Here?

1176
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,723
Yes.

1177
00:59:49,725 --> 00:59:50,794
Right there.

1178
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:53,162
And that stops the heart.

1179
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:54,232
That's correct.

1180
00:59:56,732 --> 00:59:58,836
And then you use forceps.

1181
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:04,372
You use these and
you reach up in there

1182
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:08,377
and you grab ahold
of an arm or a leg

1183
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:10,278
or whatever and you pull on it

1184
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,515
until it comes out or
comes off, correct?

1185
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:15,850
That's correct.

1186
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:18,486
But with larger fetuses,
they remain intact.

1187
01:00:18,488 --> 01:00:20,756
Of course, because
the head's bigger.

1188
01:00:20,758 --> 01:00:22,890
Makes it more difficult.

1189
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,493
What do you do then?

1190
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,162
We use a machine to
suction out the gray matter.

1191
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:29,430
The gray matter, the brains.

1192
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:32,700
So, you suction out the
brains and then what happens?

1193
01:00:32,702 --> 01:00:36,671
Then the skull collapses
and the fetus can be removed.

1194
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:37,541
Right.

1195
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:42,644
Now, isn't it true
that sometimes,

1196
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:45,513
in order to get the suction
machine into the fetus,

1197
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:47,214
you have to use a
pair of scissors

1198
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:49,854
to make a hole in
the back of the neck?

1199
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,988
Sometimes this happens, yes.

1200
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,557
So before, when you said
that you'd never cut the neck

1201
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:56,926
of a fetus...

1202
01:00:56,928 --> 01:00:58,325
I was referring
to a live birth.

1203
01:00:58,327 --> 01:00:59,227
Oh.

1204
01:00:59,229 --> 01:01:01,231
Oh, okay, yeah, I get it now.

1205
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,667
Have you ever had a live birth

1206
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:06,267
during an abortion
attempt, doctor?

1207
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,337
No, I have not,
because we listen

1208
01:01:08,339 --> 01:01:11,973
to the sonogram to ensure that
the fetal heart has stopped.

1209
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:13,408
Well, what if
you made a mistake?

1210
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:14,209
We don't.

1211
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:15,642

1214
01:01:18,915 --> 01:01:20,948
I'd like to have her opinion.

1215
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,783
Overruled.

1216
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,086
I'm going to allow the question,

1217
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,022
but stay on point, counselor.

1218
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,156
What would you do
if the baby was out

1219
01:01:29,158 --> 01:01:30,528
and it was breathing?

1220
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:35,796
We would issue comfort care.

1221
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:37,232
Comfort care.

1222
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:39,103
Can you define that for us?

1223
01:01:40,236 --> 01:01:43,441
That's keeping the fetus
warm and comfortable.

1224
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,609
Eventually, it will pass.

1225
01:01:46,776 --> 01:01:49,079
Eventually, it would pass.

1226
01:01:53,182 --> 01:01:54,484
So basically, you'd,

1227
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,356
you'd let it die.

1228
01:02:05,428 --> 01:02:06,962
Seems like it'd be more humane

1229
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,162
to just take a
pair of scissors...
