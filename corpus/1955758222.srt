Ja, ja, I agree.

163
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,279
And that is why she's been sent to me...

164
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,079
to be a test of my, of my patience...

165
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,499
and my generosity.

166
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,879
<font color=#ff00ff>[Exhales]</font> She wants to learn our way.

167
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,400
And God has asked me... to show her.

168
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,680

That is Zeke's way. When he
gets nervous, he passes out.

172
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,320
Nothing to be concerned
about. Just give him a nudge.

173

<font color=#ff00ff>- [Dog Barking]</font>

174
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, my name's Havana. And you're?

175
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,940
Oh, I get it, you have no name.

176
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,339
Okay. All right. Well... actually I'm fine.

177
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,180
- Thank you for asking.
- I presume you're Havana.

178
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,340
Then you presume right on.

179
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,099
I'm Uncle Wilhelm. I'm the head of the Colony.

180
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,820
- Welcome to our family, Havana.
- Thanks. It's...

181
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,160
Uncle Wilhelm, I see you met Havana.

182
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,319
- Yes, we met, and it was a beautiful
moment had by all.             - Good.

183
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,080
<font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font> Colony life will be difficult at first...

184
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,640
but it will be easier if you live it for God's sake.

185
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,640
There is a lot for her to learn, Uncle
Wilhelm. It'll take a little time.

186
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,480
We are pleased that you have
decided to marry Peter...

187
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,159
- and join our simple way of life.
- He is?

188
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
- She makes a fine breeder for us.
- Oh.

189
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,079
<font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font> Thank you.

190
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,800
- Sorry, I... I have to work now.
- Okay.

191
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,560
You can breed this!

192
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,759
Havana, the rules of the Colony are very
strict. I had to think of something.

193
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,859
Some way that the elders would let
you stay 'til I think of a plan...

194
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,639
Plan? Is that what you call getting married;
figuring out a plan? What am I, a yo-yo?

195
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,319
- Shh.
- I'm getting whiplash. I have a plan.

196
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,200
And my plan is to go to Hollywood, lose
you forever. That is what I call a plan.

197
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,999
- Don't go screwing with my plan.
- We'd only be married a few weeks.

with your performance in New Orleans.

You're goin' out to pick up a robbery suspect.

202
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,520
Would you do me the courtesy
of checking the manual?

203
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,900
Look under "appropriate use of Bureau
personnel" before you send a 30-year veteran

204
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,720
- to do the job of a green-ass kid.
- Markowski, listen to me.

205
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,939
Your credibility is suspect; you are not
in New Orleans; you are not undercover;

206
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,819
you are in Iowa and you are working for me.

207
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,899
And the manual says that I...

208
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,300
get to tell you what to do.

209
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,140

Man, I used to be proud to be an American.

211
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,220
You're going to Canada to bring back
Peter Jakobson, his accomplice...

212
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,220
and... the money.

213

to sew the dress for the wedding.

- All right, look.

then at least I am designing it, okay?

This is what I want. I want a sweetheart
collar coming from a tight bodice.

- Two slits up the front.
- Oh, ja, ja.

that goodness, kindness...

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,160
- Wait. What?
- What did she say?

317
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,560
Yeah, what did I say? "The wife
of the dead shall not marry...

318
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,319
"unto a stranger.

319
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Her husband's brother shall go in
unto her and take her to him to wife"?

320
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,260
I don't know, what is this book?
Is this a comedy or something?

321
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,580
Uncle Wilhelm, I think maybe I should read
'cause she must be getting this wrong.

322
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,539
No, no, no, no, she's not
incorrect, nor the word of our Lord.

323
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:59,379
Havana, Ezekiel has an obligation
by our law to ask you... to marry him.

324
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,180
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Chuckles]</font>
- But there's no cause for alarm.

325
00:27:01,181 --> 00:27:05,259
You will simply refuse him and that will be that.

326
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,579
- What will be what?
- Well... you have to leave.

327
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,419
- What do you mean I have to leave?
- Here. $100.

328
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,820
- We'll drive you to the bus stop. It'll take
you to the city.       - You can't just kick me out.

329
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,619
Nobody wants to kick you
out, but we have no choice.

330
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,519
As an outsider, you are
not allowed to remain here.

331

I know this seems harsh, but it is the best.

The Hutterite way of life,
Havana, is not for you.

333
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
- So I have to leave now with this $100?
- I'm sorry.

334
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,559
Ezekiel Jakobson, it falls to you to perform
the duty of the brother-in-law. Ask her.

335
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,519
Let us get this done with.

336
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
But, Uncle Wilhelm, I'm only
12 years old. I still hate girls.

337
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:52,240
- I-I'd much prefer a frog...
- Don't disgrace yourself in the eyes of God!

338
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,960
- Ask her, please.
- But I'd make a bad husband.

339
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,360
- Don't make me do this.
- You must, child!

340
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,880
It's the Lord's rules. You must please Him.

- Do you wanna... <font color=#ff00ff>[Panting]</font>

Guys, <font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font> I admit...

351
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,700
this is one goofy twist on
the whole boy-girl thing...

352
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,660
but let's not throw the baby
out with the bathwater, okay?

353
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,939
<font color=#ff00ff>[Chuckles]</font> If you would have told me
out on the street that the Bible...

354
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,779
is the happening book that I now think it is,
you could've knocked me over with a feather.

355
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,579
<font color=#ff00ff>[Giggles]</font> But, guys, I have seen the light.

356
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,639
I have been saved. So, if the only
way I could stick around here...

357
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,240
and soak up more of this religion stuff
is to get hitched to the little midget...

358
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,239
then... count me in, honey.

359
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,480

but that little fainting trick has got to go.

362

- How can we allow this?
- It's not our place to challenge the Lord!

363
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,299
But he is a child!

364
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,639
We do not believe that our brother colonies
would be so literal to the written word.

365
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,839
- We will be ridiculed!
- This is correct!

366
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,159
- None of them will believe us!
- No one will.

367
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,120
- There must be something.
- The Bible doesn't say anything about children!

368

- We must not do this!

Looks American.

473
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,140
I guess Peter must've dropped it.

474
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,419
Hey, this isn't fair, you doing all my chores.

475
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,160
Why don't you come inside and
take a rest and I'll take over.

476
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,120

- Positive.

giving the rest of that money to me!

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,659
Where's the rest of it? I want
my money and I want it now!

489
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,180
I'm your husband. Uncle Wilhelm
said you are to do as I tell you!

490

Who's gonna make me? You? You're
gonna make me, all 60 pounds of you?

491
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,479
If you don't start behaving like a proper
wife, I'm feeding all that money to the hogs!

Come here! Come back here!

I will give you the money.

You're never going to get this...

- Money!

Listen, you let me take the heat on

If I tell him I am a lousy wife

he will cut us both a little slack.

Ooh. Um, I think you should
lighten up a little bit, you know.

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,239

577
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,639
I thought he believed in
the things I believed in.

578
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,520
He spoke all the time of
honesty and virtues and God.

579

What does God think? <font color=#ff00ff>[Sobbing]</font>

Disgraced by the shame of greed and lust.

583
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:44,740
The money should be burned.

584
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,160
Burned?

585
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,580
- It certainly should be.
- We must all agree.

586
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,619
Excuse me.

587
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,840
I agree the money is tainted, but
tainted or not, it is not ours to burn.

Yeah. Yes.

that which was deceitfully gotten.

<font color=#ff00ff>[Sighs]</font>

594
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,419
Since Peter was my brother and he
carried both my name and my blood...

595
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,199
I think that I should be
the one to return the money.

596
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,579
But, Ezekiel, you are not your brother's keeper.

597
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,199
Yes, but I am the keeper of the shame
that Peter brings to my family...

598
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,200
and to the entire Colony
with his sinful thievery.

599
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,880
But, Ezekiel, a job like this is... is for a man.

600
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,480
How can I be a husband
without first being a man?

601
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,280
Yes.

602
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,919
Yes. This I cannot argue.

603
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,759
And as your wife, I'll help
you in every way I can.

604
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,240
I'll make sure you get there. <font color=#ff00ff>[Sniffles]</font>

605

God be with you, Ezekiel.

606
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,359
Inside are your birth certificate,
farmer's driving permit...

607
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,860
marriage license for the border crossing...

608
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,360
and $300.

609
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,920
- That's a lot of money, Uncle Wilhelm.
- We'll bring back any extra.

610
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,020
Here.

611
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,920
Listen to God.

612
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,880
- And return with God.
- I will, Mother.

613
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,440
Okay, now, when they ask you
why we're going to the States...

614
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,319
- what are you gonna say?
- We're going to return stolen money.

615
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,339
- That's an excellent answer.
- Thank you. I thought so too.

616

- It's excellent if you want to go to jail.
- What?

617
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,839
You say that, they're gonna
figure you were in on the robbery.

618
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,440
The first thing that they're
gonna do is burn your little hat.

619
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:08,279
And the second thing they're
gonna do is take your Bible away.

620
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,499
And the third thing is the worst thing.

621
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,280
- What?
- Rats. Rats in your face.

622
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,880
Rats all night long, back and forth.

623
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,400
They seem to like faces more than
anything. They're bred that way.

624
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,420
They're called... face rats.

625
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,760
- Face rats?
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,260
So we're gonna have to lie a little teeny bit.

627
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,620
Oh, I don't like to lie.

628
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,060
You like your face to be eaten by rats?

629
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,140
<font color=#ff00ff>[Sighs]</font> Okay. What do I have to say?

630
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,180

Where'd the lovebirds go?

675
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,380
They've gone into America
to return the money.

- No, it's safe.

- No.

Definitely not, padre. Hell,

there was a soft bed it'd be all right.

I know exactly what you mean.

Beforehand, they treat you like a king.

718
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,060
After you make that big mistake,
they treat you like a dog.

719

All the time, they're just
interested in one thing.

720

You know what that one thing is, don't you?

721

- The money.
- Damn straight!

just comes up pretty short.

797
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,800
- Something like that.
- Well, I'll be damned! She married a kid!

798
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,960
Yeah. It takes all kinds.

799
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,440
Okay, here you go.

800
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,879
Wir batten Dich, Herr Gott Himmlischer
vater segne diese deine Gaben.

801
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,739
Die wir von Deiner reichen milden Hand.

802
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,199

Durch. Jesum Christem. Amen

803
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,520
- Amen.
<font color=#FF551>- WOMAN:</font> Amen.

804
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,239
<font color=#ff00ff>[Whispering]</font> I was thinking.
We could split the money.

805
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,760
What would I do with money?

806
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,800
Just think about this. Okay?

807
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,800
We could go away somewhere for a
week just like two pals hanging out.

808
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,020
Then, after that, I'd make sure
you'd get home safe and sound.

809
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,879
- But what about returning the money?
- Zeke!

810
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,500
The fair doesn't need that money. They
make more money than that every day.

811
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,959
Nobody will ever know.

812
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,540
It'll be like our little secret.

813
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,139
- Deal?
- We cannot do that.

814
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,620
- Zeke!
- "Lead me not into temptation."

815
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,879
- Don't you want more?
- More ice cream?

816
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,979
More everything!

817
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,519
I have everything.

818
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,200
Don't you want to do something that
would make you important, famous?

819
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,199
Wouldn't you want the whole
world to know who you are?

820
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,400
Well, God knows who I am.

821
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,220
And I know who God is.

822
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,100
And God knows the world.

823
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,879
So it's kinda like I know the world, right?

824
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,340
And that's enough for you?

825
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,159
Ja... with a lot left over.

826
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,920
Um...

827
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,439
Fine. I'm going to the bathroom.

828
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,400
Look! It's a helicopter.

829
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,600
Excuse me. Miss?

830
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,840
You know that little boy? Can you
make sure he gets to the bus station?

831
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,000
Give him a piece of pie and in here
are exact directions where he's going.

832
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,440
If he faints, give him a little
nudge. He'll pop up like a turnover.

833
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,280
Don't screw it up.

834
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,160

845
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,899
- She deserted me.
- Oh.

846

That's a nasty habit. Why don't we go find her?

Zeke, hold on!

862

No! You make me sick.

870
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:21,140
- Get in the truck.
- I am not going anywhere with you!

871
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,059
I'm not going to sit around here
and argue with you about this.

872
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,180
Just go away!

873
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,979
- Come here.
- What are you... Hey!

874
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,780
- You put me down!
- Do what I tell you.

875
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:37,739
You're trying to get us killed. Get in.

876
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,739
- I'm your husband! You have to...
- Get in the truck!

877

- Get in. Get down! Get down.
- What? What are you doing?

878
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,820
Now!

879
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,080
Go get the money.

880
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,300
Come on!

881
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,720
Come on!

882
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,259
Where are you taking me?

883
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,820
To the state fair. To get you and this
money out of my life once and for all.

884
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,300
Been nothing but a nightmare.
First we ditch this truck.

885
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:02,179
- Why?             - Because the F.B.I. Is
on us. We don't have time to drive.

886
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,960
- We're gonna have to fly.
- Doesn't it cost a lot of money?

887
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,319
- Who cares? We've got it.
- That is not our money! We will take a bus.

888
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,559
You are so cheap!

889
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,680
- I do not do buses.
- I do not do planes!

brother was a bad person?

894
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,840
No.

895
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,239
- I just think that he didn't know how to listen.
- To what?

896
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,519
To that little voice inside that
tells you what's okay and what's not.

897
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,759
Do you hear it?

898
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,840
Sometimes.

899
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,699
It's getting pretty hazy.

900
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:17,160
It better start coming clearer
'cause this deal is getting tiring.

901
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,680
- You want to go to sleep?
- No, I don't mean tired like that.

902
01:13:21,681 --> 01:13:26,460
I mean, tired like I'm sick
of pretending all the time.

903
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,400
Here, put this on.

904
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,239
What do you pretend about?

905
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,839
Well, for one thing, my
name isn't really Havana.

906
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,700
It's not? No?

907
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,500
It's Betsy... Betsy Iggits.

908
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,559
I thought Havana sounded
better: More glam, more with it.

909
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,159
Kinda one of those one-name things
like Madonna and Cher... Marilyn.

910
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,339
Who's Marilyn?

911
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,180
Who's Marilyn? Marilyn Monroe?

912
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,900
- Only my hero.
- Why?

913
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,520
Zeke, she was beautiful.

914
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:23,660
She had fabulous houses and boats and men
and cars and furs and jewels and clothes.

915
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,339
- And everything a girl could want.
- She had a nice family too?

916
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,560
Well, that part didn't work out so good.

917
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,059
But you said that she had everything.

918
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:37,219
And if she didn't have a nice family...

919
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,399
it sounds like she had nothing.

920
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,980
It does kinda sound like that, huh?

921
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:50,200
I have a nice family. Do you?

922
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,239
I don't know. I guess they're nice.
I don't really think about them.

923
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,720
You don't think about your family all the time?

924
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,419
No! That's why I left home.

925
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:05,460
That's why I left Milwaukee, so I wouldn't
have to think about them or Milwaukee.

926
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,500
Is that what that Marilyn girl told you to do?

927
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,579
'Cause if so, she's wrong
and you should tell her...

928
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:17,580
that she should go back home and see her
family before she doesn't have any left.

929
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,679
Okay, Zeke, I told you I'd get you
to the state fair and I have, so...

930
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:40,320
- If they catch me they're gonna arrest me.
- No, they won't.

931
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,059
You don't understand. I helped
Peter with that robbery.

932
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,460
You did?

933
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,579
It's a crime. I'll go to jail.

934
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,179
Remember... face rats? Not my
idea of a good time, either.

935
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,480
No! Not a face rat will touch you.

936
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,279
I promise, I won't let anybody take you to jail.

937
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,440
Zeke, this is where I get off.

938
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:06,139
Go down that street and at the
very end there's a white building.

939
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,059
Go in there, ask for the manager's office.

940
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,200
Tell them you want to return the money.

941
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,539
Will you wait here?

942
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:15,420
No.

943
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,560
I think we should say good-bye now.

944
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,239
I'll pray for you.

945
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,060

947
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,199

01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,960
- Help me! Help me!
- F.B.I.

962
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,059
- Call security!
- Gimme the bag!

963
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,840
Get the hell outta here! Ow!

964
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,780
Run, Zeke!

965
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,679
Roger, I heard it. Someone calling
for security in area seven.

966
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,840
- It may be Havana. If you see her,
lock her up.              - Copy that.

967
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,880
Kid, come on, slow down!

968
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,820
Come on, somebody help me.

969
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:46,979
- Who the heck are you?
- F.B.I.  F.B.I.

970
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,340
I don't care who you are. You
better get out from under that bull.

971
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,580
- Come on...
<font color=#FF551>- MARKOWSKI:</font> Stop that kid!

972
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,360
Yah! Yah!

973
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,300
- Get going! Get going! Yah! Yah!
- Come on, slow down.

974
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,440
You son of a...

975
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,559
<font color=#FF551>CLOWN:</font> Balloons! Here's a green one.

976
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,200
Thank you.

977
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,320
Balloons!

978
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,920
Move!

979
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,500
No. No, I won't faint.

980
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,300
I won't faint!

981
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,339
- You jerk! Get off of me!
- What do you think you're doing?

982
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,299
Back off, fellas.I am F.B.I.

983
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,979
<font color=#FF551>HAVANA:</font> Zeke? Zeke? Zeke?

984
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,099
F.B.I. Okay?

985
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,239
- Stop him, stop him!
- It's over, everybody. Relax.

986
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,839
- She's got an air conditioned cab.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Tractor Motor Starts]</font>

987
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,940
- Hey, wait! Hey!
<font color=#ff00ff>- [Honking]</font>

988
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,500
Get off of me, you bitch!

989
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,020
No, no. Put me down.

990
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,140
Put me down! I'm F.B.I...!

991
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:52,460
<font color=#ff00ff>[Cheering]</font>

992
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,500
Put me down. Put me down!

993
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,719
<font color=#FF551>ZEKE:</font> You have to let her go!

994
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:17,739
She helped me! You can't take
her to jail. She's my wife!

995
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,439
Your wife.

996
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,619
He's my husband. If you have a problem
with me, then just deal with me.

997
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,659
Leave him out of it. He's a good man.

998
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:31,140
- A man.                  - He's the biggest
man I know. So, he's not the tallest.

999
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,160
You're the F.B.I. What do I do?

1000
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,759
It's up to you, sir. You want to press charges?

1001
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,879
She was wrong to help my
brother, but she's changed!

1002
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,539
I couldn't have returned it without her.

1003
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:48,280
We had to spend some of it on the way, but...

1004
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,600
But whatever's missing, I'll work to
pay it back. I'll do whatever you want.

1005
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,720
Just don't take her to jail.

1006
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,640
Well, I don't know. She sure
did make some fool outta me.

1007
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,560
Um, could you come here please, sir?

1008
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,520
Chapter 26, verse 6.

1009
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:17,060
"To forgive a woman with stain in
her hands, but health in her heart...

1010
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,140
"makes a higher man of he who forgiveth.

1011
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,660
"And God shall such remember...

1012
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,180
"when such a day of final reckoning comes forth.

1013
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:34,660
For he shall be coveted as a man among men."

1014
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:41,300
Sir, I think that Job was speaking to you.

1015
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:46,139
Look, son...

1016
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:50,820
the state fair has offered a $25,000
reward for the return of this money.

1017
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,640
That's for you!

1018
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,220
No, I don't want any reward.

1019
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,460
I just want my wife.

1020
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,840
I don't know if you're crazy,
or just crazy for this woman.

1021
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,080
But you got a deal!

1022
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,120
<font color=#ff00ff>[Men Laughing]</font>

1023
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,560
- Welcome home, Ezekiel.
- Thanks.

1024
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,600
Sorry about that.

1025
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,340
I deserved it.

1026
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,580
Thanks for saving me back there at the fair.

1027
01:24:42,681 --> 01:24:45,779
Well, you saved me back with
that quote from the Bible.

1028
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,420
I'm gonna have to thank Job one day.

1029
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,759
No. Thank me. I made it up.

1030
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:56,620
But I don't think Job would be
mad. It was for a good cause.

1031
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,419
You actually think I could turn
out to be a good cause, hmm?

1032
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,420
You already are!

1033
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,980
Friends forever?

1034
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,820
Forever and a day.

1035
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,280
Okay.

1036
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:26,339
Ah, where are you going to go to now?

1037
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,860
Home to see my family.

1038
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,319
Havana, will I ever see you again?

1039
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,240
No... but you'll see Betsy.

1040
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,600
<font color=#ff00ff>[Laughing]</font>

1041
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,480
We're doing that again in ten years!

1042
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,760
If you don't, I will!
