1
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:03,982
(soft music)

2
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:19,692
(tense electronic music)

3
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,124
(light music)

4
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:38,174
(paint splattering)

5
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,526
(soft tense music)

6
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,923
- [Dispatcher] You know,
I think it's something

7
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,150
that is given to us when we're young,

8
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,967
like implanted in us.

9
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,820
You graduate college, you get
your job, buy a big house,

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,600
have 2.5 kids, have a
fence around your yard,

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
a dog, nice cars.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,340
You don't have anything to worry about.

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,370
- [Boothe] I think everyone still uses

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,830
like that white picket fence reference,

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,790
and in everybody's head

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,410
that's what everybody
still wants, you know?

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,080
Perfect house, perfect family,
whatever that family may be.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,150
Everybody in their hearts,

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,640
they want that on a financial level.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,353
They want to marry that person
that is their true love.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,250
- [Don] The goal of this
country has always been

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,980
that everyone can have a home.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,190
When World War II ended

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,160
and the great American middle
class started to evolve,

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,510
the American dream was that you could be

26
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,740
a middle-class person, have your own home,

27
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,650
have your own four walls,
have your own life.

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,130
You're a king in your castle.

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,730
Even if the thing's a
thousand square feet,

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,300
it doesn't matter, if it's
a nice thousand square feet.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,030
- [Peggy] My parents and my generation,

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,290
they all expected that their
children would have more

33
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,900
and be able to do more than
they were able to provide.

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,820
Life will progress in such a manner

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,000
that we're able to have
more and to provide more

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
for our families.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,680
And that we will not be going backwards.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,330
- One of the great things about America,

39
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,420
it's one of the few countries
that has the least amount

40
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,850
of obstacles for anybody to make a home,

41
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,270
buy a home, have their family there.

42
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,180
My husband and I have
been married for 29 years.

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,630
We have three children,
and we're now at the stage

44
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,420
where we're witnessing our
kids graduating from college,

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,910
following their own dreams,
having their children,

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,060
doing the whole thing
that my husband and I

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,893
have been doing.

48
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:29,710
The struggles, the triumphs.

49
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,410
We believe in our hearts,

50
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,260
whatever it is that we want
to attain, we can achieve it.

51
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,523
(paper shuffling)

52
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,849
(children chattering)

53
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:03,138
(soft music)

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,180
This is a three bedroom, two bath,

55
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,180
1,460 heated square feet,
and has a split plan.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Master bedroom is over here.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,610
There's two smaller
bedrooms near the entry.

58
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,900
The kitchen is nice
but it's sort of plain.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,850
Nice, big walk-in closet, right?

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,600
Take your time, look around,
and ask me any questions, okay?

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,280
- Yeah, just give us a few, please.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,470
- Okay.
- Thanks.

63
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,543
So what do you think?

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,490
- It's not perfect,
but the longer we wait,

65
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,380
we won't even be able to
afford something like this.

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,310
- It's more than we talked about.

67
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,260
- Yeah, but when we move in,
we won't owe on anything else.

68
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,140
Hey, don't worry.

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,733
- I can't not worry.

70
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,886
Let's just go.

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,713
- Hey.

72
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:18,563
- What are you doing?

73
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:19,563
- Come here.

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,303
Come here.

75
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,393
Here we go.

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,450
Look how tall I am.
(both chuckling)

77
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,294
(soft music)

78
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,410
- [Barack On TV] They
believed in an America

79
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,410
where hard work paid off and
responsibility was rewarded.

80
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,593
And anyone could make it if they tried.

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,060
And these values gave rise
to the largest middle class-

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,753
- What do we still have to do in there?

83
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,573
We got the bed in there.

84
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,760
We got the bedding in there.

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,330
That's it for tonight though?

86
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,330
- Well, maybe a box or two
depending on what time it is.

87
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,583
I'm gonna start, you know,
putting clothes away.

88
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,170
- I'm not gonna stop you.

89
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,813
To our lovely home?
- Mm-hm.

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,698
So is it too soon to start talking names?

91
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,130
- Ooh!

92
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,963
Names.

93
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:13,452
(soft music)

94
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:22,054
- I can't believe this is happening.

95
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,242
- On three, okay?

96
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:28,794
- Okay.
- Okay.

97
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:29,994
One,

98
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,004
two,

99
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:31,837
three.

100
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:52,588
(Maggie breathing heavily)

101
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,872
- It was all in your dream, babe.

102
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:07,858
You all right?

103
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:09,783
- I am now.

104
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,380
Baby.

105
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,213
- Hm?

106
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,190
- If something were to happen to you,

107
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,720
how long would you want me
wait to find somebody new?

108
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,903
- Where did that come from?

109
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,650
- How long?

110
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,233
- Once I'm underground,
you can do what you want,

111
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,143
but I'm not going anywhere for a while.

112
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,673
- Better not.

113
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,973
- Yeah, what's my statute of limitations?

114
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,610
- Never.

115
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,110
You're gonna mourn my death
the rest of your life.

116
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,670
- So what do we have, five
more days to the weekend?

117
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,160
- [Jonah] Tell me about it.

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,420
- [Don] How did your
move go? How's the house?

119
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,980
- It's great.

120
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Won't feel like home

121
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,880
till we get the last
couple boxes unpacked,

122
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,590
but the commute's a lot easier.

123
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,340
Couldn't ask for a better deal, so.

124
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,193
- Fortune favors the bold.

125
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,844
- Somethin' like that.

126
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:37,220
(phone ringing)

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,160
Production, Jonah speaking.

128
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,733
- Jonah Price?
- Yes, sir.

129
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,530
- [Phil] Got a minute?

130
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,623
- Yeah, sure.
- Stop by my office.

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,948
- Yeah, okay, should I-

132
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,177
- Thanks.

133
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,844
(phone beeping)

134
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,703
Mr. Price.

135
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,493
Look, there's no real easy way to do this.

136
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,350
It's the worst part of my job.

137
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,220
Revenue has gotten pretty tight.

138
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,343
Corporate has asked us to make cuts.

139
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,133
- Your termination will
be effective in 30 days.

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,930
- [Phil] I hold myself
responsible for all of this.

141
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,980
I had to make some tough decisions.

142
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,846
- [Melanie] In this economy,
we've had to right-size...

143
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,705
Health-care coverage,
job placement services.

144
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:20,798
- [Phil] Every one of our
papers across the country

145
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,298
is eliminating-
- Termination.

146
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:25,620
- Jonah, I understand your concern.

147
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,170
Anyone would feel the same
thing in your situation.

148
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,090
I'm glad you called, but I
mean, why don't we give it

149
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,940
a few weeks before we start panicking?

150
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,850
- Well, it's not panicking.

151
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,238
I think it's a smart move to
try and reduce the payments

152
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:37,800
to something a little bit more manageable.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,830
- We've got to know your income

154
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,300
before we can set the terms, right?

155
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,900
Focus on getting a job right now

156
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,277
and talk to me first of the month.

157
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,404
(soft music)

158
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,952
- [Maggie] Do you know any
other places hiring right now?

159
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:18,250
- Well, not in newspapers,

160
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,933
but there's bound to
be something I can do.

161
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,824
- [Maggie] And what if there's not?

162
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,313
- It's gonna be okay.

163
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,163
- Well, maybe I could pick up
some serving shifts somewhere.

164
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,253
- Yeah, I don't think we
need to worry about that yet.

165
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,393
- I don't know, Jonah.

166
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I really like it here,

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,563
and I'd rather just
fix this now than wait.

168
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,361
I'm afraid it's gonna be too late.

169
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,160
(soft music)

170
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:29,341
I think maybe I should talk to my mom.

171
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,389
- Out of the question.

172
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,643
- It's either another job or my mom.

173
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm sorry, but I can't go
back to some tiny apartment

174
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,890
and then just wait for the stars to align

175
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,970
so that we can start a family.

176
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,093
It's either another job or my mom.

177
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,487
(soft music)

178
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,720
- [Ellen] I'd like to
Laura and Cole to Disney

179
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,760
at the end of the month,

180
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,257
but I wanted to ask about staying with you

181
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:30,180
before I offered Leah.

182
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
- That sounds great, Mom, I'm
just not sure how much time

183
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm gonna have to play host.

184
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,210
- [Ellen] Well, if it's too much trouble,

185
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm sure your brother can
afford to spring for a hotel.

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,231
- That is not the issue, Mom.

187
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:42,637
I just don't know how much time
I'm gonna have to take off.

188
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,510
- [Ellen] Has he gotten any offers?

189
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,553
- [Maggie] He'll get something soon.

190
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:48,075
- [Arnold] Mr. Price, I
appreciate your interest.

191
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,370
- [Peggy] And I sympathize
with your circumstances, but-

192
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,490
- [Nick] We're more focused on building

193
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,840
our web presence right now.

194
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,660
- Absolutely, you know,
I've had tons of experience

195
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,660
with the web and love training
regarding the new programs.

196
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,720
- [Bernard] We'd like someone with

197
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,620
a more extensive magazine background.

198
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,920
- [Daphne] Unfortunately, we aren't able

199
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,910
to offer relocation expenses.

200
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,710
- [Mark] Yes, I do remember.

201
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,250
We were interested a year ago.

202
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,150
- [Angela] You understand what
it's like for an alt weekly.

203
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,320
- [Trudy] We've had to fight to keep them

204
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,520
from killing our print
edition all together.

205
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,900
- [Ellen] I just want you to be happy.

206
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,070
If you'd stayed up here
instead of following him

207
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,100
all over the country, you
might've had your own kids

208
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,650
to take care of by now
instead of everybody else's.

209
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Every one of the boys you dated in school

210
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,520
had enough sense to find something stable

211
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,390
that would support a family
and will be around in 20 years.

212
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,300
- [Maggie] Nothing in that
place will change in 20 years.

213
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,520
- [Cliff] Unfortunately, we're
on a hiring freeze right now.

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,640
- I understand that, sir.

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,510
Just thought it might be worth a call.

216
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,070
- [Meredith] We'll keep
your information on file.

217
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,900
- All right, well,
thank you for your time.

218
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,940
- [Woody] I'll be sure to give you a call

219
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,063
if anything comes up.

220
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
- If you're so worried, Mom,
you could just write a check.

221
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,880
- [Ellen] I'm sorry, Maggie,
with your dad's health

222
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,370
the way it is, we can't
afford to look after anyone

223
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,110
but ourselves right now.

224
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,530
Besides, you're supposed to be an adult.

225
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,720
What would it teach you to bail you out?

226
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,553
- Business call?

227
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,140
Oh, relax.

228
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,417
I'd be doing the same thing.

229
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,498
- [Jonah] Yeah, what's that?

230
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,863
- Doing whatever I could to
find a new job on company time

231
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,205
and company dime.

232
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,490
- Look, I've also been-

233
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,280
- Look, you gotta cut corners.

234
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,323
Don't worry, I'll back you up.

235
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,997
- I appreciate that, Don.

236
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:37,090
- The least I could do.

237
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,253
- So what do we got? Anything good here?

238
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,483
Melanie, dropped these in my box for you.

239
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,170
- [Jonah] Oh.

240
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,003
Tremendous.

241
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,625
What's that?

242
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,680
- That is something
I'd like to keep quiet.

243
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,610
- What do you got here, Don?

244
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,833
Don't hold out on me.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,330
- Phil wanted to have
some kind of a ceremony,

246
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,800
even had my wife start
to bake a cake but...

247
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,360
I don't feel quite right about it.

248
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,103
- [Jonah] 25 years, huh?

249
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,375
How does it feel?

250
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:14,210
- I don't know how to feel.

251
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,450
I mean, I work harder and harder.

252
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,660
I make less and less.

253
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,783
And the suits keep making more and more.

254
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,540
You know, there was a
time they'd talk to me.

255
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,530
They would consult with
me before letting go

256
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,633
the top layout artist I've worked with.

257
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,880
- Well, you enjoy that.

258
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,713
- Yeah.

259
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,070
Listen, seriously,

260
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,903
if there's something you need,

261
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:40,420
if you gotta knock off
early for an interview,

262
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,953
come in late, whatever.

263
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,900
If there's some way I can make
your life a little easier,

264
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,733
say the words.

265
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,693
- [Ellen] It's not going to be easy.

266
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,090
You're just going to have
to tighten your belts.

267
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,573
Stick to the necessities.

268
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:17,960
- [Character on TV] You walking along,

269
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,810
not a nickel in you jeans,
you're free as the wind.

270
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,550
Nobody bothers you.
(phone beeping)

271
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,689
Then you get ahold of some dough.

272
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:23,522
And what happens?

273
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,800
First thing you know, you own things.

274
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,632
You're not the free and
happy guy you used to be.

275
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,132
You got to have money to
pay for all those things.

276
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,863
- [TV announcer] Tonight's
jackpot is $35 million,

277
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,623
and your winning lotto numbers are 47,

278
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,370
44,

279
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,110
42,

280
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,770
41,

281
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,270
seven,

282
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,570
and the last lotto number

283
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,411
is 36.

284
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,244
Now-

285
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:59,377
- [Jonah] You wanna go to bed, babe?

286
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,833
(soft music)

287
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:35,430
- [Morty] Jonah, sorry for the wait.

288
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,290
How's the job search coming?

289
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,903
- Well, not so well. Not so well at all.

290
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,324
You told me to give you a call

291
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:44,924
if I hadn't had found
anything by the first,

292
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,840
so that is what I'm doing.

293
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,780
- So what can I do you for?

294
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,870
- [Jonah] Well, I figured
if I had a longer term

295
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,313
then I might be able to
accept some offers right now.

296
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,830
Bit too low to make the current payments.

297
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,720
- Sounds like you got a good head

298
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,150
on your shoulders there, Jonah.

299
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,400
Let me pull up your file.

300
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,751
Uh-oh.

301
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:07,840
- [Jonah] What?

302
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,130
- [Morty] Looks like
we're no longer at liberty

303
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,613
to change the terms.

304
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,206
- [Jonah] What?

305
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,963
- [Morty] We don't even
actually own it anymore.

306
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,572
- [Jonah] Whoa, Morty, who does?

307
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,904
- [Morty] You should've
gotten a notice about this.

308
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:21,571
- [Jonah] I didn't get anything.

309
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,956
(door creaking)

310
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,789
(kids chattering)

311
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:15,237
- Jonah.

312
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,043
Jonah, will you please talk to me?

313
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,080
What are you doing?

314
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,913
- Buying time.

315
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:22,953
- What do you mean?

316
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,413
No way.

317
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,610
- Look, I'll do it, okay?

318
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,270
Just go back in the house.
- No way.

319
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,770
- Go back in the house.
- No!

320
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:36,780
- Look, this could go on for months.

321
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,230
Do you realize how much
money we would save here?

322
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,413
- No.

323
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,150
It's gotta be dangerous.

324
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,983
You trying to get yourself killed?

325
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,330
- No, I'm not gonna get myself killed.

326
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,280
It's not dangerous.

327
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,823
- I suppose you do know
what you're doing, huh?

328
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,870
- Before I was old
enough for a paper route,

329
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,653
this is what we did when
Mom's hours got cut back.

330
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,664
- Jonah.

331
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:15,223
Come on, we'll find another way.

332
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,523
- Yeah, fine.

333
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,164
(door slamming)

334
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:40,593
(crickets chirping)

335
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,810
(knocking on door)

336
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,803
- Just forget it.

337
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:03,387
- [Boothe] And you are?

338
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,302
- [Jonah] Jonah Price.

339
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:07,393
- Okay, let's see.

340
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,653
And what interests you
about Eagle Staffing Agency?

341
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,350
- As you can see on my resume,

342
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,493
I've worked in extremely professional,

343
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,373
competitive environments
for nearly 10 years.

344
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,650
I have excellent computer skills,

345
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,140
and given my background in publishing,

346
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,690
I think I'd have an edge when
it comes to communication

347
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,410
within a corporate environment.

348
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,403
- I see.

349
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,370
It doesn't look like
you have any experience

350
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,370
as an executive assistant, or a secretary,

351
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,410
even a receptionist, for that matter.

352
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,290
- Well, no, but I've worked
in newspapers all around

353
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,830
the country for nearly 10 years,

354
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,660
and like all my references
are gonna tell you,

355
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,473
I have zero problems
adapting to new challenges.

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,503
- You never scheduled appointments?

357
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,940
- No, but I've-

358
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,490
- Maintained a company filing system?

359
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,890
- Well, I've had to adhere
to a common filing system.

360
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,710
- Yeah, but solely for an individual?

361
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,310
Like an executive, for instance.

362
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,613
- No.

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,640
- Have you ever had any office
management responsibilities,

364
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,843
such as maintaining an inventory
of office supplies before?

365
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,293
- No.

366
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
- What about office machines? Fax, copier?

367
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,223
- I can operate a fax
machine and make copies.

368
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,343
- I see.

369
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,181
How about heavy phones?

370
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,840
Have you ever had to handle multi-line

371
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,380
heavy phone traffic before?

372
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,393
- Yeah, I can answer the phone.

373
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,793
- Make coffee?

374
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,580
- I've had to redesign
entire sections of the paper

375
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,060
at the last minute so an ad
rep can satisfy his clients.

376
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,083
I've dealt with constant
deadline pressure,

377
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,170
day in and day out.

378
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,540
I have done three people's
jobs for weeks at a time,

379
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,983
so I think these are,

380
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,860
you know, the filing, the heavy phones,

381
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,283
these are things that I could handle.

382
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,660
- I understand you possess
some notable qualifications

383
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,810
that many of our candidates
for placement don't,

384
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,280
but we need to fully stand behind

385
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
the employees that we place.

386
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,940
I'm not saying that you
won't be considered,

387
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,773
I just, you know,

388
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:34,810
if your background
check and drug screening

389
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,470
come back clean, then we'll see.

390
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,300
I believe we have your
contact information,

391
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,823
so you know, if we have a
match, I'll be in touch.

392
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,176
(knocking on window)

393
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,213
- Hey.

394
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,669
- That bad, huh?

395
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,098
- Let's just say I'm
not holding my breath.

396
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:02,931
- [Maggie] I'm sorry.

397
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:07,998
- [Jonah] Me too.

398
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:10,831
- [Maggie] I mean, for everything.

399
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:13,989
- [Jonah] Me too.

400
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,690
- You're gonna find something.

401
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,820
- What am I gonna find that pays enough

402
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,120
to keep the house, Maggie?

403
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,783
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,083
- Why don't you go camping
this weekend, Jonah?

405
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,310
I just, I think it would
be good for you to get away

406
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,133
and clear your head, regroup.

407
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,823
I think it'll be good for both of us.

408
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,286
(soft music)

409
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:33,288
(line trilling)

410
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,533
- [Jonah] Hey, it's
Jonah, leave me a message.

411
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:38,200
(phone beeping)

412
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:42,684
(waves lapping)

413
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:51,413
(birds chirping)

414
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,150
(microwave beeping)

415
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,910
- Hey babe, it's me.

416
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,793
Just checking to see where you are.

417
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,473
Call me back, okay?

418
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,433
I love you.

419
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:57,098
(soft music)

420
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,010
- [TV announcer] Free of charge

421
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,640
with absolutely no
obligation for just 14.95,

422
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,660
but this spectacular-

423
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,170
- [Sterling] What those
companies hope you'll do.

424
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,003
At the Ster...

425
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,490
(line trilling)

426
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,710
- [Jonah] Hey, it's
Jonah, leave me a message.

427
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,235
(phone beeping)

428
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:34,290
- I don't know what's goin' on here,

429
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,100
but can you just please call
me and let me know you're okay?

430
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:51,198
- [Jonah] Hey, it's
Jonah, leave me a message.

431
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:52,230
(phone beeping)

432
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,493
- Jonah, pick up!

433
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,780
Where are you?

434
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:01,359
Look,

435
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,230
I know things have been hard lately.

436
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,207
Maybe that's my fault.

437
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,957
I don't know, just...

438
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,365
I love you, I'm worried about you.

439
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,140
Please just call me back.

440
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,250
- [Jonah] Hey, it's
Jonah, leave me a message.

441
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,111
(phone beeping)

442
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,663
- Jonah, where are you?

443
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:33,020
I don't know what to do.

444
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,563
Do I call 911?

445
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,070
Could you please just come home?

446
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:46,409
Now?

447
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:48,935
I love you.

448
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,669
(crickets chirping)

449
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,417
(phone ringing)

450
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,630
Hello?
- I didn't think I'd get you.

451
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,580
I was gonna leave a voicemail.

452
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,623
We're coming down at the end of the month.

453
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,840
- Okay.

454
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,030
- [Ellen] Now don't worry,
we're staying at a hotel.

455
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,713
I'll make sure you don't
have to worry about anything.

456
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,381
- You haven't bought your
plane tickets yet, have you?

457
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,320
- [Ellen] Why?

458
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,130
- I haven't heard from
him since Friday night.

459
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,760
- [Ellen] All weekend?

460
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,560
- [Maggie] It's not like that.

461
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,520
- [Ellen] Are you sure?

462
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,700
You don't always know.

463
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,090
- Well, he went camping,

464
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,540
but he didn't come back
when he said he would,

465
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,980
and I couldn't get through on his cell.

466
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,578
- [Ellen] Could there be someone else?

467
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:02,900
(line trilling)

468
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,070
- This might be weird, but
I need to ask you something.

469
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,903
- Go ahead.

470
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,910
- If Jonah was seeing anybody,
I just, maybe you don't know.

471
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,726
I just feel like a lot
of times I've heard that

472
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:15,676
that happens a lot.

473
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,650
If I don't hear from him tonight,

474
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,160
I think I'm gonna go to the police.

475
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,360
But when I do, I just don't
wanna be some poor woman

476
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,695
whose husband ran off and
she didn't see it coming.

477
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,300
- Look, if something was
going on here, you know,

478
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,170
he would've been pretty sly about it.

479
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,430
I mean, he could have,
but I really don't think

480
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,263
that's the case.

481
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:32,740
- [Maggie] I'd say that's a relief,

482
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,110
but the alternatives
aren't relieving at all,

483
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,434
so thanks, I guess.

484
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:39,937
- I understand.

485
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:42,354
(soft music)

486
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,680
- [Ellen] You heard from his mother?

487
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,240
- [Maggie] She's not staying with us.

488
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,940
- But-
- No, she's just gonna stay

489
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,020
with a friend who used to go
to their church or something.

490
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,340
- That's ridiculous.

491
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,250
I mean, you're right here.

492
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,160
She shouldn't have to-

493
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,700
- [Maggie] She doesn't like us.

494
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,260
Well, she doesn't like me, you know,

495
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,960
kinda like how you are with Jonah.

496
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:18,290
(police radio chattering)

497
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,640
- Cell phone and car keys were
both found inside the tent,

498
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,455
as well as some camping gear:
stove, headlamp, cookware,

499
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,101
sleeping bag, water bottles, clothes.

500
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,160
Once we finish the
necessary forensic work,

501
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,622
you can inspect the contents of the tent

502
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:32,510
and tell us if there's anything missing.

503
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,850
A ranger found his car
up near the boat launch.

504
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,147
Wallet was found inside the
console, looks untouched.

505
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:06,016
(police radio chattering)

506
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,950
- [Detective] At the moment,
our most likely scenario

507
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,790
is that Mr. Price went exploring

508
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,760
where the river meets the ocean.

509
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,940
Maybe he encountered some trouble-

510
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,650
- Do you think he's out there?

511
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,610
- [Detective] We're
gonna get as many people

512
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,683
out here searching for him as
we can for the next 36 hours.

513
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,930
We need to take other scenarios into-

514
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,030
- What are you saying?

515
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:37,010
- [Detective] This place has
some powerful rip currents.

516
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,760
Solo swimmer, we don't know
if he had a life jacket on.

517
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:46,187
- Now who knows if they're right?

518
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,993
You're gonna keep
looking, isn't that right?

519
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,223
- Yes, ma'am.

520
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:56,257
(waves crashing)

521
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:22,452
(soft music)

522
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,633
- Hey, we're home, sweetheart.

523
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:12,763
Come on, honey, just get a little rest.

524
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:13,810
I promise you'll feel better

525
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,860
with just a little rest after a long day.

526
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,083
Sit down. I'll get your shoes.

527
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,610
- [Maggie] Thanks, Mom.

528
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:31,340
- That's what moms are for, so I'm told.

529
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,010
Left foot right up here.

530
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,353
Pop up your sweet feet.

531
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,330
I can't give you another
one for a few hours,

532
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,933
so I sure hope you can sleep, okay?

533
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:49,570
- [Maggie] I love you, Mom.

534
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,690
- I love you, too.

535
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,573
You are my precious girl.

536
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,735
Sleep.

537
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,787
(soft music)

538
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:20,007
Primary beneficiary, Maggie Price, spouse.

539
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,653
Beneficiary to be paid $500,000.

540
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,360
Hi, dear.

541
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,743
Question for the lawyer in the family.

542
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,093
- Mom, what if by some
miracle he's out there,

543
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,690
who knows where, but
I'm not waiting for him?

544
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,120
- [Ellen] I don't think they
would've called off the search

545
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,083
if they thought there was a
chance they could save him.

546
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:43,571
- I know, but it's just-

547
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:44,404
- What?

548
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,470
- There's still a chance.

549
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,700
- Listen, Maggie, I don't
pretend for a second

550
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,463
to know where he is, but it is not here.

551
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,340
And I think it is worth
your while to see if you can

552
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,310
get something for your trouble.

553
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,510
- That makes me feel
like a horrible person.

554
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,980
- I have to deal with horrible people

555
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,131
in this line of business sometimes.

556
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:18,790
I mean, these are people that
are out for money, right?

557
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,993
They don't care how they're
gonna go about getting it.

558
00:42:21,828 --> 00:42:25,233
You do not strike me as one
of those. Not even close.

559
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,930
But I also deal with people
that have a good case,

560
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,120
but they're either ignorant
or just plain stubborn.

561
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,000
They come to me too late for
me to do anything about it.

562
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,070
All right, so that's why
it's important that we take

563
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,690
the initiative in these matters.

564
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,980
It's gonna go a long way to preventing

565
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,250
an even bigger mess later

566
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,183
that's gonna be a lot harder to clean up.

567
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,267
- I think I need to sleep on it.

568
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,800
I hope that's not a problem.

569
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,320
- No, Maggie, not at all.

570
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,153
I understand.

571
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,453
Just remember,

572
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,579
for the best chance of
a favorable settlement,

573
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,279
we need to get on this right away.

574
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,473
Just give me the word, all right,

575
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,843
and we're gonna put this into action.

576
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,160
- Thank you for your time.
- Absolutely.

577
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,670
Thanks for coming in.

578
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,553
- I don't know what you're waiting for.

579
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,910
I think he would take good care of you.

580
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,690
Even if he's out there,
you should still do it.

581
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,743
Honestly, if I thought he were,
I'd be even more convinced.

582
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,243
Because in that case, where is he?

583
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,553
Why did he leave you to deal
with all of this on your own?

584
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:59,699
(soft music)

585
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,997
I wish you the best with this.

586
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:44,600
You know I love you.

587
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:48,858
- [Maggie] Thank you.

588
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:51,615
Have a safe trip, Mom.

589
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:57,754
(soft music)

590
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,578
(crickets chirping)

591
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:11,828
(soft music continues)

592
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,124
(patrons chattering)

593
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,160
- [Man on TV] Tonight,
all across this state

594
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,290
and all across this country,

595
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,570
there are people working hard

596
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,000
to ensure that their children would have

597
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,970
a better opportunity in this life

598
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,960
than they have had themselves.

599
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,990
And they are blessed to live

600
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,180
in this great and extraordinary society

601
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,620
where indeed that dream is still possible,

602
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,520
and is still true.

603
00:48:18,234 --> 00:48:20,734
(dog barking)

604
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:27,784
(paper shuffling)

605
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,970
- [Maggie] Who did this?

606
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,230
- You didn't know about it?

607
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,063
- Of course not.

608
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,418
- Maggie, I am so sorry, she said that-

609
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:54,251
- Who?

610
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:56,580
- Mrs. Price, I mean his mother.

611
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,531
She said that, she told me that-

612
00:48:58,531 --> 00:49:00,198
- I should've known.

613
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:07,941
- I thought that you knew everything.

614
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:08,873
- I'm sorry, Don.

615
00:49:08,873 --> 00:49:12,790
I didn't mean to come in
here and just start...

616
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:15,691
- I just thought that...

617
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,647
(soft music)

618
00:50:18,965 --> 00:50:21,632
(Maggie crying)

619
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,330
- How's this work?

620
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,520
- Well, there's a remote possibility

621
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,070
that if someone were to
petition for a probate hearing,

622
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,920
your in-laws for example,
that you might lose something,

623
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,960
but all of his assets should
be transferred to you.

624
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,240
Precedent for cases like these, you know,

625
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,880
with a surviving spouse
is pretty airtight,

626
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,880
even without a will.

627
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,600
- [Maggie] What about-

628
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,273
- No, ma'am, not yet.

629
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,760
Look, we're not like a lot
of the other firms out there

630
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,510
who are gonna bill you by the hour

631
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,350
and hope to get rich off of
wasting your time, all right?

632
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,150
We take our share from the back end,

633
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,333
because we do plan on winning.

634
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:31,138
We're very good at what we do,

635
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:32,360
and you will not owe us anything

636
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,043
that our performance doesn't warrant.

637
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:39,279
(light music)

638
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:09,035
- [Ellen] You're down
there all by yourself.

639
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:10,234
If you've got to start over,

640
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:12,040
you might as well do it up here.

641
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,570
- I need to get everything
settled down here

642
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,770
before I can even think about that.

643
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,820
- [Ellen] How long is that going to take?

644
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,530
- Without a body, the courts
generally take five years

645
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,070
to issue a death certificate
so the insurance company

646
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,403
can be sure that the person
in question is actually dead.

647
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,830
- All those people couldn't find him.

648
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:37,970
- Look, the state can expedite
the death certificate,

649
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,490
all right, as long as we
can prove that your husband

650
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,660
was exposed to imminent peril.

651
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,500
But since this isn't a major disaster,

652
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,983
you know, legally speaking,

653
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,190
it still could take up to a year.

654
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,490
- I'll be out of my house.

655
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,623
- I'll do what I can, all
right, to move this thing along,

656
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:03,180
but if I were you, I would
do everything in your power

657
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,599
to get out from under that house.

658
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,899
- We were supposed to
have kids in that house.

659
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,330
- The market hasn't changed too much,

660
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,930
but at the same time I see that

661
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,980
you guys still have some work to do here.

662
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,510
The lawn should be mowed,

663
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,110
and it would help if you
would get rid of the weeds.

664
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:25,290
You wanna make sure that the
house looks like it's been

665
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,734
kept up and you've taken good care of it.

666
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:31,734
(children laughing)

667
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,473
(engine rumbling)

668
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,743
- Ms. Price.

669
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,630
- [Sterling] Hey, Maggie.

670
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,530
Have a seat, this shouldn't take long.

671
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:11,110
- [Maggie] So what's this about?

672
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,440
- Miss Price, we've been asked

673
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,390
to take another look at your husband's,

674
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,950
his...

675
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,170
- Death?

676
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,560
- That's right.
- You know how things are

677
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,460
when there's insurance money at stake.

678
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,620
- Now if I recall correctly,
your husband lost his job

679
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,210
shortly before he disappeared?

680
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,523
- [Maggie] Yes, that's right.

681
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,343
- And he was having some
trouble finding work?

682
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,443
Would you say he was depressed?

683
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,330
I'm sorry, Miss Price, but I'm
gonna need you to speak up-

684
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,000
- Yes, he was depressed.

685
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,480
- He wouldn't have done it on
purpose or anything, would he?

686
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,713
- Okay, Maggie, let me restate that.

687
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,160
If Jonah committed suicide,
then the insurance company

688
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,130
would only have to refund the premiums

689
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,633
versus the full benefits.

690
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,470
- He would've said goodbye.

691
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,570
There wasn't even a note, so...

692
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,450
- Forgive me, Miss
Price, but I had to ask.

693
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,513
- Is that all, sir?

694
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,370
- Ma'am, I'm afraid that
there's one more thing.

695
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,533
And again, I apologize
if it is insensitive.

696
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,110
- [Maggie] Go ahead.

697
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,510
- Is there any possibility

698
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,340
that your husband could
be trying to defraud

699
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,680
the insurance company
for his benefit or yours?

700
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,090
- We're done, okay?

701
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,913
Maggie, you don't have to
answer that at all, okay?

702
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,793
- No.

703
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,323
- No chance?
- None.

704
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,530
My husband couldn't pull
off something like that.

705
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,790
I mean, I love him,
but he wouldn't have...

706
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,543
Just something that he wouldn't do, okay?

707
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,110
- Well, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

708
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,733
Miss Price, I think I've heard
all that I needed to hear.

709
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:24,690
- Glad to hear it.

710
00:56:27,006 --> 00:56:28,173
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

711
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,170
- I am impressed.

712
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,816
- What?

713
00:56:48,816 --> 00:56:49,649
What do you mean?

714
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:50,840
I told the truth.

715
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,940
- Doesn't matter you're telling the truth.

716
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,202
Only matters whether you're convincing.

717
00:56:56,202 --> 00:56:58,683
- I think that's the most
cynical thing I've ever heard.

718
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,603
- Yeah well, any cop or lawyer
will tell you the same thing.

719
00:57:04,874 --> 00:57:05,963
A good one, anyway.

720
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:10,861
- I suppose I ought to
feel good about today then.

721
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,790
- Well, step in the right direction.

722
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:17,910
You know, they still may come
back and try to only pay half.

723
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,760
They're entitled to without the body.

724
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:24,680
I mean, hey, it's better
than the alternative.

725
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,113
- Half is more than enough.

726
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:34,373
- You gettin' by?

727
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,413
- I'll be okay.

728
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:40,403
- You sure?

729
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,450
I mean, if anything changes,

730
00:57:48,557 --> 00:57:51,823
you know, if you need anything,

731
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,423
you can call me, day or night.

732
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,840
I'm sure we can work out a
mutually beneficial arrangement.

733
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,370
Just keep it in mind.

734
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:09,703
- I'm gonna go.

735
00:58:11,712 --> 00:58:14,212
(light music)

736
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,627
(microwave beeping)

737
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:17,159
(water running)

738
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,413
- Maggie.

739
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,823
- Oh my God.
- Maggie, it's me.

740
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,006
(knocking on door)

741
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:50,006
Maggie, come on, open up.

742
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,247
(thunder rumbling)

743
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:03,150
Maggie.

744
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:25,384
Maggie, come on, open the door.

745
01:01:25,384 --> 01:01:26,384
- Oh my God.

746
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:45,357
- I came back to you as soon as I could.

747
01:01:46,729 --> 01:01:47,562
- What?

748
01:01:49,837 --> 01:01:51,087
- What's wrong?

749
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:03,087
- You son of a bitch.

750
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:07,077
- Maggie, look, I would've told you if-

751
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:08,393
- You should have.

752
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,490
- [Jonah] Maggie, it's not
like I didn't trust you.

753
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:14,960
- The second that you thought about this,

754
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,793
you should've told me.

755
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:17,263
I thought I lost you.

756
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,928
- It wouldn't have worked if I told you.

757
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:20,928
- Oh my God!

758
01:02:22,132 --> 01:02:23,719
I don't think I even know you.

759
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:25,760
- Maggie, don't you get it?

760
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,630
I did this for us.

761
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:28,630
- Which part, Jonah?

762
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,757
- All of it.
- Don't touch me!

763
01:02:29,757 --> 01:02:32,243
- I did all of this for us, Maggie.

764
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:35,963
Yeah.

765
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:38,993
- The part where I thought you were dead?

766
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:41,890
Like the part where you
ran off and left me here

767
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:45,023
by myself to clean up your mess?

768
01:02:46,353 --> 01:02:48,180
That was for us.

769
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,403
- Maggie, everything I did was for you.

770
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:56,153
- Don't you stand there and
tell me that this was for us.

771
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,943
You did what was easiest for you.

772
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:02,466
I can't even look at you, Jonah.

773
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:03,299
I can't believe-

774
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:05,620
- You think this was easy for me?

775
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,973
Do you have any idea the
things I have been through?

776
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,293
- I want you to leave.
- No, no, no, no, no.

777
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,123
Look.

778
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,390
You're all that matters.

779
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,113
I don't care about anything but you.

780
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,960
- If you cared about me, you
would've never done this to me.

781
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:30,480
I can't even look at you, I can't...

782
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:37,297
- You don't get it, do you?

783
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,590
- There is nothing that you could say

784
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,653
that could possibly excuse this.

785
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,063
- Excuse this?

786
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,793
Maggie, excuse this?

787
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:52,693
What do you mean, excuse this?

788
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,220
- I want you to leave.

789
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:02,533
- Is that what you want,
you want me to leave?

790
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,310
- I don't want you to be here.

791
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:11,219
- All right.

792
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:21,794
I love you,

793
01:04:21,794 --> 01:04:22,627
and

794
01:04:24,377 --> 01:04:26,627
I'm really glad to see you.

795
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:32,790
(Maggie crying)

796
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:42,045
(thunder rumbling)
(rain drizzling)

797
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:05,860
- If you're not out of here by
the time I wake up tomorrow,

798
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,560
I'm turning you in.

799
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,630
Either you leave or I'm calling the cops.

800
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:13,400
- You are the only one
who knows I'm alive, okay?

801
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,010
The only thing standing between us

802
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,440
and a half million dollars
is some paperwork, Maggie.

803
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,630
- It's a quarter million.

804
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,463
And it's going to be-
- So?

805
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:21,720
- [Maggie] At least a year.

806
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,780
- Do you have any idea how long we could

807
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:25,160
make that last someplace else?

808
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,853
- Give it up, Jonah. It's over!

809
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,490
- Are you serious right now?

810
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:30,890
You would send me to prison?

811
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:33,930
- Don't tempt me.

812
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,540
I just don't want you here.

813
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:41,419
- You'd really send me to
prison right now, wouldn't you?

814
01:05:41,419 --> 01:05:44,350
- I just don't want you here.

815
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,940
- Where do you want me to go, Maggie?

816
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,100
- You've been somewhere
else this whole time, Jonah.

817
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,153
Just go there.

818
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:57,730
(woman moaning)

819
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:01,691
(fly buzzing)

820
01:06:02,947 --> 01:06:05,614
(TV chattering)

821
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:14,581
(line trilling)

822
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,640
- [Phone Recording] The wireless
customer you have called

823
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,550
is not available at this time.

824
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,577
Please try your call again later.

825
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:25,836
(phone beeping)

826
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:28,253
(soft music)

827
01:07:21,923 --> 01:07:26,923
(grease crackling)
(dishes clattering)

828
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:45,481
(soft music continues)

829
01:09:39,737 --> 01:09:42,654
(doorbell ringing)

830
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,420
- I'm really glad you could make it.

831
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,383
- Yeah, me too.

832
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,263
- Come on.

833
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,410
This is gonna have to
be a little bit quicker

834
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:09,280
than I was hoping, 'cause
I have to get back to work

835
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,370
to do a couple things.

836
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:13,640
It's okay. (chuckles)

837
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,330
But why don't we first give you a tour?

838
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:20,810
(soft music)

839
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:00,030
And this is the bedroom.

840
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:15,004
Look.

841
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,210
I'm sorry.

842
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,863
I think I'm so much usually
better at this type of thing.

843
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,313
I just, by the look that
you're giving me right now,

844
01:11:26,313 --> 01:11:27,990
I don't think you
understand what's happening.

845
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,033
It's my fault, 'cause I really
should've been much clearer.

846
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,990
Yeah, I know you need the money,

847
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,590
so I'm gonna go ahead and
leave this on the dresser.

848
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,183
Everything okay?

849
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:54,563
Look,

850
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,283
cleaning supplies, right?

851
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,760
The cleaning supplies are downstairs.

852
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,883
They're in the closet right
next to the laundry room.

853
01:12:06,378 --> 01:12:08,123
Okay, 'cause you'll need those.

854
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,963
And it's better this way.

855
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,180
Okay, 'cause you need the money, right,

856
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,320
and then my wife comes
home to a clean house

857
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,270
and I don't have to sleep on the couch.

858
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,330
Take all the time you need.

859
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,453
Okay, you have all day.

860
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,343
Diane, my wife, doesn't
get home till four so,

861
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,583
call me if you need anything.

862
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:41,000
(soft music)

863
01:13:47,561 --> 01:13:50,311
(vacuum humming)

864
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:10,195
(soft music continues)

865
01:14:37,926 --> 01:14:41,426
(cleaning tool thudding)

866
01:15:31,192 --> 01:15:33,859
(hand pounding)

867
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:39,284
(Maggie sniffling)

868
01:15:47,123 --> 01:15:49,790
(carwash beeps)

869
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,467
(tool clanging)

870
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:40,474
(metal rattling)

871
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,084
(soft music)

872
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:53,976
- Maggie?

873
01:17:06,224 --> 01:17:07,224
Hey, Maggie.

874
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:56,737
Maggie?

875
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:06,858
(door creaking)

876
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:15,522
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

877
01:18:15,522 --> 01:18:16,355
- [Jonah] My wife's been electrocuted.

878
01:18:16,355 --> 01:18:18,327
- [Dispatcher] I'm sorry,
sir, what's your emergency?

879
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:20,140
- My wife has been electrocuted.

880
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,810
- [Dispatcher] And the exact
location of your emergency?

881
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,023
- 2121 Sabal Palm Circle, 32820.

882
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,070
