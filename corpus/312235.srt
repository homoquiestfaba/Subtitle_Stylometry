1
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,413
Duane, is that you?

2
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,181
Light beer?

3
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,809
Yeah, I'm trying
to lose some weight.

4
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,615
Hey, Bobby.
- Where are you headed?

5
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,622
Going home.

6
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,624
What are you doing
out here?

7
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,853
Nothing, just driving around.

8
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,862
Are you drunk, Duane?

9
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,524
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Bobby.

10
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,534
Yeah, that's good.

11
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,799
Listen, why don't you
come with me?

12
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,067
I'm getting off in a half hour,
I'll drop you home,

13
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,166
I'll call a tow for the truck
and you can pick it up in the morning.

14
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,839
How am I gonna get back out here?
- Duane, I'm doing you a favor.

15
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,708
Come on.

16
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,872
All right. You got it?

17
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,898
You okay?

18
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,773
All right, come on, let's go.
Let's get you out of here.

19
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,850
What? What do you
got in there?

20
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,876
I got my daughter.

21
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,417
Honey.

22
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,393
Come on,
Bobby's gonna give us

23
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,224
a ride home, sweetie.
Come on.

24
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,709
You get in the car, Duane.
I'll get your daughter.

25
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,782
This changes things, Duane.

26
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,253
I can't let you go on this.

27
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,586
Get in the car, Duane.
It's cold.

28
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,373
Let me get this straight.

29
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,637
You're doing 84
on the parkway, it's 2:00 A.M.,

30
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,644
your daughter's
in the back seat,

31
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,976
and you're twice the legal limit.
Am I hearing this right?

32
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,379
Your Honor...
- It's a rhetorical question,

33
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,941
Mr. Hopwood.
Do you understand the seriousness

34
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,682
of your situation?
- Yeah. Your Honor, if I could just...

35
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,190
No, Mr. Hopwood, you can't.

36
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,749
Now, I understand
the arresting officer

37
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,262
is going to pay Mr. Hopwood's bail.
Is that correct?

38
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,264
Yes, Your Honor,
that's correct.

39
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,266
He's my client's cousin.

40
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,962
Uh, we're not...
we're not really cousins.

41
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,971
Our fathers are
best friends.

42
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,496
We sort of grew up tog...

43
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,907
Here's what's gonna
happen, Mr. Hopwood.

44
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,002
I'm releasing you
on your own recognizance.

45
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,013
Your Honor,
my client feels...

46
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,515
I sympathize with how
your client feels,

47
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,018
but due to the fact
that Mr. Hopwood has no priors,

48
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,885
and it doesn't seem as though
he was fleeing with the child,

49
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,755
I see no reason
not to release him at this time.

50
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,825
I am, however, temporarily revoking
your license, Mr. Hopwood.

51
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,990
Your Honor, with...

52
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,627
with all due respect and stuff,
I really need my car.

53
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,637
I mean, I work at Caesars.

54
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,639
That's how I make my living,

55
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,766
and I gotta pay
child support.

56
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,935
What am l...
am I supposed...

57
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,537
You live in Longport?

58
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,104
Yeah.

59
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,015
You have a bike?

60
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,281
Yeah, I got a bike.

61
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,481
Well then.

62
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,490
Your Honor,
it's November, it's cold

63
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,685
and I work
from 3:00 A.M. To noon...

64
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,751
I'm not your
transportation coordinator.

65
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,763
Do what you have to do,
keep a low profile,

66
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,163
and I'll see you back here
in two weeks, okay?

67
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,032
Okay.
- You're a very lucky man, Mr. Hopwood.

68
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,060
Things could be a lot worse.

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,471
They could?

70
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,907
Oh yeah.

71
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,858
Bullshit. Bullshit.

72
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,246
Get out of the way!
- What the fuck!

73
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,844
Sorry, man.
It's me... Anthony.

74
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,413
Hey, Anthony, yeah.
You kind of snuck up on me there.

75
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,051
I wasn't sure it was you.
You got that parka on.

76
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,583
You gotta get one of those
reflector vests, dude.

77
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,289
Somebody's gonna
run you over.

78
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,127
That's what I'm hoping for.

79
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,962
Oh man, don't mess around.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,991
I just ran over a seagull,
I swear to God,

81
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,697
and I told him
the same thing.

82
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,399
I said, "You gotta wear one
of those reflector vests."

83
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,408
You know what he said?
- What did he say?

84
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,774
"Fuck you!"
No, really, he said

85
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,871
they don't have them in his size,
and they weigh him down and shit.

86
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,372
So listen, you want a ride?
- Hell yes.

87
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,386
All right,
cool, man, pull over.

88
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,116
I'll put your bike
in the trunk.

89
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,424
You get switched?
- Yeah, I told Robin

90
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,830
I'd work 3:00 to noon
if he let me do stand-up.

91
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,835
'Cause I want to be
an actor, you know.

92
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,996
I'm fixing slot machines now,
but if I can get

93
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,005
some casino stand-up
under my belt,

94
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,735
somebody might see me,
and I can get an agent or a manager.

95
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,869
That's how it starts.
It's all up ford grabs, dude.

96
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,880
Robin?

97
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,610
Yeah, you know, the dude
that books talent in the lounge.

98
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,618
- Big fat black dude.
- You mean, Rahmn.

99
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah, Robin.

100
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,622
No, his name is Rahmn.

101
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,216
It's Rahmn. He's... it's like
a Muslim name or something.

102
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,227
Really? Shit.

103
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,024
You serious?
- Yeah.

104
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,690
Fuck, I've been calling him Robin.
- Well, it's Rahmn.

105
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,666
Fuck. I'm like "Hey, Robin!

106
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,396
How about letting me
do some stand-up, you big fat fuck?"

107
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,301
No wonder he's been
looking at me funny.

108
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,306
Rahmn. Hell.

109
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,501
Like the noodles.
Like Ramen noodles.

110
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,511
Yeah, we don't...
he doesn't like that.

111
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,513
Oh, okay.
- Don't ever mention...

112
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,447
Oh yeah? Okay, good.
...the noodle thing.

113
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,677
No, I wanna be in tight with him.
- Seriously.

114
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,742
I come out
at the top of my act, and I'm like,

115
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,482
"Hi, everybody.
I'm Mike, good to see you.

116
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,490
Everybody good?
Everybody got a drink?

117
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,152
Moe Greene. How are you?
Fredo, give Mike a drink."

118
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,024
You know that scene
from "The Godfather"?

119
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,656
Yep.
- I can't wait to try it in the casino.

120
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,223
'Cause in the movie, they're...
...in the casino.

121
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,394
Yeah, in the scene.
And if someone heckles me,

122
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,404
I'll just go,
"Hey, you know who I am?

123
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,168
I'm Moe Greene!
I'm Moe Greene!"

124
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,175
You know what I mean?
It's just bullshit.

125
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,200
You just gotta
work at it a little.

126
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,882
Listen, I got
a proposal for you.

127
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,884
You live alone, right?
- Right.

128
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,716
Okay, I'm looking for a place
to rent that's closer to work.

129
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,847
How do you feel
about a roommate?

130
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,381
You know I got the job,
so rent's not a problem.

131
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,394
I'll clear out
whenever you need me to,

132
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,623
'cause I know you got
the kids, when they visit.

133
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,188
You get a ride to work
instead of the bicycle thing.

134
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,860
I know I talk a lot, but I swear
to God I'll shut the fuck up.

135
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,666
Anthony, it's not you.
It's just a bad time.

136
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,673
I understand.
I understand.

137
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,675
Just do me a favor
and think about it.

138
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,677
Take a couple days.

139
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,201
And get
a reflector vest!

140
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,940
Maybe a little bell
for the bike,

141
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,711
you know, whatever.
It could work!

142
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,647
Hit me! Hit me!

143
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,813
Sir, you need to keep
your voice down.

144
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,824
I'm not gonna keep
my voice down!

145
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,325
You get paid
to pay attention,

146
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,987
and you are
absolutely killing me!

147
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,588
Here, let me work this out.
There's no reason to shout.

148
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,599
I'm not shouting.
Who are you?

149
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,261
My name's Duane Hopwood.
I work for the casino.

150
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,702
Lou, why don't you keep Mr...

151
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,332
Uh, Mr. Fuck You.

152
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,468
Please keep Mr. Fuck You's chair open.
We'll be right back.

153
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,478
Hey, hands off the suit, Duane.

154
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,480
That's all right, Tommy,
it's all right.

155
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,846
Here's the deal,
Mr. Fuck You. Listen.

156
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,283
Either you keep
your voice down, or Tommy here

157
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,787
is gonna put you in a full nelson
while I call the cops

158
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,381
and tell them some asshole is
mouthing off at Caesars.

159
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,392
Then the cops find out
who you really are,

160
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,656
and my guess is,
that's not something you want.

161
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,322
Am I right?

162
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,292
Which way?
- Right this way, sir. Thanks, Lou.

163
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,397
Look, I didn't do nothing.
That dealer's been dealing

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,965
too freakin' slow.
- Just save it. I know you've been

165
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,910
casing trouble at other casinos
and tossed a couple of times.

166
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,675
Oh yeah? How do you know that?
- I'll tell you how I know.

167
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,683
'Cause I'm Moe Greene.

168
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,685
That's how I know.

169
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,550
I thought you said
your name was Duane.

170
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,555
It is. Hit the road.
- What about my game?

171
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,820
Your game is over, okay? Now hit
the road before you get into trouble.

172
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,191
Oh come on,
don't do this to me.

173
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,389
Will you give me
another chance here?

174
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,867
Come on, please.
Listen, I've been up for two days here.

175
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,461
Give me a chance, will you?

176
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,606
Here. Just play
a few slots, okay?

177
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,631
Then get the fuck out.

178
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,346
Jesus.

179
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,348
Moe Greene, huh?

180
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,816
Gotta keep it fresh, Tommy.

181
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,819
10 minutes to cocktails.
Care to join?

182
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,821
Nah, rain check.
I got shit to do.

183
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,722
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

184
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,817
Your ex is waiting
out on the boardwalk.

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,556
What, Linda's here?
- Yeah. I was coming over to tell you

186
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,463
when that guy popped off.
She said she'd meet you on the pier

187
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,059
when your shift's over.
- Thanks, Tommy.

188
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,798
Holy shit! I won!

189
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,170
I won! I won!

190
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,175
$100,000!

191
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,200
I won $100,000!

192
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,539
I can't believe it!

193
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,421
Yeah, baby!

194
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
100 grand!

195
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,763
Linda.

196
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,061
Hi. Is that my bike?

197
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,466
I'll get my own if you want.

198
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,471
No, it's fine.
You can use it.

199
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,473
So what's it like
riding to work?

200
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,702
Uh, you know,
it's November, Linda,

201
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,710
so it blows.

202
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,712
What, are you mad?

203
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,306
I'm thrilled.

204
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,317
It's not my fault
you lost your license.

205
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,876
I didn't say it was.
- Well, then why are you mad at me?

206
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,286
I didn't say that.
- Well, why do you seem kinda...

207
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,517
Look, Linda, we're divorced.
You should stop

208
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,526
telling me how I seem.

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,960
Okay.

210
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,261
I'm sorry.
- Um, Mary would like to talk to you.

211
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,096
Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

212
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,534
She just wants to talk to you.
She won't tell me why.

213
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,538
What about Katey,
is she okay?

214
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,733
Yeah, she's fine.
- I like this.

215
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,765
Thank you.
They're both fine.

216
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,012
My...

217
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,014
lawyer...

218
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,846
has suggested

219
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,852
that I revoke
your visitation rights

220
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,285
because of what you did.

221
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,680
Huh!

222
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,825
What? What are you...

223
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,059
Okay, look, I'm sorry, but l...

224
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,760
Linda, they take
my visitation rights away,

225
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,896
that means I can't see
Mary and Kate.

226
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,930
I understand what it means.

227
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,943
What do you...

228
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,945
you got everything.

229
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,776
What else do you want?

230
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,782
I want you to promise me
you won't drink

231
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,807
around the kids anymore.

232
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,444
Linda, please. Okay?

233
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,356
You're a drunk, Duane.
Do you understand?

234
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,360
That's what
this is all about.

235
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,988
I'm not a drunk.

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,590
Who-who...

237
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,399
okay, yes, for Christ's sakes,

238
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,462
I drink too much sometimes,

239
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,473
but, Linda, come on,
I'm not a drunk.

240
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,340
You're drunk now.
- Oh my God.

241
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,175
I just got off, okay?
I had two quick drinks.

242
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,807
Why? Why?
It's quarter after 12:00

243
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,647
during the daytime!
- Not for me, it's not.

244
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,710
I just got off work,
remember?

245
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,722
Some of us work.

246
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,589
Yeah, you work, and I don't.

247
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,594
You drink, I don't.

248
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,290
It's quarter after 12:00.
- Okay.

249
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,059
You're not safe
around the kids.

250
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,402
What were you even thinking?

251
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,406
My God, you know
how crazy I was?

252
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,170
I was out of my mind!
- Okay, okay, would you... not so loud?

253
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,145
I was just bringing her home.

254
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,147
I was frantic!
And I'm telling you...

255
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,048
Just calm down.
- If you drink around my kids again...

256
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,052
My... our kids!

257
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,611
Our kids!

258
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,228
Okay.

259
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,630
I'll buy you a new one.

260
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,881
Duane.
- Hi Carl.

261
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,883
Let's take a walk.

262
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,384
I'm calling a taxi.

263
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,979
What do you need a taxi for?
What's wrong with your car?

264
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,286
I got a '92 Explorer
with over 100,000 miles on it.

265
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,123
I got an '89 Volvo
my son uses

266
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,391
that got almost
200,000 miles on it,

267
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,898
runs like the top.
- How is he doing, by the way?

268
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,526
He's busy bankrupting me
at college.

269
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,968
Yeah? What's that running you?
- About 100 grand.

270
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,235
Jesus Christ.
- For a degree in communications.

271
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,243
What's that?
- Radio, television... I don't know.

272
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,212
Okay, Mrs. Fillipi,

273
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,215
tell us again what you saw.

274
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,615
I seen him

275
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,950
give him a handful of quarters

276
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,888
which he used
on my machine...

277
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,118
That ain't your machine,
you crazy old whacko.

278
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,786
Hey, let her finish.
...before he won that money.

279
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,626
I should have won that money.
- What are you talking about?

280
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,462
That ain't your machine.
- I play that machine every morning.

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,468
All right.
- I was coming right over

282
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,470
with my quarters
from my other machine...

283
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,836
You crazy freakin' whacko.
- All right.

284
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,864
Whacko!
- That's enough!

285
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,069
Tommy says it was
Mr. Alonso's quarter.

286
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,208
Mr. Alonso?

287
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,619
Oh, yeah.

288
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,621
Yeah, it was his.

289
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,590
Mr. Alonso was, um,
playing blackjack,

290
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,593
he had a problem with Lou,

291
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,595
we had a little talk, I suggested

292
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,460
he cool off by playing some slots,

293
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,466
and he got lucky.

294
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,468
That's it, then?

295
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,470
Mrs. Fillipi,

296
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,496
Mr. Alonso won that money
fair and square.

297
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,532
Now why don't you
go back to that machine?

298
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,909
Maybe it's still hot.
- I come here every day.

299
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,710
I'm a widow
on a fixed income.

300
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,718
I deserve that money.
Everybody knows it's my machine.

301
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,482
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Fillipi...
- I deserve that money.

302
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,490
But there's nothing I can do.

303
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,719
I'm a widow
on a fixed income.

304
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,057
Come with me.
- It's my money.

305
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,996
Mr. Alonso, collect your winnings

306
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,898
and don't come back.
- You said I won it fair and square.

307
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,902
How come you're giving me
a hard time?

308
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,234
'Cause you're a liar and a cheat,
and you've been

309
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,571
kicked out of several casinos
on several occasions.

310
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,576
Well...

311
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,204
Yeah, okay, whatever.

312
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,770
But I did win this.

313
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,148
You did.
Enjoy your winnings.

314
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,050
Have a nice day.

315
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,726
You know something,
Duane?

316
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,819
Sometimes lately

317
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,127
I get the feeling
you're not happy at your job.

318
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,563
I'm happy, Carl.
- Are you, Duane?

319
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,934
Because what just
walked out that door is

320
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,735
a potential
public relations nightmare.

321
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,140
Poor old lady loses,

322
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,144
scumbag wins.

323
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,703
I need sound judgment
from my pit bosses, Duane,

324
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,715
or else it's my ass.
You understand?

325
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,582
I understand.
- Good.

326
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,985
Thanks for coming in, Duane.

327
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,037
I don't see him.

328
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,733
I don't know if we should be
looking in here or not.

329
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,106
Let's just put it
in the box.

330
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,111
Would you do it?

331
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,613
I cut myself
on the mailbox.

332
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,505
Ow, ow! Fred,
you're on my foot.

333
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,508
Get off my foot.
- For chrissake, what about my hip?

334
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,510
Hello, Fred.
Hey, Wally.

335
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,910
I'm sorry, I was just kidding there.
Are you okay?

336
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,539
Do I look okay?

337
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,550
Just tell him
about the invitation.

338
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,552
Wait a minute.
Okay there.

339
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,554
Huh?
- The invitation.

340
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,613
Oh, the invitation.
There's an invitation

341
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,318
in your mailbox
to Thanksgiving dinner.

342
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,327
Me?

343
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,591
Yes, you, your family.

344
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,598
Oh, uh, how is that going?

345
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,600
Still divorced, Fred.

346
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,602
Oh, I'm sorry.

347
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,299
I realize that. I just...

348
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,071
neither one of us
wanted to assume anything.

349
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,078
Well, it's just me.

350
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,013
Um, are you dating anyone?

351
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,016
Oh, Fred.

352
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,018
Sorry.

353
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,850
Look, thanks.
Thanks a lot, Fred.

354
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,856
Thanks, Wally.

355
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,620
Uh, well,
I'll check my schedule

356
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,060
and you know,
I may be working, but...

357
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,554
What do you mean, working?
On Thanksgiving Day they make you work?

358
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,567
Casinos are non-stop, Fred.

359
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,432
I work holidays all the time.

360
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,438
Oh.
- Fred, come on.

361
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,872
Anyway, good night.

362
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,637
Okay, good night.
- It's in the mailbox.

363
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,949
Mary!
- Hi, Daddy.

364
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,956
Hey. Hey, you know what?
Grab your bike.

365
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,958
I'll race you
to the boardwalk.

366
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,893
Wait.

367
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,159
Linda, it's Duane.
I'm taking Mary for a ride!

368
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,991
A bike ride!

369
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,669
Come on, slowpoke.

370
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,937
Where's Katey?
- She's with Mom and Bob.

371
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,911
Who's Bob?
- Mom's friend.

372
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,913
He jogs every day.

373
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,381
He's in real good shape.

374
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,642
What, and I'm not?

375
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,485
Well, he's not older
like you are.

376
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,894
Well, how old is Bob?

377
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,919
I don't know.

378
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,860
So what's the deal
with Jogging Bob?

379
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,496
What do you mean?

380
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,302
Well, how long has
he been Mom's friend?

381
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,366
I don't know.

382
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,379
You like him?
- He's all right.

383
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,582
So Mom said you
wanted to talk to me.

384
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,325
Yeah.
- Yeah, what about?

385
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,090
Do you think
I can live with you?

386
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,393
Why? Why do you
want to live with me?

387
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,456
Just because.

388
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,263
Hey, because why?

389
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,395
Dad!
- What?

390
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,998
Just because.
- Hey hey hey, hold up, hold up.

391
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,373
Mary, you know
the deal, all right?

392
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,605
You live with Mom,
and I get to visit.

393
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,045
That's a shitty deal!
- Hey hey!

394
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:07,108
Watch it.
Come on.

395
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,211
And I hate Kate.

396
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,347
You don't hate your sister, Mary.
- Yes, I do.

397
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,381
She called me fat
in front of Bob,

398
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,883
and Bob said he'd take me jogging
so I can lose some weight.

399
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,021
I hate her stupid guts!

400
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,760
Okay okay,
hey hey, come on.

401
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,496
Your sister
loves you, okay?

402
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,766
I'll talk to her.
She shouldn't have said that.

403
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,968
I'll talk to her, okay?

404
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,307
I love you, okay?
- Okay.

405
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,394
Hey.
- Hi.

406
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,430
Sorry about the other day.

407
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,306
You didn't have to buy me a new bike.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

408
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,574
Can I sit down?
- Sure.

409
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,584
Here.

410
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,643
Can I have some
Honeycombs?

411
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,484
I'd rather you didn't.

412
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,047
Why are your feet wet?
- They're not wet.

413
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,820
Look at your feet.
They're soaking wet.

414
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,296
Sorry, it's my fault.
We took a ride on the beach.

415
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,355
Okay, go change your shoes,

416
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,959
and you can have
a small bowl of cereal.

417
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,196
We're leaving for lunch in 15 minutes.
- Thank you.

418
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,637
You're welcome.
- What? You're leaving?

419
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,641
I thought you wanted me
to come talk to her.

420
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,143
Yeah, I did, but you didn't tell me
you were coming now.

421
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,078
I thought maybe we
could all do something.

422
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,513
Well, like what?

423
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,517
I thought we could all...
I don't know...

424
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:50,282
maybe have dinner later.
- I can't.

425
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,756
Lunch?
- Hm-mmm.

426
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,262
Late breakfast?

427
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,890
No?

428
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,332
Can I interest you
in a "glitten"?

429
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,303
It's not a glove,
it's not a mitten.

430
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,999
This here's a "glitten."

431
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,236
No thanks.
- Okay.

432
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,446
Hey, Lin.

433
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,645
Duane.

434
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,984
Hey.

435
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,296
Lin, come on, please.

436
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,424
Please.

437
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,868
I've been thinking

438
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,872
about what you said,
and I think...

439
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,908
I think I'm gonna
try to do it,

440
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,410
and if I give up
drinking altogether,

441
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,423
I was wondering
if maybe you could...

442
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,221
I don't know... I was hoping
you would call off your lawyer.

443
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,886
Hi.

444
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,824
Bob Flynn, this is
my ex-husband Duane.

445
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,894
Hey, Duane, nice meeting you.
- You too.

446
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,805
Bob is going to be
taking us to lunch.

447
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,172
Yeah, you want to come?
We're just going around the corner.

448
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,541
Yeah, Daddy, come.

449
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,071
Yeah, quick bite?

450
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:30,318
Oh, did you tell Daddy who came?
- Who came where?

451
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,086
Oh my God, let me see.
Two in one day?

452
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,288
And the tooth fairy
gave you 5 bucks?

453
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,389
Thank you very much.
So what are you gonna get?

454
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,424
A necklace.
- A necklace, huh?

455
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,301
Well, we talked about that.

456
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,398
That's more of a grownup present
that costs more than 5 dollars.

457
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,102
What kind of necklace?

458
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,975
It's the same as Mommy's.
- Oh, yeah, which one?

459
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,537
It's nothing. It's, um...

460
00:26:56,581 --> 00:27:00,915
It's a... well, I had seen
this thing.

461
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,920
I drew it out for a guy.

462
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,047
I designed a little...

463
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,115
And he had it made
for my birthday.

464
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,991
That is true.

465
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,258
It's great.

466
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,335
You got my flowers.

467
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,600
I did, thank you.
They were beautiful. Beautiful.

468
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,904
Bob threw them out.
- Mary!

469
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,842
I saw him throw them out.

470
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,505
Bob did not just throw them out.
- Lin, it's fine.

471
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,912
Mary, he didn't throw them out.
- No, what happened was

472
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,350
there were a little ripe, and I thought
it was time to throw them out.

473
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,513
We would never ever
just throw them away.

474
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,648
Lin, it's okay.
It's been a week and a half.

475
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,286
I'm glad you got 'em.
Happy birthday.

476
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,389
Thank you.

477
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,807
Hey, you guys, it's time
for "Powerpuff Girls."

478
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,710
Whoo!

479
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,079
"Powerpuff Girls."
- I'll be in in a minute.

480
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,981
Okay, don't sit too close.

481
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,045
Woo, thank God for
"Powerpuff Girls," eh?

482
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,148
You can say that again.

483
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,182
Well, I gotta go.

484
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,524
Thanks again for lunch.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

485
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,054
Listen, it was really a pleasure.
- Yeah, you too.

486
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,192
Mary.

487
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,260
Oh, yeah, how'd that go? Excuse me.
- Good.

488
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,737
She's okay.

489
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:31,833
She's just mad at Katey
for calling her fat,

490
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,242
but she'll be all right.
- I thought that's what it was.

491
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,611
You know, I had told her
that I am happy to help her

492
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,843
if she wants to
get in a little better shape,

493
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,284
'cause there's easy things
that I can do with diet, exercise.

494
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,845
Real easy stuff.
- Yeah, well, she's eight, so...

495
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,290
Yeah, no, I know.
- I mean, there's plenty of time for her

496
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,556
to be self-conscious later.

497
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,190
Yeah, sure. Although it's never
too early to start good habits,

498
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,724
especially with nutrition,
'cause at a young age, the fat cells...

499
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,294
You know what?
He's very interested in nutrition.

500
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,272
He's really healthy,

501
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,504
lives a healthy lifestyle.
- No, I know. Mary said "Jogging Bob."

502
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,502
Just Bob is fine.
- Huh?

503
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,174
Just Bob.

504
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:15,550
Well, Just Bob,
I'm just telling you

505
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,613
that she doesn't
really need to hear you

506
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,217
telling her she needs
to lose weight, first of all.

507
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,093
That's the wrong thing to be telling
an eight-year-old girl.

508
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,928
And second of all,
it's none of your fucking business.

509
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,458
Okay, you know what?
Because if you're gonna be an asshole...

510
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,438
Ah, asshole.
- Guys guys, really, it's just no...

511
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,737
Calm down.
- Duane, what are you doing?

512
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,074
Duane, what are you doing?
Duane, stop it, stop it!

513
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,512
Hi, Daddy, are you staying?

514
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,476
No no, I gotta go.

515
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,595
Love you.

516
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,568
Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye, Daddy.

517
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,695
Stop stop stop.

518
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,539
Hey, Duane.

519
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,167
Hey, Frank.

520
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,638
Duane.
- Anthony.

521
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,583
You know Aldo?
- Yeah.

522
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,110
I mean, I don't know him,
but he's a comic, right?

523
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,147
Not for long he ain't.

524
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:10,231
What's up?
- Aldo got Michelle pregnant.

525
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,168
Who's Michelle?

526
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,639
You know, the waitress
in the lounge, night shift,

527
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,073
18, 19.
She's got that tit-too.

528
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,306
Oh, yeah, Michelle.
What, he got her pregnant?

529
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,837
Yep, she started showing

530
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,010
and Rahmn was gonna fire her,
so then she told him it was Aldo.

531
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,485
Fuck. What's she doing
with Aldo anyway?

532
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,853
He's like 55 years old.
How do you know?

533
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,984
Patty told me.
- Who's Patty?

534
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,462
Bartender. You know,
she's got the black hair

535
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,760
with the white...
- Oh, yeah, like a skunk.

536
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,700
I'm telling your ass right now, Aldo!
- Screw you, you fat bastard.

537
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,034
Who the hell you think you gonna
fucking turn out on the fucking...

538
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,369
Screw this!

539
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,432
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

540
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,435
Now don't come back here anymore.
You understand me?

541
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,778
Do you understand me?

542
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,147
Yeah, yeah, all of it. Get off!
- Shut the fuck up!

543
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,732
Hey, Barney Fife,
you got your shot.

544
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,227
You're on Tuesday night.
I hope you're funny.

545
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,040
Hey, listen. You thought
any more about what I said

546
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,047
about the roommate thing?

547
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,811
You can't ride that bike
everywhere. Let's face it.

548
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,086
Why do you want
to live with me, Anthony?

549
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,987
Why, I told you why.
I'm looking to be closer to work.

550
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,856
So just get an apartment.
It's easy.

551
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,225
Yeah, but...
- But what? But what?

552
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,459
What do you want
from me? Seriously.

553
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,432
I mean, you're...

554
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,799
What, you really
think you're gonna be some star?

555
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,532
You're... what,
you're 38 years old.

556
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,599
You're dreaming, man.
You're funny, but you're dreaming.

557
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,676
Yeah, well,
what's your dream, Duane?

558
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,878
Tell me what
your dream is, man.

559
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,944
At least I got one.

560
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,952
You know what?
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,827
It's none of my fucking business,
Anthony. I'm sorry.

562
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,234
It's cool.
It's all right.

563
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,864
You, uh...

564
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,933
So you really think
I'm funny?

565
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,645
Hey, come on, you know?
- Yes yes,

566
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,947
you're a funny guy, Anthony.

567
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,976
I knew it.
I knew it, man.

568
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,513
Look, I just don't
want to live alone, all right?

569
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,184
That's all. That's why.

570
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:52,322
Yeah, I'm 38 years old and I live
with my mom in Cape May, New Jersey.

571
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,558
But look, I know you better than
anyone else at work,

572
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,692
and I don't want to work
in a casino all night

573
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,759
and then go home to some piece
of shit apartment I'm renting

574
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,364
like a fucking vampire.
I don't want to do that shit, you know?

575
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,671
And I just thought
we can help each other out.

576
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,677
No harm, no foul.

577
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,679
You know,
if it works, great.

578
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,841
If it doesn't,
it doesn't, you know?

579
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,643
Hey.

580
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,094
The house, it's not even mine,
it's my parents', so...

581
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,158
You don't have to
pay me any rent, okay?

582
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,897
Just give me some money
for utilities and phone

583
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,872
and the occasional ride,

584
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,000
and we'll see how it goes.

585
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:42,672
Coast 101 weather...
it sucks! Ha!

586
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,738
Official weather for ya,

587
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,512
it's a nor'easter, mister,
so if you're inside, stay there.

588
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,213
That's my advice anyway.

589
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,086
Rick D'Angelis rockin'
the Jersey shoreline...

590
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,681
Shut up.

591
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:58,218
See, that guy, he drives me crazy.
He thinks he's so funny.

592
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,356
Who?
- Rick D'Angelis.

593
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,731
Rockin' the Jersey shoreline.

594
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,066
Shut up.

595
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,279
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

596
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,373
I don't know.
Probably just spend it with my neighbors

597
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,577
Wally and Fred.

598
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:25,153
Is Linda taking the kids
to visit her folks?

599
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,623
No, I don't think so.

600
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,650
So why aren't you
having dinner with them?

601
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,663
It's not gonna happen.

602
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,325
Oh. All right.

603
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,206
You know, my old man
was always on the road.

604
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,709
My mom was working
her ass off

605
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,576
keeping me and my
two brothers together.

606
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,309
She'd bust his balls.
He'd drink a little.

607
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,341
Not bad, you know?

608
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:58,082
But it always
worked out with them.

609
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,319
You know? I mean,
we felt it.

610
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,193
They just... they just...
they just loved each other.

611
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,663
Sickness and health.

612
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,461
That's right.

613
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,992
That's right.

614
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,699
Give me another,
will you?

615
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,608
I've got to go.
Go on inside.

616
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,381
Would you help me in?

617
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,650
Duane, it's pouring.

618
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,850
I've got to go.

619
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,486
No.

620
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,966
You have got to be kidding me.
- Oh, no!

621
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,212
Answer the phone!

622
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,242
Kakinada.
- Oh, God.

623
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,811
Do you think
I can get a taxi?

624
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,880
I don't know.

625
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,892
Have you been
to Kakinada?

626
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,953
God! Shit!
What am I gonna do?

627
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,491
Duane, I am serious.
I have got to get back.

628
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,595
All right, come here.

629
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,334
Tell you what.

630
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,365
You go to bed with me,

631
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,207
and I'll let you
borrow my boogie board.

632
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:33,047
Duane, I am so not going to
sleep with you.

633
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,676
Why not?

634
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,779
Duane, stop.

635
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,916
Why?
- Because you're drunk,

636
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,917
and you smell...
like a dead rat.

637
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,193
Oh, and that's
a bad thing.

638
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,564
God.

639
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,832
Ahh.
You're probably right.

640
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,305
Shit.
- Hey, you know, you're welcome to stay

641
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,331
as long as you want.

642
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,871
Think I'm gonna take a nap.

643
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,611
Get over here!
This is Duane.

644
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,986
He's the manager
at Caesars, and, Duane,

645
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,888
this is Stephanie, right?

646
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,120
Yeah.
- Stephanie, okay, and Sharon.

647
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,129
Sharon's got that
Julia Roberts vibe happening.

648
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,030
I'm feeling it, and this is
the lovely Arlene.

649
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,160
And over here
this is Erica.

650
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,501
So listen, ladies,
this is what I'm thinking.

651
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,473
I'm headlining Tuesday night
at the Blue Martini.

652
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,477
I do comedy and since Duane
manages the casino,

653
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,503
I'm thinking we'd love to have you guys
come out for the show.

654
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,005
You manage there?
- Duane's been there what, 10 years?

655
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,076
Almost nine.
- Yeah, almost nine.

656
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,088
And you're headlining?
- Yeah.

657
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,555
How come I never
heard of you?

658
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,558
Oh, no, I'm just
getting into standup.

659
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,686
I'm mostly an actor,
and Duane, he came out to L.A.,

660
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,697
and he invited me out here 'cause
he saw me at the Comedy Store.

661
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,097
Mostly it's the acting thing.

662
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,500
You know "JAG" on CBS?

663
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,937
I heard of that. That's like
that young guy, the cute guy.

664
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,737
Anyone seen it, anyone?

665
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,904
Okay, well, I do
a regular role on there.

666
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,209
I play a Marine doctor.

667
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,376
It's sort of best friend part
with the main character.

668
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,783
Really?

669
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,879
Because of Thanksgiving,
we have a couple hiatus weeks,

670
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,913
so I'm out here
doing my act at the casino,

671
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:30,120
some other pub.
- Pub?

672
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,688
Publicity. You know,
Regis and Kelly Lee,

673
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,461
Conan O'Brien, stuff like that.
- Then back to L. A?

674
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,060
We got three more shows
to shoot before Christmas.

675
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,401
Maybe we'll come.

676
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,431
Cool.
- If I can have your autograph.

677
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,443
You can have
whatever you want, baby!

678
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,945
Tuesday night at 10:00
in the lounge!

679
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,880
Bring your dancing shoes!

680
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,077
"JAG"?

681
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,450
Yeah, college chicks
don't watch "JAG."

682
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,455
Different "dermographic."

683
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,030
Howdy.

684
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,738
I'm Anthony.

685
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,211
Oh, yes, we saw.

686
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,214
Fred and Wally.

687
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,411
Duane told me all
about you guys.

688
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,248
Uh-huh-huh.

689
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,154
I just moved in.
- We saw you moving in.

690
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,713
How do you know Duane?

691
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,283
We work together.
- At the casinos?

692
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,589
Yeah, at Caesars.

693
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,358
We haven't been
up to the casinos in years.

694
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,492
Actually, we saw
Johnny Mathis about...

695
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:54,334
Yeah, he's good.
...some time ago.

696
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,236
How long ago
would that have been, Wally?

697
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,367
I have no idea.
- Yo, Duane!

698
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,176
Well, see, we're here to tell Duane
that we're changing the time

699
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,705
of Thanksgiving dinner to 4:00.
- Oh, Thanksgiving.

700
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,710
Yes yes, we're
having Duane and...

701
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,714
say, are you going to be here?
- Yeah.

702
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,785
Well, Anthony,
why don't you join us?

703
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,162
Really?
Great, absolutely.

704
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,997
Oh, couple things, all right?
I'm a strict vegetarian,

705
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,731
and I have ADHD, so you know,
I have a hard time sitting still.

706
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,832
Hey, Fred, hey, Wally.
- We just invited your friend to join us

707
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,105
for Thanksgiving.
- Oh, good.

708
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:38,046
Listen, good to meet you guys.
Wally, Fred, thanks for the invite.

709
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,073
Peace.

710
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,783
That's my new roommate.
- Yes, he was telling us.

711
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,917
He's quite a character.
- Oh, yeah, he's nonstop.

712
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,654
So Linda and the girls?

713
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,720
Yeah, they're gonna be having dinner
with Linda's boyfriend.

714
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,665
Linda has a boyfriend.

715
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:02,465
Well, these things happen,

716
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,339
and life goes on.

717
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,073
Honestly, guys,
I just got off the phone with my lawyer.

718
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,276
Linda's trying
to take the kids away,

719
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,841
so I don't know if I'm gonna make it
to dinner Thursday.

720
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,514
Well, that's
all right, Duane.

721
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,853
We're just a couple
of old men,

722
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,587
but any way we
can help, we will.

723
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,960
So why don't you go back inside
with your crazy roommate

724
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,124
and if you can,

725
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,758
come to
Thanksgiving dinner

726
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,168
Thursday at 4:00.

727
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:38,140
And we'll all... give thanks.

728
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,215
Duane. Sit.
- Carl.

729
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:13,004
The old lady went to Larry,
that prick.

730
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,207
Duane, I love you
like a son,

731
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,374
but what the fuck
are you doing?

732
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,350
How bad is this, Carl?

733
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,085
It's the game, Duane.

734
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,856
Oh, man, don't... don't...
don't tell me that.

735
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,125
I mean, I'm...

736
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,530
I'm in the middle
of it here.

737
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,161
Duane, listen to me.
You listening?

738
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,433
We're all in the middle
of it here.

739
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,667
I just took out
a second fucking mortgage

740
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,369
to pay for a fucking
degree in communications.

741
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,378
I don't even know
what that is.

742
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,539
But I'm not starring
in a fucking movie,

743
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,142
doing shit that costs
me my fucking job.

744
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:59,218
Duane, my fucking
hands are tied here.

745
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,554
Larry almost fired me.

746
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,719
You understand?

747
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,226
You saved any money?

748
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,469
I think Larry's days
may be numbered.

749
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,166
I heard they
offered him Vegas.

750
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,174
If he takes it,
we all move up.

751
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,473
I become Larry.
You're back in.

752
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,447
We'll see.

753
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,779
I'm sorry, kid.

754
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,275
How about you
finish out the week?

755
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,561
It's fucking mad, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

756
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,590
Why?

757
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,770
Because it was.
- Why, because why?

758
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,707
We did it.

759
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,074
I know we did it.

760
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,512
So... so I thought
it was good.

761
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,176
Mad, that's all.

762
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,547
Oh, no, it was great.

763
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,888
Okay, take, you know,
take a little longer to answer that.

764
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,353
God, that's all right.

765
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,031
No, it was...

766
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,435
I'm sure it was great.
I'm sure it was great.

767
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:57,497
It was great.

768
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,609
Hey, can I tell you something?

769
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,776
Yeah.

770
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,954
I mean, I think I can tell you this
'cause... you know,

771
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,225
'cause we're friends.

772
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,732
No, that's not what...
- I'm a friend, am I?

773
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,961
You know what I mean.

774
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,361
You know what I mean.

775
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,306
I'm kidding, Duane.

776
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:35,334
What? What?

777
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,746
I just hope you understand
when I say that...

778
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,853
I still love Linda.

779
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,320
You know?

780
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,957
Okay.

781
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,268
You know?
- Yeah.

782
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,930
No, Gina.

783
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,135
Whatever, Duane.

784
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,577
No, don't go.

785
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,542
Hey, Jake. Jaker, hey,
come here for a sec.

786
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,411
Hey, Mr. Hopwood!

787
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,417
Hey, Jake, how you doing?
- Good.

788
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,919
Good. Good.
Listen, can you do me a favor?

789
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,853
What's that?

790
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,322
I want you to go
inside and find Mary and Kate, okay,

791
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,588
and tell them I need
to see them real quick, all right?

792
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,787
I just need to tell them something.
Can you do that?

793
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,319
No.

794
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,355
No, why not?

795
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,368
Sorry, Mr. Hopwood,
I gotta go.

796
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,427
All right, don't worry
about it, Jake.

797
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,304
Kate has playtime
anyways now, I think.

798
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,367
Oh, yeah, that's her.
Hey, Katey!

799
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,742
Come here.

800
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,514
I'm her Dad.
Sweetie, hi.

801
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,679
Hi, Daddy, what are
you doing here?

802
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,656
Oh, well, I was
just around the corner,

803
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,659
and I knew you have
playtime now,

804
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,184
so I thought I'd say
a quick hello.

805
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,197
Are you warm enough, sweetie?
- Mm-hmm.

806
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,994
Yeah, you sure?
- I'm sure.

807
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,661
Yeah?
How's school today?

808
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,500
Good. We practiced
for our play,

809
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,506
a Thanksgiving play.

810
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,064
Oh, yeah.

811
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,576
I'm a Native American.

812
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,240
A what?
- A Native American, like an Indian.

813
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:54,773
Oh oh, that's great, sweetie.

814
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:58,083
Yeah, it's fun to be the Indian, huh?
Pilgrims are boring.

815
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,056
Can you come?
- Oh, sweetie,

816
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:05,187
you know how I have
work in the mornings.

817
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,196
All right, kids.
- Hey.

818
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,289
Don't get upset, okay, please.
- Come on in, time for class.

819
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,132
Sweetie, I just wanted to come by
and say a nice hello, okay?

820
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,162
You know about
when I work.

821
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,107
Hello, sir? We're going inside.
It's too cold.

822
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:22,134
Oh, all right.
- Can I help you with anything?

823
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,841
No no, she'll be right there.

824
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:29,011
Hey hey, I'm sorry
about the play, okay?

825
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,452
I just wanted to see you,

826
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,457
see your sweet face,
sweetie Kate, okay? Come here.

827
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,460
Come here, give me a kiss.
Come here.

828
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,758
Kate.

829
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,728
Daddy, let go of me.

830
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,602
Off you go.

831
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,778
I been sober 15 years,

832
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,785
and every time
my mother-in-law

833
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,014
makes that funky-ass
nutloaf thing,

834
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,523
I want to jump.
You understand?

835
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:11,550
Not fall, jump off
the motherfucking wagon.

836
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,564
Now, we know
this is a bad time

837
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,964
or can be a bad time.

838
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,366
The holidays ain't for drunks
who wanna do right.

839
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,926
You know
what I'm saying?

840
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,371
So let's talk
about that.

841
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,374
We talk about it.

842
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,740
How about you?

843
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,745
Yeah, that's right, you.

844
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:33,647
Sneaky ass rooky.
I see you sneaking in back there.

845
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:36,117
My name is William.
I run this group here.

846
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,718
Welcome. Come on in,
get yourself a chair.

847
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,815
Join the circle.

848
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,330
Why don't you
tell us your name

849
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,355
and a little bit
about yourself?

850
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,106
Um...

851
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,268
I'm Duane.
Duane Hopwood.

852
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,141
Good morning, Duane.

853
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,443
Tell us, what's up
with you today?

854
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:08,975
Well, my lawyer said

855
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,987
I should do this.

856
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,989
I don't...

857
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,356
I've never been to one
of these things, so...

858
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,361
but I got
a court thing coming up,

859
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,955
and he thought

860
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,965
that this might help.

861
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,990
What kind
of court thing?

862
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,402
I got stopped
down on the parkway

863
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,269
last week on a D.W.I.,

864
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,970
and he thinks that
the judge might like it

865
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,604
if I showed up for
a few of these things.

866
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,615
Is this the first time
you've been busted on a D.W. I?

867
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,209
Yeah, first time.
Hopefully, the last.

868
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,220
I heard that.

869
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,222
So your lawyer thinks
you should be here?

870
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,224
What do you think?

871
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,226
What do I think?
I don't know.

872
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,626
If it'll help, you know?

873
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,994
I mean, I'm not sure

874
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:58,797
I need to be here, but...

875
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,269
Well, let me tell you, Duane,

876
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,501
I'm a recovering alcoholic,
but I'm also a lawyer myself,

877
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,874
and that's advice I'd give
to somebody with a real problem,

878
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,538
not a first-time D.W.I.

879
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,547
Now, you're in a room
full of people

880
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,482
who thought they could
get better themselves, including me,

881
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,418
but my experience... and I've been
doing this for a long time...

882
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,480
tells me that when a person walks
through that door,

883
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,855
they need help.

884
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,861
We're your friends.

885
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,261
Nothing leaves this room.

886
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,528
Nothing.

887
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,496
I...

888
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,437
I had my daughter
in the car.

889
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,726
My wife's lawyer...

890
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,630
I'm divorced...

891
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,634
is telling her

892
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,636
that she should have

893
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,639
my visitation rights
revoked,

894
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,471
which means I won't be able
to see my two daughters.

895
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,376
If that happens...

896
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,937
um...

897
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,779
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

898
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,014
You don't think
you're an alcoholic, Duane?

899
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,914
I don't know. I'm...

900
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,086
my wife says I am...
my ex-wife.

901
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,291
My lawyer says
I should be here.

902
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,135
Me? L... you know...

903
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,474
I'm just...
I'm just sad...

904
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,103
is all.

905
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,443
I'm just sad right now,

906
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,449
because...

907
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,747
look, I'm not a drunk.

908
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,652
I, um...

909
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,054
I hate that word.

910
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,787
I mean, I work hard
and I pay my bills,

911
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:09,731
and I'm just... I'm just...

912
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,532
And I can't have them
take my kids away.

913
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,941
I can't have that.

914
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,968
I'm sorry.
I gotta go.

915
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,041
Hey, Duane.

916
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,986
Promise us
you'll come back.

917
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,011
Yeah.

918
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,829
Big Steve.
- 'Morning, Counselor.

919
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,893
That's her lawyer, right?

920
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,926
Yeah. He's not
a bad guy, actually.

921
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,939
We play softball together.

922
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,100
Shitty third baseman.
- Oh yeah?

923
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,110
The worst.

924
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,135
Plus, he runs like a girl.

925
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,214
Man, just try to relax.

926
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,049
Remember what
I told you, okay?

927
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,214
Mr. Hopwood,

928
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,622
do you wish to say anything?

929
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,218
Yes, Your Honor.

930
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,258
Now is the time.

931
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,733
Um, Linda, you know
I feel real bad

932
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,399
about having Mary
in the car.

933
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,069
Mr. Hopwood, please confine
your remarks to me,

934
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,943
not to your ex-wife.
- You know me, Linda, come on.

935
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,243
I would never do anything...
- Mr. Hopwood.

936
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,514
Yes, Your Honor?
- I will not warn you again.

937
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,987
Okay.

938
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,252
Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Honor.

939
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,953
Look, I know
I'm at fault here.

940
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,791
I mean, Linda's...
she's a great mom.

941
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,301
I mean, she's really
raised them.

942
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,769
She's had to be
the bad guy sometimes,

943
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,796
with the discipline,
because I just wasn't...

944
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,241
I mean, I was at work.

945
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,870
I was always at work.

946
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,442
I see that now.
I didn't know...

947
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,286
And then... then she left,

948
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,757
and it got worse.

949
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,061
You know... I know
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

950
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,066
but now I've lost my job,
Your Honor, and...

951
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,125
Who told you
not to tell me that?

952
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,730
Nobody.
Nobody, Your Honor.

953
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,797
- Nobody?
- No.

954
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,809
No, I just know.

955
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,811
Look, I'm sorry.

956
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:39,246
Your Honor,

957
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,273
I love my kids.

958
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,349
I love my ex-wife, still,

959
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,448
but I know she deserves
to be happy.

960
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,550
So do I.

961
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,626
My parents were
together 49 years.

962
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,667
And after my mother died,
six months later

963
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,669
my father, he just...

964
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,332
he went... too,

965
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,365
'cause he had
no reason to stay.

966
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:12,838
You see what I'm saying?
I need a reason to stay.

967
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,594
Your Honor.

968
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,502
What's with the bat?

969
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,946
I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Don't do that.

970
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,958
No no, it'll be all right.
- Don't do that!

971
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,460
Duane, listen to me.
You wanna go to jail, you idiot?

972
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,792
I'm telling you, don't go there.
- Why not?!

973
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,457
You gotta calm down.
- I am. Okay.

974
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,227
I'm telling you,
you gotta calm down.

975
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,168
It all depends on the judge
and how she views things.

976
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,171
Come on,
I was just upset.

977
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,070
I wasn't gonna hurt
anyone with the bat.

978
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,735
Duane, go home.
Stay there.

979
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,767
I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

980
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,738
You hear me?

981
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,915
Gobble gobble gobble, baby.

982
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,189
Thursday is the day.
Thanksgiving!

983
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,794
Turkey holocaust.

984
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,393
Oh-hh, poor bastards.

985
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,836
"Hey, what is that,
an axe?" Ouch.

986
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,432
Time to spend some quality time
with the family,

987
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,500
stuff yourself like
the little piggy you are.

988
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,568
Cranberry sauce,
potatoes, string beans,

989
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,580
candied yams...
ooh baby!

990
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,605
Coast 101!

991
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,462
Hey, how did it go?

992
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,726
I don't know.

993
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,734
I'll find out
this afternoon.

994
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,202
Oh, all right.
Sit down, man.

995
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,535
I wanna run
some stuff by you.

996
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,110
Well, what do you think?

997
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,177
I figured I'd come out
like this, you know?

998
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,082
I've got this whole pissed off turkey
monologue worked out.

999
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,279
Just wrote it.
I thought I'd run it by you.

1000
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,914
It's brand new,
but I think it'll kill.

1001
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,186
I mean, I feel like I gotta
grab 'em by the balls.

1002
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,193
Just get, you know, nuts.

1003
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,888
Okay.

1004
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,726
You think it's too much?

1005
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,857
No no, it's...

1006
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,868
it's very funny.

1007
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,767
So can you listen?

1008
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,772
It's been
a rough morning.

1009
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,967
I think I just need
to be alone for a while.

1010
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,976
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
I'll get out of here.

1011
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,137
No, that's all right.
That's not what I meant.

1012
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,307
No, really, I'm cool. I have
a couple other props to pick up anyway.

1013
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:02,545
So, you're coming tonight, right?
- Oh yeah, I'll be there.

1014
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:05,281
Cool, man, 'cause I'm freaked.
I am so freaked.

1015
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,983
For real. But in a good way,
you know what I mean?

1016
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,992
I mean, things happen
for a reason, Duane.

1017
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,926
You know what I mean?
They really do.

1018
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,327
Everything's
gonna be okay.

1019
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,331
For both of us,
you know?

1020
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,833
It's gonna work out.
And you've been a great friend,

1021
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:22,099
and I really hope things work out
with your wife and kids.

1022
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,368
I'm gonna say a prayer.

1023
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,375
Thanks, man.

1024
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,377
And, you know,
if I don't see you

1025
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,005
before you go up there,
you break a drumstick.

1026
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,015
I like that,
right there.

1027
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,314
That's funny. I'm telling you,
you're a funny guy, Duane.

1028
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,343
I'm gonna
write that down.

1029
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,651
Hey. What's up?

1030
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,216
Let's talk.

1031
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,116
Duane.

1032
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,118
Duane.
Hold on, Duane.

1033
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,417
Duane, listen to me.
You're only gonna make it worse.

1034
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,117
Don't... Duane!
Don't do that, Duane!

1035
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,006
Linda!

1036
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:23,012
All right, yeah.
Hey, how you doin'?

1037
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,213
Everybody, Mike,
good to see ya.

1038
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,245
Everybody good?
Everybody got a drink?

1039
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,259
Moe Greene. How are ya?
Hey, Fred, give Mike a drink.

1040
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,693
Where are you from, guy?
- Philadelphia.

1041
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,696
Philly. I knew it.
I saw you earlier

1042
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,198
trying to cash in your chips
for a cheese steak.

1043
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:38,894
I knew it.

1044
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,903
And ladies, how are ya?
You're back.

1045
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,905
40th year in a row,

1046
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,531
you still haven't
broken even.

1047
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,041
Come on, ladies,
let's pick it up.

1048
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:16,096
Yeah, okay,
let's look alive, people.

1049
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,197
Come on,
it's a comedy show here.

1050
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,073
Ladies, how are you doing?

1051
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,947
Excellent seat you got here,

1052
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,780
looking right at the slot machines.
All right.

1053
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,252
And how are you doing over here?
How are you guys?

1054
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,154
Very cool. Where are you from
over there? Uh-huh.

1055
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,522
Oh. Thank you.

1056
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,959
Thanks very much.
Uh, am I finished?

1057
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,725
I guess I'm done.
That's it for me, everybody, good night.

1058
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,289
I'm just doing two minutes.
You guys can catch me here

1059
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,166
tomorrow night,
performing from 8:43 to 8:45,

1060
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,400
but it will be a different two minutes,
I promise you.

1061
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,340
Oh, what are we doing now?
Oh great, charades, yeah.

1062
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,675
Uh, you're a mime
who's suffered a head injury.

1063
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,680
Uh, you're...

1064
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,376
you're the worst guy ever
from Cirque Du Soleil.

1065
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,614
Uh... oh oh,
something else here now.

1066
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,315
Oh, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
a big round of applause

1067
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,324
for the drunk guy

1068
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,326
and my roommate!
He's also my roommate.

1069
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,794
Can you believe that, ladies?
Unbelievable.

1070
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,992
And my road manager.
He's my road manager too.

1071
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,467
Yeah, just take a walk.
Stroll around.

1072
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,493
Do whatever
you need to do.

1073
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,271
Uh, no, sir.

1074
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:29,209
Un, I'm too sexy
for my shirt. You are...

1075
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:32,180
ruining my set.
Duane, man, what are you doing?

1076
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,614
Duane, come on.

1077
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,641
Duane, come on, man.

1078
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,585
Rahmn, call the desk.
Hurry up.

1079
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,896
Casinos actually
got odds on this fight.

1080
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,923
Rahmn, hurry up.
- It's...

1081
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,400
Rahmn, hurry up.

1082
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,036
It's not funny.
It's not funny.

1083
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,101
Morning.
- Word up.

1084
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,107
Nice hat.

1085
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,609
I do a rap thing.

1086
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,976
Fresh. Peace.

1087
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,109
I didn't even get to it.

1088
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,620
I'm sorry, man.

1089
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,321
I'm really sorry.

1090
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:25,327
It's all right.

1091
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,955
It was going good
before it became a duet.

1092
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,795
Rahmn says he'll let me
go on again, so...

1093
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,234
you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1094
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,329
You're lucky they let me
take you home, man.

1095
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,932
They wanted to call the cops,
send you to the hospital,

1096
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,704
but I knew if that happened,
you'd probably end up in jail,

1097
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,144
so Tommy and I dragged
your ass back here.

1098
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,741
What the fuck were you on?
- About nine scotches

1099
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,241
and an old hit of mescaline

1100
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,754
some guy at work gave me.

1101
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,655
Oh Jesus.
What did I sound like

1102
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,852
on nine scotches
and a hit of mescaline?

1103
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:02,330
Loud. You sounded loud, man.

1104
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,663
So, the court thing
didn't work out?

1105
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,693
No, I lost visitation rights.

1106
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,706
And Linda is gone.

1107
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,072
Jesus.
- With the kids.

1108
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,839
I'm sorry, man.

1109
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,847
You know,
I lost my job.

1110
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,849
Yeah, Rahmn told me.

1111
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,646
Why didn't you
say something?

1112
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,018
Oh, I didn't wanna,
you know,

1113
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,046
mess you up
before the big show.

1114
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,826
I figured you'd hear
soon enough.

1115
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,987
Wow. That was
nice of you.

1116
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:36,691
Rahmn told me
just before I went on.

1117
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,530
I was like, "Is Duane here?"
And he's like,

1118
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,560
"Duane don't work here
no mo'. You on."

1119
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,009
Mmm.

1120
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,568
Shit, I'm sorry, man.

1121
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,639
No, it's okay.
I was doing good, you know.

1122
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,877
I actually thought,
"I can use it," but, you know,

1123
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,886
when the alien
popped out of your chest,

1124
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,253
I felt I lost
their attention.

1125
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,260
I'll get it.

1126
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:07,228
You should go take a shower
or something.

1127
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,821
You're scaring me.
- What?

1128
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,855
You look like shit, man.
Go shower.

1129
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:15,199
You're having a bad...
hair... just trust me.

1130
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,205
Just shower up.

1131
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,764
It'd be good for you.

1132
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,708
Morning.

1133
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,712
Happy day before Thanksgiving.

1134
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:25,714
Thanks.
Is Duane here?

1135
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,979
I got it.
- Oh. Okay, yeah. All right.

1136
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,954
Hi.
- Hey.

1137
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,956
Who is that?

1138
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,958
Oh, that's Anthony.
He's my new roommate.

1139
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,553
Oh. Wow. How's that
working out for you?

1140
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,623
Who the fuck knows?

1141
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,399
So...

1142
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,430
So you know I'm leaving?
- Yeah.

1143
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,500
Yeah, I went
by the house yesterday.

1144
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,012
I thought you'd already gone.
- I'd never do that.

1145
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,277
The furniture was gone,
because we had to get it out

1146
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,944
before the first of the month
so Mrs. Wakely could rent it,

1147
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,249
but I would never leave
without saying goodbye.

1148
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,380
Where are the girls?
- Bob's.

1149
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,823
He's been offered a job
in South Carolina,

1150
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,759
and he's asked
that the girls and I

1151
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,286
go with him,
and I said yes.

1152
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:26,437
Um, what kind of job?

1153
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,035
Same thing.
His brother owns a gym,

1154
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,841
and they're gonna co-run it.

1155
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,474
If it works out, they're gonna let
the bookkeeper go,

1156
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,610
and I can do that. It's not a lot,
but between both our salaries

1157
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,349
and the child support
I think we're gonna be all right.

1158
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,187
You know anything
about bookkeeping?

1159
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,352
Well, I've been taking
night courses,

1160
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,828
and how hard
could it be?

1161
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,431
So you love this guy?

1162
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:05,068
Yeah, I do.
- That's good.

1163
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:11,011
One thing though,
he's got to back off Mary.

1164
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,544
I know. I think he thinks
he's being helpful.

1165
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,319
He just doesn't know
how to be around them all the time yet.

1166
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,952
But he's good with them,
and he's learning.

1167
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,127
How did
this happen, Linda?

1168
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,900
Duane, look at me.

1169
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:42,177
I know, I did it.

1170
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,185
I'm sorry.

1171
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,187
I know.

1172
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:49,918
You're a good father,
and tomorrow,

1173
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,926
if you can,
it would be great

1174
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,258
if around 10:00
you could come by before we leave

1175
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:58,528
and say goodbye to the girls.
This is Bob's address.

1176
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,535
When I get there,
I'll call you right away.

1177
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,935
I'll give you our phone number
and arrange for you

1178
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,939
to visit them
in a couple of months.

1179
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,998
Thank you, Linda.
- You're welcome.

1180
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,980
Bye.

1181
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,553
Bye.

1182
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,563
Oh.

1183
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,758
So, what are you gonna do
for Thanksgiving?

1184
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:34,064
Anthony and I
are gonna go

1185
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:36,070
to Fred and Wally's
for dinner.

1186
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,766
You're going to Fred
and Wally's? Wow.

1187
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,775
Well, that is

1188
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,403
almost worth sticking around to see.
- Yep.

1189
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,437
Almost.
