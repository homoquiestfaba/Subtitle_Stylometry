1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,308
Move 'em out, boys!

2
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,371
[indistinct chatter]

3
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,111
- [man 1] Let's go!
- [dog barking]

4
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,911
[man 2] Move it out!

5
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:22,604
[owl hooting]

6
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:32,289
Tonight... is the night.

7
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:33,550
[hooting]

8
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,220
All Hallow's Eve.
The moon is full.

9
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:42,026
I'll show all those fools
just how powerful

10
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:44,966
Warwick the Warlock really is!

11
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,367
[hooting] Master, you are the evilest.

12
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,601
Yes, I am.

13
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,538
Excuse me, Mr. Hoot, sir?

14
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,709
When do we get to meet
the Howlloween Hound?

15
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,912
I think Master's almost ready.

16
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,923
- [barking]
- The manor!

17
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:47,826
That no-good Warwick.
He must have the puppies.

18
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,263
- [barking]
- Give me those bolt cutters.

19
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,268
[barking]

20
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,575
Drat.

21
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,378
We must hurry. [hiccups]

22
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:20,154
Howlloween Hound
on All Hallow's Eve...

23
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:23,493
...with the moon full and bright,

24
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,056
open a portal beyond light.

25
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:31,333
Call three times to summon
a hound of great might.

26
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:36,333
The souls of five puppies
you shall have on this night.

27
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,744
Howlloween Hound.

28
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,741
Howlloween Hound!

29
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:52,218
To our side, Howlloween Hound!

30
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,531
Who dares summon me?

31
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:01,034
I do, Hound.

32
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,536
Warwick the Great.

33
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,434
I have the five puppy souls
of the same blood.

34
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,446
I believe they are
what you need to open the portal.

35
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,381
And why should I open
the portal for you?

36
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,045
Because together we shall unleash

37
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:22,045
all the creatures
of the underworld on Fernfield.

38
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:27,221
And then you and I
shall rule the land, Hound.

39
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,058
I like the sound of that.

40
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:33,761
But we only have this Halloween night,
while the moon is full.

41
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:42,071
The Howlloween Hound will see you now.

42
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,701
Let me go first.

43
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,671
- [man 1] Come on, boys.
- [man 2] Here we go now.

44
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,879
- Be careful, guys.
- OK, watch your backs, boys.

45
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,619
Pip! We have to find him, Dad!
He's my best friend!

46
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:01,756
We will, Joseph.

47
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,024
Grab that tree trunk.

48
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,498
We have to break down the door.

49
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,092
Pip!

50
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,434
I've changed my mind. I don't wanna
go with the Howlloween Hound.

51
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:17,307
Master, the puppy
doesn't want to go now.

52
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:20,438
All I wanted was a wise owl.

53
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,972
And I seem to have got a moronic parrot.

54
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,177
- You're next.
- [biting]

55
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,914
[yelling]

56
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,446
You can't escape!

57
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,401
He's catching up to me!

58
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:49,505
Might as well accept your fate!

59
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,775
[evil laughter] Got you!

60
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:00,153
[dog whining]

61
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,813
- Pip!
- [barking]

62
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,221
Stay back!

63
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,280
Stop, Warwick!

64
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,358
Stay back or I will
turn you all into toads!

65
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,297
Stay back!

66
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,161
- [growling]
- [croaking]

67
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:23,139
Soon you will all be my slaves!

68
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,182
Son!

69
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:33,685
- Deputy Tracker...
- [growls]

70
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,118
...after him!

71
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,853
Quickly, Hound. Dawn is here!

72
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,519
Take the last puppy.

73
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:42,789
I'm fading.

74
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,524
Complete the spell!

75
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:46,361
[howling]

76
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,033
Pip!

77
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:58,402
There's nothing I despise more
than petulant young children!

78
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,911
- Let me go!
- [screams]

79
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,277
No! Pip!

80
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,815
- [barking]
- [yelling]

81
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,618
[groaning] The sun! My eyes!

82
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:11,356
[grunting]

83
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:15,861
Hound! Open the portal!

84
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:20,957
I need all five puppy souls.
It's too late, Warwick.

85
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,533
It's over, Warwick.

86
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,905
You're under arrest.
Enough of your black magic.

87
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,204
You're through.

88
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,403
Never.

89
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,912
I'll take this town
under my control one day.

90
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:38,213
Mark my words. I'll be back!

91
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,241
[yelling]

92
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,049
What in tarnation just happened?

93
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,588
[sobbing] Dad,
look what they did to Pip.

94
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:00,731
This is a statue, son.

95
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:05,132
No, it's Pip.
We have to turn Pip back.

96
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,444
Joseph, I'm right here.

97
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,673
[gasping]

98
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:15,580
We have to get out
of this place now.

99
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,546
[Joseph] No.

100
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,315
Come on, son. Let's go.

101
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,446
Wait. Why are you afraid?
It's just me, Pip.

102
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:46,007
[indistinct chatter]

103
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,052
What happened, Sheriff?

104
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,986
I don't know.

105
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,684
But hopefully it won't happen again.

106
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,930
Oh, no! I'm trapped in here.

107
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,601
This home is officially condemned.

108
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,603
- [man 1] Good idea!
- [man 2] About time!

109
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,941
Let's board it up, boys!

110
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,810
I don't want anyone going in.

111
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:18,410
[crowd murmuring]

112
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,513
[hooting]

113
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:38,230
<i>[woman] It was 75 years ago</i>
</i>that the Manor was boarded up.</i>

114
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:42,298
No one is exactly sure
what happened that night

115
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:45,070
or whether the legend
is even true at all.

116
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:50,007
But it's an interesting part
of Fernfield folklore, regardless.

117
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,514
I can't wait for tonight.

118
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:55,041
Halloween is my favorite
event of the year, paws down.

119
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:58,214
You do a trick and
you're guaranteed to get a treat.

120
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,723
It's trick or treat, Budderball.

121
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:02,054
Even better!

122
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,561
For me, it's all about the costume.

123
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,357
I can't wait to dress up.

124
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,559
Kids go in there every Halloween...

125
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:13,660
...and they say the Howlloween Hound's
name three times in the mirror.

126
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:14,727
They're never seen again.

127
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,239
Where did you hear that?

128
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:19,037
Come on. He's just trying to scare us.

129
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:23,240
No. No, it's true.
And he gets their pets too.

130
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:25,805
Once you hear the Hound's howl...
it's too late.

131
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,444
Either way, this place
gives me the creeps.

132
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:31,486
[howling]

133
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,627
- [both laughing]
- [all] Oh, my gosh.

134
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:42,591
OK, Rodney and Skip,
no more tricks.

135
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,065
- Good one.
- Come along, children.

136
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,432
Onto the bus!

137
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:49,064
We have one more stop
on our spooky Fernfield tour.

138
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,300
[giggling]

139
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:52,475
Come on, get the lead out.

140
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,034
Come on, let's go.
Let's get on the bus.

141
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,611
[Rodney] You should have seen
the look on their faces.

142
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,977
Where's B-Dawg hiding?

143
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,986
I wasn't hiding, yo.

144
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,192
I was just getting ready
to pounce on that Hound.

145
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,063
Yeah, right, dude.

146
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,798
You were hiding like a scaredy-cat,
'cause you thought there was a ghost.

147
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:25,740
Pshaw, dawg.
B-Dawg is afraid of nothing,

148
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,743
especially no ghost!

149
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:30,473
Then why are you afraid to go
trick-or-treating tonight?

150
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,310
[all laughing]

151
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,974
Nice one, dude!

152
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,177
Fine. I'll prove it.

153
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,414
I'll go in there right now,
call out that Howlloween Hound,

154
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:41,617
and kick his tail, yo.

155
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:49,194
B-Dawg, wait.
Where are you going?

156
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,437
Whoa! This place is really creepy.

157
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:07,809
A pup? What is he doing in here?

158
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,514
Come on, guys. We can't leave
B-Dawg in there by himself.

159
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:27,068
[nervously laughing]
See? It's not too scary.

160
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,362
[chandelier clinking]

161
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,204
Did you guys just see that?

162
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,505
See what?

163
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,376
A strange glow, like a ghost.

164
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,041
Uh, nice one, dawg.

165
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:43,380
Maybe we just oughta leave.

166
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,719
Ha! Look who's the 'fraidy cat now,
big tough Budderball.

167
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,224
We must respect
the spirits of the night.

168
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:53,854
Ghosts are lost souls
that can't find their way to heaven.

169
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,831
B-Dawg the Brave, here I go.

170
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:01,236
[Rosebud] B-Dawg!

171
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:05,300
Let's reel him in
before we get in trouble.

172
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:20,120
This is the great
Deputy Tracker's grave...

173
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,655
[kids murmuring]

174
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,123
...one of the best canine officers
our town ever saw.

175
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,454
[boy 1] What? Where?

176
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:28,394
[woman] He had a nose for crime.

177
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:31,888
If there was evidence,
he had the best sniffer in town.

178
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,765
- He could just smell it.
- [screams]

179
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,858
[boy 2] What?

180
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:39,740
- Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson!
- Whoa.

181
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,544
That's the caretaker.

182
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,877
He's been running this place
as long as I can remember.

183
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,781
Yo, dawgs, did you see
that creepy old guy?

184
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,909
Yeah, that dude's, like, spook central.

185
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,649
OK, let's continue on, children.

186
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,429
[gulping]

187
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,467
Here we go, B-Dawg.

188
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:21,379
Just say it three times,
and it will all be over.

189
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:28,515
[stuttering] Howlloween Hound.

190
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,358
Howlloween Hound.

191
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,798
OK, nothing happened. Let's go!

192
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,996
Stop, please! Don't say it!

193
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,303
It's a ghost!

194
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,276
Let's get out of here, dudes!

195
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:51,801
Come on, B-Dawg. Run!

196
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,810
Don't say it again!
You'll release them!

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,148
[screaming]

198
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,850
You're... you're the Howlloween Hound!

199
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:09,691
Oh, no! You said it three times!

200
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:13,291
[screaming] Run for your life!

201
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,066
Wait!

202
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,680
Wait! I'm not the Howlloween Hound!

203
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:30,377
[screaming] The ghost is on my tail!

204
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:32,408
[hooting]

205
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:50,130
Yo, that was a ghost, dawgs!

206
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:53,070
A real off-the-chain ghoul!

207
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:55,904
Dudes, was that the Howlloween Hound?

208
00:15:55,963 --> 00:16:00,605
I said Howlloween Hound
three times into the mirror, dawgs.

209
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,672
I released the Howlloween Hound!

210
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,342
Could it really be true?

211
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:07,353
They've released Master
after all these years?

212
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:11,585
B-Dawg is correct, although
he was smaller than I'd imagined.

213
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,388
Whatever it was, we are outta there.

214
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:17,555
And I, for one, am never going back.

215
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,428
Come on. Let's catch up to our kids.

216
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,830
[haunted house sounds]

217
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:31,104
Now, I know you're all excited
about trick-or-treating tonight,

218
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:35,080
but let's not forget that your Fernfield
history projects are due Monday.

219
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,138
Monday?

220
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:39,276
What a bonehead.

221
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,183
Yes, Billy. Is that a problem?

222
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,620
It's been assigned
for the last two weeks.

223
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:47,592
Oh! Oh, that project!

224
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,424
Yeah, I totally finished mine.

225
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,294
Great, Billy.
What subject did you choose?

226
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,868
I, uh...

227
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:59,200
The Curse of the Howlloween Hound.

228
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,170
Perhaps your project might
finally answer

229
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,403
whether the legend is true or not.

230
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,469
Oh, oh, definitely!

231
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,105
OK, class dismissed.

232
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:11,208
[high-pitched giggling]
Happy Halloween!

233
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:13,641
- Bye.
- Wow.

234
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,777
What am I gonna do?

235
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,654
If I don't pass this project,
I'm gonna be history!

236
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:21,124
What do you mean, Billy?

237
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,821
Sounds like you've got
a great spooky topic.

238
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,489
I just picked the first thing
that came into my head.

239
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,432
I totally forgot about
this history project.

240
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:29,490
Uh-oh.

241
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:32,094
I don't even know if I'll be able to go
trick-or-treating tonight.

242
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,002
Now, that's a disaster.

243
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,006
You know, if the police were involved,

244
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:38,440
then I bet Sheriff Dan knows
a thing or two about it.

245
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,843
- [all] Yeah.
- All right.

246
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,540
- Yeah, good idea.
- All right, let's go check it out.

247
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:43,637
- All right.
- Yeah, let's go.

248
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,712
The Howlloween Hound, yeah.
I've heard that spooky story

249
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,847
around the campfire once or twice.

250
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,687
Careful, kids,
there's a stair here that...

251
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,727
- [kids yelling]
- Yep, that's the one.

252
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,094
OK. Sheriff Jim kept all the evidence

253
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,791
from every case
he was ever on down here.

254
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,666
We're bound to find something
in these cold case files.

255
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:07,035
How are we gonna find
anything down here?

256
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:10,802
Don't worry, kids. I got this
entire room perfectly organized.

257
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,367
- [grunting]
- [clattering]

258
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,813
- That's been moved.
- [Billy] Uh-huh.

259
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,612
OK, we're looking for 1937.

260
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:24,053
- 1978.
- [Sheriff Dan] 1983.

261
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,182
1976. This could prove difficult.

262
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:30,961
Hey, I think this is it, Sheriff Dan!

263
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,258
- What?
- Yeah, check it out!

264
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,560
- Holy Dinah!
- Sweet!

265
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,363
That's good detective work, Billy.

266
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:37,561
Yeah.

267
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,231
Halloween, 1937.

268
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,637
- Whoa!
- Oh!

269
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,174
[Billy] No! No, wait, wait!

270
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,402
[Pete] Oh, dude.

271
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:47,933
- [groans]
- Uh... Wow.

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,105
OK... yep.

273
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,043
Thanks, Sheriff Dan.

274
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:54,542
Sweet.

275
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,112
- Whoa, that's cool.
- Whoa!

276
00:18:58,177 --> 00:18:59,121
- What is that?
- Wow!

277
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,350
- Whoa.
- Sick.

278
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:01,891
That's quite the magic wand.

279
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:04,417
Hey, that'd be great
for my presentation.

280
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:05,325
Huh.

281
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:06,590
Do you think I could borrow it?

282
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,757
- [Bartleby] Yeah.
- [Pete] That's a good idea.

283
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,266
Well, it is a part
of this cold case file.

284
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,532
But it's been over 70 years, so, uh...

285
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,929
- Ah, what the heck.
- Cool.

286
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:19,442
But remember, that's police evidence,
so I'm gonna need that back, Billy.

287
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,102
Oh, I promise I'll bring it back.

288
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,238
OK. Wouldn't want
you casting any spells.

289
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,582
Well, let's go back upstairs.
I have a soufflé in the oven.

290
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,949
[Bartleby] Soufflé?

291
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:30,749
[Pete] Dude.

292
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,814
[snoring]

293
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,919
Hey there, Deputy dude.

294
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,956
Huh? What's going on?

295
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:45,559
Ooh! Top of the morning to you, Buddies.

296
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,663
Actually, it's afternoon, Deputy.

297
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,237
We were wondering where you pups went.

298
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:58,145
Hey, guys, it's four o'clock!

299
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,149
If we don't get ready
for trick-or-treating,

300
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,583
we're not gonna maximize
our candy potential!

301
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:04,815
Yeah. Thanks for all the help,
Sheriff Dan.

302
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,652
Well, good luck
with your project, Billy.

303
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,057
You let Sheriff Dan know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

304
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,991
And you kids, remind your parents

305
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,792
to come to the Fernfield
Spooky Brew Ha-Ha tonight,

306
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,321
or I'll have to arrest them!

307
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:16,958
[all laughing]

308
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:19,264
- [all] Thanks, Sheriff. Bye!
- [Sheriff Dan] See you!

309
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:22,961
[recorded laughter]

310
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:24,598
Come on, B-Dawg.

311
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,704
Let's go, boy.

312
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,748
[door closing]

313
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,483
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hello, dear.

314
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,714
I gotta get ready for trick-or-treating.

315
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,382
- Did you pick up the costume?
- Oh, I sure did.

316
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:43,084
- It's just over there on the table.
- Cool.

317
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:46,151
And I bought a matching one
for B-Dawg as well!

318
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,663
Oh, sweet.

319
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,328
[bell dinging]

320
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:57,339
Mom?

321
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,900
Oh, isn't that adorable?

322
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,844
You are just gonna be the cutest
little hip-hopper out there.

323
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:08,574
[stammering] Mom, I said hip-hop rapper,

324
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,882
not hip-hop rabbit!

325
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:15,117
I mean, are you trying
to completely ruin our street cred?

326
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,058
- [barking]
- I'm sorry. We cannot wear these.

327
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:21,586
Billy, you two will look
adorable as bunnies.

328
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:23,457
[groans]

329
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,237
Huh.

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,673
[stammering]

331
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:41,576
- Check it out, B-Dawg.
- [whimpering]

332
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:44,586
I present to you, Warwick the Warlock,

333
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:47,145
- at your service.
- [whining]

334
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:51,690
I'm sorry, B-Dawg,
but it's really not that bad.

335
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:53,888
[whining]

336
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:59,397
Hey, check this out, buddy.

337
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:02,302
This must have been
what the warlock looked like.

338
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,930
And see the photo?

339
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:08,499
That must be the boy from the story,
and his little pup, Pip. See?

340
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,642
2332 Pine Lane.

341
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:15,746
I wonder if he still lives there.

342
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,287
Yeah, I know, it was,
like, 75 years ago.

343
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:23,290
He'd be older than Grandpa by now.
Man, that's old.

344
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:27,990
If I could just talk to him,
this would be the easiest project ever.

345
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:31,958
- [owl hooting]
- It's kind of creepy.

346
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,278
Hurry!

347
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,144
Almost... got it.

348
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:49,640
- There!
- [cat growling]

349
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:50,810
[yelling]

350
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,552
- Dude, chill. It's just a dumb cat.
- [yowling]

351
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,488
I bet there's tons
of weird stuff we can use

352
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:58,550
to scare those dudes from class with.

353
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,993
Oh, man. It's getting dark.
We better hurry.

354
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:07,999
[grunting]

355
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:15,370
Whoa.

356
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:16,968
[Skip] Almost.

357
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,004
What? I got more visitors?

358
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,118
[Skip] Check it out.

359
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,779
[Rodney] Whoa.

360
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,505
[kids laughing]

361
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:47,405
All right.

362
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:53,472
With the Howlloween Hound,
I will control the world.

363
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,381
- [chuckling]
- [exaggerated laughter]

364
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,213
Hey, that is really good.

365
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,117
- Thanks, dawg.
- Whoa.

366
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,522
Why is that thing, like, glowing?

367
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:05,219
- [Sam] Oh, yeah. Intriguing.
- Huh.

368
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:06,191
I don't know.

369
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,221
Maybe it has batteries or something.

370
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:13,162
Argh, nice costume, matey!

371
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,533
Does the "B" stand for bunny?

372
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:16,832
[all laughing]

373
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:22,901
This ain't no ordinary rabbit costume,
dawgs.

374
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:24,570
It's a killer rabbit.

375
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,706
And those things are da bomb!

376
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:31,081
- Now let's go score some sugar.
- Oh, yeah.

377
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,087
There are healthy
alternatives to sugar, too.

378
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:35,918
My family is handing out

379
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:40,655
homemade almond raisin granola.
How cool is that?

380
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:43,253
OK, no offense,
but I vote we skip Sam's house!

381
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:44,855
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

382
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,560
- Me three.
- Ah, man.

383
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,296
- [Alice] Sorry.
- Sorry, buddy. Come on!

384
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:49,961
[Alice] Whoa, check out the full moon!

385
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,633
[owl hooting]

386
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,871
Awesome!

387
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,825
[creaking]

388
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:22,760
Whoa.

389
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:35,240
"Rodentus...

390
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,644
...trans...

391
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,813
...something."

392
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:45,722
- Rodney!
- What?

393
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:01,835
- [rumbling]
- [groaning]

394
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,276
[clinking]

395
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:14,346
We are... free!

396
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,683
Oh, no!

397
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,087
[evil laughter]

398
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:22,761
Oh, it was horrendous in there!

399
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,423
- [groaning]
- [whimpering]

400
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:28,330
Are you the ones that released us?

401
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:30,698
- Speak up!
- [both gasping]

402
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:31,726
Wait a minute.

403
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:35,770
Where's my staff? My book?

404
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:40,105
You've stolen them, haven't you?

405
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,045
Give me that.

406
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:45,376
<i>Ratius rodentius!</i>

407
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:48,181
- [sizzling]
- [Warwick laughing]

408
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,210
[Skip squeaking] Oh, no!
What happened to us?

409
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,555
[Rodney] Let's get out of here!

410
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:57,391
Now... they won't be able
to warn the rest of the town.

411
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,556
We must finish the spell.

412
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,725
I can smell the blood
of the five puppies we need.

413
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,235
They have been in this room.

414
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,134
Oh, no!

415
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,765
[squeaking]

416
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,543
Hey, watch where you're going!
That's my tail!

417
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,912
Will you zip it? We have to find help!

418
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,540
[yowling]

419
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,921
You'll make a great Halloween treat.

420
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,388
[loud yowl]

421
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:27,483
Come on! We were just kidding before!

422
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,288
We love cats, really!

423
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:34,398
[frantic squeaking]

424
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,431
[yowling]

425
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,174
[growling]

426
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,649
[creaking]

427
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,064
[hooting]

428
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,128
[sighs] Oh.

429
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:18,108
The Manor has seen better days.

430
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,737
[hooting] Master, it's true.
You're back!

431
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,411
[Warwick] Yes, Hoot,
you moronic birdbrain.

432
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,418
Go and find my staff.

433
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,420
Nothing can happen without it.

434
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:31,820
It'll be illuminated by the moonlight.

435
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,084
Yes, Master.

436
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,788
[hooting]

437
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:41,893
Hoot will find the glowing staff

438
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,366
and I will find my spell book.

439
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,904
If they can leave, then maybe I can too.

440
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,107
I'm free! Yes!

441
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,341
OK, I better go warn those puppies.

442
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:05,678
- Thanks!
- Thank you!

443
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,779
Thank you!

444
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,587
- Come on!
- Guys, let's go to this house.

445
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,990
I hope they have strawberry fizz bombs
at the next house.

446
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,585
- Let's go check out this one!
- Come on, let's go!

447
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,258
- They're amazing!
- Let's go.

448
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,458
Come on!

449
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:25,498
Yo, let's get this trick-or-treatin'
show on the road.

450
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,343
I don't want any more run-ins
with that Howlloween Hound dog

451
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,008
or any other creepy ghost,
for that matter.

452
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:35,416
Dude, they're just kids
in Halloween costumes.

453
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:40,480
Either way, dawg, I'm keeping
my eye on everything tonight.

454
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,356
- [Warwick groaning]
- [girl] Wait up, Sam!

455
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,160
Ah! Get away!

456
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,362
Look at that old guy.

457
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,369
- Get away!
- Excuse me.

458
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,030
- Real scary.
- [mumbles]

459
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,368
[kids screaming]

460
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,238
This is horrible.

461
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,837
Evil creatures are roaming the streets.

462
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,309
Oh.

463
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,078
- Hurry!
- Yeah, come on.

464
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,744
The best candy's at the next house!

465
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,047
[kids] Trick or treat!

466
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,385
That pink goblin is hideous!

467
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,086
You've misled me, Warwick.
This town has already been taken over.

468
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,594
Quickly, Hound.
We still have some time.

469
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,598
Go and find your puppy souls.

470
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,963
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's go cash out.

471
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,974
[doorbell cackling]

472
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,746
- Dude!
- Whoa.

473
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,312
Who dare knocks on my door?

474
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,415
- Dude, sweet costume!
- Yeah!

475
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,792
Dude, it's Frankendude to you.

476
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,796
- Oh, hello, children!
- Mrs. Carroll!

477
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:58,265
- Hi, Mrs. Carroll.
- It's Mrs. Frankendude.

478
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,963
- Welcome to our spooky house.
- Yeah.

479
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,598
- So, what do you think?
- It's totally awesome.

480
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,301
- Oh, it's so cool.
- Trick or treat?

481
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,641
Rad. Yeah, let Frankendude
help you out there, all right?

482
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,169
Except one per customer or
Frankendude will get upset

483
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:12,305
and then have to storm the village.

484
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,647
- [all laughing]
- That will be uncool.

485
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,150
[all] Good night. Thanks!

486
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,981
- Later.
- Shaka brah!

487
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,282
Hang ten on it.

488
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,652
[Sam] Let's check that place out!

489
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:22,987
- See ya in the tube.
- [laughing]

490
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:24,458
[Billy] Let's go check out
the next house, guys.

491
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:25,289
[Pete] Let's hurry up!

492
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,921
- [laughing]
- [puppy whining]

493
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:30,864
- Oh, he's so cute.
- It's time for us to get some treats.

494
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,400
Watch and learn.

495
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:33,662
[Mr. Carroll] Look,
he's coming up on the porch.

496
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,998
[Carrolls exclaiming]

497
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,868
- [whining]
- The dude begs.

498
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,406
- Oh, bark.
- He chases his tail...

499
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:43,673
Cute! He's going in a circle!

500
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,145
...then rolls over.

501
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:48,081
And for the finale,
Budderball's signature trick:

502
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,845
Plays starving!

503
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:51,010
- Oh!
- Oh.

504
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,520
- [whining]
- Go get some treats.

505
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,021
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:57,617
If Budderball's an expert at anything,
it's begging for treats.

507
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,650
- Oh, yes.
- He earned it.

508
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:01,356
He did earn it.
There you go.

509
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:08,061
- Yeah!
- Really, really good!

510
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,765
- I'm so excited, you guys!
- That was awesome!

511
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:24,646
Hey, there's another ghost!
Maybe he can help me.

512
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:30,452
Excuse me. My name is Pip.

513
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:34,121
I was wondering if you've seen
five Golden Retriever puppies?

514
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:39,659
[laughing] That tickles.

515
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,727
[screaming] Ghost!

516
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,366
Help, Mom!
I just saw a real ghost!

517
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:48,875
[mother] Time to go home.
You've had enough sugar for one night.

518
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:54,041
Uh-oh. I guess ghosts are scary.
I better disguise myself.

519
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:05,092
[muffled laughter]

520
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,926
[Billy] That was such a jackpot.

521
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:15,594
[Alice] I got all my favorite candy.

522
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:17,904
[Billy] Come on, Sam!

523
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:19,429
[Sam] Geez, guys, wait up, I'm coming.

524
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:22,568
[hooting] There's the Master's staff.

525
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:25,306
[Sam] Two words: Godzilla feet!

526
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:28,507
- Trick or treat!
- Oh, what have we here?

527
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,175
- All right, here's for you.
- Thank you!

528
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:40,084
There you are.
Thank goodness I found you guys!

529
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:43,620
Yo, if you're lookin' for a pawtograph,

530
00:33:43,686 --> 00:33:45,461
I ain't in da mood.

531
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,968
I'm here to warn you about
the Howlloween Hound.

532
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:49,730
How did you know about that?

533
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:57,206
[yells] It's the Howlloween Hound!

534
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:00,270
I told you dawgs he'd come after us!

535
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,282
- No, I'm not.
- Run, dawgs!

536
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:03,408
[all yelling]

537
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:17,555
[all breathing heavily]

538
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,835
Yo, this ghost dawg
just doesn't give up!

539
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:25,337
What do we do?

540
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,838
I know a place.

541
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:29,137
If there's anyone who can help us
with a paranormal problem,

542
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:32,145
it's Zelda. Follow me.

543
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,910
Please, wait.
I'm just trying to warn you guys.

544
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:45,686
[puppies barking]

545
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:47,351
[panting]

546
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:49,122
That must be them.

547
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:57,564
It looks like someone else
is after those puppies, too.

548
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,498
[breathing heavily]

549
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,207
Remind me to never
come trick-or-treating

550
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:12,480
here at 2332 Pine Lane again!

551
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:15,716
Talk about no Halloween spirit!

552
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,552
2332 Pine Lane?

553
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:24,892
Hey! Guys, the boy
from the story lived here.

554
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,956
This was Joseph's house.

555
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,501
Go knock on the door, Billy.
Maybe he still lives there.

556
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:33,062
Alice, come on, he'd be, like,
a thousand years old or something.

557
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:36,540
Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

558
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,305
[sighing]

559
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,544
[gate opening]

560
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:49,182
[owl hooting]

561
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,601
I guess nobody's home.

562
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:08,868
See, I told you guys.

563
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:11,877
It's just a creepy old house
with nobody in it.

564
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,012
[all gasping]

565
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,446
What?

566
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:19,211
Behind you, look.

567
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,810
Oh, ha ha. Good one, Sam,

568
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,616
but I'm not gonna fall for...

569
00:36:23,644 --> 00:36:24,782
[Pete] Uh...

570
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,688
For reals?

571
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:28,420
[Sam] Yeah.

572
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,958
Oh! Um...

573
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:37,666
Uh, hello, sir. I...

574
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,606
I was just wondering
if this boy still lives here.

575
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,306
No, this boy hasn't lived here
in quite some time.

576
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:49,712
What do you want?

577
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,150
Well, you see,
I'm doing this school project

578
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:56,380
on The Curse of the Howlloween Hound,

579
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,946
you know, an old Fernfield legend,

580
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:03,985
and I was just hoping
to ask him some questions.

581
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:06,156
I'm sure if that boy
wanted to talk about it

582
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:09,166
he would have a long time ago.
Now go away!

583
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:12,135
Oh, OK. I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,398
Hey, boy!

585
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,305
Where'd you get that staff?

586
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:19,937
Hand it over!
That's very dangerous!

587
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,742
[all] Run! Go!

588
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:23,008
Come on! Go!

589
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:25,312
[Billy] He's behind us!

590
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,215
[Sam] So creepy!

591
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,310
[exhales]

592
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:39,886
I must find out who's responsible
for this infestation.

593
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:44,628
No one beats Warwick the Warlock
at his own game.

594
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:47,871
What is this?

595
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:52,307
Perhaps the evil sorcerer lives there?

596
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,106
[exhales]

597
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:03,353
All the ghouls and goblins
are flocking to his door.

598
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,377
[laughing]

599
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,390
[electronic laughing]

600
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,222
[kids] Trick or treat!

601
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:14,321
- [cackling]
- [screams]

602
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:18,358
- Who dares...
- [screams]

603
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,568
Dude, a little bit, uh,
old for trick-or-treating?

604
00:38:21,627 --> 00:38:23,129
No!

605
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:25,937
Now give me what's rightfully mine!

606
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,809
OK, I think that would entail
a trick on your part.

607
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,814
[hooting]

608
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:36,410
[gasps] Wow.

609
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,479
Master, I have good news.

610
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:41,684
OK, that's... Wow, ventriloquism.
That's impressive.

611
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:44,285
Yeah, bro, you just
got yourself a treat. Nice.

612
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:54,033
So, this is what
food tastes like these days.

613
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:58,307
Later.

614
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,246
Now, Hoot, tell me the good news.

615
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:05,771
Have you found my staff?

616
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:08,114
Yes, a young warlock has it.

617
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,278
[sighs]

618
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:13,117
I leave for 75 measly years,

619
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:15,920
and they find someone new to replace me.

620
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:17,858
- [kids] Trick or treat!
- Where's the respect?

621
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,395
[electronic laughing]

622
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:21,055
[sighs]

623
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,100
[breathing heavily]

624
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:32,536
[panting]

625
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:34,304
I think we lost him.

626
00:39:34,365 --> 00:39:36,436
Why is that ghost dude after us?

627
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,948
Maybe he wants to drink our blood!

628
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,313
That's vampires.

629
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:43,818
Maybe he wants to eat our brains.

630
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,549
That's zombies, dude.

631
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,989
Maybe he wants to devour
everything he sees.

632
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,755
- That's Budderball.
- Hmm?

633
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:55,162
It's probably because B-Dawg
released him from the mirror.

634
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,826
Oh, sure, dawg, blame me!

635
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:02,669
It's you guys teasing me and calling me
scaredy-cat that made me do it.

636
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:06,766
It's true. We have to take personal
responsibility for our own actions.

637
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,912
- [boy] Wait up!
- [all] Trick or treat!

638
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:16,350
He's got all kinds of terrifying
creatures following him.

639
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:18,580
- Thanks!
- Let's check out that place.

640
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:20,020
How will we get to him?

641
00:40:20,078 --> 00:40:22,024
Those are just his friends, Master.

642
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,460
Friends? With creatures
of the underworld?

643
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:29,124
- No, they're...
- Silence!

644
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,259
- I need to focus.
- [kids] Trick or treat!

645
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,034
- Come on, guys! Let's go!
- Let's go over here!

646
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,936
- You there!
- Huh?

647
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:40,203
- Young warlock.
- Um, he's...

648
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,607
[chuckles]

649
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:45,906
Do you know who I am?

650
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:49,541
Uh... I'm not sure?

651
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,850
I am Warwick the Warlock,

652
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:55,584
the evilest warlock known to man!

653
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:56,681
[hiccups]

654
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,522
[all laughing]

655
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:02,395
- [yelling]
- [Sam] Oh!

656
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:07,201
I will make all of you ghouls my slaves!

657
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:09,636
[Billy] Uh... [chuckles]

658
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:10,967
Now...

659
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:15,973
...give me that staff!

660
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,740
Here, take it, Mister.

661
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:19,872
- Whoa!
- [yelling]

662
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,883
- What was that?
- Whoa!

663
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:25,181
That was awesome.

664
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:28,717
How did you do that?

665
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:31,089
Dawg, I have no idea!

666
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:34,288
But I'm pretty sure that guy
was who he says he is.

667
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,228
- What do you mean?
- Check this out!

668
00:41:38,088 --> 00:41:39,431
That dude really is the Warlock!

669
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,230
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

670
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,761
- [coughs]
- [Sam] Uh, guys...

671
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:46,569
I believe that now would be
an opportune time to run.

672
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:48,338
- Go!
- Run!

673
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,271
Are you OK, Master?

674
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:57,013
I clearly underestimated that warlock.

675
00:41:57,074 --> 00:41:58,610
[coughs]

676
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,212
[Billy] Guys, come on!

677
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:04,348
Come on!

678
00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,126
Whoa.

679
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,629
[all panting]

680
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,359
What was with that guy?

681
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,232
Yo, I have no idea,
but he wanted this thing pretty badly.

682
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:18,102
We better find Sheriff Dan, like, now!

683
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:19,572
- [Billy] Let's go.
- [Bartleby] Let's go.

684
00:42:21,764 --> 00:42:23,175
[grunts]

685
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,278
[cackling]

686
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:36,281
Yeah, again, great bit before,

687
00:42:36,312 --> 00:42:38,986
but, uh, it's kinda one piece
of candy per trick.

688
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:43,464
Look, I need your help, monster.

689
00:42:43,486 --> 00:42:46,160
You're big and you're scary,

690
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:48,930
the perfect henchman for this job.

691
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,165
<i>Slavius mineus!</i>

692
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:53,366
- [laughing]
- What the...

693
00:42:58,768 --> 00:43:04,309
[exhales] Now, you will do
exactly as I tell you.

694
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,320
Dude.

695
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:09,487
Dude.

696
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:14,518
I want you to find a young warlock

697
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:19,896
whose staff has a shiny blue crystal.

698
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:22,162
I want you to seize it.

699
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,702
Yes, Master.

700
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,071
And then eliminate him.

701
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:30,338
Yes, Master.

702
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:35,213
Dude. Dude.

703
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:37,751
[groaning]

704
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,382
[grunting]

705
00:43:42,712 --> 00:43:44,214
[groaning]

706
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,782
Dude.

707
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:59,365
I probably should have used
someone smarter for this job.

708
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:00,600
[groaning]

709
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,476
Idiot!

710
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:07,269
[hooting]

711
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,914
I believe this is the place.

712
00:44:30,058 --> 00:44:32,766
Hello? Is anyone home?

713
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:35,900
I don't think anybody's here.

714
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:45,277
Yo, check out this crystal ball, dawgs.

715
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,910
It's like a giant gumball.

716
00:44:46,941 --> 00:44:48,852
Welcome.

717
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:53,722
Yo, dawgs, the gumball is talking to us!

718
00:44:54,682 --> 00:44:57,185
- I am Zelda.
- [shouting]

719
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:59,323
I am all-knowing and all-seeing.

720
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:03,802
I specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

721
00:45:03,825 --> 00:45:06,271
I also do doggy weddings
and doggy bar mitzvahs.

722
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:09,639
Now, I sense you puppies are in danger.

723
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:12,075
Only if we end up at your groomer.

724
00:45:13,134 --> 00:45:15,808
B-Dawg! I apologize for my brother.

725
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:18,646
We need your help because
this ghost has been chasing us.

726
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,309
Well, this is Halloween,

727
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:22,615
the only night spirits are free to roam.

728
00:45:22,643 --> 00:45:25,317
We must make contact
with this ghost of yours.

729
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:27,484
[gasps] Oh, I have a Ouija board.

730
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:30,427
It can be used
to contact the other side.

731
00:45:41,628 --> 00:45:43,665
- Hello?
- [all gasping]

732
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,438
I don't think you're gonna
need your Luigi board.

733
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:47,844
There's the ghost!

734
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:51,577
Oh, a ghost! [groaning]

735
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:56,648
That dudette is down for the count.

736
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:58,520
Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.

737
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:02,652
That's what ghosts always say
before they eat you.

738
00:46:02,683 --> 00:46:05,186
Ghosts don't eat.
There's no way for us to.

739
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:07,859
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

740
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:10,266
I'm a friendly ghost, I promise.

741
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:13,132
Oh, my, what a horrible dream.

742
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,663
- I know I look a bit strange.
- Oh!

743
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:18,040
But I was once a pup just like you.

744
00:46:18,098 --> 00:46:19,338
My name is Pip.

745
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:21,039
You're the pup from the story.

746
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:23,809
Yes. I've been like this
ever since that night.

747
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:26,181
The Hound stole my brothers'
and sisters' souls.

748
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:28,413
The spell must have been
interrupted that night.

749
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:30,716
Your soul was left in limbo.

750
00:46:30,777 --> 00:46:32,814
[sniffing]

751
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,060
[soft growling]

752
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,224
I'm sorry I scared you guys
at the Manor.

753
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:43,735
I was trying to stop you
from releasing the Hound.

754
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,066
Yeah, and we're sorry, too, Pip.

755
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,072
I'm Rosebud, and these are my brothers,

756
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:51,075
B-Dawg, Mudbud, Buddha and Budderball.

757
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:52,973
The Hound and Warwick are free.

758
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:55,376
They're still trying
to finish their spell,

759
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:58,177
but they need five puppies
of the same blood to do it.

760
00:46:58,204 --> 00:46:59,581
They're after you guys.

761
00:46:59,605 --> 00:47:02,848
We must stop them
from completing the spell.

762
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,980
And Pip, now that you
have left the Manor,

763
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:07,854
if you do not return
to your body before sunrise,

764
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,655
you will be lost forever.

765
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:11,092
[gasping]

766
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,721
We must find the body
you once inhabited.

767
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:17,860
We shall ask the spirits
through my crystal ball.

768
00:47:20,893 --> 00:47:23,874
[deep growling]

769
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:27,776
[exaggerated voice]
Oh, beautiful and wise one,

770
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,973
we ask for your help
on this night of Halloween.

771
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:33,449
Please show us this young pup's body.

772
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:36,350
Does it still exist
on the earthly plane?

773
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:40,883
That's me! I turned to stone
the night it all happened.

774
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:44,224
Ah, snap! The cemetery?

775
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,630
I mean, is it really necessary
to go there, dawgs?

776
00:47:52,325 --> 00:47:53,463
[all gasping]

777
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:55,796
Hello, puppies.

778
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:58,637
Oh, no! It's the Howlloween Hound!

779
00:47:58,664 --> 00:48:02,111
Come out, come out,
and I'll have your souls for dinner.

780
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:04,136
Oh, no. I'm stuck!

781
00:48:04,203 --> 00:48:05,648
The back door, quickly!

782
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,989
Come on! [grunting]

783
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:19,126
[loud groaning]

784
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:20,824
- [kids] Mr. Carroll?
- [Billy] Oh, Mr. Carroll!

785
00:48:20,886 --> 00:48:23,924
- Maybe you can help us.
- Give me staff!

786
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:26,162
That's not normal, even for Mr. Carroll.

787
00:48:26,224 --> 00:48:28,500
- [Pete] That dude's eyes are creepy!
- [all exclaiming]

788
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,506
We better get to that party!
Sheriff Dan's there!

789
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:32,200
- [Billy] Yeah, come on!
- [Pete] Come on!

790
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:36,844
Dude.

791
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:44,845
[singing "Monster Mash"]

792
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:14,216
Billy! Billy, come on!
Dance with your mom. Whoo!

793
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:16,385
Whoo!

794
00:49:16,408 --> 00:49:20,254
Mom, I really don't have time right now.
See, there's a monster chasing us.

795
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,450
Of course there is, dear.
It's Halloween!

796
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:24,790
- [Mr. Carroll] Give me staff!
- [Billy] There he is.

797
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,556
Run! Run!

798
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,393
Oh, sweetheart, where are you going?

799
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,899
[grunting]

800
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:32,230
[noisemaker tooting]

801
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:38,337
[grunting]

802
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:47,015
[burping] Dude.

803
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:55,816
[fireworks whistling]

804
00:49:57,582 --> 00:50:01,586
This must be that young Warlock's lair!

805
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:04,758
It's swarming with all those creatures.

806
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:09,032
This warlock is more powerful
than I thought.

807
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:12,173
[all chattering]

808
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:14,736
[high-pitched scream]

809
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,108
Hand over the candy.

810
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,737
Stay back, demon!

811
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:19,770
You'll not trick-or-treat me!

812
00:50:19,803 --> 00:50:21,282
- [grunting]
- [popping]

813
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:27,522
Wait a minute.
You're no demon!

814
00:50:27,578 --> 00:50:28,852
And you...

815
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:34,590
...you're no goblin!

816
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,196
You!

817
00:50:38,422 --> 00:50:40,129
- [snapping]
- [shouting]

818
00:50:40,157 --> 00:50:41,932
What kind of trickery is this?

819
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:44,633
These are just kids in disguises!

820
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:46,174
Out of my way!

821
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,143
- Let's get outta here!
- Let's get outta here!

822
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,669
[singing "Monster Mash"]

823
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:02,888
[muffled music]

824
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:04,653
[Mudbud] Dudes! Sniffer!

825
00:51:04,715 --> 00:51:07,161
He'll know what to do
about that nasty Hound!

826
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:09,095
[snoring]

827
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,996
Deputy Sniffer!

828
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:13,000
Wake up! Wake up!
We need your help!

829
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:16,230
[stammering] Trick-or-treat,
smell my paws.

830
00:51:16,293 --> 00:51:17,636
Yo, dawg!

831
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,335
It's a straight up 9-1-1!

832
00:51:20,397 --> 00:51:22,843
[stammering] Buddies,
you startled me there.

833
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:24,368
What's the problem?

834
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:27,779
Did someone steal
Budderball's candy bag?

835
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:30,308
No. This is more serious
than trick-or-treating.

836
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,684
Well, hi there, Zelda.

837
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:36,349
Deputy Dawg, we got a serious problem.

838
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:38,653
The Howlloween Hound
has been released!

839
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:42,356
I sense we have a few hours
before the entire town is doomed,

840
00:51:42,418 --> 00:51:44,921
and soon after that, the whole world!

841
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:47,524
You're quite the trickster, Zelda.

842
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,867
[chuckling] My great grandpappy Tracker

843
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:53,203
used to tell me that old wives' tale
when I was just a pup.

844
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,004
Scared the bejesus outta me.

845
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:58,808
Deputy Sniffer,
I can assure you the legend is true.

846
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:03,947
Wow, great ghost costume.

847
00:52:04,006 --> 00:52:06,885
It's not a costume, Deputy Sniffer.
He's a ghost.

848
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:09,685
See, I can float through walls.

849
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,487
[Sniffer] Oh! Look at...

850
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:14,856
[stammers]

851
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:20,523
Whoa! Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

852
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:21,830
My name is Pip.

853
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:24,702
I knew your great grandpappy,
Deputy Tracker.

854
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,400
We could really use your help.

855
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:29,306
[sniffing]

856
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:32,574
Uh, would this hound
happen to be large and brown

857
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:34,912
and, uh, with green eyes?

858
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:37,710
Oh, no! He's found us!

859
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,949
The long paw of the law
will handle this intruder.

860
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,048
- You guys go.
- Hurry, we must get to the cemetery.

861
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:48,259
[weak howling]

862
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:50,423
Stop in the name of the law!

863
00:52:52,388 --> 00:52:53,924
Time to meet your fate.

864
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:56,994
- You're under arrest!
- [howling]

865
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:59,596
What in tarnation do you...

866
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,777
[singing "Monster Mash"]

867
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,014
[giggling]

868
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:27,424
Oh, there you are, Frank!

869
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,958
You didn't tell me you
left early for the party!

870
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,130
- Uh...
- Come on!

871
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:35,333
The costume contest is starting
and you're a shoo-in!

872
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:38,034
- Come on!
- [grunting]

873
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:46,946
Oh, I love your costume!
You're a wizard, right?

874
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:50,821
I am a warlock, Madam,
and I'm not wearing a costume!

875
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,485
Now unhand me, you crazy kitty cat!

876
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:54,492
[shouting]

877
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:02,460
- [applause]
- [Dan] OK, all right.

878
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,834
OK, all right.

879
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,998
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a round of applause

880
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:11,170
for the finalists
for most original costume.

881
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:13,803
[crowd chattering]

882
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:16,941
OK, you've got your numbers.

883
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:22,546
[panting]

884
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:26,185
[Dan] All right, make a nice,
clean line, please.

885
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:28,693
Sheriff! Sheriff.
I've really gotta talk to you.

886
00:54:28,717 --> 00:54:29,855
It's really, really important.

887
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:31,022
In a jiffy, Billy.

888
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:32,622
I just have to announce the winner,
all right?

889
00:54:32,654 --> 00:54:33,632
But, Sheriff!

890
00:54:33,655 --> 00:54:34,861
Ladies and gentlemen,

891
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,563
the first place winner is...

892
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,764
- ...drum roll, please.
- [drum roll]

893
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:43,534
The winner is...

894
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:46,168
...Frank Carroll! Frankendude!

895
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,508
[shouting]

896
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,710
- Move!
- Honey, that's great!

897
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,582
Useless monster!

898
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,449
Must I do everything myself?

899
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,116
Staff! [grunting]

900
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,061
Say "cheese"!

901
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,994
[pained grunting]

902
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,691
- [shouting]
- [crowd gasping]

903
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,326
[shouting]

904
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,404
Heavens to Betsy!

905
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:15,407
Somebody had a bit too much
spooky punch!

906
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:16,806
[crowd laughing]

907
00:55:16,864 --> 00:55:18,366
Oh, honey, are you OK?

908
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,538
You know that story about the warlock?

909
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,480
Hypothetically speaking,
could Warwick return to Fernfield

910
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:26,040
even if it was, like, 75 years ago?

911
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,814
Billy, it's Halloween!

912
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:31,084
All the scariest monsters
return this time of year.

913
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:33,091
Give the staff to me, boy!

914
00:55:33,113 --> 00:55:35,593
It belongs to me, Warwick,

915
00:55:35,649 --> 00:55:38,391
the greatest warlock of all time!

916
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,092
I've gotta return that to Sheriff Dan!

917
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,566
What have you done with my book?

918
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,594
Now, sir!
That, my friend, is a party foul!

919
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,038
Unhand that boy!
Enough monkey business!

920
00:55:49,063 --> 00:55:50,269
[grunting]

921
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:53,411
Monkey business, eh?

922
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,038
- [all] Let's go!
- [Sam] Come on!

923
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:58,479
<i>Transformius monchius!</i>

924
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:00,519
[crowd gasping, applauding]

925
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,578
What in tarnation? [chittering]

926
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,816
- [gasping]
- You're under arrest

927
00:56:04,878 --> 00:56:07,449
for insulting an officer of the law!

928
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:08,824
[chittering]

929
00:56:10,484 --> 00:56:11,462
[all laughing]

930
00:56:11,485 --> 00:56:14,090
[shouting]

931
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,794
No one makes a monkey
out of Sheriff Dan!

932
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,197
- [chittering]
- [applause]

933
00:56:23,262 --> 00:56:26,539
Great trick! Just fabulous!

934
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,443
Thank you! It's good to be loved!

935
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,479
- [hiccuping]
- [crowd laughing]

936
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,985
But it's better to be feared!

937
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:38,750
[evil laughter]

938
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:41,648
[Mrs. Carroll] Wow!

939
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:43,455
That was amazing.

940
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,156
[Janice] That was!

941
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,460
Baby, come over here!
Come on, dance!

942
00:56:48,387 --> 00:56:51,027
# <i>Ghosts and goblins</i>
<i>and green little things</i>

943
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,128
# <i>They're comin' up, comin' up</i>
<i>My, oh my, it's a scream</i> #

944
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,506
Dude, did you get the staff
to Sheriff Dan?

945
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:00,807
- Sort of.
- Uh, what do you mean?

946
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,312
- Uh...
- [door opening]

947
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,679
- [chittering]
- Hey, that monkey

948
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:06,683
is dressed like Sheriff Dan.

949
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:09,345
- That is Sheriff Dan!
- What?

950
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:11,547
Run kids! He's coming!

951
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,226
[Pete] But, dude, where's Warwick?

952
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:18,694
There you are!

953
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:20,128
Does that answer your question?

954
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:21,257
Uh-huh.

955
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,995
Now, where is that book?

956
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:25,866
[gasping]

957
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:29,465
Or do you all want to be
turned into monkeys, too?

958
00:57:29,495 --> 00:57:31,873
No, really, Mister,
we don't know where the book is!

959
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:34,811
Wrong answer, boy.

960
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:37,479
<i>Monchius appe...</i>

961
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:39,005
[screaming]

962
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,485
- Hurry!
- Uh...

963
00:57:42,508 --> 00:57:44,545
Come with me!

964
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,751
Before it's too late! Come on!

965
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:50,354
Come on.

966
00:57:50,382 --> 00:57:51,725
[groaning]

967
00:58:02,227 --> 00:58:03,638
[engine starting]

968
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,505
They won't get far.

969
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:23,183
[all panting]

970
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:28,531
What's the plan now, dudette?

971
00:58:28,553 --> 00:58:30,396
Everyone, look around for Pip's body.

972
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:31,730
We don't have much time.

973
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:49,449
Whoa! That's me.

974
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:51,544
"Pip. Rest in peace.

975
00:58:51,576 --> 00:58:53,578
Most loyal friend of Joseph.

976
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,614
The best pup a boy could ever have."

977
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:57,251
What do we do now, Zelda?

978
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:59,626
OK, well, uh, I have to confess.

979
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:00,994
[nervous laughter]

980
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:04,932
I've never really returned
a spirit to a body, per se.

981
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:06,492
But I'll give it a whirl.

982
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:10,765
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

983
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:14,038
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

984
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:19,375
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

985
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:23,111
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

986
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,643
It's working!

987
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:30,325
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

988
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:34,056
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

989
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:39,959
Whoa, guys, my legs!

990
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:45,496
I can wiggle my nose!

991
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:48,839
Wow, guys, I can chase my tail!

992
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:50,674
I'm back! Whoo!

993
00:59:50,701 --> 00:59:52,840
How can I ever thank you guys?

994
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,610
Watch me run!
Look at me go!

995
00:59:54,638 --> 00:59:57,084
Whoo! Awesome!

996
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:05,523
Come on, kids.

997
01:00:06,984 --> 01:00:09,692
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

998
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,169
Quickly, everyone inside!

999
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:18,031
There they are!

1000
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:20,866
[evil laughter]

1001
01:00:34,545 --> 01:00:38,425
I want that book!

1002
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,558
[shouting]

1003
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:48,365
You'll be safe here.

1004
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:51,271
Evil like Warwick cannot
enter the house of God.

1005
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:53,239
Well, how come you have a key?

1006
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:55,037
I'm the organist here every Sunday.

1007
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,038
Don't worry, kids.

1008
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,210
We beat Warwick once,
we can do it again.

1009
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,414
This is you, isn't it?

1010
01:01:10,446 --> 01:01:12,426
You're the boy from the legend.

1011
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:17,459
That was sure a long time ago.

1012
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:22,798
Well, um, I'm Billy, and this is Alice,

1013
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:26,466
and that's Pete and Bartleby,

1014
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,132
and that's Sam.

1015
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,980
Joseph. Joseph Johnson.

1016
01:01:35,738 --> 01:01:37,809
[sniffing]

1017
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:39,718
[growling]

1018
01:01:47,683 --> 01:01:49,287
[all gasping]

1019
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:51,764
This time, there's nowhere to run.

1020
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:53,529
[hooting]

1021
01:01:58,961 --> 01:02:01,601
Mr. Hound, I am Zelda.

1022
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,474
I am all-knowing and all-seeing.

1023
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:07,641
I specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

1024
01:02:07,703 --> 01:02:10,616
I believe I can help you
come from the dark

1025
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,984
back into the light.

1026
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:17,650
I actually like the darkness.
Now get out of my way.

1027
01:02:17,713 --> 01:02:19,420
[shouting]

1028
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:23,163
Oh, no!

1029
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:25,097
- Hoot.
- [grunting]

1030
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,897
Go tell that idiot Warwick
I've captured the puppies.

1031
01:02:30,192 --> 01:02:33,662
Now, I have a different plan
for you pups.

1032
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:35,230
We're doomed!

1033
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,781
For 75 years I held onto this book...

1034
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:46,016
...dreading a full moon
on Halloween night.

1035
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:50,789
It's the only night Warwick could return
to finish the spell.

1036
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:56,523
They have my book!

1037
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,927
How do I get my hands on it?

1038
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:06,363
[Billy] Whoa, what's up with this book?

1039
01:03:06,428 --> 01:03:08,237
The writing's all trippy.

1040
01:03:08,296 --> 01:03:10,833
It's Latin. I learned the language

1041
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:13,142
and studied the book
from cover to cover,

1042
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:17,275
trying to decipher its meaning,
so I could stop Warwick.

1043
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,615
So, what's the book say, Mr. Johnson?

1044
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:24,680
Warwick will need three items
to complete the spell tonight

1045
01:03:24,713 --> 01:03:28,718
for the evil spirits
of the netherworld to remain here.

1046
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:30,694
The nether-what now?

1047
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,428
That's another name
for a place where ghosts live,

1048
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:36,298
usually bad ones.

1049
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:39,396
Halloween is the one night

1050
01:03:39,461 --> 01:03:43,739
these spirits can roam free
in our world.

1051
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:47,245
Only the Howlloween Hound
can call them out.

1052
01:03:47,936 --> 01:03:50,177
Warwick will use those spirits

1053
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:53,778
to control the townsfolk of Fernfield.

1054
01:03:53,842 --> 01:03:56,982
But you said he needs three things,
right?

1055
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,581
That's right.

1056
01:03:59,414 --> 01:04:02,326
His staff, the spell book...

1057
01:04:04,151 --> 01:04:05,596
...and one other thing.

1058
01:04:07,288 --> 01:04:08,631
Well, what is it?

1059
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:16,105
The souls of five young puppies
who share the same blood.

1060
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:19,941
Like brothers and sisters?

1061
01:04:21,168 --> 01:04:23,478
[all] The Buddies!

1062
01:04:24,738 --> 01:04:26,979
- Master!
- [shrieking]

1063
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,078
Don't sneak up on me like that!

1064
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:31,350
Hound has captured the five puppies.

1065
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:32,413
Perfect!

1066
01:04:32,446 --> 01:04:35,484
Those puppies will come in handy

1067
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:37,586
in more ways than one.

1068
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:39,222
[evil laughter, hiccuping]

1069
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,307
[hooting]

1070
01:04:55,336 --> 01:04:56,576
[shouting]

1071
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:02,119
Good work, Hound.

1072
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:04,315
Now all I need is my book.

1073
01:05:04,345 --> 01:05:07,326
You take these puppies
back to the Manor

1074
01:05:07,348 --> 01:05:09,624
and I will meet you there.

1075
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,527
[laughter, hiccuping]

1076
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:27,972
Open wide like the jaws of a dragon!

1077
01:05:31,505 --> 01:05:33,075
You in there!

1078
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:36,647
I have something you want.

1079
01:05:36,676 --> 01:05:40,180
Yo, dawgs, it's that creepy old warlock!

1080
01:05:40,246 --> 01:05:42,522
If you want to see your puppies again,

1081
01:05:42,582 --> 01:05:45,324
you better bring that book to my Manor!

1082
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:46,625
[laughing]

1083
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:55,498
Oh, no, they've got the Buddies!

1084
01:05:55,528 --> 01:05:57,838
Yeah, but what if they're
just trying to trick us?

1085
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:01,505
You really want to take that chance,
dude? I wouldn't.

1086
01:06:14,714 --> 01:06:19,754
I told those wretched children
to bring me my spell book.

1087
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:23,394
What if they don't come with the book?

1088
01:06:23,423 --> 01:06:27,064
Quiet, you moronic birdbrain.

1089
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:29,232
They will want to save

1090
01:06:29,295 --> 01:06:33,471
their precious puppies, won't they?

1091
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:36,013
[evil laughter, hiccuping]

1092
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:45,481
Mr. Johnson, what happens
if we can't stop them?

1093
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:50,119
Then the spirits will be
under Warwick's control forever.

1094
01:06:50,183 --> 01:06:52,220
They'll take over Fernfield first,

1095
01:06:52,251 --> 01:06:54,458
and who knows what they'll do next?

1096
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,228
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

1097
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:01,369
We have to put an end to this tonight,
for all time.

1098
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:05,504
[muffled music]

1099
01:07:06,332 --> 01:07:08,778
[squeaking]

1100
01:07:14,806 --> 01:07:16,444
What are you dudes up to?

1101
01:07:16,475 --> 01:07:18,284
We're gonna get that dirty rat.

1102
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:20,380
Hey, I resent that comment.

1103
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:23,621
Come on, or you'll be a dirty rat
for the rest of your life.

1104
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:26,094
Ready to exact some revenge!

1105
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:33,627
Soon, they will be here
with my spell book,

1106
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,264
and you can devour those...

1107
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,267
...delicious puppy souls.

1108
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:44,473
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1109
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:45,641
Oh, what is it?

1110
01:07:45,704 --> 01:07:47,741
Something is biting me! Ow!

1111
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:51,346
Quickly, Hound,
Hoot do something! Ow!

1112
01:07:52,978 --> 01:07:55,151
[shouting]

1113
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,787
Yo, now that dawg
has some serious moves.

1114
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,163
Vermin!

1115
01:08:07,192 --> 01:08:08,762
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1116
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,501
Change us back, you jerk!

1117
01:08:10,529 --> 01:08:11,837
Run for it, dude!

1118
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:14,507
Back off, you vermin!

1119
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,677
[squeaking]

1120
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:21,047
Hound! Get them!

1121
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:27,820
I'll get that book
from those stupid kids!

1122
01:08:27,846 --> 01:08:30,326
Our kids are here?
Oh, no!

1123
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:33,260
You guard the puppies.

1124
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,524
Yes, Master.

1125
01:08:34,553 --> 01:08:39,935
Fail me, and I'll turn you
into a feather duster.

1126
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:57,517
Psst, Buddies.

1127
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:58,542
Pip!

1128
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:00,078
We have to get you out of here.

1129
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,522
[hooting] What do you
think you're doing?

1130
01:09:02,546 --> 01:09:04,287
I'm saving my friends.

1131
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,022
I can't let them escape.
Master would be furious.

1132
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:10,191
Hoot, why are you so loyal to Warwick?

1133
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:11,825
Seriously, dude!

1134
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,894
It's totally obvious he plans
to get rid of you.

1135
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:18,532
Master sometimes gets angry,
but he would never get rid of me.

1136
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:19,836
He needs me!

1137
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,935
Yo, are you hallucinatrippin'?

1138
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:25,105
He's got that Howlloween Hound
to do his dirty work now.

1139
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:28,878
Man, he calls you names
like moronic birdbrain.

1140
01:09:28,906 --> 01:09:31,250
That does sound like something he'd say.

1141
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:34,722
You have a conscience,
but yet you have spent your whole life

1142
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:37,589
being bossed around by someone
who doesn't respect you.

1143
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:39,720
What do you know?

1144
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,752
I know you never meant to hurt us, Hoot.

1145
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:45,596
And even though you've been
under Warwick's control for a long time,

1146
01:09:45,623 --> 01:09:48,763
you still have a chance
at a happy life in this beautiful world.

1147
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:52,069
But if Warwick wins,
we'll all be doomed.

1148
01:09:52,096 --> 01:09:54,576
Haven't the last 75 years without evil

1149
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:57,272
been a lot nicer than your time
under Warwick's wing?

1150
01:09:57,301 --> 01:10:00,874
It was kind of nice not having to look
over my shoulder all the time.

1151
01:10:10,114 --> 01:10:12,424
You won't regret it, Hoot.
I promise.

1152
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:15,293
[Skip squeaking]
Run! He's on our tails!

1153
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:22,467
Rats! Another ridiculous chase.

1154
01:10:25,628 --> 01:10:28,438
We've got to go, Buddies,
before they return.

1155
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:33,378
Puppies, how did you get out?

1156
01:10:33,436 --> 01:10:34,813
I let them go.

1157
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:36,475
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1158
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:38,280
I've had enough of the dark side.

1159
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:40,811
I won't be responsible for anymore evil.

1160
01:10:41,678 --> 01:10:43,954
[hooting]

1161
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,152
Run, puppies, run!

1162
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:50,130
[B-Dawg] Let's go!

1163
01:10:50,153 --> 01:10:52,724
- [hooting]
- [barking]

1164
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:55,395
[howling]

1165
01:11:13,376 --> 01:11:14,946
Dudes, we're trapped!

1166
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:20,026
Finally, your puppy souls will be mine.

1167
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:22,825
Let them go, Hound.
All you need is me.

1168
01:11:22,852 --> 01:11:23,853
What is this?

1169
01:11:26,656 --> 01:11:28,192
It's me, Pip.

1170
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:30,533
You stole
all my brothers' and sisters' souls.

1171
01:11:30,593 --> 01:11:32,766
Now all you need is me
to complete the spell.

1172
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:35,639
Then you'll have five souls
of the same blood.

1173
01:11:35,665 --> 01:11:40,011
Why, Pip, I do remember you.
Your siblings were delicious.

1174
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:42,642
Take me and let the Buddies go.

1175
01:11:42,672 --> 01:11:44,049
You don't need them.

1176
01:11:44,073 --> 01:11:46,212
Goodbye, Buddies.

1177
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:47,879
No, dude! Don't!

1178
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:50,117
- Stop! No!
- Don't do it!

1179
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:51,521
Pip!

1180
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:53,321
[howling]

1181
01:11:56,618 --> 01:11:57,722
This way, puppies.

1182
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,113
I can now open the portal.

1183
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:18,777
I'm not waiting for that idiot Warwick
any longer.

1184
01:12:34,423 --> 01:12:36,061
[gate creaking]

1185
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:46,806
Open the portal!

1186
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:49,508
Release the spirits of the netherworld!

1187
01:12:51,339 --> 01:12:53,615
[deep evil laughter]

1188
01:12:53,675 --> 01:12:55,780
[maniacal laughter]

1189
01:13:10,092 --> 01:13:11,127
[Joseph] Oh, no!

1190
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:12,536
They've opened the portal!

1191
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:22,777
Have faith, young ones.
We can still stop it.

1192
01:13:22,804 --> 01:13:25,409
- Yeah.
- [engine starting]

1193
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:31,955
[boy laughing]

1194
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:35,085
- Did you guys see that?
- [maniacal laughter]

1195
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:53,501
- Let's get out of here!
- Run!

1196
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:59,340
[maniacal laughter]

1197
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:05,452
# <i>One dark, scary night</i>
<i>some wolves...</i> #

1198
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,256
Sheriff Dan really
went all out this year.

1199
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:12,354
- The special effects are amazing!
- Oh, yeah.

1200
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,700
[babbling]

1201
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:19,935
[groaning]

1202
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:21,940
Dude.

1203
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,469
[all groaning]

1204
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,408
Perfect.

1205
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:07,644
- Bring it right to me.
- [car doors close]

1206
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:13,214
Yo, this place is
a lot creepier at night.

1207
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:16,325
Stay close to me, kids.

1208
01:15:26,826 --> 01:15:28,328
Warwick!

1209
01:15:28,394 --> 01:15:31,773
We're here. We have your book.

1210
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,871
Ah, just in time.

1211
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,215
Hand it over!

1212
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:40,684
Where are the Buddies?

1213
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,586
Oh, they're around here somewhere.

1214
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:47,023
[chuckles sinisterly]

1215
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,620
Now, I'll be taking that book.

1216
01:15:51,651 --> 01:15:54,131
No book until you hand over the puppies.

1217
01:15:54,187 --> 01:15:56,758
Oh, really?

1218
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,036
[grunting]

1219
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:02,665
- [Pete] Mr. Johnson!
- [Warwick laughing]

1220
01:16:09,202 --> 01:16:10,306
[laughing]

1221
01:16:10,336 --> 01:16:12,782
[Alice] Oh, Mr. Johnson, are you OK?

1222
01:16:12,805 --> 01:16:14,785
- [groans]
- Are you OK?

1223
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:16,844
My book! [laughs]

1224
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:21,255
Go after him, kids.
It's up to you now.

1225
01:16:22,115 --> 01:16:23,150
[groans]

1226
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:26,162
[Billy] Let's go.

1227
01:16:30,356 --> 01:16:35,634
- [all groaning]
- Dude. Dude.

1228
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:38,802
Now I shall complete the spell,

1229
01:16:39,298 --> 01:16:42,211
and all the creatures
of the netherworld...

1230
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:44,811
...will be here forever.

1231
01:16:46,371 --> 01:16:50,513
And I will rule the land.

1232
01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:52,714
[laughing]

1233
01:16:56,848 --> 01:16:58,327
[yelling]

1234
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,692
[choir singing]

1235
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:04,762
"Our Father who art..."

1236
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:08,100
Wait a minute.
This is not my spell book!

1237
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,298
It's the Bible!

1238
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:12,540
You!

1239
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:18,444
Hand me my staff... boy!

1240
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:21,040
No! <i>Protectus!</i>

1241
01:17:21,073 --> 01:17:22,746
[yelling]

1242
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:24,345
Whoa!

1243
01:17:29,548 --> 01:17:31,528
Oh, sweet mama!

1244
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:34,394
Where there's a kitchen,
there's gotta be food.

1245
01:17:34,419 --> 01:17:38,060
Quick, we need to hide before
the Howlloween Hound finds us.

1246
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:52,571
Mmm, perfect. Pickled eggs!

1247
01:17:52,637 --> 01:17:55,481
A fellow can't fight evil
on an empty stomach.

1248
01:17:58,744 --> 01:18:01,054
[slurping]

1249
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:04,549
Ew, Budderball, those are eyeballs.

1250
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:06,718
They're a bit rubbery.

1251
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:16,935
Uh, dude!

1252
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:20,771
No, seriously, Mudbud,
they're not that bad. You want one?

1253
01:18:20,798 --> 01:18:24,075
Now, Budderball, please don't panic,

1254
01:18:24,101 --> 01:18:26,775
but the Howlloween Hound
is right behind you!

1255
01:18:26,804 --> 01:18:29,375
And I shouldn't panic?

1256
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:32,110
Hello, puppies.

1257
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:35,920
Just thought I would visit
the kitchen for a late night snack.

1258
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:40,861
All right, dawg, you win,
but take Budderball first.

1259
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:43,262
Uh, he's got the most meat on his bones.

1260
01:18:43,287 --> 01:18:44,288
B-Dawg!

1261
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:48,064
Actually, I'm not that tasty. Really.

1262
01:18:48,092 --> 01:18:50,265
Silence! I don't care who's first.

1263
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:52,433
You'll all end up in the same spot.

1264
01:18:52,463 --> 01:18:55,069
Trust me, dawgs. I've got a plan.

1265
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:56,806
B-Dawg has a plan?

1266
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:58,643
I can have a plan.

1267
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:01,546
Yo, Budderball, when I tell you,

1268
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:02,982
let one rip.

1269
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,075
[howling]

1270
01:19:04,108 --> 01:19:05,109
Do it, dawg!

1271
01:19:05,142 --> 01:19:06,212
[groans]

1272
01:19:06,277 --> 01:19:08,154
[farting]

1273
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:10,625
[coughing]

1274
01:19:11,048 --> 01:19:13,654
No! This can't be happening!

1275
01:19:17,455 --> 01:19:19,799
[laughing] Our secret weapon!

1276
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:21,770
That was wicked, dude!

1277
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:23,999
That takes years of practice.

1278
01:19:24,061 --> 01:19:25,506
Good thinking, B-Dawg.

1279
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:29,204
I knew Budderball's potion
could neutralize anything,

1280
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:31,177
including the Howlloween Hound.

1281
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:32,806
The kids! Come on!

1282
01:19:32,837 --> 01:19:34,475
[grunting]

1283
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,784
Quickly, Billy!

1284
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:45,156
The sun is rising!

1285
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:46,990
Say the spell!

1286
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:49,826
- Come on, Billy!
- [Pete] Say it, dude!

1287
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:53,360
[groaning]

1288
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:57,896
- <i>Aboleo alica.</i>

<i>Dnuoh Neewollowoh!</i>

1298
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,228
You're finished, Warwick!

1299
01:20:24,254 --> 01:20:26,063
[all gasping]

1300
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:30,368
[yelling]

1301
01:20:33,563 --> 01:20:37,067
I will take you with me!

1302
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:39,238
[both yelling]

1303
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:41,579
[Sam] Mr. Johnson! No!

1304
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,508
[Warwick] Ah! Ah!

1305
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:50,316
It's you, that petulant child!

1306
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,387
You're back!

1307
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:55,988
The name is Joseph.
Joseph Johnson!

1308
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:58,191
[shouting] No!

1309
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,872
Whoa!

1310
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,549
Uh, what if he comes back?

1311
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,350
I don't think that will
happen again, Alice.

1312
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,564
[yelling]

1313
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:42,465

- Whoa!

[kids panting]

1317
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,251
Huh?

1318
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:03,923
[muttering]

1319
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,270

01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,641
What? What?

1323
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:36,994
Pip!

- [gasping]
- [yelping]

1325
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:44,298
Oh, Pip. Pip.

1326
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:45,971
[kissing]

1327
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:47,438
But where are the Buddies?

1328
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,168
- [barking]
- [laughing] Whoa!

1329
01:22:49,196 --> 01:22:50,698
[Alice] Rosebud!

1330
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:51,835
- B-Dawg! Come here.
- Hey, Buddha.

1331
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:54,369
[Bartleby] Budderball. Budderball.

[laughing]

1333
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:04,347
Come on, everyone!
Let's get out of this evil place!

1334
01:23:04,378 --> 01:23:06,415
- [Pete] Yeah.
- [Sam] Come on, buddy, let's go!

1335
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,255
Come on, let's go!

1336
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:14,222

01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:16,199
[police siren chirping]

1338
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,565
[Dan] I'm here. Clear the way.
I'm here. It's OK.

1339
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,803
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1340
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:29,412
[giggling, laughing]

1341
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:34,682
I haven't had an episode like this since
that Kiss concert in the '80s. Wow!

1342
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:44,253
Maybe now I can be a wise owl.

1343
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:46,229
It's a new day at last.

1344
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:49,830
[Rodney] Hey, can we get
some help over here?

1345
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:53,597
- Oh.
- [Skip] Yeah, it's cold!

1346
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,231
Can someone find our clothes?

1347
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,707
[all laughing]

1348
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,508
Thanks again for all the help,
Mr. John...

1349
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,075
I mean, Joseph.

1350
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,055
It was a pleasure... dawg.

1351
01:24:10,077 --> 01:24:12,523
[all laughing]

1352
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,719
So, what are you gonna do now?

1353
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:19,129
Well, I tracked down Pip's
brothers' and sisters' owners.

1354
01:24:19,153 --> 01:24:22,998
They live all across America now,
so we're going to visit.

1355
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:27,297
Figure it's about time
that Pip and I do some living.

1356
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,532
See the country.

1357
01:24:31,297 --> 01:24:33,140
It's so great to have
a new leash on life.

1358
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,645
I'll miss you, Buddies.

1359
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:37,272
Yo, dawg, we'll catch you
on the flip side.

1360
01:24:37,303 --> 01:24:40,546
I think what my brother's saying is,
we'll never forget you.

1361
01:24:40,607 --> 01:24:42,416
Hang loose, dude.

1362
01:24:42,442 --> 01:24:44,945
Now that you can eat again,
do me a favor.

1363
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:47,982
You need to check out the chili cheese
dogs at every town you visit

1364
01:24:48,047 --> 01:24:49,788
and tell us which one's the best.

1365
01:24:49,816 --> 01:24:51,454
Have a great time, Pip.

1366
01:24:51,484 --> 01:24:52,758
Goodbye, Buddies.

1367
01:24:56,389 --> 01:24:58,369
[whining]

1368
01:25:00,727 --> 01:25:02,968
I haven't felt this spry in years.

[chuckling]

1370
01:25:04,464 --> 01:25:06,967
We better hit the road. Bye, kids.

1371
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,105
[all] Bye, Mr. Johnson!
