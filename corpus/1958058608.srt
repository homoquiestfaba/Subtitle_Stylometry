Congratulations on

Oh, you look tired.

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
You know, you really
ought to get some rest.

JOSEPH: Yeah, I--

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,481
I know.

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,275
I'm thinking of going to
the cabin for a few days,

16
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,484
all right?

17
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,694
Good.

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,862
But Anthony will
be here any minute.

19
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,699
I told him how busy you are,
but he insisted on seeing you.

20
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,076
Well, maybe if I hurry, I'll
be gone before he gets here.

21
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,119
No chance.

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,078
He called from his car phone.

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,870
He's downstairs.

24
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,083
I'll go put these
in some water, OK?

25
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,157
I had to come here
personally to thank you.

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,037
The flowers were enough.

27
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,663

Did I?

32
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,063
Well, maybe this is my
way of showing you how

33
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,982
I appreciated your services.

34
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,861

00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,341
[glass breaking]

188
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,056
POLICE RADIO
DISPATCHER: Negative.

189
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,724
Your Honor, at this
time, my clients would like

190
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,892
to enter a plea of not guilty.

191
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,024
Please, noted bail
is set at $50,000.

192
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,110
And a trial date will be
announced this afternoon.

193
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,570
But Your Honor, bail
was requested by the state

194
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,156
to be $250,000 each.

195
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,118
These men are up on four counts
of assault with intent to kill

196
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,411
and two counts of rape.

197
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,787
Objection Your Honor.

198
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,039
Counsel is assuming
my clients are guilty.

199
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,749
MARION: My case is very strong.

200
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,419
The defendants were still in
the house when police arrived.

201
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,336
Now, these rapists have--

202
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,754
Alleged rapists.

203
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,631
The young men are all
in protective custody

204
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,258
of their parents.

205
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,428
And they are all respectable
citizens of our community.

206
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,722
In other words, they're rich.

207
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,683
One more remark out of
you, counselor, and you'll

208
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,727
be selling hot dogs in
the courthouse steps.

209
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,645
Yes, Your Honor.

210
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,231
My decision stands.

211
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,235
Bail is set for $50,000.

212
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:36,986
Thank you, Your Honor.

213
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,328
So what the hell
are you doing here?

214
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,664
You're supposed to
be in Sacramento.

215
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,418
I was transferred and
not by choice, I might add.

216
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,837
JUDGE: Mr. And Mrs. Gaynor?

217
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,755
That's Walters
now, Your Honor.

218
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,885
If it would please the
court, Ms. Walters?

219
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,470
What would please
the court is if you

220
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,307
would conduct your reunion
elsewhere, Ms. Walters.

221
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,391
Yes, Your Honor.

222
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,184
JUDGE: Thank you.

223
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,696
So how do you like
living in Sacramento?

224
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,114
I like it fine.

225
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,116
Look, Joseph, you
probably won't understand,

226
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,618
nor will you listen.

227
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,328
But I'm going to try and
explain it to you anyway.

228
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,704
Now, I'm sure you
read the paper.

229
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,498
So you are aware of
the brutal beatings

230
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,750
and rape of over a dozen people
in New York's Central Park.

231
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,543
Don't tell me you're going
to try to link my clients

232
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,628
to those crimes as well.

233
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,213
Of course, I'm not.

234
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,882
Listen, if we're
trying this case,

235
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,550
are we supposed to
talk to each other?

236
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,177
- Yes.
- Oh, good.

237
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,720
Go on.

238
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,598
Last week, a dozen kids
enter a fast food restaurant

239
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,433
and for no reason
at all vandalized

240
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,310
and brutally beat
innocent people.

241
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,104
And when questioned, they
said they were wilding.

242
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,606
Wilding?

243
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,399
Your clients did it,
'cause they felt like it.

244
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,443
They don't even have any
excuse except boredom.

245
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,778
Now, this is happening all over.

246
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,071
And people are scared.

247
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,239
It's got to stop.

248
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,365
That's good, honey.

249
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,574
What are you doing for dinner?

250
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,576
Oh, you haven't
heard a word I said.

251
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,827
I heard you, I did.

252
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,246
I just, uh, don't
want to eat alone.

253
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,497
We can discuss it over dinner.

254
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,831
What do you say?

255
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,707
No, thanks.

256
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,667
I have a date.

257
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:15,417
Ugh.

258
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,047
Kind of a tough
commute, isn't dinner,

259
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,590
to eat with a forklift driver?

260
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,967
MARION: He's a contractor.

261
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,447
I don't like it.

262
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,408
It's already getting
too personal.

263
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,159
Let me carry the
ball on this one.

264
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,661
Forget it, Jack.

265
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,329
Look, this is my case.

266
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,747
Now, if you want to help, help.

267
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,082
Otherwise, stay out of my way.

268
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,834
All right, all
right, I'll help you.

269
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,503
But I still think you
should take a backseat.

270
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,296
Not a chance.

271
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,470
No, let's start
at the beginning.

272
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,515
Where were you
last Tuesday, Carl?

273
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,767
Me?

274
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,020
Your name's Carl, isn't it?

275
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,021
Don't look at him.

276
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,147
Look at me.

277
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,565
I'm asking you the question.

278
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,526
Where were you?

279
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,362
I was playing baseball.

280
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,407
Not what you were
doing, but where were you?

281
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,659
I'm sure that a Harvard-bound
student like you

282
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,537
can distinguish the difference
between what and where,

283
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,205
can't you?

284
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,415
Can't you?

285
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,668
MARTIN: He was with me.
- Nice try.

286
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,836
That's real stupid.

287
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,546
Don't call the boy stupid.

288
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,506
You said he was
playing baseball.

289
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,467
He answered your question.

290
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,302
Shut up, or get out.

291
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,095
Pardon me?

292
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,514
We're paying you a great
deal of money, sir.

293
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,891
That's right.

294
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,226
And my reputation is
as good as my record.

295
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,394
I have never lost a case.

296
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,980
And I don't plan
on losing this one.

297
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,900
If they are convicted, they
will all have gray hair

298
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,695
by the time you see them next.

299
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,948
So now you listen to me, or
you get yourself a new lawyer.

300
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,866
OK.

301
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,661
We're listening.

302
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:18,916
From now on until the trial,
you three will be like angels.

303
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,336
You won't miss, or be
late for a day of work.

304
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,796
How can we miss a day of work?

305
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,756
We don't even have jobs?

306
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,383
I've arranged for
all three of you

307
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,593
to do voluntary work
in various places

308
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,722
in the city, a
Children's Hospital,

309
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,934
an old aged home,
and a blind school.

310
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,978
It's very important to
win the hearts and souls

311
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,439
and sympathy of the jurors.

312
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,358
I don't work where
I don't get paid.

313
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,609
You don't work when
you don't get paid?

314
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,740
You get paid in jail,
you want to work there?

315
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,243
You do exactly
what Mr. Gaynor says.

316
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,996
And get a hair cut.

317
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,842
You do believe they're
innocent, don't you?

318
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,261
It's not important
when I believe.

319
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,346
The jury has to believe it.

320
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,305
They can hurt him.

321
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,098
I can't.

322
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,357
BILL: I just can't
believe they let him walk.

323
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,276
Now, you said you'd
lock them up for good.

324
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,569
I will.

325
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,404
Look, this is just
normal procedure.

326
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,447
The bail is posted.

327
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,406
They pay the bail.

328
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,699
They're out until the trial.

329
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,783
Yeah, but you
said the bail was

330
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,161
a quarter of a million dollars.

331
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,912
What difference does it make?

332
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,331
As soon as we get a
jury, we lock them up.

333
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,333
Just like that.

334
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,544
Yes, trust me.

335
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,546
I've prosecuted 53 cases.

336
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,174
This one will be the easiest.

337
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,050
I don't think I can
go through with this.

338
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,011
Of course, you can.

339
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,389
Doris, do you want them
to get away with this?

340
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,017
No, of course not.

341
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,394
But it took me six hours
to fall asleep last night.

342
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,940
And when I finally
did, I saw their faces.

343
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,151
I'm terrified of them.

344
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,444
Well, I'm going on the stand.

345
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,070
And I'm going to do
whatever it takes

346
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,741
to put those bastards away.

347
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,659
You know, why go through all
this crap anyway, you guys?

348
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,787
If we testify, and they get
out, what's going to stop them

349
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,205
from coming after us anyway?

350
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,081
MARION: Well, they could
come after you anyway.

351
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,876
So why not get them now?

352
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,670
If we let them walk, then
we are telling the people

353
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,548
that the system fell apart.

354
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,968
Help me make them a symbol
for the rest of the country.

355
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,387
Help me put them away.

356
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,724
I can't do it without you.

357
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,517
It's your decision.

358
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,188
Well, you might have
to do it without me.

359
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,307
MARION: No, not this weekend.

360
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,183
Oh, I don't know.

361
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,226
Well, I don't know.

362
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,727
The trial hasn't started yet.

363
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,187
Uh-huh.

364
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
Oh, how's the
house coming along?

365
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,357
Yeah.

366
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,442
Oh, great, great.

367
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,445
Um, oh, god, I have
so much work to do.

368
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,699
Yeah, I have to be
in court at 7:30.

369
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,658
OK.

370
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,201
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

371
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,369
Good.

372
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,370
I love you, too.

373
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,162
Bye.

374
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,112
[doorbell]

375
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:22,618
[classical music playing]

376
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,209
Hi.

377
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,252
MARION: Hi.

378
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,045
Come on in.

379
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,673
You change your
mind about dinner?

380
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,675
No, this is business.

381
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,385
Oh, well, then enter.

382
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,059
Well, I see you've done
very well for yourself.

383
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,936
Private practice,
like I always told you,

384
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,354
was the way to go.

385
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,272
Well, if it were
corporate I'd understand.

386
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,899
But criminal?

387
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,858
I don't know, Joseph.

388
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,860
That I don't understand.

389
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,528
Well, then let me
explain it to you.

390
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,366
You do a good job,
you get a guy off

391
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,619
or just an inexpensive fine,
he or she writes you a check.

392
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,329
How hard is that to understand?

393
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,581
It loses something
in the translation.

394
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,542
What is that supposed to mean?

395
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,212
Case in point,
"Anthony versus Maxwell."

396
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,880
Everyone in the world
knew he was guilty.

397
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,758
And you get him off on
a petty technicality.

398
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,803
"State versus Scott,"
a 68-year-old man gets

399
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,765
a check for $125 tax refund.

400
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,141
He keeps it to pay his rent.

401
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,226
And you put him in jail.

402
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,019
It wasn't his money.

403
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,813
Oh, do you think
he really knew that?

404
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,650
All right, "Armstein versus
Conner," an open and shut case.

405
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,986
That shouldn't have been in
court more than two weeks.

406
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,238
And you drag it
out for two years.

407
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,615
They lose crucial evidence,
because it went on for so long.

408
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,491
And your client walks.

409
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,790
I see you've been
following my career.

410
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,500
I've been getting
ill over your career.

411
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,339
I'll never forget
that first case.

412
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,298
What, when we were married?

413
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,217
Yeah.

414
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,137
Yeah, I remember
that, the good old days.

415
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,306
Yeah, they were,
especially the night

416
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,227
before your first case
when I held you in my arms

417
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,521
and you cried yourself to sleep.

418
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,189
Because you knew the
man you were defending

419
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,151
was guilty of
molesting children.

420
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,946
And you knew you had the
power to get him off.

421
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,449
And you did.

422
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,242
Yeah, well, that
was a long time ago.

423
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,122
You want to know something?

424
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,248
No one really gives a shit.

425
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,127
How bout a glass of wine?

426
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,129
No, thanks.

427
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,672
I just came by to
ask you a favor.

428
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,549
What's that?

429
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,051
No tricks.

430
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:44,801
Play it straight, OK?

431
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,389
See you in court, counselor.

432
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,945
Do you believe in
capital punishment?

433
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,238
Have you ever been arrested?

434
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,782
Do you believe in
the judicial system?

435
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,575
When a woman says
no, does she means yes?

436
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,994
Thank you very
much, Mr. Peters.

437
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,995
Accepted, Your Honor.

438
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,541
Do you have any
children, Mr. Peters?

439
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,667
Yes, I do.

440
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,543
How many?

441
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,711
MR. PETERS: Two.

442
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,837
Girls, boys?

443
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,172
Two girls.

444
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,048
Yeah?

445
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,007
What are the ages?

446
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,342
One is 22, one is 24.

447
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,013
No, thank you, Your Honor.

448
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,931
You're excused, Mr. Peters.

449
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,477
State your name, please.

450
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,437
Sally Glass.

451
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,065
MARION: Sally, are you
currently employed?

452
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,149
Oh, yes.

453
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,193
I work in films under contract.

454
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,528
I'm an actress.

455
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,947
Oh, anything I
might have seen?

456
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,449
"The Passionate Pussycat,"
"Three is Not Enough,"

457
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,785
"Masters and Servants."

458
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,286
I understand.

459
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,414
No, I haven't seen you perform.

460
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,417
Sally, let me ask you,
in any of these films,

461
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,088
were you ever asked to
partake in a rape scene?

462
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,840
On a few occasions.

463
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,968
And how did it make you feel?

464
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,761
Well, let me put it this way.

465
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,223
If I can help it, I avoid them.

466
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,766
OK.
Thank you.

467
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,642
Accepted, Your Honor.

468
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,363
No thank you, Your Honor.

469
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,658
JUDGE: Court is adjourned till
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

470
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,201
We could go to jail.

471
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,620
Hey, no one's going to jail.

472
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,998
I wouldn't last five
minutes in that hell hole.

473
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,374
You should have
thought about that

474
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,459
before you raped that girl.

475
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,087
Don't ever say what I did.
Can you hear me?

476
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,591
Don't you ever say what I did.

477
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,510
Feel that power, Marty?

478
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,056
Couple of hits with that
bat, and you feel that power.

479
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,391
Right.

480
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,851
Tell me how powerful
you're going to feel

481
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,896
in jail for 20 or 50 years.

482
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,691
No one is going to jail.

483
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,692
I don't want to go to jail.

484
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,818
Will you shut the hell up?

485
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,988
No one is going to jail.

486
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,909
We got the best lawyer in the
state, maybe even the country.

487
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,453
And if that's not good
enough, we'll take care of it

488
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,370
ourselves.

489
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,039
Hey, what do you mean?

490
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,583
Yeah, what do you mean?

491
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:26,171
The power, gentleman.

492
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,633
Just one or two swings more
in the head with the bat,

493
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,136
and they'll stop breathing.

494
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:38,308
If it comes to that, I will kill
anybody before I go to jail.

495
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,477
I couldn't do that.

496
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,396
I don't want any
part of any killing.

497
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,606
We are in this together.

498
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,651
And if one of us
falls, we all fall.

499
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,278
And we don't want to fall.

500
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,738
You got that?

501
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,532
I mean, do you really got that?

502
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,909
Huh?

503
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,370
Yeah.

504
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,872
Whatever it takes.

505
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,665
Whatever it takes.

506
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,803
Proceed.

507
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:34,656
Wilding-- from the adjective
wild, not civilized, savage,

508
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:41,162
not easily controlled,
a wild boy lacking

509
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,039
social and moral restraint.

510
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,046
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

511
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm sure you've heard
this story a million times

512
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,844
from your grandparents,
a relative, your mother

513
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,930
and father, who used
to speak of a time

514
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,433
when they would leave
their front doors

515
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:07,397
opened or unlocked and
felt safe in their homes,

516
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,940
when their neighbor
would look out for them.

517
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:16,781
Today, even with bolts
and chains on our doors,

518
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,574
we're still afraid.

519
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:30,295
In New York, a group of kids
beat and raped innocent people.

520
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:34,883
And when questioned,
they said it was fun.

521
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,307
In Sacramento, young men enter
a fast food establishment

522
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,351
and brutally beat
innocent people half

523
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,687
to death with baseball bats.

524
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:53,109
When questioned, they
said they were bored.

525
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,487
Good reason.

526
00:35:55,487 --> 00:36:01,993
When questioned later, they
said they felt the power.

527
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,287
Ladies and gentlemen, they
felt the power of wilding.

528
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:17,801
Today you as jurors sit
across from three young men

529
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,221
that the prosecution
will prove have

530
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,890
added themselves to
this grotesque phenomena

531
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,184
that's shocking our country.

532
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,230
The prosecution will prove that
these three young men brutally

533
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,441
beat a security guard at
the Mann's parking lot

534
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,153
after they robbed the store.

535
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:41,658
The defendants then followed
Betty Trusky to her home

536
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,785
where they crashed
her small birthday

537
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:49,457
party and brutally beat,
again, Bill Paxton,

538
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,503
and then raped Doris and Betty.

539
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,678
Now, I'm not giving up.

540
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,518
I'm not giving up
on my neighbor.

541
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:12,355
I'm not giving up on the system.

542
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:17,318
And I'm certainly, certainly
not giving up on you.

543
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,112
I still have hope.

544
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:28,455
The prosecution will prove
that the defendants are guilty

545
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,874
and, with your help, make
them a symbol for the rest

546
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:35,712
of the country, a symbol
that says nobody is going

547
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,340
to push us around anymore.

548
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,137
We, the people, are responsible
to make this country

549
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,182
a safe place to live.

550
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,894
Help us take the fear
out of our sleep.

551
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,730
Help us watch our TVs
and not our front doors.

552
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,656
These young men added
some excitement to

553
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:08,661
their boring night by wilding--

554
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:14,417
remember, not civilized,
savage, lacking

555
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,003
social and moral restraint.

556
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,884
Let's restrain these
animals, so they don't

557
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:27,096
harm or rape anyone else again.

558
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,931
Thank you.

559
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,229
JUDGE: Will the defense
state it's opening remarks?

560
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,948
That was really lovely
how the prosecution

561
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:48,952
painted her own Norman
Rockwell lifestyle.

562
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,579
But what the prosecution
has really done

563
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,999
is begin to plead my case.

564
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,627
There is crime all over
the city and in New York

565
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,754
and in Sacramento.

566
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,966
The prosecution hasn't told you
anything that you don't know.

567
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,593
You know these things.

568
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,428
So let's stick to the facts.

569
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,974
Law is about facts.

570
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,892
The fact of the matter
is is that Betty

571
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:19,148
Trusky and her friends
were having a wild party.

572
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,985
Personally, I never
heard of people

573
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,737
taking a shower during a party.

574
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,823
You take one before,
maybe one after.

575
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,742
But during?

576
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,661
So this has got to
bring to your minds

577
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:37,750
the question, what kind of party
this is in the first place?

578
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,587
One, there was no forced entry.

579
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,882
Two, the door to the house that
the party was being held in

580
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,218
was locked.

581
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,472
So this means that
someone inside the house

582
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,225
opened the door and
invited my clients inside.

583
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,983
Somewhere along the
way, the prosecution

584
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,111
is going to say that the
defendants were found

585
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,864
inside the house by the police.

586
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,199
This is fact.

587
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,495
But during this trial, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

588
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,582
I am going to prove
that my clients were

589
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,751
lured into this
house of sin where

590
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,503
a sex orgy was taking place.

591
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,341
They were seduced
and forced to perform

592
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,510
against will lewd
and violent acts

593
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,764
upon the occupants
of this house of sin.

594
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:37,602
The only thing these three
young men from fine families did

595
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,271
was defend themselves.

596
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,940
When forced to
partake, they ran.

597
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,236
When caught, they fought back.

598
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,697
My clients are victims.

599
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,451
My clients are falsely accused.

600
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,747
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, my clients are innocent.

601
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,957
They're not guilty.

602
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,920
The prosecution did such a good
job with my opening remarks,

603
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,840
maybe I should let her
plead my whole case.

604
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,675
Thank you.

605
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,444
I'll have the salmon
with a baked potato,

606
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,571
salad with house dressing.

607
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,447
Oh, my god.

608
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,200
I just lost my appetite.

609
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,661
Nothing for me.

610
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,246
Hey, Joseph.

611
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,040
Hi, Paul.

612
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,583
I was in your
courtroom this morning

613
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,422
watching the master at
work, very impressive,

614
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,965
very impressive.

615
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,175
Hey, at the rate you're
going, you could have

616
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
this case wrapped up tomorrow.

617
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,805
- Thank you, Paul.
- Hi, Linda.

618
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,223
How you doing?
- Fine, Paul.

619
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,182
How are you?

620
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,684
Good.

621
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,185
Listen, uh, Joseph, can we
talk in private, please?

622
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,103
Yeah.

623
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,104
Excuse us, honey.

624
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,480
This is just business.

625
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,398
Excuse me, Linda.

626
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,534
You remember Julio Marquez?

627
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,035
Drug dealer?

628
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,788
Yeah, well, he's on trial
over in courtroom 268.

629
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,500
I got this guy off three
times with this Judge Huxley.

630
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,712
And now he is not buying
anything I'm throwing at him.

631
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,839
You know, he's a big client.

632
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,591
He's worth a half a mill to me.

633
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,925
And now he's getting cold feet.

634
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,761
He's talking about
changing his lawyers.

635
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,512
Can you help me out here?

636
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,139
What did he do, Paul?

637
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,558
Well, he shot a
narcotics agent.

638
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,893
I mean, it's no big deal.

639
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,603
He-- it's just an
attempted murder charge.

640
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,230
And if anybody can
get him off, you can.

641
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,858
Hey, look, there
are no witnesses.

642
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,111
There are plenty of alibis,
alibis you wouldn't believe.

643
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,323
And-- and besides that,
I could probably squeeze

644
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,617
50 maybe 75 grand for you.

645
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,910
Good.

646
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,786
Have him come see
me Tuesday morning.

647
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,204
OK.

648
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,789
I'll have him bring some
samples, too, [sniffs]

649
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,706
if you know what I mean.

650
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,048
OK, so we got a deal.

651
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,804
Oh, Sue, bring me Mr. Gaynor's
check when they're through.

652
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,930
It's on me.

653
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,680
Bon appetit.

654
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,476
Excuse me, I've
changed my mind.

655
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,478
I would like something.

656
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,607
How about a lobster and
filet mignon and the best

657
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,150
bottle of champagne you have.

658
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,486
And put 30% tip on for yourself.

659
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,117
I get the impression
you don't like Paul.

660
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,454
I just don't like
sleazy lawyers.

661
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,122
What else is bothering you.

662
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,542
We're winning, aren't we?

663
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,920
I don't know, Joseph, I kind
of think you were a little too

664
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,129
hard on Marion, that's all.

665
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,130
Don't you?

666
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,881
No, I don't.

667
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,513
Well, I can't just do it.

668
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,765
Listen, Douglas, this case
is very important to me.

669
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,267
And it hasn't started
off as planned.

670
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:12,316
It's not your fault.
Look, I've got to get--

671
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,359
I've got to get to bed.

672
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,485
I've got a lot of work to do.

673
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,114
And I-- well, of
course, I see him.

674
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,616
He's trying the case.

675
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,659
No!

676
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,872
It has nothing to do with it.

677
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,457
Look, I've got to go.

678
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,750
Fine.

679
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,668
Fine.

680
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,460
Goodbye.

681
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,597
No more questions, Your Honor.

682
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,896
JUDGE: Cross-examination?

683
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:16,881
Of all the times you were with
Carl, did he ever strike you?

684
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,716
No.

685
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:23,262
Threatened to hit you, raise
a hand to you, clinch a fist,

686
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,641
show any violence
towards you at all?

687
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,476
Carl?

688
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,061
No.

689
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,398
Carl's very gentle and caring.

690
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:39,946
I mean, he's always bringing
me flowers and stuffed animals.

691
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:43,991
I only saw him get angry
once, when a woman's purse

692
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,494
was being taken on Boardwalk.

693
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,496
And what did he do?

694
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,539
He ran after the
man and-- and got

695
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,000
the purse back to the woman.

696
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,294
He complained about
how anyone could

697
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,880
violate another
person's property

698
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,257
and how disgusting it was.

699
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,425
I think I'm gonna throw up.

700
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,228
You and Carl ever make love?

701
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,021
Yes.

702
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,440
Was it ever violent,
or he ever angry

703
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,484
while he made love to you?

704
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,319
No.

705
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,239
We're in love.

706
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,615
He's gentle and warm.

707
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,288
So he never raped you
or tried tying you up

708
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,499
or slapped you while he
was making love to you?

709
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,085
No.

710
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,962
I didn't think so.

711
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,506
No more questions, Your Honor.

712
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,298
You may step down.

713
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:52,101
Will you please
identify your attackers?

714
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,854
Those three over there.

715
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,605
I would like
the record to show

716
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,775
that the witness Doris Anderson
has pointed to the defendants

717
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,609
as her attackers.

718
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,280
No more questions, Your Honor.

719
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,086
What did you do for work
last year around this time?

720
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,758
I don't know.

721
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,633
I've had a lot of
jobs since then.

722
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,430
I really don't remember.

723
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,016
Well, let me help you
remember, the Personal Touch

724
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,769
Incorporated?

725
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,313
I worked for a
telegram company.

726
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,066
Oh, Western Union, maybe?

727
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:44,111
No, a private company.

728
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,072
What did you do at
this private company?

729
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,782
Objection.

730
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,868
I can't see what her job has
to do with her being attacked,

731
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,620
beaten, and raped, Your Honor.

732
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,789
It has everything
to do with it.

733
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,749
There is a direct connection
between the witness's

734
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:00,669
previous employment
and my clients.

735
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,298
The witness will please
answer the question.

736
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,510
Um, it's a singing
telegram company.

737
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,596
We perform at birthdays
and anniversaries.

738
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,307
We perform characters
singing and dancing.

739
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,267
Characters?

740
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,062
What characters do you do?

741
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,898
I do Mae West
and Marilyn Monroe.

742
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,982
And you dance?

743
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,069
Sometimes.

744
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,071
Would strip
describe more closely

745
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,491
the type of dancing you do when
you enter a stranger's home?

746
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,201
Sometimes, yes.

747
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,995
Do you like
seducing strangers?

748
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,871
Sustained.

749
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,420
Do you walk around
the house the blinds

750
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,880
open completely naked?

751
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,383
No, not that I'm aware of.

752
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,593
Well, let me make you aware.

753
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,428
I have three different
police reports.

754
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,806
August 19th, a neighbor
complained music too loud

755
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,641
and woman walking
around house naked.

756
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,976
Objection.
JOSEPH: August 28th--

757
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,185
Mr. Gaynor.

758
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
Loud music and
party after 3:00 AM.

759
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,688
JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor.

760
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,981
Two people were seen
bushes having sex.

761
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,440
MARION: Objection!

762
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,650
May 3rd, neighbor
complained of wild screams--

763
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,026
Mr. Gaynor.

764
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,069
JOSEPH: --and possible
drug and sex party.

765
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,279
Objection!

766
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,989
Counsel is
badgering the witness.

767
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,867
JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor,
if you continue

768
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,869
to go on another
theatrical rampage,

769
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,120
I will hold you in contempt.

770
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,624
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

771
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,506
Doris, have you
ever met Carl Sloan?

772
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,426
No, never.

773
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,219
Are you sure?

774
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,597
Yes, I'm positive.

775
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,893
Look at him again.

776
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:42,271
Except for the night of
the attack, you cannot

777
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,192
place that face anywhere?

778
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:49,320
No, definitely not.

779
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,075
According to the records of
the Personal Touch Incorporated

780
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:59,997
telegram service, you
performed at a birthday

781
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:05,669
party for one Greg Marks on
the 8th of July last year.

782
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:10,841
You drove to 8804 Sunrise
Terrace in Beverly Hills.

783
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:15,262
Your appointment was for
a 9 o'clock stripper-gram.

784
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,473
The company got
a call that night

785
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:22,186
around midnight saying you
were not coming back to work.

786
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,562
You then proceeded
to drink yourself

787
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,605
into bed with three men.

788
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,148
Objection.

789
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,108
JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor, will you
please keep your remarks

790
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,569
in the form of a question?

791
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,988
The jury will disregard
that last statement.

792
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,870
That night there
was a young man

793
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,250
at that party who tried
to stop you from drinking

794
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,835
and offered to drive you home.

795
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:51,298
And that young man is one of
the defendants, Carl Sloan.

796
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,967
Do you place his face now?

797
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,266
No.

798
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,101
I don't remember.

799
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,727
Alcohol does make
you forget things

800
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,105
you don't want to remember.

801
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,233
Maybe some photographs might
help refresh your memory.

802
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,567
What?

803
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,610
JOSEPH: No further
questions, Your Honor.

804
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,366
You may step down.

805
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,999
Court's adjourned
till tomorrow morning.

806
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,251
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

807
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,546
Because it was something that
I just wanted to forget about.

808
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,423
You know, I didn't
have to testify.

809
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,301
I was doing you a favor,
and I got humiliated.

810
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,304
It was my ass up there on
the witness stand, not yours.

811
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,307
Well, what about
the police reports?

812
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,101
The old man across the
street always bitched about us.

813
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,769
Half the time the cops
even stayed for the party.

814
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,980
I didn't know they were
making formal reports.

815
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,023
[phone ringing]

816
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,817
What else haven't you told me?

817
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,695
You know, I don't need this.

818
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,655
I should have dropped
charges like I wanted to.

819
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,990
[phone ringing]

820
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,075
Listen, when the
appropriate time comes,

821
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,245
I will put you
back on the stand.

822
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,122
You can forget about it.

823
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,624
There is no way I am going
back on that witness stand.

824
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,841
[phone ringing]

825
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,282
Why didn't you
warn me about Doris?

826
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,533
It's public knowledge.

827
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,577
Anybody could go
through police files.

828
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,496
What about the pictures?

829
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,997
There are no pictures.

830
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,291
Are you working
for me or for her?

831
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,209
No pictures?

832
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,044
No pictures, I'm sorry.

833
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,045
Are you?

834
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,254
I had to.

835
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,339
Why?

836
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,215
It's my case.

837
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,257
I have to win.

838
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,509
Even if they're guilty?

839
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,968
You don't know that for sure.

840
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,886
No?

841
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,596
No.

842
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,557
You know, I just got an
offer from a private firm,

843
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,102
partnership plus a couple
of hundred thousand a year.

844
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,728
Yeah.

845
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,732
Well, they removed the offer
after today's performance?

846
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,859
You think you're winning
this case, don't you?

847
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,653
Well, it's not over
till it's over, pal.

848
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,904
I'm going to win this case.

849
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,863
You know why?

850
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,864
Why?

851
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,408
Thank you.

852
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,661
Because I don't get written
up in "Lawyers Review."

853
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,371
I don't win for me, Joseph.

854
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,914
I win for justice.

855
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,375
And that's a hell of a lot
more than money can buy.

856
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,626
Yeah.

857
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,794
Well, sometimes money
can buy justice.

858
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:40,717
Might I remind you that I,
too, have never lost a case.

859
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,182
I guess she told you.

860
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,475
She did, didn't she?

861
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,226
Yup.

862
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,526
MARION: This is our last hope.

863
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,029
Now, if we can get a solid
testimony from you and Betty,

864
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,448
we can win this case.

865
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,659
Look, Bill, we've gone
over this 1,000 times.

866
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,829
The defense is going to come
at you with both guns loaded.

867
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,831
They're going to try and
break you any way they can.

868
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,875
I know.

869
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,168
Yeah, but you're
gonna have to relive

870
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,669
the nightmare of that party.

871
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,172
Not only by my questioning,
but by the brutal attack

872
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,048
of the defense.
- Look, I'm not Doris.

873
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,008
OK?

874
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:21,884
I've got nothing to hide.

875
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:22,801
We know that.

876
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,136
We believe that.

877
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,387
But we also know that
you have a temper.

878
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,472
Hey, I want revenge, damn it.

879
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,973
Damage Those kids should die.

880
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,434
Bill, look, that's
exactly what the defense

881
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,102
is gonna try and get you to do.

882
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,229
Listen, it's
patience and composure

883
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,775
that gets a jury's ear, not
screaming for a hanging.

884
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,444
Do not think revenge.

885
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,237
Think the facts.

886
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,239
Now, let's go.

887
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:44,990
Come on.

888
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,495
Cross-examination?

889
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,418
Mr. Paxton, do you
mind if I call you Bill?

890
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,169
If you like.

891
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,928
Bill, you Betty and Doris
have been friends for how long?

892
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,805
About eight years.

893
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,808
And how would you describe
your relationship with them?

894
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,559
We're best friends.

895
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,356
Do you have a girlfriend?

896
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,733
I date.

897
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,445
How many parties have
you been to at their house?

898
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,447
I'd say just about all of
them since they moved there,

899
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:31,286
five, no six to be exact.

900
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,414
You ever sleep overnight?

901
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,165
On occasion.

902
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,128
Neither of them ever
make advances towards you

903
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,798
when you've stayed there?

904
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,052
Like I said,
we're just friends.

905
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:50,180
No further
questions, Your Honor.

906
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,723
Thank you, Mr. Paxton.

907
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,517
That's it?

908
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,309
Yeah, that's it.

909
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,149
You may step down.

910
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,347
I want to know what
the hell's going on.

911
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,599
What are you talking about?

912
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,809
Your cross-examination
of Bill Paxton.

913
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,269
What about it?

914
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,604
It was nonexistent.

915
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,272
You interviewed him.

916
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,898
You know he acts
like Dirty Harry.

917
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,984
A first year law student
would have had him screaming

918
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,611
his way into a mental ward.

919
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,988
What do you want from me?

920
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,573
First, I'm too good.

921
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,825
Now, I'm not good enough.

922
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,243
What will make you happy?

923
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,787
To win this case and
beat you at your best.

924
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,248
If your clients are
guilty, then cop a plea.

925
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,001
If they're not, don't throw the
case away, for Christ's sake.

926
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:25,359
Betty, on the evening
of June 22nd this year,

927
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,736
where were you at 10:00 PM?

928
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,738
I was at work.

929
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,657
And where do you work?

930
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:35,410
The Mann's Market
on Circle Canyon Road.

931
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,914
Will you please tell
the court what happened?

932
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,501
It started at work when
Bob, our security guard,

933
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:46,129
was severely beaten
in the parking lot.

934
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,384
Will you tell us
exactly what you saw?

935
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,678
I remember him walking
out to the parking lot

936
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:58,558
to collect money from that man,
who walked out without paying.

937
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,851
I would like
the record to show

938
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,728
that the witness
has pointed to Carl

939
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,106
Sloan, one of the defendants.

940
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,441
JUDGE: So noted.

941
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,568
And then what happened?

942
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,239
Well, out of nowhere came
someone with a baseball bat.

943
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,534
And the bat swung down
and hit Bob on the arm,

944
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,536
and then again on his back.

945
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,164
And Bob fell to the ground.

946
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,167
The boy dropped the
bat, and he ran.

947
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,878
And then another boy
picked up the bat

948
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,923
and swung down on Bob's head.

949
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,676
I turned away.

950
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,511
Every time I looked
back the bat was raised

951
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,639
high over the boy's head.

952
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,810
And on its way
down, I turned away.

953
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,854
I kept hearing laughter
mixed with thumping.

954
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,402
And I kept turning away.

955
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,573
I covered my ears and
prayed he would stop,

956
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:55,782
but he kept swinging the bat.

957
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:07,377
Felt like hours until I turned
around, and the boys were gone.

958
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,754
Bob was lying in
the parking lot.

959
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:17,137
I was sure he was
dead, but he wasn't.

960
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,184
Are you all right?

961
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,356
Your Honor, I would
like to request

962
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,985
a recess due to the continuous
stress my key witness

963
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,197
must endure during this trial.

964
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:39,201
JUDGE: Court is adjourned till
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

965
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:39,993
Thank you.

966
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,049
How do you want
to do this one, man?

967
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,467
I want to do this one myself.

968
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,390
I knew would come in handy.

969
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,767
This isn't right, man.

970
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,268
(TEASING) This
isn't right, man.

971
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,978
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Allen?

972
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,979
No, it's not right.

973
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,731
But it's necessary, all right?

974
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,860
Remember, Allen, necessity
is the mother of invention.

975
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,363
Yeah, right.

976
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,531
Guys, watch the car.

977
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,200
Beep if you see
anything strange.

978
01:00:20,200 --> 01:01:02,617
I'll be right back

979
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:06,997
[tv static]

980
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,480
Tattletale

981
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,856
[gun shot]

982
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,342
MARION: At this
time, Your Honor,

983
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:46,304
I regret to inform the
court that last night

984
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:50,517
that Betty Trusky was shot
and killed in her home.

985
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,478
Police are calling
it attempted robbery.

986
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,355
I would like to express
mine and the court's

987
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,899
deepest sympathy at this time.

988
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,318
Since she was the
prosecution's last witness,

989
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,696
I suggest if counselor
has no objections,

990
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,281
we go on with the defense.

991
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,118
In light of Betty
Trusky's murder,

992
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:13,581
the prosecution requests a week
to further prepare its case.

993
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,876
I understand your grief over
the loss of your key witness.

994
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,754
But Your Honor, the defense
is prepared to plead its case.

995
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,298
If the prosecution
is just buying time--

996
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,634
Your Honor the
prosecution has just

997
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,469
been informed that
an eyewitness who

998
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:31,391
originally refused to testify
is now willing to cooperate.

999
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:35,895
Now, tomorrow I will be able
to produce that witness.

1000
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:40,316
Your Honor, here is the name
and the address of that witness.

1001
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,777
She's been visiting
relatives out of town.

1002
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,989
And it's taken us this
long to track her down.

1003
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,199
JUDGE: You will get 24 hours.

1004
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,202
And this witness better
have a lot to say.

1005
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,954
Thank you.

1006
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,414
Court's adjourned
till tomorrow morning.

1007
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,007
What's the problem?

1008
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,468
You heard the lady.

1009
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:07,844
She found an eyewitness.

1010
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,232
See, it's standard
procedure, Mr. Micelli.

1011
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,818
Now, what I want to do first
is get you out on bail.

1012
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,653
So I'm gonna take you
before Judge Huxley--

1013
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,654
Huxley?

1014
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:27,947
Hey, don't worry about Huxley.

1015
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,365
I got him in my back pocket.

1016
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,909
We are like this.

1017
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,036
Now, if I get you off, I
get an additional $100,000--

1018
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,329
What do you mean if?

1019
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,081
Did I say if?

1020
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:40,543
No, I mean, when I get you off,
I get an additional $100,000.

1021
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,256
Now, between me and you,
did you kill this guy?

1022
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:49,219
It's none of your
fuckin' business.

1023
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,595
OK.

1024
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,638
I can live with that.
All right, come on.

1025
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,430
Let's go.

1026
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,813
What the hell
is going on here?

1027
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:00,855
What are you holding out on me?

1028
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,232
Take is easy, Jack.

1029
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,858
What the hell do you
mean, take it easy?

1030
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,693
We're getting our
ass kicked in there.

1031
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,113
Then you-- then you come
up with this witness?

1032
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:09,697
We don't have a witness.

1033
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,241
Who the hell is this witness?

1034
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,742
The witness is me.

1035
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,995
I used a fake name and
gave them my address.

1036
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,455
What?

1037
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,375
Hey, those
bastards are guilty.

1038
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,335
Now, it's my guess
that they killed Betty.

1039
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,921
If they're scared,
they'll come after me.

1040
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,714
You're crazy.

1041
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,675
You're going to get
yourself disbarred.

1042
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,136
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

1043
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,387
Jack!

1044
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:36,015
Listen, I didn't
hear any of this.

1045
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,517
You're on your own
now, counselor.

1046
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:51,656
Hey, Joseph and
Linda, how are you?

1047
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:55,785
Hey, hey, Joseph, why
didn't you return my call?

1048
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,705
Hey, don't turn your back
on me, your cocksucker?

1049
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,583
You take my money, and
then you let me hang?

1050
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,917
[spits] Piece of shit.

1051
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,294
You're all the same, whores!

1052
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,712
Nothing but whores!

1053
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,629
You fucking--
- Calm down.

1054
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,797
Guys, let me at him.

1055
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, calm down.

1056
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,466
ANTHONY: I'll get
you for this, Joseph.

1057
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,219
I swear till the day
you die, I'll get you.

1058
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,637
Nobody [inaudible].

1059
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,514
Hey, Anthony, Anthony,
take it easy, Anthony.

1060
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,724
Take it easy.

1061
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:20,810
I've got everything
under control.

1062
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,314
Listen, uh, sorry
about that, Joseph.

1063
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,648
He's, uh, he's a little upset.

1064
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,900
I just, uh--

1065
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,942
I just took him for 100 Gs.

1066
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:07,106
You know, if-- if we don't
find this witness and kill her,

1067
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,984
tomorrow on the stand that
bitch DA is going to crucify us.

1068
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:10,902
Let's do it, man.

1069
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:11,986
Let's just do it now.

1070
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:19,994
I can't.

1071
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:23,081
I can't do this shit, Carl.

1072
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,083
What are we doing?

1073
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,418
I don't want to kill anyone.

1074
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,672
We've hurt enough
people already.

1075
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,007
We haven't done anything.

1076
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,509
I told you, man.

1077
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,427
I told you he was gonna
to be a problem, didn't I?

1078
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,096
Maybe we can just
tell the truth.

1079
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,014
We can't tell the truth.

1080
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,349
Don't you understand that?

1081
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,184
We can't fuckin' tell the truth.

1082
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,852
OK.

1083
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,105
OK.

1084
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:51,150
I know, I'll say it's
my fault. I started it.

1085
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,193
I'll take the blame.

1086
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,528
I'll tell 'em I did everything.

1087
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,156
But you didn't kill Betty.

1088
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,408
I'll tell him I--

1089
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,158
killed Betty.

1090
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,830
You're going to do that?

1091
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:07,208
You're going to tell
him you shot Betty?

1092
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,209
Yeah.

1093
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,128
I'll tell him I shot Betty.

1094
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:13,965
All right, come here.

1095
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,884
So you're gonna
to go to the cops.

1096
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:21,014
And you're gonna tell 'em you
broke into that place alone?

1097
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,474
Yeah.

1098
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,352
You're gonna say you
smashed everything up,

1099
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,105
you raped that girl yourself?

1100
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,149
Uh-huh.

1101
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,400
And then you're
gonna tell them you

1102
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,072
went back alone and shot Betty?

1103
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:38,823
Yeah.

What's with the fucking gun?

1107
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,110
Just tyin' up
a few loose ends.

1108
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:16,986

1109

1114
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,043
Linda, what did you find out?

1115
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,211
Allen's dead.

1116
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,128
What?

1117
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,421
LINDA: Allen's dead.

1118
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,923
How?

1119
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,883
LINDA: Hung from a backstop
in a baseball field.

1120
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,177
If it's suicide, my guess
is our boys are guilty.

1121
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,638
JOSEPH: And if it's
murder, [sigh] our boys

1122
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:47,308
are still probably guilty.

1123
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,394
What about Marion's,
uh, witness?

1124
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,686
There isn't one.

1125
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,854
What do you mean
there isn't one?

1126
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,691
LINDA: There isn't one.

1127
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:55,900
Linda, hang up.

1128
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,692

Of course, I'm all right.

Listen, I'm sorry I woke you.

1140
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,304
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Yeah, good night.

Good morning, Miss.
Walters.

Good morning.

Morning, Thompson.

You smell good this
morning, detective.

Oh, it's something
I found downstairs.

I hope you don't mind.

Oh!
Awh.

Where's the witness?

Ah!

There is no witness.

Ah!

You bitch.

1160

You set me up!

that's burnin' our phone lines.

1174
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:25,200
It seems Beverly Hills Attorney
Joseph Gaynor's in the news

1175
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,577
again.

1176
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,704
But this time, he's been
arrested for murder.

1177
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,372
Now, let's talk about
it on our lines.

1178
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,876
Call me, 1-900-HOT-OPIC.

1179
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,669
Call me.
Let's do it

1180

JACK: Marion, you're not
even listening to me.

1181
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,590
The man is guilty.

1182
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,467
The man is a murderer.

1183
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,135
MARION: It was self-defense.

1184
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,304
JACK: Self-defense?

1185
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,598
It's 10 blocks away from
the original attack.

1186
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,224
Come on, who are
you kidding, Marion?

1187

He saved my life.

1188
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:54,605
Look, let's not go to court.

1189
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:55,648
Let's settle for five.

1190
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,149
He'll be out in two.

1191
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,109
That's insane.

1192
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:02,279
Look, Jack, I'm defending him.

1193
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,031
Marion, once you cross
to the other side,

1194
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:05,616
there's no going back.

1195
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:08,494
Yeah, well, maybe I'll
like the other side.

1196
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,704
It's not your league.

1197
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,165
It's not in you to
free a guilty man.

1198
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,376
He's not guilty.

1199
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,585
Marion, I've got
enough witnesses

1200
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,879
to fill Dodger Stadium.

1201
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,756
Let's avoid a trial.

1202
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,591
I don't want it to get dirty.

1203
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,592
I owe him.

1204
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,470
You don't know him shit.

1205
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,055
All right, level with me.

1206
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,640
What has he given you?

1207
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,017
What, a quarter of a million,
half a million, what?

1208
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:32,768
Nothing.

1209
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,522
Oh, god.

1210
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,815
You still love this guy.

01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:38,565
That's it.

1212
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:46,156
Look Marion, I tried to be fair.

1213
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,909
I tried to cut a deal.

1214
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,203
If this goes to trial,
it's your funeral.

1215
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,922
Thank you.

1216
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,135
So what did Jack say?

1217
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,387
He said five
years, out in two.

1218
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,805
I said no.

1219
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,390
Two years?

1220
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,684
That tells you what
he thinks of me.

1221
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:15,728
Joseph, he's
just doing his job.

1222
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,022
The trial starts next week.

1223
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,065
You know, this
is really ironic.

1224
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,526
I used to have a case just
like this one, two witnesses.

1225
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:23,444
I was gonna put--

1226
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,320
Wait a minute.

1227
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,988
Wait a minute.

1228
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,449
Remember, you're the client.

1229
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,284
Now, if you don't like the
way I'm trying this case,

1230
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:31,410
get yourself another lawyer.

1231
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,332
I'm sorry, Marion,
you're right.

1232
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,213
I'm just running a
little scared, you know?

1233
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:46,008
I never been on this
side of the law before.

1234
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:55,768
Well, neither have I.
