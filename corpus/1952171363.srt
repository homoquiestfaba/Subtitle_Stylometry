1
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,613
Back it in. Back it in.
Back it in. Back it in.

2
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:18,549
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're good.
You're good.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,588
Hey, Harlan.

4
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:24,423
Special delivery.

5
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:25,591
Fresh shipment in from Nebraska.

6
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:28,427
Great. Just stack it
in the freezer, will you?

7
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,194
I got to open up.

8
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:31,030
All right,
you got it, boss.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,557
(machines powering up)

10
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:00,893
Ever wonder
what's in that hot dog?

11
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,562
Human body
in a meat grinder.

12
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:05,931
Shop foreman found an arm.

13
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,401
The rest of him
is prime grade A sirloin.

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:10,903
Body in
a meat grinder.

15
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,037
Sounds kind of "Mob-ish"

16
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:14,106
except they left town
in the '80s.

17
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,942
The last guy to operate
the meat grinder

18
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,210
is this guy over here.

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,445
Manny Saldano,
age 37.

20
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,447
Worked for Meteor
for 11 years.

21
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:22,648
Shop foreman vouches for him.

22
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:25,184
Says he inspected
all three of his machines

23
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:26,685
before he clocked him out.

24
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:27,553
Well, keep him here.

25
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:29,655
We're going to need
to process him.

26
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:30,656
Sure.

27
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:33,959
Check out the smorg-ie-bord.

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,586
Go ahead.

29
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,694
Mike.

30
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,165
Good God...

31
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,208
Looks like the elbow
got stuck in the blade.

32
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:54,646
Yup, the ulna.

33
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,048
One of the strongest
bones

34
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:56,949
in the body.

35
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,250
Probably what jammed
this grinder.

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,482
Possibly why whoever did this
didn't finish the job.

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,461
It's like that Morrissey album...

38
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,163
"Meat Is Murder."

39
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,564
(grunting)

40
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:15,158
I'm going to need a hand.

50
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,308
The last remains
of John Doe.

51
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,843
We're going
to need sifters.

52
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,311
Blood's everywhere.

53
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:03,015
Phenolphthalein and Luminol
are useless.

54
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,184
We're going to have
to dismantle this

55
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,319
piece by piece.

56
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,086
Yeah.

57
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,521
I'll get a foreman.

58
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,822
I think I can handle this.

59
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,325
You know about
meat grinders?

60
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,727
Well, everything's
pretty much plumbing.

61
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,229
Male into female parts.

62
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,359
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

63
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:31,074
Grinder plate.

64
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,844
Blade.

65
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,783
The worm.

66
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:00,072
Found an ear plug.

67
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,373
Ear wax

68
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,308
is ripe with DNA.

69
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,105
Except...

70
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,247
all the employees wear them.

71
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,916
This one's different
than the ones they use.

72
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,852
Whoever wore this
brought it with them.

73
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:18,255
We just have to find out
whose ear it fits.

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,894
Girl's name is Linda Damen,
23, apparent suicide.

75
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,896
Father stopped by
with dinner,

76
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,832
found her dead,
called 911.

77
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,400
No signs of forced entry?

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,134
Nope.

79
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,602
Did find
her wallet out.

80
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,137
Empty.

81
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,272
Empty?

82
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,173
Maybe she was
just broke.

83
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,400
Hey.

84
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:41,947
Hey.

85
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,715
You guys are fast.

86
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:44,616
You pronounce?

87
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,386
7:20. Coroner will be
able to tell you more.

88
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,720
Looks like
she bled out.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,422
Her left wrist
is transected.

90
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,923
It's atypical for a female.

91
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,393
Women usually
commit suicide in the tub.

92
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,394
It's easier cleanup

93
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,229
for whoever's
left behind.

94
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,628
Yeah.

95
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,326
Warrick.

96
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:06,171
Did her parents say whether
she was living with a man?

97
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,873
Was dating
a Brody Jones.

98
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,809
No idea where
he works or lives.

99
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,211
Did someone move her?

100
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,314
She was propped up
when we got here.

101
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,315
I checked for vitals.

102
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,183
You sure with all your
life-saving efforts

103
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:18,950
you didn't move her?

104
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,487
Hey, man, like I said,
I checked for vitals.

105
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,715
It's okay, baby.

106
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,294
The victim had
no response.

107
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,330
I had no reason to move her.

108
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,664
Well, someone moved her.

109
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:35,997
She bled out here
and she's dead there.

110
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,669
(sighing)

111
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,676
I'm going
to hit the road...

112
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,711
baby.

113
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:48,305
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,920
There's a stain here.

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,888
So cold stains.

116
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,753
Is it recent?

117
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,855
It's cool to the touch,
yeah.

118
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,735
Sara.

119
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:13,899
I think our suicide
just became suspicious circs.

120
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,876
Since I'm the one who always
seems to state the obvious

121
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:21,346
this arm was dead
before it was hacked off.

122
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,882
What do you make
of the, uh

123
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,051
scar tissue on the palm?

124
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,220
Occupational hazard, maybe.

125
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,855
I see this kind
of thing a lot

126
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:33,859
in bricklayers,
plumbers, carpenters.

127
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:36,228
Looks like
it's blistered.

128
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,464
Gradual denaturation
of the proteins

129
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,799
in the epithelials.

130
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:44,803
Resulting in general
scarring on the palm

131
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,737
or surface.

132
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,371
I'll send this
sample to trace.

133
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,746
Tips of the fingers look like
they're worn to the bone.

134
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,839
Can you get a partial?

135
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,484
Much more than that.

136
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,782
Lansberry's Ridge Builder.

137
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,489
One application

138
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,858
to the bulbs
of the fingers

139
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,295
and the ridges
plump out temporarily

140
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,059
like a Chia Pet on steroids.

141
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,594
Petrov Samsko.

142
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:47,532
Non-gaming sheriff's permit,
head chef, DeBreff Restaurant.

143
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,000
Chef... that would explain

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,470
the burn scar tissue
on his palm.

145
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,437
It's "DeBreff."

146
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:53,872
It's a five-star restaurant.

147
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:54,639
I've eaten there.

148
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,842
Good, maybe you can
get us a table.

149
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,111
Different sole,
different size.

150
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,012
Thank you.

151
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,982
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

152
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,817
It's just a
standard procedure.

153
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:09,421
Do you have any idea
where your daughter's
boyfriend works?

154
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,356
Well, a casino.

155
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:14,326
Uh, which one?

156
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,861
All of them.

157
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,896
He's, uh, he's a gambler.

158
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:22,968
Um, used to drag Linda out,
keep her up

159
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,669
days at a time.

160
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:25,504
Ran her

161
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,440
health down, her spirit.

162
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,075
She was getting
better, though.

163
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:35,013
She had a, uh... rough time
after college finding herself

164
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,608
but she was getting better.

165
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,531
The transection of
the left wrist is consistent

166
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,965
with a self-inflicted wound

167
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,568
particularly because
she's right-handed.

168
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,436
There's no hesitation marks.

169
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:00,438
Isn't that uncommon for suicide?

170
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:03,174
People usually stutter-cut
a few times

171
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,176
trying to work up the courage.

172
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,412
This woman cut herself
with one smooth motion.

173
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,381
This DB is all wrong.

174
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:13,051
Someone moved her two feet
from where she bled out.

175
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,920
What did
the tox screen say?

176
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,720
Nothing. Not back yet.

177
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,956
But I'll get it to you
soon as it is.

178
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,516
Thank you.

179
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,922
Is that glass in her hair?

180
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,463
Minute pieces of it, yeah.

181
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,901
I tweezed a few for trace.

182
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,505
We didn't see any broken
glass in her apartment.

183
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,441
Round edges, tinted...

184
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,443
It looks polarized.

185
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,412
Probably safety glass.

186
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,413
Yeah.

187
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,615
Too bad it didn't protect her.

188
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,750
Uh, DeBreff, please hold.

189
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,419
DeBreff,
please hold.

190
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,720
DeBreff, please hold.

191
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,588
Hi. Last name?

192
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,756
We don't have
reservations.
W-We're here...

193
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,458
Eh, party of four?

194
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,926
Three weeks
from Thursday?

195
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:55,594
Let me see.

196
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,562
Excuse me,
but you don't understand.

197
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,965
No, I'm sorry.
You
don't understand.

198
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:00,932
Your walk-ins

199
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,100
on a very busy night.

200
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,168
We're short a chef.

201
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,703
We know.
He's dead.

202
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,671
Not only dead.

203
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,161
Dismembered.

204
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,942
We're with the crime lab.

205
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,143
(phone ringing)

206
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,611
I'll get the owner.

207
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,950
Are you sure
it's Petrov?

208
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,620
Coroner made
a positive identification.

209
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,754
What makes
you think

210
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,189
this event
happened here?

211
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,958
We found traces
of aspic and olive oil

212
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,026
under his fingernails.

213
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:31,529
Means that he went
into the meat grinder

214
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,497
without showering.

215
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,033
Possibly straight
from this kitchen.

216
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,801
If there was a murder
in our kitchen

217
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,003
don't you think
that, uh...

218
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,005
(chuckling)
I'd know about it?

219
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,269
I don't know.
Would you?

220
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,547
Hey, Cath?

221
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,615
Blood spatter.

222
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,651
It's a kitchen.
The chefs use knives.

223
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,718
That's not uncommon.

224
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:55,020
You are...?

225
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,154
Gil Grissom.

226
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,985
I'm with her.

227
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,293
Who's, uh, Stephanie?

228
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,662
One of my waitresses.

229
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,164
Oh, I understand
how chefs cut their fingers

230
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,601
and how the kitchen help
could have blood spatter

231
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,301
on their uniforms

232
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:14,795
but how does a waitress get
blood on the back of her shirt?

233
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,677
We can shut you down
for hours

234
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:23,512
or get a warrant
and shut you down for good.

235
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,014
Give me till after the rush?

236
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,324
(sighs)

237
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,694
Okay, this rush
is taking

238
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,162
entirely too long.

239
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,830
The
coquilles St. Jacques.

240
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,564
Thank you.

241
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:43,134
People always think
that the show is out front.

242
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,570
It wasn't till
I waitressed

243
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,539
I realized it's
all in the back.

244
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,591
What are you looking at?

245
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,727
Looks like a
V-pattern to me.

246
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,558
What do you think?

247
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,664
Yeah.

248
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:13,865
What, caused by a candle?

249
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,701
Burn area seems too
big for a candle.

250
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,136
Okay. Kitchen's all yours.

251
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:22,607
Mr. Dutton, uh,
can I ask you
what happened here?

252
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,241
Oh, geez.

253
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:26,611
Uh, waiters probably put the
candles too close to the wall.

254
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,806
I've told them
a million times.

255
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,753
Ah, excuse me.
Stephanie?

256
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,653
Yeah.

257
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:36,688
Is this your uniform?

258
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,090
Don't have to answer that,
Steph.

259
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,625
They don't have a warrant.

260
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,627
I thought you said
the Mafia left town.

261
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,762
(chuckling)

262
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,630
We have the owner's consent

263
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,632
so, again,
could you explain

264
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:48,860
this blood?

265
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:50,602
Order up, Stephanie.

266
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,169
Hot items.

267
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:54,906
Two filet mignon
and one
coquilles St. Jacques.

268
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:56,674
Boogie.
Go, go.

269
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,442
Hey!

270
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,677
We found blood spatter
on the uniforms

271
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,613
of several employees
who worked the night

272
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,648
that Chef Petrov died.

273
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:05,383
Ross Halpo...

274
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,618
sous chef.

275
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:07,685
Lola Creighton...

276
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:08,920
saucier.

277
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,656
You want to tell us
how the blood got here?

278
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,851
It's my blood.

279
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:15,293
We got a rule
in the kitchen:

280
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,762
Don't touch my knife;
don't touch my johnson.

281
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:22,467
I was working with Petrov,
the head chef.

282
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,368
Hey, hey, that's my knife!

283
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,305
Touched his knife.

284
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,439
I deserved it.

285
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,140
Okay.

286
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,745
That still doesn't explain how
the blood got on the uniforms.

287
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:34,813
They don't get it.

288
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,481
Chefs here have a ritual.

289
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,682
Macho thing.

290
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:38,416
If you get cut

291
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,453
it's tradition that
you disburse maximum spillage.

292
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,688
Oh, hey, watch it.

293
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:44,823
Ah, blood!

294
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,291
Oh, hey, stop... ooh!

295
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,227
That's how everyone
got blood on themselves.

296
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:49,828
Macho.

297
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,697
Haven't these people
ever heard of HIV?

298
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,832
Apparently not.

299
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,766
Alert all your employees.

300
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,669
We're going to take over
your kitchen, starting now.

301
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,805
Hey. You got something
on that glass?

302
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,740
Didn't beep you to say hi.

303
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,177
Glad to see
you're settling in, Hodges.

304
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,179
You were right.
It is polarized.

305
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,248
Ultraviolet quotient
is very high.

306
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,183
Glass is from
a car windshield.

307
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:16,287
Maybe she was in some kind
of car accident.

308
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,522
Hit-and-run...

309
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:20,425
Then she crawls home,
gets on her bed

310
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,960
and commits hari-kari?

311
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,361
Stranger things have happened.

312
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,698
If you weren't such a lab rat,
you would know that.

313
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,967
You got a make of a car for me?

314
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,835
No.

315
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,203
But...

316
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,906
I can narrow it down
to the year it was manufactured.

317
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,976
Oar companies add more
ultraviolet sealants

318
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:41,880
each season to stay ahead
of safety standards.

319
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,214
Used a comparison study

320
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:46,240
of a car that
was made in 2001.

321
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:51,055
Your windshield glass
is from a 2002 model.

322
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:52,056
Thank you.

323
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,889
Mm-hmm.

324
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:57,295
(sighs)

325
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:58,529
The windshield's intact.

326
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,398
Yeah. Well,
maybe the glass

327
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:03,968
came from another
windshield in this lot.

328
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:05,403
Yeah. Let's take a look.

329
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:08,740
You know, you can tell
a lot about a person

330
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,909
by what they leave
in their car.

331
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,443
Rotten bananas.

332
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,245
(chuckles)

333
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,735
Business suit.

334
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,419
I got a paycheck.

335
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,888
Who would do that?

336
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:25,290
Underwear.

337
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,058
(chuckling)

338
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:30,255
That looks like adhesive.

339
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,431
Still tacky.

340
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:34,565
Hey, hey!

341
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,767
What are you doing?

342
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:36,935
That's my car.

343
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,503
Crime lab.
How are you?

344
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,071
Cute picture.
I'm late for work.

345
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,407
We noticed you had your
windshield replaced recently.

346
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:43,341
The adhesive's seeping.

347
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,309
You get what you pay for.

348
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,944
So the car shop was
having a half-off deal.

349
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,879
I'm in no position
to go to the big guys.

350
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,848
Did replacing the windshield
have anything to do

351
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:51,916
with the tenant

352
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,584
in apartment 325?

353
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,286
Linda? Yeah.

354
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:56,287
She did it.

355
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:59,023
I'd send her the bill
if I thought she'd pay.

356
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,325
She hasn't paid
for anything else

357
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:01,526
she trashed in this complex.

358
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:02,593
Like what else?

359
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,929
Oh, well,
that would depend on her mood.

360
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:08,524
Um, when she's up,
she breaks the mailboxes.

361
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,436
When she's down

362
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,938
she throws the patio furniture
into the pool.

363
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:16,099
(screaming)

364
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:18,609
She broke my
windshield yesterday

365
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,511
because she said she heard me

366
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,480
talking on my cell about her.

367
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,849
(screaming, glass breaking)

368
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,384
You bitch!
I heard you!

369
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,053
We just call her
"the whack job in 325."

370
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,488
Well, she died yesterday.

371
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,824
We think it may have been
a suicide.

372
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:36,351
Yeah? I'm surprised
someone didn't kill her.

373
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,333
Look, unless you want
to call my pit boss

374
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:47,038
and tell him I'm under arrest,
I'm going to work.

375
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,340
Thank you.

376
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,010
I would like to see
Linda Damen's tox report.

377
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,035
Yeah.

378
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,395
(turns off motor)

379
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,696
Fresh off an airplane

380
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,198
from a conference,
and bam...

381
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:16,100
I got seminal fluid.

382
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,159
Lucky you.

383
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,685
Some things never change.

384
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,687
What's that?

385
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:39,019
Cocaine.

386
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,532
Presence of blood on the drain.

387
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:48,900
Blood, coke, semen.

388
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,928
These people were
doing everything
in this kitchen but cook.

389
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,207
I'll go have
a little chit-chat

390
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,075
with the hostess.

391
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,908
They always seem
to know everything.

392
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,065
Blood clot.

393
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,434
What is that, sand around it?

394
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:25,603
Looks like it.

395
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,738
What would sand be doing
in a kitchen?

396
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,073
Well, one thing's

397
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,042
for sure:

398
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,610
The blood got there
before the sand.

399
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,980
This was not
a little knife nick.

400
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,515
This guy was stuck.

401
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:39,984
I mean, uh,
he bled out long enough

402
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:44,478
for his blood
to pool and clot.

403
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,755
Excuse me.

404
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,721
We're going to need
all your knives.

405
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,031
Starting with yours.

406
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:55,133
(clears throat)

407
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,533
I need them back
by the next shift.

408
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,261
Well, that depends
on what we find.

409
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:08,179
(siren wailing in distance)

410
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,149
Oh, uh, this is
the clearest picture

411
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,518
that we could find
of Brody.

412
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,486
Thank you.

413
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:16,521
I'll get it
to a detective.

414
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,623
The shoeprint that you found

415
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:19,490
in Linda's bedroom?

416
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,592
Are you thinking
that Brody might have...?

417
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:22,527
Oh, we don't know yet.

418
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,595
We're going to wait and see
what the evidence tells us.

419
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,632
I did meet a tenant at your
daughter's apartment complex

420
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:30,835
that described Linda as...

421
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,069
troubled.

422
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:35,173
Did you ever witness
her being violent?

423
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:39,143
We like to think of her
as normal, as improving.

424
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:43,080
She was prescribed lithium
her junior year of college.

425
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,183
She was diagnosed bipolar?

426
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,617
She's a rapid cycler.

427
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,319
She shifts into manic
in a blink.

428
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,524
We knew she had been violent
around the complex.

429
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:54,859
Lithium didn't help?

430
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,327
Well, it's a catch-22.

431
00:19:56,327 --> 00:20:00,364
When Linda's in an "up" phase,
she doesn't think she needs

432
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,266
the lithium,
so she doesn't take it

433
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:06,600
which then makes her
more unstable.

434
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,608
Made.

435
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:14,271
I'm sorry for your loss.

436
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,580
That's a
guridon

437
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,581
used for
tableside cooking.

438
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:54,085
I thought there was a policy
against the use of these

439
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,119
in Las Vegas restaurants.

440
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,623
Ever since a television star
from the '70s

441
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,157
burned his face by one.

442
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,592
It's changed dining
forever.

443
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:02,426
You know, those V-marks

444
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,161
that we found in
the restaurant...

445
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:06,097
those were made
fairly recently.

446
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:09,624
Certainly since the '70s.

447
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:14,138
I lied about the candles.

448
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,106
It was an accident.

449
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:21,846
According to your owner's log,
it was a bad accident.

450
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,914
Danny Pasqualle

451
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:24,782
Italian male model

452
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:26,417
suffered
third-degree burns

453
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,818
on his face

454
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:30,121
the night of
September 26, 2002.

455
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:33,758
We do special requests
for special customers.

456
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:37,361
Chef Petrov made
Mr. Pasqualle

457
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,729
a Cafe Diablo.

458
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:46,704
Myers Rum, Grand Marnier,
Kahlua, and now for the ride.

459
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,674
Did he ever file formal charges
against you?

460
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,175
No, that's the strange thing.

461
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,836
He... he never did.

462
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,681
What am I going to do,
sue for a restaurant?

463
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:59,150
I used to make
five million a year.

464
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,817
You do the math.

465
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:02,320
So after losing
all that salary

466
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,254
you never filed suit.

467
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,424
Maybe you didn't file
charges to keep it quiet

468
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,858
and settle it for yourself.

469
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:11,829
Are you accusing me
of something?

470
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:15,466
No charges will be
filed, Mr. Pasqualle

471
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,201
if... you'd be willing

472
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:21,467
to fill out a statement
to that effect.

473
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,677
The mark on your hand,
Mr. Pasqualle?

474
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:28,245
Patterned abrasions

475
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,847
over the dorsal of the hand

476
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:32,249
at the metacarpal
phalangeal joints.

477
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,185
We call it a "fight bite."

478
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,253
Human mouths
are full of bacteria.

479
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,421
A wound from
a human bite

480
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:40,991
is a tremendous source
of infection, unfortunately.

481
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,293
So, what happened,
Mr. Pasqualle?

482
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:43,994
You paid the chef
a little visit

483
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:47,191
and did your version
of "Etu, Brute?"

484
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:57,536
You don't have to say anything,
Mr. Pasqualle.

485
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:05,882
We just need your hand.

486
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,697
(printer whirring)

487
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:31,208
Blade #25: Not human.

488
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:36,407
25 knives in,
and I'm bust.

489
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:41,309
Oh, now we're cooking.

490
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,891
It's not blood.

491
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:50,361
There he is... dollar
slots, wearing the cap.

492
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,862
How did you track him down?

493
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,564
We showed his
photo around.

494
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,065
The ATM in
the lobby...

495
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:57,932
he used it
24 hours ago.

496
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:01,238
What is he doing?

497
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:04,275
We used to call a guy like that
a bean counter.

498
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,310
Degenerates paying
25 cents a pop

499
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,012
in hopes of cracking
a pattern.

500
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:09,814
What are the notebooks for?

501
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:10,815
It's his results.

502
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:11,749
But that joker doesn't realize

503
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:15,241
that the patterns can end up
in the hundreds of millions.

504
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,022
You know, the more I see
of this kind of stuff

505
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,890
the less I picture
you a gambler.

506
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,891
This isn't gambling.

507
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,086
This is the end of the line.

508
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,398
How long have
you been here, sir?

509
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,503
Las Vegas Police.

510
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,305
We want a word
with you.

511
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,039
What do you know

512
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,907
about the death
of Linda Damen?

513
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:37,808
Unfortunate.

514
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,544
I need to...
write my results.

515
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,812
I need to...

516
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,380
document them.

517
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,116
How did you get the blood
on your shirt?

518
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:47,384
What blood?

519
00:24:47,384 --> 00:24:49,086
We're going to need your shirt.

520
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,987
(sighs)

521
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,483
Take it.

522
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,296
You're coming with the shirt.

523
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,098
We'll need your shoes, too.

524
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,567
Did you know
that some doctors believe

525
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,436
that oral bacteria
have no other benefits

526
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:08,973
than to make it impossible
for other more vicious bacteria

527
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,375
to take up residence
in our mouths?

528
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,309
I knew that, Greg.

529
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,845
So, then I should just stop
trying to impress you.

530
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,013
That would
impress me.

531
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:18,415
Okay. Well, results
from the Fight Bite Boy.

532
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:20,417
I had to get it
from an outside lab

533
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,418
since we're not equipped

534
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:23,821
to do bacterial DNA testing
ourselves.

535
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:24,922
Hint, hint.

536
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:25,856
Bacteria on his knuckles

537
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:29,093
matches the natural bacteria
in the chef's mouth.

538
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,162
I guess he settled
out of court.

539
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,631
You ruined my life!

540
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:34,398
(grunts)

541
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:38,562
Looks like he took a cheek swab
of the chef with his own fist.

542
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,838
Thanks, Greg.

543
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,039
Mm-hmm.

544
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,673
You can see

545
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:45,175
why I might have a hard time
believing you, right?

546
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:48,045
(raps on glass)

547
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:50,445
Excuse me.

548
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,856
So... our male model
copping to battery?

549
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,124
He's denying murder.

550
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:03,060
Well, maybe
he's telling the truth.

551
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,129
The earplug
from the meat plant...

552
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,064
we got a hit on OODIS.

553
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,866
Kicked out Harold Haskins

554
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,001
delivery man from Meteor Meat.

555
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,970
Out on parole for extortion.

556
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,172
He delivers
to DeBreff Restaurant.

557
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,541
So, you snuck in the place
to grind up a body?

558
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,476
No. I didn't even
know what it was

559
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:20,210
till it was too late.

560
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,081
Who exactly gave you
the, uh, meat to grind?

561
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:27,017
Uh, it was in the
restaurant freezer

562
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,485
at the DeBreff.

563
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:29,420
You see my face?

564
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,155
This is me almost believing you.

565
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:32,923
Now, I've already
violated your parole

566
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,458
so whatever
I say to the judge

567
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,492
is up to you.

568
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:36,493
So, what is it?

569
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:37,661
(sighs)

570
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:39,029
It was Ross.

571
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:40,997
The sous chef.

572
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,534
I owed him 3,000 for coke.

573
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:47,171
He said I could pay him back
with the favor.

574
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:50,507
You ground up a body
as a favor?

575
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:51,542
It was already dead.

576
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,743
It's not like I killed him.

577
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:55,646
Well, that's a very tenuous
distinction.

578
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,915
Stay right there.

579
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:00,551
That's a filet,
not a porterhouse.

580
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:01,251
I'm a sous chef.

581
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:04,188
20 guys are into me
for recreational substances.

582
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:06,957
It doesn't mean
they'd cut a body up for me.

583
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:07,958
Ground it up.

584
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,928
We're thinking that you did
the actual filleting.

585
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,196
Never happened.

586
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:13,697
Ask any of the guys.

587
00:27:13,697 --> 00:27:15,065
We have.

588
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:16,200
They won't talk.

589
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,769
Military calls it
"Code Red."

590
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,938
Fierce loyalty to the top dog.

591
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:23,741
I guess Petrov was that
until somebody killed him.

592
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:27,040
His tragedy is your promotion?

593
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:28,946
Excuse me.

594
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,147
We're in the middle
of a rush here.

595
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,549
Customers don't forgive
a cold meal or a late one.

596
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:34,585
I bet
they'd forgive a murder, Les.

597
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,587
Hey, do you guys
serve mutton?

598
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:37,721
What?

599
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,288
Mutton.

600
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:40,591
It's from the French word
for sheep.

601
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:42,226
These fibers
look like wool

602
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:45,229
and since sheep are sheered
before they're butchered

603
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,097
I think that somebody
was cooking

604
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:50,692
something here,
and it wasn't food.

605
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:54,168
Code Red?

606
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,679
Brody, we have

607
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,481
your shoeprint
in Linda's blood.

608
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,684
We also have a sample
of Linda's blood

609
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,152
that we found on your T-shirt.

610
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:11,088
Is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

611
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:11,622
Yes.

612
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:14,758
Someone is playing that machine
right now and is throwing

613
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,326
the entire
last 72 hours

614
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:18,996
of calculations
out the window.

615
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:19,797
Did you kill this girl

616
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,832
and try to make it
look like a suicide?

617
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:25,202
If anything,
I tried to save her.

618
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,004
Save her how?

619
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,338
I went to her place...

620
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,171
to borrow some money
from her.

621
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,278
I looked in her bedroom.

622
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,613
I thought
she fell asleep reading.

623
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:38,740
Then I saw blood.

624
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,518
Linda!

625
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:44,112
Tried to revive her.

626
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,521
Oh, oh.

627
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,351
But you left her there, dead.

628
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:52,329
You don't get it.

629
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,631
Even as the son of God

630
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,533
I can only do

631
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:57,693
so much.

632
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,376
Oh, I get it.

633
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:12,315
You and Linda are kind of
on the same page, huh?

634
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,886
Did you stop
taking your lithium together?

635
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,581
Is that it?

636
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,157
It's not a crime.

637
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:21,859
Yeah, you're right.

638
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,622
It's not.

639
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,870
Bipolar girl

640
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,171
meets a bipolar guy.

641
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,073
Together, they cut out
their medication.

642
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,574
She ends up
committing suicide.

643
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:38,742
It's almost like bipolar boy

644
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:41,378
is too high to even
realize what went down.

645
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,579
Yeah.

646
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:43,213
Hey, Doc.

647
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,816
I was over here
on an exhumation matter.

648
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,184
I knew you wanted this.

649
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:49,186
Tox results for Linda Damen.

650
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,313
Thank you.

651
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:55,192
No lithium,
just like her parents said.

652
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,860
She did have a huge dose

653
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,263
of Valium,
ingested less than an hour

654
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:00,931
before her time of death.

655
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:01,732
Valium?
Yeah.

656
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:02,733
That doesn't make any sense.

657
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,836
I mean, that's the last thing
a depressed person would take.

658
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,304
200 milligrams.

659
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:10,674
That's more than five times
the normal dosage.

660
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:11,942
(whistles)

661
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,377
That much Valium.

662
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:17,247
There's no way she could have
fought somebody off

663
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:20,774
if they were coming after her
with a straight razor.

664
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,624
Greg, how's the
knife coming

665
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:29,426
with that mysterious
smudge on it?

666
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:31,295
I just got the results.

667
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,231
Alcohol, acetate
and red dye #58.

668
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,199
Nail polish.
Mm-hmm.

669
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:40,863
May I see your
nails, please?

670
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,147
Oh.

671
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,783
Well, I'm going to need
a sample of that polish.

672
00:30:52,783 --> 00:30:53,851
A scraping.

673
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,411
Uh, is this small enough?

674
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,789
Yeah. That'll do.

675
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,993
Okay, the, uh, three
of you can go.

676
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,688
Thank you, ladies.

677
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:06,930
And I've got a
table for you.

678
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,931
A five top.

679
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:10,200
All by yourself.

680
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,302
By the window.

681
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:15,169
Someone will be with you
shortly.

682
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,276
I looked into that prescription
at the pharmacy you asked about.

683
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,510
Linda Damen, the deceased.

684
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,311
That was quick.

685
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,313
She doesn't have a prescription
for Valium.

686
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,015
Her mother does...
Jane Damen.

687
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,416
25 milligrams as needed.

688
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,518
I think we better go
pay Mom a visit.

689
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,953
Yeah. Thanks, Sully.

690
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:30,888
Okay.

691
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,254
(computer beeping)

692
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,193
Wools are worsted.
12-ounce weight.

693
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:38,228
That's heavy?

694
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:40,030
Light... weave.

695
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,933
Mostly for season spanners.

696
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,268
We're talking about clothes?

697
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:47,337
Worsted is predominately used
in the manufacturing

698
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:49,539
of suits
and light overcoats.

699
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,341
The finish on this

700
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:53,944
is a trademark coating
in high-end suits.

701
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,479
Okay, good.

702
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,346
Thanks.

703
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:58,314
Mm. I'm not done.

704
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,852
There was also blood present
on the burnt wool.

705
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:04,855
Did we get a DNA test?

706
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,724
It's victim's blood,
from your chef.

707
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:10,360
I know
what you're thinking.

708
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,762
Couldn't possibly be his suit.

709
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,563
Chefs wear checks
and white shirts.

710
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,733
But somebody did burn
a bloody suit

711
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,869
in the restaurant kitchen.

712
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,496
A high-end suit.

713
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,231
You have a candidate.

714
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:29,579
You're the new guy.

715
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,515
Yeah. Uh, David Hodges.

716
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:33,483
Transferred from LAPD.

717
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:34,952
(blows air)

718
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,020
They said I had
an attitude problem.

719
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,556
Said that I thought
I was entitled.

720
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:42,024
(scoffs)

721
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:52,536
So that sample I collected
matches the polish

722
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,271
on this knife.

723
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:57,441
You handled this knife.

724
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,609
So?

725
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:00,844
Kitchen's first rule:

726
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:05,110
Don't touch my knife;
don't touch my johnson.

727
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,452
Did you stab the chef?

728
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,887
Well, this is
the sous chef's knife.

729
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,122
I'm aware of that.

730
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,524
But when a transfer
is made on a blade

731
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:16,059
it's usually
from slippage.

732
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,324
Due to a stabbing motion.

733
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,801
Ar-Are you charging me
with anything?

734
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:25,335
No.

735
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,938
But why don't you have
a seat out in reception.

736
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:30,874
Things could change.

737
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:32,309
Mrs. Damen, our detective found

738
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,145
this prescription
in your name

739
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:36,046
for Valium.

740
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:39,641
Can you tell us
anything about that?

741
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:45,088
I take Valium on occasion.

742
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,156
Yes.

743
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:47,457
Our lives get pretty frenetic

744
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:48,959
just trying to keep up
with Linda.

745
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,461
And you last got
a prescription...

746
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:52,596
this past Monday.

747
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:54,064
What does that mean?

748
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:55,665
The tox report says

749
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,600
Linda had five times

750
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,335
the normal dose of Valium
in her system.

751
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,670
Because there were
no hesitation marks
on her wrists

752
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,839
it suggests that someone
else inflicted the wound.

753
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,142
That much Valium would've been
enough to subdue her.

754
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:09,646
Hey, l-I think
you're a little
out of line here.

755
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:11,982
I did not drug
my daughter.

756
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:12,983
May we have your permission

757
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:16,180
to look through the current
contents of your prescription?

758
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,522
Did Linda's boyfriend
put you up to this?

759
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:20,991
Because he is not stable.
(phone ringing)

760
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:21,858
No.

761
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,360
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

762
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,861
We're simply
trying to determine
Hello?

763
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:25,695
How your daughter died.

764
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:28,665
The blouse from your
vic's closet... the stain.

765
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:31,134
The substance is a biological.

766
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:33,170
High salt content.

767
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,967
Male or female?

768
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,033
Thanks, Greg.

769
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:44,915
Mr. And Mrs. Damen, there
are five types of tears...

770
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:48,151
sorrow, regret, joy, fear

771
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:50,153
and allergic reaction.

772
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:53,423
The one thing that
they have in common
is DNA.

773
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:56,059
We found a blouse
in your daughter's closet

774
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,227
the night that she died.

775
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,396
There was
moisture on it.

776
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:03,567
The moisture... was tears.

777
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,235
The DNA...

778
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,964
was male.

779
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:12,533
Mr. Damen?

780
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:16,435
Were you waiting in the closet
for your daughter?

781
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:22,085
We can get a warrant
to test your DNA sample

782
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,687
against our sample.

783
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:25,678
John?

784
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:29,926
The... (sighs)

785
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:33,196
The-the only way to get
an adult committed

786
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:34,698
for psychological help

787
00:35:34,698 --> 00:35:37,701
is if they hurt themselves.

788
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,002
Or someone else.

789
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:40,170
Everyone Linda attacked

790
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,240
was too afraid to file
complaints against her.

791
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,943
She was out of hand.
She was attacking strangers.

792
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:48,778
She was vandalizing
property.

793
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:52,182
She was refusing
to take her medication

794
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,683
and we were helpless
to make her.

795
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:59,990
It was supposed to be
a suicide attempt...

796
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,258
(door rattling)

797
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:02,225
But then...

798
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,729
I heard somebody
at the door and I...

799
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:08,732
l-I...

800
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:12,168
I guess I panicked.

801
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:17,107
I hid in the closet.

802
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,609
(door opens and closes)

803
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:29,450
And, um, she, uh...
when he...

804
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:32,589
Linda?

805
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:33,356
Linda?!

806
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:37,019
(voice breaking)
By then it was too late.

807
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:41,164
I just wanted
to get her help.

808
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:44,801
I just wa...
She needed my help.

809
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:47,771
I just...

810
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,739
She, she needed help.

811
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,341
Honey, you know...

812
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:54,777
she-she wouldn't...

813
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,754
Reminds of what
my grandmother said
a long time ago.

814
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:06,590
I would never
believe her.

815
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,258
What's that?

816
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:13,163
Crazy people make even
sane people act crazy.

817
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:16,655
(faint rattling)

818
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,542
(rattling)
What'd you find?

819
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:26,543
Come here.

820
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:28,545
Do you hear this?

821
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:31,314
(rattling)

822
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:33,817
How did we miss that in Trace?

823
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:34,584
I don't know.

824
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,387
But I've learned
that the evidence room

825
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:40,156
is the quietest place
in the lab.

826
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:42,386
(knife handle clicks)

827
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:47,330
Sand. Right...

828
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,561
for balance and precision.

829
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,103
Did you know that
to a geologist

830
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,738
there's no such
thing as sand?

831
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,773
Each grain is
its own tiny rock.

832
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:59,843
Fine, glassy crystals...

833
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:02,379
dark.

834
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:04,214
Obsidian, I bet.

835
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,383
Volcanic sand.
Long way from home.

836
00:38:06,383 --> 00:38:08,218
Japanese call it
singing sand.

837
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,854
If you walk on certain
beaches in Japan

838
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:13,123
it'll make
a musical sound.

839
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,357
Never been to Japan

840
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:17,127
but I've seen this sand
before...

841
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,721
on the blood clot.

842
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,834
(Grissom chuckles)

843
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:28,605
"Let us carve him
as a dish fit for the gods."

844
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,174
I'm going to guess
Shakespeare.

845
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:33,343
Julius Caesar.

846
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:36,313
That's your knife.

847
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,382
This is the owner's log.

848
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:43,453
"The sous chef gets 89% of
the meat off of trout filet...

849
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:46,222
six percent better
than any chef on the line."

850
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:49,749
I don't think
you killed the chef.

851
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,962
You did fillet him, though.

852
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,731
Your knife handle slid open...

853
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:55,465
(blade clangs)

854
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:56,933
...sand went down the drain

855
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,402
landing on the victim's
clotted blood.

856
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,438
It's hard work,
carving up a man.

857
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:05,306
I believe that's how
you broke your knife handle.

858
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:09,268
But you didn't do this alone,
did you?

859
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,982
A murdered chef
in your kitchen.

860
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:15,416
Kiss of death for a restaurant.

861
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:17,987
We'll never get
our customers back.

862
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:20,390
How am I going to get
a body out of here?

863
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,426
I do for you,
you do for me.

864
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:27,453
Code Red, in fact...
protect the kitchen.

865
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,736
Some people say
the most important part

866
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:34,938
of preparing a meal
is the cleanup.

867
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:40,377
While the fillet man disposed
of the chef parts

868
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,878
you got rid

869
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:43,313
of your bloody wool suit.

870
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:45,804
(flames crackling)

871
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:52,021
How's it going?

872
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,957
Well, he's not
denying anything.

873
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:56,459
He's not admitting
anything, either.

874
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,394
(sighs)
Yeah.

875
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,229
Same as the
other two here.

876
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:01,264
They need
a little nudge.

877
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,366
Such as?

878
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:05,268
While they're
in our custody

879
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,930
shall we try
a little theater?

880
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:17,804
(whispering)

881
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,050
Let's go for a walk.

882
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,954
Hey, relax.
You'll be with a friend.

883
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:27,047
Cuff him up.

884
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:08,086
Why did you kill him?

885
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:14,838
L-I went into the walk-in
to, to get some lemons.

886
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,272
Oh, yeah... (moans)

887
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,277
He played around
all the time...

888
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,781
waitresses, patrons...
nobodies.

889
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:29,343
But... she was different.

890
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,789
She was a chef.

891
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,424
What does that mean?

892
00:41:34,424 --> 00:41:38,895
Well, I can't make toast,
um... where did I stand?

893
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,364
Hey, beautiful,
I haven't seen
you all night.

894
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,566
Well, I've seen you.

895
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,401
(knife clangs)

896
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,469
(grunts)

897
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,936
(groans)

898
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:58,882
Officer, would you take her
to Booking, please?

899
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,611
(cuffs rattling)

900
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:07,957
All in a day's work.

901
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,585
Yeah.

902
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:14,122
You up for dinner?
