01:48:16,872 --> 01:48:19,705  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'm good with my hands.

240
01:48:19,775 --> 01:48:23,108  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:398 Y2:433
What a wonderful family,

241
01:48:23,178 --> 01:48:28,013  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:360 Y2:433
although there's one fella
I haven't met yet.

242
01:48:28,083 --> 01:48:30,551  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:398 Y2:430
Hi there, mister.

243
01:48:30,619 --> 01:48:31,551  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:398 Y2:433
Your nephew?

244
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:32,587  X1:280 X2:442 Y1:398 Y2:433
My brother.

245
01:48:32,654 --> 01:48:33,621  X1:336 X2:385 Y1:400 Y2:426
No!

246
01:48:33,689 --> 01:48:34,815  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:362 Y2:426
Fester,
come out here.

247
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:36,653  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:398 Y2:433
He's very shy.

248
01:48:36,725 --> 01:48:40,252  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:360 Y2:433
Fester, this is Miss Jellinsky,
our new nanny.

249
01:48:40,329 --> 01:48:42,320  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:398 Y2:430
Hello, Fester.

250
01:48:45,334 --> 01:48:47,928  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:360 Y2:433
These Addams men,
where do you find them?

251
01:48:48,003 --> 01:48:49,834  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:398 Y2:433
It has to be damp.

252
01:48:51,006 --> 01:48:52,439  X1:283 X2:439 Y1:400 Y2:427
I can't wait.

253
01:48:52,508 --> 01:48:54,669  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:360 Y2:426
I'll start first thing
tomorrow.

254
01:48:57,112 --> 01:48:59,580  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:398 Y2:433
Why not tonight?

255
01:49:07,956 --> 01:49:09,116  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:433
[Morticia]
Good night, Debbie.

256
01:49:09,191 --> 01:49:10,783  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:398 Y2:433
Good night!

257
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:13,851  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:433
Scream if you need
anything.

258
01:49:13,929 --> 01:49:16,295  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:360 Y2:433
So we've hired
Miss Jellinsky.

259
01:49:16,365 --> 01:49:18,890  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:360 Y2:433
She's a gem,
don't you think?

260
01:49:18,967 --> 01:49:20,127  X1:269 X2:451 Y1:398 Y2:433
She's perfect.

261
01:49:20,202 --> 01:49:23,763  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:433
Oh, Fester,
I'm such a lucky man.

262
01:49:23,839 --> 01:49:26,899  X1:140 X2:583 Y1:360 Y2:433
I hope that someday you'll know
the indescribable joy

263
01:49:26,975 --> 01:49:28,806  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:398 Y2:433
of having children

264
01:49:28,877 --> 01:49:31,937  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:360 Y2:426
and of paying someone else
to raise them.

265
01:49:32,014 --> 01:49:33,948  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:433
First wouldn't I
have to get married?

266
01:49:34,016 --> 01:49:38,009  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:433
You're just a boy.
There's plenty of time.

267
01:49:38,086 --> 01:49:40,987  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:433
You'll meet someone,
someone very special,

268
01:49:41,056 --> 01:49:43,081  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:368 Y2:433
someone
who won't press charges.

269
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:44,989  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:398 Y2:430
Oh, I'd like that.

270
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,891  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:398 Y2:426
You rascal.

271
01:49:49,231 --> 01:49:53,531  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:398 Y2:430
Oh, and what's this?

272
01:49:57,039 --> 01:49:59,371  X1:310 X2:410 Y1:362 Y2:426
- Mom.
- Mom.

273
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:09,648  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:360 Y2:433
Tonight on America's
Most Disgusting Unsolved Crimes,

274
01:50:09,718 --> 01:50:13,711  X1:234 X2:497 Y1:362 Y2:427
we investigate
the case of Ursula...

275
01:50:13,789 --> 01:50:14,778  X1:303 X2:429 Y1:400 Y2:426
Carmen...

276
01:50:14,857 --> 01:50:16,256  X1:273 X2:459 Y1:398 Y2:426
and Nadine--

277
01:50:16,325 --> 01:50:20,284  X1:174 X2:562 Y1:360 Y2:433
three very different women
with one thing in common--

278
01:50:20,362 --> 01:50:21,556  X1:310 X2:426 Y1:398 Y2:426
murder!

279
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:24,292  X1:246 X2:485 Y1:360 Y2:426
And they're all
the same woman.

280
01:50:24,366 --> 01:50:27,164  X1:188 X2:545 Y1:360 Y2:426
She's known by the police
as the Black Widow.

281
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:29,033  X1:275 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:426
She mates,
then she kills.

282
01:50:29,104 --> 01:50:30,594  X1:254 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:433
She investigates
wealthy men,

283
01:50:30,672 --> 01:50:32,663  X1:234 X2:496 Y1:360 Y2:430
finding the richest,
loneliest bachelors,

284
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:35,301  X1:238 X2:493 Y1:360 Y2:430
gaining their trust
and their love,

285
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:38,039  X1:243 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:426
and finally,
she marries them.

286
01:50:38,113 --> 01:50:40,581  X1:175 X2:558 Y1:360 Y2:426
Then, on the wedding night,
she kills them.

287
01:50:40,649 --> 01:50:43,311  X1:239 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:433
The deaths
appear accidental.

288
01:50:43,385 --> 01:50:45,876  X1:169 X2:560 Y1:360 Y2:433
After the funeral,
she disappears, cash in hand,

289
01:50:45,954 --> 01:50:48,115  X1:264 X2:471 Y1:360 Y2:426
but the money
never lasts.

290
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:51,216  X1:209 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:433
Soon the Black Widow
is hungry again,

291
01:50:51,293 --> 01:50:53,818  X1:255 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:433
hungry for cash,
hungry for love.

292
01:50:53,896 --> 01:50:57,024  X1:110 X2:618 Y1:360 Y2:433
A mistress of disguise,
she's eluded the authorities for years.

293
01:50:57,099 --> 01:50:58,760  X1:292 X2:441 Y1:398 Y2:430
Who is she,

294
01:50:58,834 --> 01:51:01,894  X1:128 X2:606 Y1:360 Y2:426
and what seemingly innocent pose
will she next assume?

295
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,437  X1:243 X2:483 Y1:398 Y2:433
All we can say is...

296
01:51:03,505 --> 01:51:05,302  X1:237 X2:492 Y1:398 Y2:430
bachelors, beware.

297
01:51:38,407 --> 01:51:41,342  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:360 Y2:433
We'll be going out
for most of the morning.

298
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,900  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:398 Y2:433
All the important numbers--

299
01:51:42,978 --> 01:51:44,966  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:360 Y2:433
police, fire department,
morgue.

300
01:51:47,402 --> 01:51:49,233  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:398 Y2:433
Fester, come along.

301
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:52,301  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:398 Y2:433
Goodbye, Fester.

302
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:55,308  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:398 Y2:433
Say goodbye to Debbie.

303
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:58,108  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:398 Y2:433

304
01:52:00,982 --> 01:52:02,472  X1:296 X2:425 Y1:398 Y2:426
Have fun!

306
01:52:06,988 --> 01:52:10,754  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:400 Y2:426
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

307
01:52:10,825 --> 01:52:14,722  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:398 Y2:433
Fester Addams. My, my.

308
01:52:14,889 --> 01:52:16,914  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:398 Y2:426
Stocks and bonds...

309
01:52:16,991 --> 01:52:19,152  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:398 Y2:426
deeds...

310
01:52:19,226 --> 01:52:20,557  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:398 Y2:433
gold bullion.

312
01:52:30,905 --> 01:52:32,930  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:398 Y2:433
Treasury bills...

313
01:52:33,007 --> 01:52:34,634  X1:328 X2:394 Y1:400 Y2:426
IRAs.

01:52:34,709 --> 01:52:36,142  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:398 Y2:433
[Squeak]

315
01:52:39,046 --> 01:52:42,311  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:398 Y2:433
What a strange old house.

316
01:52:42,383 --> 01:52:44,078  X1:275 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:433
It's so drafty.

317
01:52:44,151 --> 01:52:47,143  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:360 Y2:426
It's really no place
for children.

318
01:52:51,258 --> 01:52:53,818  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:398 Y2:433
No place at all.

319
01:52:56,063 --> 01:52:58,054  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:360 Y2:433
Hold still,
you little brat.

320
01:52:58,132 --> 01:52:59,793  X1:258 X2:464 Y1:398 Y2:426
He's not a brat.

321
01:53:02,636 --> 01:53:06,094  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:360 Y2:433
Of course not.
He's an adorable little baby.

322
01:53:06,173 --> 01:53:07,800  X1:265 X2:457 Y1:398 Y2:426
Fine. Rub it in.

323
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:09,638  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:360 Y2:433
We're getting him
all ready

324
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:11,644  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:398 Y2:426
for a nice little walk.

325
01:53:11,712 --> 01:53:13,680  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:398 Y2:433
Would you like to come?

326
01:53:13,748 --> 01:53:15,477  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:398 Y2:433
Are you really a nanny?

327
01:53:15,549 --> 01:53:18,017  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:398 Y2:433
What a question.

328
01:53:18,085 --> 01:53:19,677  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:398 Y2:433
Why did you come here?

329
01:53:19,754 --> 01:53:24,691  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:398 Y2:433
Why, to take care of you...

330
01:53:24,759 --> 01:53:26,852  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:398 Y2:433
all of you.

331
01:53:26,927 --> 01:53:28,827  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:398 Y2:433
Especially my uncle?

332
01:53:36,604 --> 01:53:39,505  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:360 Y2:433
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

333
01:53:39,573 --> 01:53:41,564  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:360 Y2:433
They swore me
to secrecy,

334
01:53:41,642 --> 01:53:43,303  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:398 Y2:433
the little angels,

335
01:53:43,377 --> 01:53:44,867  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:398 Y2:433
but they want to go.

336
01:53:44,945 --> 01:53:47,436  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:433
It's all they talked about
all morning.

337
01:53:47,515 --> 01:53:49,506  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:360 Y2:433
They're just afraid
to ask you.

338
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:52,518  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:360 Y2:433
They're afraid you'll think
they don't love you.

339
01:53:52,586 --> 01:53:54,349  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:398 Y2:433
The poor things.

340
01:53:54,422 --> 01:53:56,117  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:398 Y2:433
It's a bizarre request.

341
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,714  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:398 Y2:433
It's horrifying.

342
01:53:57,792 --> 01:54:00,260  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:360 Y2:426
They have their hearts
set on it.

343
01:54:00,327 --> 01:54:02,352  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:360 Y2:433
I knew
you'd want to know

344
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:04,330  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:433
as concerned,
caring parents.

345
01:54:04,398 --> 01:54:06,389  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:426
Oh, Gomez,
what shall we do?

346
01:54:06,467 --> 01:54:07,957  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:400 Y2:433
How can we say no?

347
01:54:08,035 --> 01:54:09,434  X1:208 X2:514 Y1:400 Y2:427
Don't even mention it.

348
01:54:09,503 --> 01:54:11,232  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:398 Y2:433
Just do it.

349
01:54:11,305 --> 01:54:13,296  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:362 Y2:433
I'm sure
they'll deny everything,

350
01:54:13,374 --> 01:54:15,399  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:398 Y2:433
but they want to go,

351
01:54:15,476 --> 01:54:16,738  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:398 Y2:426
God love them.

352
01:54:18,612 --> 01:54:20,910  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:362 Y2:433
- Summer camp.
- Summer camp.

353
01:54:23,651 --> 01:54:25,050  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:398 Y2:433
"Camp Chippewa."

354
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,279  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433
How charming.

355
01:54:26,353 --> 01:54:28,184  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:398 Y2:433
What's a chippewa?

356
01:54:28,255 --> 01:54:30,246  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:360 Y2:426
It's an old
Indian word.

357
01:54:30,324 --> 01:54:31,757  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:398 Y2:433
It means orphan.

358

364
01:54:48,843 --> 01:54:50,333  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:398 Y2:426
Hi. I'm Amanda Buckman.

365
01:54:50,411 --> 01:54:52,743  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:360 Y2:426

367
01:54:54,148 --> 01:54:56,378  X1:244 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:426

to a funeral.

Very exclusive.

380
01:55:20,474 --> 01:55:22,465  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:426

381
01:55:22,543 --> 01:55:25,068  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:426

that very special age

384
01:55:28,883 --> 01:55:32,250  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:360 Y2:433

only one thing on her mind.

395
01:55:53,908 --> 01:55:57,674  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:433

400
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:11,087  X1:268 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'm fine.
How are you?

401
01:56:11,158 --> 01:56:12,625  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:398 Y2:433
How are you doing?

402
01:56:14,695 --> 01:56:17,186  X1:278 X2:446 Y1:360 Y2:426

I like it here.

403
01:56:17,264 --> 01:56:19,755  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:360 Y2:433

how dirty you are?

404
01:56:19,833 --> 01:56:21,391  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:398 Y2:426

407
01:56:24,572 --> 01:56:27,097  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:360 Y2:433

409
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:32,345  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:433
This has nothing to do
with allergies.

410
01:56:32,413 --> 01:56:33,675  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:398 Y2:426

411
01:56:33,747 --> 01:56:35,408  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:398 Y2:433

492
02:00:17,638 --> 02:00:19,765  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:362 Y2:433

494
02:00:22,309 --> 02:00:23,606  X1:286 X2:435 Y1:398 Y2:426
I could tell.

495
02:00:23,677 --> 02:00:25,542  X1:280 X2:441 Y1:360 Y2:430
When I first
saw him,

496
02:00:25,612 --> 02:00:27,443  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:360 Y2:433
I thought
he was from Europe.

497
02:00:27,514 --> 02:00:28,606  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:398 Y2:426
You did?

498
02:00:28,682 --> 02:00:29,740  X1:306 X2:416 Y1:400 Y2:426

502
02:00:43,163 --> 02:00:44,824  X1:254 X2:469 Y1:398 Y2:433
I just can't tell--

503
02:00:44,898 --> 02:00:47,264  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:426
does he like me
at all?

504
02:00:47,334 --> 02:00:48,801  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:398 Y2:426
Of course he does.

505
02:00:48,869 --> 02:00:50,063  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:398 Y2:426
He vomited.

506
02:00:50,137 --> 02:00:53,197  X1:204 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:426
Does he always do that
with women he likes?

507
02:00:53,273 --> 02:00:54,570  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:398 Y2:430

511
02:01:00,347 --> 02:01:01,974  X1:264 X2:457 Y1:398 Y2:426
Of course not.

the ghost said,

"And I will

02:05:09,229 --> 02:05:11,857  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:433

to the campers,

580
02:07:08,915 --> 02:07:14,114  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:430
And--And I dreamed
that when I met him,

581
02:07:14,187 --> 02:07:17,714  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:433
that we would wait
until our wedding night

02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:20,191  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:430

the ultimate sacrifice.

it was impossible,

586

you're nervous.

832
02:19:52,118 --> 02:19:53,813  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:400 Y2:426
So am I.

833
02:19:53,886 --> 02:19:55,285  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:400 Y2:426
I'm not nervous.

834
02:19:55,355 --> 02:19:56,720  X1:295 X2:426 Y1:400 Y2:433
I'm upset.

835
02:19:56,789 --> 02:19:59,519  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:398 Y2:426
Because of the bathtub?

836
02:19:59,592 --> 02:20:00,923  X1:305 X2:415 Y1:398 Y2:426

837
02:20:02,562 --> 02:20:04,496  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:398 Y2:426
That was an accident.

838
02:20:04,564 --> 02:20:05,724  X1:312 X2:409 Y1:398 Y2:426
I know.

839
02:20:05,798 --> 02:20:07,026  X1:307 X2:414 Y1:398 Y2:426
I'm fine.

I know.

841
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:10,531  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:362 Y2:434
Don't give it
another thought.

never had sex?

845
02:20:19,779 --> 02:20:21,246  X1:316 X2:405 Y1:400 Y2:426
Never.

846
02:20:21,314 --> 02:20:25,910  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:360 Y2:433
Then how do you know we're
not having it right now?

847
02:20:25,985 --> 02:20:28,579  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:426
We'll be just like

854
02:20:44,971 --> 02:20:48,532  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:398 Y2:433
Only you, my dearest.

855
02:20:52,312 --> 02:20:53,836  X1:314 X2:408 Y1:398 Y2:433
Really?

856
02:20:53,913 --> 02:20:56,279  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:398 Y2:433

- What?

860
02:21:04,791 --> 02:21:06,520  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:398 Y2:430
after we've made love,

861
02:21:06,592 --> 02:21:09,493  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:368 Y2:433
you can never see
your family again.

862
02:21:09,562 --> 02:21:10,756  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:398 Y2:426
What?

863
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:14,357  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:360 Y2:433
Otherwise, I could never
really enjoy myself.

864
02:21:14,434 --> 02:21:17,767  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:433
I could never
give myself completely.

865
02:21:17,837 --> 02:21:21,000  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:433

my family again?

866
02:21:21,074 --> 02:21:24,202  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:360 Y2:430
Yes. If I picture them
in our lives,

867
02:21:24,277 --> 02:21:27,508  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:433

02:21:32,652 --> 02:21:33,914  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:398 Y2:426
Of course.

from Fester and Debbie.

02:25:16,581 --> 02:25:19,709  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433

02:25:29,327 --> 02:25:31,090  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:398 Y2:433
No quarrels.

948
02:25:31,162 --> 02:25:32,424  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:400 Y2:426
No cares.

949
02:25:32,497 --> 02:25:35,193  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:400 Y2:427
No survivors.

950
02:25:35,266 --> 02:25:38,292  X1:303 X2:428 Y1:400 Y2:427
Cara mia.

951
02:25:38,369 --> 02:25:40,030  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:400 Y2:426
So...

952
02:25:40,104 --> 02:25:42,732  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:433
you still desire me
after all these years?

953
02:25:42,807 --> 02:25:44,775  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:398 Y2:426
The old ball and chain?

954
02:25:44,842 --> 02:25:45,900  X1:306 X2:416 Y1:400 Y2:426
Forever.

955
02:25:47,044 --> 02:25:48,636  X1:276 X2:446 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'll get them.

956
02:25:51,582 --> 02:25:53,948  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:360 Y2:433
Heads up, campers.
Thejamboree's only two weeks away.

957
02:25:54,018 --> 02:25:57,078  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:360 Y2:426
And you know what that means--
clean cabins.

958
02:25:57,155 --> 02:25:59,020  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:398 Y2:433
Creating with clay and...

959
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:00,921  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:400 Y2:430
Canoes, canoes, canoes!

960
02:26:00,992 --> 02:26:03,984  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:433
So we better
get cracking, huh?

961
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:07,121  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:433
Look at this.
I've got them.

962
02:26:07,198 --> 02:26:09,132  X1:194 X2:534 Y1:398 Y2:426
Schizos and Serial Killers.

963
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:11,725  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:426
I have almost
the whole series.

964
02:26:11,803 --> 02:26:15,569  X1:145 X2:578 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'm only missing Jack the Ripper
and that Zodiac guy.

965
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:16,629  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:398 Y2:426
But look.

966
02:26:16,707 --> 02:26:18,538  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:398 Y2:426
"The Black Widow."

967
02:26:18,609 --> 02:26:20,270  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:398 Y2:433
It might be Debbie.

968
02:26:20,344 --> 02:26:23,939  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:398 Y2:426
At least three rich husbands...

969
02:26:24,015 --> 02:26:25,812  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:398 Y2:426
all dead.

970
02:26:25,883 --> 02:26:27,475  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'll trade you.

971
02:26:27,552 --> 02:26:28,610  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:398 Y2:426
For what?

972
02:26:31,489 --> 02:26:33,389  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:433
Amy Fischer.

973
02:26:33,457 --> 02:26:35,823  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:360 Y2:426
Each year,
we conclude our summer

974
02:26:35,893 --> 02:26:38,418  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:433
with a very special
presentation.

975
02:26:38,496 --> 02:26:40,157  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:433
Book, music,
and lyrics by...

976
02:26:40,231 --> 02:26:42,131  X1:264 X2:457 Y1:400 Y2:433
Gary Granger!

977
02:26:43,734 --> 02:26:45,429  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:398 Y2:433
And this year,

978
02:26:45,503 --> 02:26:48,768  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:360 Y2:433
the old bean has come up
with something pretty exciting--

979
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,434  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:360 Y2:433
my own personal salute
to the first Thanksgiving.

980
02:26:51,509 --> 02:26:54,706  X1:205 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:433
Now, we have thought
long and hard

981
02:26:54,779 --> 02:26:57,907  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:360 Y2:433
about choosing
just the right little actress

982
02:26:57,982 --> 02:27:00,974  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:360 Y2:430
for the leading role
of Sarah Miller,

983
02:27:01,052 --> 02:27:03,247  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:433
our beautiful
and kindly pilgrim lady,

984
02:27:03,321 --> 02:27:06,222  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:398 Y2:426
and we have selected...

985
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:12,120  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:398 Y2:426
Amanda Buckman!

986
02:27:12,196 --> 02:27:15,427  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:360 Y2:433
And in the roles
of her pilgrim pals--

987
02:27:15,499 --> 02:27:17,296  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:433
Lily, Jennifer,
Tiffany, Missy,

988
02:27:17,368 --> 02:27:20,735  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:398 Y2:430
Michelle, and Melissa!

989
02:27:22,573 --> 02:27:26,839  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:360 Y2:433
But, of course,
not everyone can be a star.

990
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:360 Y2:433
Let's not forget
our cheery little Chippewas

991
02:27:30,481 --> 02:27:33,143  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:398 Y2:433
Mordecai, Yang,

992
02:27:33,217 --> 02:27:36,050  X1:308 X2:414 Y1:398 Y2:426
Esther...

993
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:37,109  X1:328 X2:393 Y1:406 Y2:426
um...

994
02:27:37,188 --> 02:27:41,124  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:398 Y2:430
Consuela, Irwin...

995
02:27:41,192 --> 02:27:42,454  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:398 Y2:430
and, um...

996
02:27:42,526 --> 02:27:45,893  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'm still not sure just
how to pronounce this.

997
02:27:45,963 --> 02:27:47,760  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433
Jam-il?Jame-il?

998
02:27:47,832 --> 02:27:48,821  X1:317 X2:401 Y1:360 Y2:433
[Gary]
Jamal.

999
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:50,299  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:398 Y2:426
Whatever.

1000
02:27:50,368 --> 02:27:53,929  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433
And as their leader
in the secondary

1001
02:27:54,005 --> 02:27:57,600  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:360 Y2:430
but still compellingly
written role of Pocahontas,

1002
02:27:57,675 --> 02:28:00,803  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:398 Y2:433
guess who we have in mind.

1003
02:28:00,878 --> 02:28:03,904  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:426
Our own little
brunette outcast--

1004
02:28:03,981 --> 02:28:05,915  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:398 Y2:433
Wednesday Addams.

1005
02:28:13,357 --> 02:28:15,791  X1:154 X2:574 Y1:398 Y2:433
[Chimes Play Wedding March]

1006
02:28:20,331 --> 02:28:23,732  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:362 Y2:426
We want to see
Debbie and Fester.

1007
02:28:23,801 --> 02:28:26,861  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:426
Miss Debbie!

1008
02:28:26,938 --> 02:28:28,166  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:360 Y2:426
[Debbie]
Debra!

1009
02:28:30,174 --> 02:28:31,232  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:400 Y2:426
Gomez...

1010
02:28:31,309 --> 02:28:33,140  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:398 Y2:426
where are we?

1011
02:28:33,210 --> 02:28:35,405  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:398 Y2:426
It looks familiar.

1012
02:28:35,479 --> 02:28:37,811  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:433
Of course--
the gates of hell.

1013
02:28:39,183 --> 02:28:41,208  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:398 Y2:433
Welcome to my home.

1014
02:28:41,285 --> 02:28:42,843  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:398 Y2:433
Might we see my brother?

1015
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:47,653  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:360 Y2:433
No. He doesn't want to see
any of you or that.

1016
02:28:47,725 --> 02:28:48,783  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:398 Y2:433
Why not?

1017
02:28:48,859 --> 02:28:50,759  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:398 Y2:426
Because he's in love.

1018
02:28:50,828 --> 02:28:53,160  X1:171 X2:552 Y1:360 Y2:433
He's wrapped in a gossamer
blanket of ecstasy,

1019
02:28:53,230 --> 02:28:54,993  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:398 Y2:433
and he hates your guts.

1020
02:28:55,066 --> 02:28:56,328  X1:298 X2:423 Y1:398 Y2:433
But why?

1021
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,265  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:362 Y2:433
Because you've
flaunted yourselves,

1022
02:28:58,336 --> 02:29:00,463  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:398 Y2:433
your great love affair.

1023
02:29:00,538 --> 02:29:03,006  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:398 Y2:433
You kept him a child.

1024
02:29:03,074 --> 02:29:04,905  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:398 Y2:426
I've made him a man.

1025
02:29:04,976 --> 02:29:07,467  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:433
Let me hear this
from his own lips.

1026
02:29:07,545 --> 02:29:09,945  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:398 Y2:433
His lips are busy.

1027
02:29:10,014 --> 02:29:12,039  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:433
You want to talk
to these people?

1028
02:29:12,116 --> 02:29:13,083  X1:309 X2:413 Y1:398 Y2:426
Debbie.

1029
02:29:17,154 --> 02:29:18,121  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

1030
02:29:18,189 --> 02:29:19,178  X1:298 X2:423 Y1:400 Y2:433
Go away!

1031
02:29:19,256 --> 02:29:21,190  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:398 Y2:433
That is not my brother.

1032
02:29:21,258 --> 02:29:22,452  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:400 Y2:433
Sorry.

1033
02:29:22,526 --> 02:29:24,357  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:360 Y2:426
You have
enslaved him.

1034
02:29:24,428 --> 02:29:26,293  X1:270 X2:453 Y1:360 Y2:433
You have
placed Fester

1035
02:29:26,364 --> 02:29:28,025  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:360 Y2:433
under some strange
sexual spell.

1036
02:29:28,099 --> 02:29:31,500  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:360 Y2:433
I respect that.
But, please, may we see him?

1037
02:29:31,569 --> 02:29:33,196  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:362 Y2:426
Don't even
think about it.

1038
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:34,794  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:426
You have gone
too far.

1039
02:29:34,872 --> 02:29:36,362  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:426
You have
married Fester.

1040
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:37,930  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:433
You have destroyed
his spirit.

1041
02:29:38,009 --> 02:29:40,534  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:426
You have taken him
from us.

1042
02:29:40,611 --> 02:29:42,101  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:433
All that
I could forgive.

1043
02:29:42,179 --> 02:29:43,476  X1:270 X2:451 Y1:398 Y2:430
But, Debbie...

1044
02:29:43,547 --> 02:29:44,946  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:398 Y2:426
What?

1045
02:29:46,217 --> 02:29:47,343  X1:308 X2:414 Y1:398 Y2:426
Pastels?

1046
02:29:47,418 --> 02:29:49,579  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:398 Y2:433
Get out of my house!

1047
02:29:49,653 --> 02:29:51,484  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:426
Hit the road!

1048
02:29:51,555 --> 02:29:54,786  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:360 Y2:433
And if you ever
show your faces around here again,

1049
02:29:54,859 --> 02:29:58,761  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'll have you locked up
for trying to visit.

1050
02:29:58,829 --> 02:29:59,955  X1:270 X2:451 Y1:398 Y2:433
Right, Fessie?

1051
02:30:00,031 --> 02:30:00,998  X1:320 X2:401 Y1:398 Y2:433
Right!

1052
02:30:10,574 --> 02:30:14,738  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:362 Y2:430
Luxor, nexor,
burst, and burn!

1053
02:30:14,812 --> 02:30:16,677  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:398 Y2:433
What is she doing?

1054
02:30:16,747 --> 02:30:19,375  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:362 Y2:433
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.

1055
02:30:24,188 --> 02:30:26,383  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:398 Y2:433
I demand justice!

1056
02:30:26,457 --> 02:30:28,755  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:433
Someone has married
my brother.

1057
02:30:28,826 --> 02:30:30,259  X1:337 X2:385 Y1:400 Y2:426
No.

1058
02:30:30,327 --> 02:30:32,158  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:398 Y2:426
She took him to Hawaii.

1059
02:30:32,229 --> 02:30:35,289  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:433
They have moved into
a large, expensive home

1060
02:30:35,366 --> 02:30:37,163  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:433
where they make love
constantly.

1061
02:30:37,234 --> 02:30:38,963  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:433
I hate
when that happens.

1062
02:30:39,036 --> 02:30:40,970  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:433
Arrest her at once
without delay.

1063
02:30:41,038 --> 02:30:42,972  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:426
- Who?
- Debbie.

1064
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,101  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:360 Y2:433
My brother's wife,
the temptress of Waikiki.

1065
02:30:47,178 --> 02:30:48,372  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:398 Y2:433
Who are you?

1066
02:30:48,446 --> 02:30:50,880  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:426
What are you?
Who moved the rock?

1067
02:30:50,948 --> 02:30:52,939  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:360 Y2:433
Officer,
you must issue a subpoena.

1068
02:30:53,017 --> 02:30:54,985  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:398 Y2:433
I believe they own...

1069
02:30:55,052 --> 02:30:56,076  X1:284 X2:437 Y1:400 Y2:430
Gomez, no!

1070
02:30:56,153 --> 02:30:57,085  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:398 Y2:426
A Buick!

1071
02:30:57,154 --> 02:30:59,179  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:360 Y2:433
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.

1072
02:30:59,256 --> 02:31:02,487  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.

1073
02:31:04,328 --> 02:31:06,353  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:398 Y2:433
Has the planet gone mad?

1074
02:31:08,099 --> 02:31:10,067  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:398 Y2:433
My brother... passion's hostage.

1075
02:31:10,134 --> 02:31:11,761  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:398 Y2:433
I seek justice.

1076
02:31:11,836 --> 02:31:13,565  X1:309 X2:413 Y1:398 Y2:426
Denied.

1077
02:31:13,637 --> 02:31:18,438  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:360 Y2:433
I shall not submit.
I shall conquer. I shall rise.

1078
02:31:18,509 --> 02:31:23,913  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:360 Y2:426
My name is Gomez Addams,
and I have seen evil!

1079
02:31:23,981 --> 02:31:25,881  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:398 Y2:426
I have seen horror!

1080
02:31:27,818 --> 02:31:30,810  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:433
I have seen
the unholy maggots

1081
02:31:30,888 --> 02:31:35,518  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:360 Y2:426
which feast in the dark recesses
of the human soul!

1082
02:31:35,593 --> 02:31:37,083  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:398 Y2:433
They're at camp.

1083
02:31:37,161 --> 02:31:39,823  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:426
I have seen all this,
Officer.

1084
02:31:39,897 --> 02:31:41,762  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:398 Y2:433
But until today,

1085
02:31:41,832 --> 02:31:45,233  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:398 Y2:426
I had never seen...

1086
02:31:47,037 --> 02:31:48,095  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:400 Y2:433
you!

1087
02:31:49,173 --> 02:31:53,701  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:426
Hook him, book him,
cook him. Now!

1088
02:31:53,777 --> 02:31:55,608  X1:279 X2:442 Y1:398 Y2:426
Next in line.

1089
02:31:55,679 --> 02:31:58,204  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:360 Y2:433
Yes, I'd like to renew
my passport, please.

1090
02:31:58,282 --> 02:32:00,341  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'll be leaving the country
very shortly.

1091
02:32:00,417 --> 02:32:01,679  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:398 Y2:433
Traveling alone?

1092
02:32:01,752 --> 02:32:04,812  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:398 Y2:426
Yes. I'll be a widow.

1093
02:32:09,393 --> 02:32:11,361  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1094
02:32:11,428 --> 02:32:13,589  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ Hunger pains will go away ~

1095
02:32:13,664 --> 02:32:15,188  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:360 Y2:433
~ When you hear
the pilgrims say ~

1096
02:32:15,266 --> 02:32:17,325  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ It's happy turkey day ~

1097
02:32:17,401 --> 02:32:19,301  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ Happy, happy turkey day ~

1098
02:32:19,370 --> 02:32:21,770  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:360 Y2:433
~ Let's all eat
the Indian way ~

1099
02:32:21,839 --> 02:32:23,830  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:433
~ As Bastille
and Cape Cod day ~

1100
02:32:23,908 --> 02:32:27,105  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ On happy turkey day ~~

1101
02:32:27,178 --> 02:32:32,206  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:360 Y2:433
Look at you.
Oh, Amanda, you look perfect!

1102
02:32:32,283 --> 02:32:35,616  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:360 Y2:426
You're just the prettiest pilgrim
I've ever seen!

1103
02:32:35,686 --> 02:32:38,246  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:426
Gar, come and take
a look at this.

1104
02:32:38,322 --> 02:32:39,812  X1:265 X2:457 Y1:398 Y2:433
Here they are!

1105
02:32:39,890 --> 02:32:41,357  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:433
They were
by the phone.

1106
02:32:41,425 --> 02:32:42,915  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:398 Y2:433
We were calling the FBI.

1107
02:32:42,993 --> 02:32:44,483  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:398 Y2:426
Their uncle's in trouble.

1108
02:32:44,562 --> 02:32:46,689  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:398 Y2:433
You're late for your fittings.

1109
02:32:46,764 --> 02:32:48,994  X1:240 X2:483 Y1:360 Y2:433
I don't want to be
in the pageant.

1110
02:32:49,066 --> 02:32:51,694  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:433
You won't help me
realize my vision?

1111
02:32:51,769 --> 02:32:54,329  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:426
Your work is puerile
and under-dramatized.

1112
02:32:54,405 --> 02:32:57,203  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:360 Y2:430
You lack any sense
of structure, character,

1113
02:32:57,274 --> 02:32:59,105  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:398 Y2:426
or the Aristotelian unities.

1114
02:32:59,176 --> 02:33:01,736  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:360 Y2:433
Young lady,
I am getting just a tad tired

1115
02:33:01,812 --> 02:33:03,575  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:398 Y2:433
of your attitude problem.

1116
02:33:03,647 --> 02:33:05,774  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:400 Y2:433
Everyone, campers!

1117
02:33:05,849 --> 02:33:08,511  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:398 Y2:426
I have a wonderful idea.

1118
02:33:08,586 --> 02:33:11,749  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:360 Y2:433
Wednesday and Pugsley
and young Mr. Glicker here,

1119
02:33:11,822 --> 02:33:14,950  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:433
well, they have just
never quite latched on

1120
02:33:15,025 --> 02:33:16,253  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:398 Y2:433
to the Chippewa spirit,

1121
02:33:16,327 --> 02:33:18,852  X1:207 X2:516 Y1:360 Y2:426
nor have some oftheir
little comrades.

1122
02:33:18,929 --> 02:33:21,659  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:398 Y2:426
Isn't that sad?

1123
02:33:21,732 --> 02:33:22,664  X1:323 X2:396 Y1:362 Y2:426
- Yes!
- Yes!

1124
02:33:22,733 --> 02:33:24,200  X1:271 X2:452 Y1:362 Y2:427
Don't we just
hate that?

1125
02:33:24,268 --> 02:33:25,200  X1:323 X2:396 Y1:362 Y2:426
- Yes!
- Yes!

1126
02:33:25,269 --> 02:33:27,134  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:433
Don't we wish
they'd just die?

1127
02:33:27,204 --> 02:33:28,193  X1:323 X2:396 Y1:362 Y2:426
- Yes!
- Yes!

1128
02:33:28,272 --> 02:33:29,500  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:398 Y2:426
We don't.

1129
02:33:29,573 --> 02:33:32,633  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:426
But you know what
we'll do with them?

1130
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:35,076  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:433
We're going to make
an example.

1131
02:33:35,145 --> 02:33:37,807  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:433
We are going to show
that anyone,

1132
02:33:37,881 --> 02:33:40,941  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:360 Y2:433
no matter how odd
or pale or chubby,

1133
02:33:41,018 --> 02:33:44,078  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:433
can still have
a darn good time.

1134
02:33:44,154 --> 02:33:46,179  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:426
Whether they
like it or not.

1135
02:33:46,257 --> 02:33:49,021  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:398 Y2:433
What are you going to do?

1136
02:33:50,194 --> 02:33:52,287  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:360 Y2:433
Yes, indeedy,
just the ticket.

1137
02:33:52,363 --> 02:33:53,523  X1:318 X2:412 Y1:398 Y2:426
Bambi.

1138
02:33:53,597 --> 02:33:55,792  X1:233 X2:497 Y1:400 Y2:427
Lassie Come Home.

1139
02:33:55,866 --> 02:33:57,834  X1:234 X2:500 Y1:398 Y2:426
The Little Mermaid.

1140
02:33:57,901 --> 02:33:58,868  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:400 Y2:434
Stop it.

1141
02:33:58,936 --> 02:34:01,029  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:398 Y2:433
He's only a child.

1142
02:34:02,806 --> 02:34:06,071  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:362 Y2:433
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.

1143
02:34:06,143 --> 02:34:08,270  X1:327 X2:395 Y1:400 Y2:426
But...

1144
02:34:08,345 --> 02:34:10,040  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:400 Y2:434
it's Disney.

1145
02:34:10,114 --> 02:34:11,513  X1:332 X2:386 Y1:400 Y2:426
Yes.

1146
02:34:14,752 --> 02:34:17,721  X1:217 X2:513 Y1:398 Y2:432
~ The hillsare alive ~

1147
02:34:17,788 --> 02:34:22,418  X1:167 X2:564 Y1:398 Y2:432
~ With the sound of music ~

1148
02:34:22,493 --> 02:34:24,893  X1:151 X2:580 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ With songs they have sung ~

1149
02:34:24,962 --> 02:34:26,759  X1:172 X2:559 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ For a thousand years... ~~

1150
02:34:26,830 --> 02:34:31,096  X1:169 X2:561 Y1:360 Y2:432
~ And they knew that it was
much more than a hunch ~

1151
02:34:31,168 --> 02:34:34,569  X1:190 X2:543 Y1:360 Y2:433
~ That this group must
somehow form a family ~

1152
02:34:34,638 --> 02:34:38,130  X1:160 X2:575 Y1:360 Y2:433
~ That's the way we all
became the BradyBunch... ~~

1153
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:42,304  X1:201 X2:529 Y1:398 Y2:433
~ You're always a day ~

1154
02:34:42,379 --> 02:34:47,817  X1:280 X2:450 Y1:400 Y2:433
~ A-way ~~

1155
02:35:00,064 --> 02:35:01,258  X1:318 X2:402 Y1:398 Y2:426
Well...

1156
02:35:01,332 --> 02:35:03,527  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:398 Y2:433
good evening.

1157
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,966  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:360 Y2:433
Is there anything
you'd like to say to everyone?

1158
02:35:06,036 --> 02:35:07,264  X1:332 X2:386 Y1:400 Y2:426
Yes.

1159
02:35:07,338 --> 02:35:10,398  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:433
And just what
might that be?

1160
02:35:14,211 --> 02:35:16,042  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'm not perky.

1161
02:35:17,147 --> 02:35:18,637  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:398 Y2:426
That's for damn sure.

1162
02:35:18,716 --> 02:35:20,809  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:398 Y2:426
But I want to be.

1163
02:35:22,119 --> 02:35:23,347  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:398 Y2:426
You do?

1164
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:25,251  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:398 Y2:426
I want to smile

1165
02:35:25,322 --> 02:35:28,223  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:398 Y2:433
and sing and dance

1166
02:35:28,292 --> 02:35:30,760  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433
and be Pocahontas
in Gary's vision.

1167
02:35:30,828 --> 02:35:34,059  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:433
Oh, darling,
do you really mean it?

1168
02:35:51,615 --> 02:35:52,775  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:360 Y2:433
- [Gasps]
- [Gasps]

1169
02:35:52,850 --> 02:35:54,545  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:398 Y2:433
Isn't she pretty?

1170
02:35:54,618 --> 02:35:56,313  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:398 Y2:433
She's scaring me!

1171
02:35:56,387 --> 02:35:57,445  X1:304 X2:416 Y1:398 Y2:430
Oh, Gar.

1172
02:35:57,521 --> 02:35:58,488  X1:321 X2:397 Y1:398 Y2:426
Yeah.

1173
02:36:00,858 --> 02:36:03,053  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:398 Y2:426
Aah!

1174
02:36:03,127 --> 02:36:04,526  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:398 Y2:433
Stay back!

1175
02:36:04,595 --> 02:36:07,223  X1:268 X2:454 Y1:398 Y2:433
He's very sick.

1176
02:36:12,136 --> 02:36:13,899  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:398 Y2:433
My baby!

1177
02:36:18,242 --> 02:36:20,540  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:398 Y2:430
Lumbar, dison...

1178
02:36:20,611 --> 02:36:22,442  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:398 Y2:433

02:50:53,070 --> 02:50:54,901  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:398 Y2:426
a child of mine.

lots of good fun,

1424
02:51:39,550 --> 02:51:41,711  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:360 Y2:433
and my husband
is dying.

1425
02:51:43,020 --> 02:51:46,148  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:426
Oh, mama,
what shall I do?

1426
02:51:46,223 --> 02:51:49,056  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:426
Well, you have
a black dress.

1427

1432

1435

1446
02:53:00,865 --> 02:53:05,495  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433
Our whole family--

1447
02:53:05,569 --> 02:53:07,537  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:398 Y2:433
Three generations...

1450
02:53:17,521 --> 02:53:19,887  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:360 Y2:433
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

1451
02:53:19,957 --> 02:53:22,425  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:360 Y2:433
I don't enjoy
hurting anybody.

1452
02:53:22,493 --> 02:53:26,691  X1:185 X2:538 Y1:360 Y2:430
I don't like guns or bombs
or electric chairs,

1453
02:53:26,764 --> 02:53:28,994  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:360 Y2:433
but sometimes
people just won't listen,

1454
02:53:29,066 --> 02:53:31,830  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:433
and so I have to use
persuasion...

1455
02:53:31,903 --> 02:53:33,666  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:398 Y2:426

1456
02:53:33,738 --> 02:53:36,571  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:362 Y2:426
My parents--
Sharon and Dave.

1457
02:53:36,641 --> 02:53:38,233  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:398 Y2:433
Generous, doting...

1458
02:53:38,309 --> 02:53:40,106  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:398 Y2:433
or were they?

1459
02:53:40,177 --> 02:53:44,614  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:426
All I ever wanted
was a ballerina Barbie

1460
02:53:44,682 --> 02:53:46,775  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:398 Y2:433
in her pretty pink tutu.

1461
02:53:46,851 --> 02:53:48,250  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:433

1462
02:53:48,319 --> 02:53:49,718  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:400 Y2:430

1463
02:53:49,787 --> 02:53:52,688  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:360 Y2:433
and do you know
what they got me?

1464
02:53:52,757 --> 02:53:56,124  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:398 Y2:426
Malibu Barbie.

1465
02:53:56,193 --> 02:53:57,888  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:398 Y2:426

1466
02:53:57,962 --> 02:53:59,088  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433
The nightmare.

1467
02:53:59,163 --> 02:54:00,323  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:398 Y2:426
The nerve.

1468
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:02,764  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:426
That's not
what I wanted.

1469
02:54:02,833 --> 02:54:04,858  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:398 Y2:426
That's not who I was.

1470
02:54:04,936 --> 02:54:07,404  X1:241 X2:482 Y1:398 Y2:426
I was a ballerina--

1471
02:54:07,471 --> 02:54:10,736  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:398 Y2:433
graceful, delicate.

1472
02:54:10,808 --> 02:54:12,605  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:398 Y2:433
They had to go.

1473
02:54:28,592 --> 02:54:31,789  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:433
My first husband,
the heart surgeon.

1474
02:54:31,862 --> 02:54:34,831  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:433
All day long,
coronaries, transplants.

1475
02:54:34,899 --> 02:54:36,526  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:398 Y2:433
What about your needs?

1476
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:39,194  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:398 Y2:433

1478
02:54:43,174 --> 02:54:44,505  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:400 Y2:426

1479
02:54:44,575 --> 02:54:46,873  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:398 Y2:426

1481
02:55:06,797 --> 02:55:09,698  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:360 Y2:433

He loved his country.

1483
02:55:11,836 --> 02:55:15,033  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:360 Y2:433
"Sorry, Debbie.
No Mercedes this year.

1484
02:55:15,106 --> 02:55:17,267  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:398 Y2:433
We have to set an example."

1485
02:55:17,341 --> 02:55:20,868  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:398 Y2:433
Oh, yeah? Set this!

02:55:37,762 --> 02:55:39,559  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:398 Y2:433

1487

02:55:43,234 --> 02:55:44,701  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:398 Y2:426

02:55:44,769 --> 02:55:46,669  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:398 Y2:433

1490
02:55:46,737 --> 02:55:49,467  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:398 Y2:433
And his adorable family.

1491
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:52,907  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:360 Y2:433
You took me in.
You accepted me.

1492
02:55:52,977 --> 02:55:56,469  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:398 Y2:433
But did any of you love me?

1493
02:55:56,547 --> 02:55:57,878  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433
Really love me?

1495
02:56:14,532 --> 02:56:16,363  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:398 Y2:426
So I--I killed.

1496
02:56:16,434 --> 02:56:18,231  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:398 Y2:426
So I maimed.

1497
02:56:18,302 --> 02:56:23,535  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:360 Y2:426
So I destroyed one
innocent life after another.

1498
02:56:23,607 --> 02:56:27,099  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:398 Y2:433

02:56:27,178 --> 02:56:32,878  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:433
Don't I yearn and...
ache and shop?

1500
02:56:34,085 --> 02:56:39,352  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:398 Y2:426

1505
02:57:14,058 --> 02:57:16,185  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:426
For what I've done,
I deserve to die.
