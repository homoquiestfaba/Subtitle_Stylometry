1
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,254
-You know De Vicco too?
-Yeah, from the Four Seasons.

2
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:25,191
He showed us around
the vineyards in Toscany.

3
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:32,632
It was beautiful.
He showed us around.

4
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,302
We did the taste test, you know?

5
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,533
We tasted the wine.

6
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,853
He doesn't speak Italian.

7
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:59,292
He also doesn't
drink much.

8
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,489
I guess he likes to keep
his head clear for business.

9
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,968
Your credit card's been
refused.

10
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,935
What?

11
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,707
Obviously there's
some computer error.

12
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,510
We phoned American Express.

13
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,311
Could we discuss it over here?

14
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,778
Excuse me.

15
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,821
I understand there's
a problem with the card.

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,290
You won't take a check?
What do you want me to do?

17
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,697
It's a computer error,
believe me.

18
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,736
Can the management offer
anyone a drink?

19
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,747
But I had to write it.

20
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,352
It was an important business dinner
and I'd forgotten my credits cards.

21
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,687
The check?

22
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,656
It's 400 Pounds or so.

23
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,793
487 Pounds probably.

24
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:52,398
Could you hang on a second, please?
There's someone at the door.

25
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,833
Come in.

26
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,037
I realize the account is
slightly more overdrawn...

27
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,942
but it would be crazy for the bank
to even think of stopping my credit.

28
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,445
Granted, yes.

29
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,115
I could sell some of
my American stocks.

30
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,117
But, but why?
The market is awful...

31
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:15,088
And when the market's awful,
Binky doesn't go to market.

32
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:20,793
But I am on the verge of
something very lucrative.

33
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:27,033
So for you to even be talking
about dishonoring my checks...

34
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,771
puts me in a very sweaty mode.
How can you say that?

35
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:36,643
I assure you, I appreciate
the bank's position...

36
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,479
but the bank is not
in jeopardy.

37
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,248
I'm asking for
two weeks' time.

38
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,547
In two weeks time I will be
in the black.

39
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,690
I promise I won't write
no more checks.

40
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,959
Thanks, bye.

41
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,927
Jerk.

42
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,130
How much are you talking about?

43
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,532
Nothing. 4,000 Pounds.

44
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,303
The Hotel's pushing me to pay
the bill, that's another 6,000...

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,139
and, apparently,
it's full steam ahead.

46
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,907
Can't you just put that on the Amex?

47
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,177
I could, if I wanted it to
bounce several miles...

48
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,510
it's a problem, I mean,
not a problem problem.

49
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,717
I just gotta have
a little cash, you know...

50
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,953
until that cocoa gets off
the dock in Sierra Leone.

51
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,023
Poor Jake. Everything's gonna be
all right. It always is.

52
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,491
What do these people want?
I mean, spleen?

53
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,551
God damn grapefruit.

54
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:37,603
How you can eat all that you do and
stay so thin I'll never know.

55
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,867
I'm just lucky, I guess.

56
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,405
I've been thinking.

57
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,419
How much could you say
that this is worth?

58
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,895
-Nothing doing.
-40, 50 thousand dollars?

59
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,931
Jake, you know what that
means to me.

60
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,133
I'll get you another one.
I'll get you two of them.

61
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,404
It's beautiful and all this crap,
but times are tough.

62
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,706
When times are tough what
a thing like-this for?

63
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,867
Well, I love my little
Henry Moore.

64
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,992
Stop it!
You know I hate that...

65
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,789
especially when I'm eating.

66
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,373
You don't have to worry, baby.

67
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,639
Everything's gonna be all right.
It always is.

68
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,147
You're so damn smart.

69
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,447
I have nothing personal against
this handicapped girl.

70
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,282
Not that word.

71
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,486
-This handicapped woman, then.
-No, not handicapped.

72
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,954
What are we talking about,
then?

73
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,124
We don't sanction the use
the word 'handicapped'.

74
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,992
'Hearing impaired'.

75
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,996
Obviously I've nothing personal
against this...

76
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,032
hearing impaired person...

77
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,668
but the fact that she can't speak
or hear is a pathetic reason...

78
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,672
but the fact that she can't speak
or hear is a pathetic reason...

79
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:58,201
to deny her the chance of
a very menial job of work.

80
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:06,586
-Chicken Farsi again?
-It was either that or the Duck...

81
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,623
Victor, have a word with
the guests in 327-328, will you?

82
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,092
Their Amex imprint was refused
although I'm sure...

83
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,495
it's just a temporary
cash flow hiccough.

84
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,065
But I retire in June, Victor.

85
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:22,869
I want to leave here on a seamless
cloud of perfection.

86
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,737
All right. Seamless.
Sorry to disturb you.

87
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,979
A great Hotel is like an ocean
going lilith, Mrs. Doughty.

88
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,015
Stewards with white gloves
in the lounge...

89
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,084
and the burlesque
stoken down below.

90
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,388
And it all must mesh...
seamlessly.

91
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,859
With this person, I see complications
arising with the rest of the staff.

92
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,364
-Communication, what have you.
-Yes, of course. Communication.

93
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,200
My husband's brother
'communicates'.

94
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,069
He's a features writer
for the Times.

95
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm afraid I don't see it working
from our point of view.

96
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,909
He's doing an expose
article...

97
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,011
on job discrimination.

98
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,673
This is just what
he's looking for.

99
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,453
Very well.

100
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,955
A trial period.

101
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,459
Say, a week as long as she
keeps out of everyone's way.

102
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,895
I don't want you to think
don't have a heart here.

103
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,768
This is crazy.
Why am I standing here with you?

104
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,102
Because the light's red.

105
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,705
Jake. You know what I mean.
Why am I letting you do this?

106
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,542
-I'm not letting you do this.
-Let's find out the value of the thing.

107
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,978
At the present time. It's important
to know these things.

108
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,675
-Important for who?
-Ah, for our insurance.

109
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,546
Don't you worry.
I'm not letting him sell you.

110
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,499
I'd say...

111
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,603
about 20,000 Pounds
at current market values.

112
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,407
It's one of a limited edition
of, I think, yes, nine.

113
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,377
None of the others are available
at the moment, as far as I know.

114
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,512
An exquisite piece.

115
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,014
How long have you had it, Mr. Bartholemew?

116
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,216
3 years.

117
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,453
And may I ask how much you
originally paid for it?

118
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,221
It was a gift.

119
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,859
20,000 Pounds?
That's, what, $32,000 or so?

120
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,260
That's all?

121
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,263
Well, you said yourself
it's an exquisite piece.

122
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,099
Come on, you can do better
than that.

123
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,570
That's roughly what we'd pay for it.
You could put it up for auction.

124
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,139
But prices there fluctuate.
Up, and down.

125
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,166
If we put it up for auction, would
you invite a lot of Japanese?

126
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,281
We're not sure we want to
get rid of it at this time.

127
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,374
But, if we do,
we'll come to you.

128
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,819
It could be a quick sale?

129
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,389
Of course. I'm sure we could
get you the top price.

130
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,026
It'd really very sporting of you
to keep it in a hotel suite.

131
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,994
It would be a shame
to keep it locked away.

132
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,623
-I'm sure you're well covered.
-Yes, we're covered.

133
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,397
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

134
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,814
I've got a very naughty idea.

135
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,158
You heard what that nice
man said about hotels?

136
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,961
Well, why don't we take it
and claim on it?

137
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:40,332
That way you can have your money
and I get to keep my Henry Moore.

138
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,869
-A touch risky, I'd say.
-How?

139
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,305
It's so small, it could fit
in a shoebox.

140
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,909
Anybody could've taken it.
It could've just disappeared.

141
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,845
I know Joan would keep it
for me if I ask her.

142
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,549
Well, it is against the law.

143
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,178
Of course, prison is one way of
cutting down on our hotel bills.

144
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,589
You just better make sure our
insurance is up to date...

145
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,527
because I might just make it
disappear at any time.

146
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,256
Maybe.

147
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:40,659
All our suites come in a different
style. She must really like this one.

148
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,429
It must be very difficult for her.

149
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,966
No, not really.
Jenny's survivor.

150
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,001
Been in the home...
from the time she was six.

151
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,138
The poor little child,
her parents dead.

152
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,131
She doesn't make friends easily.
Shy, I suppose.

153
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:01,373
-I hope she can fit in here.
-Oh, she's a good girl.

154
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,273
-All right?
-Yes, so far.

155
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,870
What is spaghetti made of?

156
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,440
Spaghetti ingredients. I don't know.
Flour and water?

157
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,635
Flour and water?

158
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,613
How much does that cost?

159
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,615
Flour and water don't cost much.

160
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:15,287
Not much. A dollar for, say, a hundred
strands or a thousand strands?

161
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,656
A dollar for a couple
hundred strands probably.

162
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,026
How many strands, would you say,
are on this plate?

163
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,729
Fifty strands? Eighty?

164
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,065
Fifty, eighty. That's about right
to me, give or take.

165
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,935
Yes, when I say fifty to eighty,
or take is built in.

166
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:34,607
Now, what else is here?
Olives, tomatoes?

167
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,735
And what else?
Caper look-alike?

168
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,680
-What would that cost?
-Not much.

169
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,217
So, not much for the flour and the
water and the chopped up vegetables.

170
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,888
Why is it what I'm paying for this
dinner is more than the national debt...

171
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,456
of a third world country?

172
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,224
I don't know.
Is the wine expensive?

173
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,594
You know what I mean.

174
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,330
Couldn't you cook this?

175
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,200
We don't have a kitchen, Jake.
lf we had a kitchen I could cook it.

176
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,602
We'll get a kitchen some day.

177
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,170
Anyway, since when do you care?

178
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,607
You've always said when it comes to
food, shoes and sex, price is no object.

179
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,541
Good shoes are important.

180
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,585
-There's Larry.
-Where?

181
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,416
Coming up this way.

182
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,498
-Hello, Tina. How are you?
-Fine. You?

183
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,535
Couldn't be better, except I wish
l were home in Westport.

184
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,870
Where are you staying?

185
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,005
Jonathan and Melissa asked me.

186
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,108
For a few days, I thought why not
skip the Savoy this time?

187
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,413
Their new house is beautiful.
Marble bathrooms from Italy...

188
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,150
-Jonathan and Melissa. How are they?
-All right.

189
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,217
You never can tell.

190
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,287
She's put a little weight
and he's grown a beard.

191
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,755
Well, better that than
the other way around.

192
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,295
Better that than
the other way around.

193
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,257
Well, look after yourself, Tina.

194
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,541
What I was attempting
to say is that...

195
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,211
it would have been odd had she grown
the beard and he'd put on the weight.

196
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,047
But, maybe I didn't
make it clear.

197
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,750
l said it twice
to try and make sure.

198
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,020
Don't take it like that, Jake.
You don't care.

199
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,615
-And you know he hates you.
-Why? I don't hate him.

200
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,854
You're very big hearted.
l'll always remember that.

201
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,101
Now that's a good idea, and it
doesn't cost anything.

202
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,498
<i>Shut that bloody row.</i>

203
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,916
<i>Turn off that bloody racket</i>
<i>l'll call the police!</i>

204
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,254
<i>Turn it off or I'll come down and</i>
<i>sort you out myself, you bugger!</i>

205
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,281
<i>Please, turn it off!</i>

206
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,891
<i>Well thanks bloody much!</i>
<i>lt's about bleedin' time, too!</i>

207
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,576
l need mineral water.

208
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,381
Dark is best.

209
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,152
God, water.

210
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,684
Room service, please answer.
Please answer.

211
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:32,177
Hello? Is this the concierge,
hall porter or front desk?

212
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,748
Ah, Front Desk. There's an emergency
up here in Room 327.

213
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,685
Yes. Yes. Room Service
does not answer...

214
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,055
and we need a dozen bottles of
Perrier up here right away.

215
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,791
l know it's three o'clock in the
morning, but this is an emergency.

216
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:51,130
Trinidad rum punch, stingers,
red wine, champagne.

217
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,291
Jesus, how do you do it, Tina?

218
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,995
Tina, could we please do it
on the bed tonight?

219
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,334
Tina?

220
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,677
Tina? Where are you?

221
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,348
Help me, help me.
l'm frightened.

222
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:15,120
My clothes are coming off and there's
nothing I can do to stop them.

223
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,991
Are you covered for this, Jake?

224
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,093
Are you covered?

225
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,696
l think you better call your
insurance man.

226
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,358
Oh, call him. Quick.

227
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,428
You don't really need
my insurance man.

228
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,674
l can handle this fine.

229
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,585
Will you still love
when I'm broke?

230
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,321
Good thing this isn't broke.

231
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,224
But let's fix it, anyway.

232
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:57,162
-What the hell is that?
- Don't stop, baby.

233
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,689
-Hang on I'm coming!
-Me too.

234
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,270
Jake.

235
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,139
What do you want?

236
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,630
-A dozen mineral water.
-Jake.

237
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,280
Come on in.

238
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,733
l won't see any of that, sir.
That'll go to the waiters.

239
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,804
-l'm a desk man.
-Oh, Jesus.

240
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,740
-Can I come out now, Jake?
-No.

241
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,710
-Do you have change for a 20 Pound note?
-l'm afraid I don't, sir.

242
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,411
Tina, do you have change?

243
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,746
l don't know.
Look in my purse.

244
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,682
-Where is your purse?
-l don't know. The floor?

245
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,616
lt's over there, sir.
Under the...

246
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,728
Nothing smaller than a ten.

247
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,997
-Give it to him.
-What, are you crazy?

248
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,363
Oh, Christ. Hang on.

249
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,850
Thank you very much.
Goodnight, sir, madam.

250
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,053
Boy, am I thirsty.
Double thirsty.

251
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,956
You're going to be very popular with
the lads in Room Service.

252
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:36,495
'Room 327, I'll take it up. I hear
she tips good and might be naked.'

253
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,631
Don't be such a prude. The human
body's a beautiful thing.

254
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,963
So? Flash for me.

255
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,672
64 days. I was counting.

256
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,970
That's the longest anything's
lasted in two years.

257
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,844
But you knew he really wasn't
the one for you anyway.

258
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,981
-Just because he was married?
-No, of course not.

259
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,319
-Because of those things I told you?
-Well, you said you liked that.

260
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,388
l didn't mind it, sometimes.
So, why then?

261
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,791
lt's simple. He didn't wanna
spend money on you.

262
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,226
You could always tell. He'd get
you take-out Chinese...

263
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:12,030
then tell you about the scuba diving
equipment he'd bought for himself.

264
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,165
That's not his fault.

265
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,200
l told him
l Iiked Oriental food.

266
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,464
Men are such strange
creatures.

267
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,108
Jake and I ran into Larry and Larry
pretended that Jake didn't exist.

268
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,346
So Jake wanted to be smart, which
made Larry ignore him even more.

269
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,116
Really, there's no difference between
grown men and little boys.

270
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,085
lt's the same as it was
in the sandbox.

271
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,213
Except for then they wanted to pull
your panties down in public.

272
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,661
You're so lucky with Jake, though.
He gives you everything you want.

273
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,130
l wanted to talk
to you about that.

274
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,000
Will you promise, on your soul,
not to say anything to anyone?

275
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,135
Promise.

276
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,771
Jake needs some extra
cash for a scheme of his...

277
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:57,743
-and he wants to sell my Henry Moore.
-That's yours.

278
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,413
Of course it is.
But you can't trust men.

279
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,716
l'm afraid he might sell it
behind my back.

280
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,419
l was wondering, if I brought it
to you, wrapped in a napkin...

281
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,921
would you keep it
for me for a while?

282
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,557
Well, he'd suspect, wouldn't he?
l mean, he knows we're friends.

283
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,026
Well, I could just say
it was stolen.

284
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,154
You could just say you don't know
what we're talking about.

285
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,533
Okay. Sure.

286
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,194
lt's simple.

287
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,996
Well, you were my first choice.
Maybe next time.

288
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,106
l will. yeah.
Give ours to Vicky.

289
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,869
Right. Bye.

290
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,973
Jerk.

291
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,412
-You take a long time, by the way.
-Well, it's worth it. Right?

292
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,385
Ah, my money.

293
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,353
l forgot my wallet.

294
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,057
ln an elevator.
Those guys are everywhere.

295
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,372
He's retiring soon.
Collects stamps.

296
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,431
And my money, any day now.

297
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,107
Tina, honey, hurry up. The waiter's
waiting to see you naked.

298
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,217
Come on, before your stuff
gets cold.

299
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,800
-That was a witty thing to do.
-What was?

300
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,270
-The little Henry Moore. It's gone.
-What do you mean?

301
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,839
Come on, Jake. Where is it?

302
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,974
What are you talking about,
'it's gone'?

303
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,205
Well, look. Look.

304
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,420
-So, what? It's under the bed?
-Jake.

305
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,223
-lt's under Joan's bed?
-What have you done with it?!

306
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,692
What have I done with it?
l didn't do anything with it.

307
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,460
lt's gone. Right?

308
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,621
Okay. All right.

309
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:51,169
Let's just get the little
insurance thing started.

310
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,804
Great.

311
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,675
And if anyone's taken it
somewhere, it's you.

312
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,177
Let's remember, it was your idea
in the first place.

313
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,113
l will hand it to you, though.
You're sneakier than I thought.

314
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,383
-No, maybe just as sneaky.
-Look, Jake. I don't know where it is.

315
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,385
Oh, sure. I believe you.
l trust you implicitly.

316
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,987
Oh, I can tell.

317
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:13,058
l guess we'd better call and
report it. Isn't that what you do?

318
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,760
l guess so. You're the guy.
You should known.

319
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,396
Just don't call me when they
send you up the river.

320
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,399
Likewise. Likewise.

321
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,629
And you don't know
anything about it?

322
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,038
Okay here it goes.

323
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,667
-Swear me.
-l swear. I swear. Let loose of me!

324
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,282
Could I speak with the Manager,
please?

325
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,911
Yeah. It's Jake Bartholemew,
in Room 327.

326
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,334
25,000 Pounds?

327
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:00,939
-lnsured?
-Oh yes, thank goodness.

328
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,107
Where was it kept?

329
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,609
Apparently on a side table,
like a dish of peanuts.

330
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,077
Have they any ideas?

331
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,447
He just telephoned to say the damn
thing's gone missing.

332
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,417
Better get on to Detective Fagan,
will you? Start him off.

333
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,486
Fagan's drinking again.

334
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,988
Well, somebody's got to do it.

335
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,723
l suppose you'd better.

336
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,761
Let's try and keep it to ourselves
for the moment, shall we?

337
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,252
327, Mr. Bartholemew.

338
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,235
Mr. Bartholemew, if it's not
too much trouble...

339
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,172
l'd like to send Mr. Swayle up to get
some information from you.

340
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:38,443
Our regular man, Detective Fagan,
is down with the flu.

341
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,678
Oh, no, I assure you.

342
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,015
lf anyone can get to the bottom
of this, it's our Mr. Swayle.

343
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,386
He was attached to an intelligence
unit during his Army service.

344
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,822
Of course. By all means.
And thank you so much.

345
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,787
Actually, it was a catering
course, sir.

346
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,898
-This afternoon, Victor, after lunch.
-Sir.

347
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,913
Hello? Yes.

348
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,279
Yes, it is.
Put him through.

349
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:24,455
l'm calling because one of the items
which is covered in my policy...

350
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,582
has apparently been stolen.

351
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,894
lt's a small bronze head
Henry Moore.

352
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,696
Yes, it was here
on the bedside table.

353
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,830
Yes, in the hotel.

354
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,212
What?! Yes! Yes, it is.

355
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:51,216
lt is covered in the 'Agreed Values'
section of the policy.

356
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,686
l pay more premium, but it's covered.
A special clause.

357
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,454
Jake, I'm going out for a walk.

358
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,857
Yeah. Well, you better check.
l'll go with you. Hang on.

359
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,026
-lt's okay. I'm going for a walk.
-Where are you going?

360
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,223
-Just out. A walk.
-Well, I'll go with you.

361
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,334
Look, I can't talk right now.
l've got another call coming.

362
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,302
Okay. Tomorrow. Bye.

363
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,509
Tina.

364
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,392
Teddy, when you told me
to go into cocoa...

365
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,361
you practically guaranteed it.

366
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,764
l realize you can't predict a dock
strike in Sierra

367
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,268
But a $30,000 margin call
is nothing, Teddy.

368
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,738
Anyway, I would really rather
not be pressed on it today.

369
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,172
Tina is very upset.

370
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,675
Her little Henry Moore statue
got stolen.

371
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,578
Yeah, it's insured.
$50,000.

372
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,514
So, you know, look at that as
collateral for your margin.

373
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,450
No, she wouldn't mind.
Why should she mind?

374
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,886
Teddy, the cocoa's gonna be off
the dock soon. Right?

375
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,356
Worse?

376
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,256
What could be worse than that?

377
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,892
Dumping it into the ocean?

378
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,937
Well, I mean, you can dredge
up cocoa, can't you?

379
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,874
l don't know. You could call that
guy who found the Titanic.

380
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:27,011
l realize the position, puts you in.
Yes. We're friends. Teddy...

381
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,981
Please don't talk about
liquidating me!

382
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,315
Teddy. I'm asking for grace.
Grace?

383
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,872
Oh, Mr. Bartholemew?

384
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,041
Excuse me.

385
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,440
How are you?

386
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,627
-Yes?
-Mrs. Bartholemew?

387
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,263
l'm Victor Swayle,
the Assistant Manager.

388
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,800
-Mr. Bartholemew is expecting me.
-He's out.

389
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,704
l'm here concerning your robbery.
l'm very sorry to hear about it.

390
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:30,575
-So am I.
-l want to ask you a few questions.

391
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,099
Come in.

392
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,715
I really can't tell you much. It was
just here yesterday and gone today.

393
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,118
lt's gone. Missing.
Stolen.

394
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,986
-You've looked around the suite?
-Sure. Everywhere. No sign.

395
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,150
Just gone. Missing. Stolen.

396
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,097
Oh, Jake. This is Mr...

397
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,999
Swayle. Swayle.

398
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,570
Mr. Swayle. He's from
the Hotel, to investigate.

399
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,573
l told him we couldn't
help much.

400
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,310
No, we can't. Not much.
lt's gone. Stolen I guess.

401
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,980
Have you notified the Police?

402
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,281
The Police.

403
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,383
No, we haven't. Not yet.

404
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,319
Well, maybe we can hold
that off for a while.

405
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,055
We're conducting our own
investigations and obviously...

406
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:21,059
if we can keep it in-house,
and return you your goods...

407
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,458
we'd all be happier.

408
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:27,698
Mrs. Bartholemew. Mr. Bartholemew,
thank you for your help.

409
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:32,270
l'm sorry that such a thing should
have happened in our hotel.

410
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,106
l do hope that you
won't hold it against us.

411
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,542
Us? No. We wouldn't dream of it.

412
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,112
Mr. Bartholemew, I wonder
if I could just have a word...

413
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,347
in private?

414
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,076
Sure. Okay.

415
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,303
l'm sorry to have to
mention this today...

416
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,172
but it's the bill. It's getting
heavily on the debit side.

417
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:13,978
Otherwise, we shall have
to start taking measures.

418
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,613
Look, Mr...

419
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,382
-Swayle.
-A $60,000 artwork...

420
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,551
is missing from your hotel.

421
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,120
l would say the debit is
on your side.

422
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,156
-Well, please, Mr. Bartholemew...
-Your hotel!

423
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:30,294
l think the last thing we should
worry about is my hotel bill.

424
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,765
ln fact, the lawsuit, which I'm
attempting to persuade my wife...

425
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,935
not to file,
would make my hotel bill...

426
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:41,572
look like a one hour rental
in a Tijuana bordello!

427
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,709
Oh, please, Mr. Bartholemew, I know
how upsetting this is.

428
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:48,145
You don't know what upsetting
is, you stupid prick.

429
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,928
lt was exciting to stay in
for a change.

430
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,072
lt makes me feel old staying
in watching TV with you.

431
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,008
Maybe it wasn't really
a great TV night.

432
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,978
l mean, how many times
will they allow...

433
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,615
'Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde' to be
remade? Is it an infinite number?

434
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,085
lt reminds me of home,
my mother, my father.

435
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,387
Still relying
on the characters?

436
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:08,188
Staying in watching TV, because they
had nowhere else to go.

437
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,634
Look, Jake, you don't know what
that head means to me.

438
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:21,372
l'm frightened without it. It's the
only thing that I've got in the world.

439
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,575
Tina, it was your idea to steal it
in the first place.

440
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,776
To help you.

441
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,745
l mean, is your family really
out of the question?

442
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,381
Yeah. Military School
is the last thing...

443
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,716
l said I would ever
take from them.

444
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,151
-Your sister? Your brother?
-My sister's having a baby.

445
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,387
My brother wouldn't give me
the sweat off his balls.

446
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,523
Oh, God, Jake. We should've
been in Sardinia by now.

447
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,125
l mean, what're we doing
in this dump?

448
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,293
Dump?

449
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,761
Who are you?
The Queen Mother?

450
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,864
Oh, the big breadwinner.
lt's not a problem.

451
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,534
lt's a problem when the only thing of
value in your wallet's the leather.

452
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,672
lf I were you, I'd stay away from
leather as a topic of conversation.

453
00:37:54,672 --> 00:38:00,011
At least until you can to cut down
on the shoe consumption.

454
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:05,249
l always thank God for Sundays, 'cause
it means you can't go shopping.

455
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,752
'On the seventh day she rested
and she drank.'

456
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:11,188
Screw you! Screw you! Just get back
and give it back to me!

457
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,957
Tina, keep your voice down.

458
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,359
Why?! They're gonna throw us
outta here anyway!

459
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,363
-Where were you this morning?
-l told you, I went for a walk.

460
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,999
Bullshit. If you went for a walk,
you would've come back with a package.

461
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,334
l went for a walk in the street.

462
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,804
Maybe over to Joan's?
Maybe carrying a little bundle?

463
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,473
Where were you? Don't tell me that
you were out buying cigars...

464
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,975
because I know you
can have them sent up.

465
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,705
l went somewhere else, okay?

466
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,148
Now, stop it.

467
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,615
Come on.

468
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:43,020
What are we fighting about?

469
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,122
We're in this together.

470
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:49,320
Oh, God. Just get it back
and give it back to me.

471
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,330
Well...

472
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,174
-What're you gonna do?
-l'm thinking.

473
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,574
l thought I heard
something rattling.

474
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,059
-Your name is Mr. Jake Bartholemew?
-Jonathan.

475
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,807
And you normally reside where?

476
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:15,346
Well, we don't. We travel.
Don't we, honey?

477
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,917
We would've been in Sardinia,
if it weren't for this.

478
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,654
Can I just ask, Mr. Bartholemew,
your date and place of birth?

479
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:28,284
Plainfield, New Jersey.
July 8, 1955.

480
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,630
And your full name, please,
Mrs. Bartholemew?

481
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,066
Tina Lesley Bartholemew.

482
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:41,906
Lesley?
Forgive me if I ask you, too.

483
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:49,747
-You were born?
-March 12, 1959.

484
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:53,117
Pensacola, Florida, U.S.A.

485
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,085
And the date of your marriage?

486
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:04,794
We're not, in the classic sense of
the term, actually married.

487
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,692
Well, there's no harm in that.

488
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,571
-You've known each other for...
-Two years.

489
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,272
Two years.

490
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:18,730
We learn a little more about
each other every day.

491
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,582
But, do we really need all
the personal questions?

492
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:29,453
lt's just part of the procedure to
satisfy the Insurance Company.

493
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,320
lt just helps them deal a bit more
quickly with your claim.

494
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,927
Where did you purchase it,
Mr. Bartholemew?

495
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,662
lt was a gift.

496
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,700
-From who?
-From Tina' S first husband.

497
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,270
First husband? You've been
married twice, then?

498
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,474
No. Jake means the man
l was married to.

499
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:54,011
-His name?
-Larry.

500
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,445
-Lawrence Oates.
-Lawrence Oates.

501
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,587
And you were divorced when?

502
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:09,226
Well, in the classic sense
of the term...

503
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,196
it's not final yet.

504
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,465
So, legally, you're still
Mrs. Lawrence Oates?

505
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,900
Yes.

506
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,424
Legally.

507
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,708
She would've done 327
two nights ago.

508
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,979
Ask Jenny if she has any idea
where a 25,000 Pound...

509
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,015
Henry Moore statuette
may have gone to.

510
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,784
l won't ask her that.
Not in those terms.

511
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,154
Ask her if she remembers
seeing such a statuette.

512
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,090
Ask her if she knows what it
looks like and where it was put.

513
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,997
A small head on the table
by the bed.

514
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,697
Thank you, Victor.

515
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:04,415
The most sensible thing to do would be
to search where Jenny lives.

516
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,213
Mr. Swayle can do it.
He's a trained man.

517
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,556
Why her place?
She wants to know.

518
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,492
She was the one on duty.
Reports have to be made.

519
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,429
lt'll save time.
Take your choice.

520
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:24,068
l'm sure it's not Jenny that's
done it, but life is hard.

521
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,670
Let's just get it out of the way.

522
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:32,370
Then Jenny can come back and finish
her work here or whatever...

523
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,287
l've had a word with the Hotel.
He's 3 weeks behind with the bill.

524
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,624
He had the statue valued just
the day before for 20,000 Pounds.

525
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,794
He's in cocoa, there's tons of it
piled up in a dock strike.

526
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,897
And he's having serious
money problems.

527
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,400
So, I'd stall on that claim
for quite a while.

528
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,268
Even if we don't turn up with anything,
l bet we can make a deal.

529
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,170
Mundy here.

530
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,340
Oh, hello, Mr. Bartholemew.
What can I do for you?

531
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,110
Well, first we'll be needing
the report for our adjuster.

532
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,147
l understand Mr. Slaughter did get
over to see you this morning.

533
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:15,419
You can't ever pin a date down exactly.
There's a lot of paperwork involved.

534
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,556
Usually not more than
6 or 8 weeks.

535
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:24,016
Yes. 6 or 8 weeks, I'm afraid.

536
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:42,306
Mr. Swayle, Jenny would like to use
the bathroom, if that's alright.

537
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,245
Oh, well, tell her not to be
too long then.

538
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,091
Nothing in here.

539
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,728
l think l'll do
the bathroom next.

540
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,116
Mr. Swayle...

541
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,902
-Jenny says she feels embarrassed.
-Why is that, Mrs. Doughty?

542
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:44,308
Don't look at her when l'm talking to
you otherwise you'll embarrass her more.

543
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,210
Alright, Mrs Doughty.

544
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,047
She put some things into the sink
to soak before going out...

545
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,811
and she wouldn't have left them
if she'd known you were coming.

546
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,031
-What's going on?
-Who are you?

547
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,267
That's what l said.

548
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:15,172
l'm a friend of Jenny's from
the Society, and this gentleman...

549
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,909
is from the hotel where she works.
He's looking for something.

550
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,979
-What's something?
-Something that's gone missing.

551
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,574
So, why's he looking here?
He thinks Jenny's nicked it?

552
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:32,689
-Hold on, son. What are you doing?
-l'm leaving.

553
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,691
l'm going to have to ask
to search garment.

554
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:38,092
Just a technicality,
l wouldn't refuse.

555
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,362
Okay, son.
Off you go now.

556
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,432
You little bastard.

557
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,582
Are you alright, Mr. Swayle?

558
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,482
l'll be alright in second.

559
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,585
l'm just gonna sit...

560
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,991
and then l'll finish
up in here.

561
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,720
Who was that little
fuck-wit?

562
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,936
Her brother, she tells me.

563
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:23,270
lf l ever see him again, l will break
every bone in his body!

564
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,847
Tina, that insurance money's
not gonna be here for awhile.

565
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,991
There's a piece of paper
in my pocket.

566
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,687
Read it to me.
lt'll help clear my mind.

567
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,874
'Model.' Crossed out?

568
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,709
So, what is this?

569
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,645
lt's a list of things l could do.

570
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:06,817
'Airline stewardess.
Work in office.'

571
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,319
'Sell poetry.'
What poetry?

572
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,722
Those poems that l write that
you say you like.

573
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,657
l thought l could find
someone to sell them.

574
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,388
'Magazine work.
Call. Wendy.'

575
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,302
Who's Wendy?

576
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,005
Oh Wendy.
She was a model l knew...

577
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:33,777
and now she's this
really big time editor.

578
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,146
l thought she might fix me
up or something.

579
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:39,483
'Buddy's Big Boy.''

580
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,018
Buddy's Big Boy, Buddy's Junior, $2.99.
l used to do it when l was 17.

581
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,219
'Other.'

582
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,588
Other things l could do.
l don't know what they are yet.

583
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,926
Tina, it's okay.

584
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,662
l'll fix it. Don't worry.

585
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,497
l do worry.

586
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,633
You can do anything you wanna do.
You're young.

587
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,157
Not forever.

588
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,375
Don't get me wrong if l say that
l thought l could rely on you.

589
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:11,581
l know that's not fair. But l thought
that's the way things worked.

590
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,184
That's how they've
always worked before.

591
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,053
You mean, Larry-wise.

592
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:20,023
Yeah. Larry-wise.
Wise Larry.

593
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,693
Tina...

594
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,530
now you gotta tell me
where it is.

595
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,132
l can't, l don't have it.

596
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,803
-l don't have it, either.
-Well, how do l know?

597
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,239
Tina, if l had the statue,
l would've sold it...

598
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,076
and we would be out of here.

599
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:42,879
Look, you know,
we're fighting.

600
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,749
Say we break up.
What would l have?

601
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:50,620
What you have?! No!
What do l have?!

602
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,992
l have a shitload of debts
and a lot of trouble!

603
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,517
Don't you shout at me!

604
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,524
Don't shout! Just do something!
l don't care what it is!

605
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,639
So, what is it with you two
at the moment?

606
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,576
You know, ever since that
statue got stolen.

607
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:48,407
Do you know about that?

608
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,782
Yeah, l heard something
about that.

609
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,808
Would l do something like that
and upset poor Tina?

610
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,094
So, what can l do for you?

611
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,998
l told you, l just wanted to get out
of the hotel for a while.

612
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,499
Why me?

613
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:13,970
All l know are brokers and bankers.
And they're mostly men.

614
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,063
And l hate men.
You're not a man.

615
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,510
On the phone you said you wanted to
talk to me about something.

616
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,048
l'd just like to sit here quiet
and-away for a while.

617
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:33,114
Okay. We can sit here quiet,
until l have to get dressed.

618
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,689
You don't know where it is,
l suppose?

619
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,226
-Bye.
-So long, my love.

620
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,372
Can l see you a minute, Frankie?

621
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,899
You and your mates knock off me
some more knives and forks?

622
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,613
Well, whatcha got?

623
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:12,129
-What is it, Steve?
-Dunno. l found it somewhere.

624
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,960
l reckon it's worth some fink.

625
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:20,504
-Hot, Steve?
-Dunno. l just found it somewhere.

626
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,873
-l think it's worth some fink.
-Not to me.

627
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,000
l wouldn't know
what to do with it.

628
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,911
A Fiver, Frankie?

629
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:30,780
lt's not worth it. l wouldn't
know how to shift it.

630
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,113
lt'd be a liability to me,
a worry, Steve.

631
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,754
Ugly little thing,
isn't it?

632
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:41,554
-A coupla quid, Frankie?
-l'd like to help, but no thanks.

633
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:46,897
l'll give you a good price if you can
knock off some more silverware.

634
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,865
Yah, l know, Frankie.

635
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,492
Thanks.

636
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,043
Look how he is.

637
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,850
-What you have?
-lt's nothing.

638
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,856
-lt's worth nothing.
-Bad guy.

639
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,647
Piece of crap. Steve.

640
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,474
lt's okay.
Come on in.

641
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:40,876
Could you leave some of those
bath salts? We've run out.

642
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:51,554
Bath salt's one of the good things
about staying in hotels.

643
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:54,022
Bath salts and free shampoo.

644
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,296
l do like it when they leave
the chocolate...

645
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,892
covered in gold foil with a little
message saying 'sleep well'.

646
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,867
You married?

647
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,612
lt doesn't matter.

648
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,341
You got a man?

649
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,322
You ever feel like it's gonna be over,
and you don't know what you feel...

650
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,850
if it's good or bad
or just frightening?

651
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,356
Or maybe you got kids,
though.

652
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:43,267
ls it better or worse...
or just more crowded?

653
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,716
The bath salts, remember?

654
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:16,773
Mother, l'd love to hear more but
l'm not gonna be able to make it.

655
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,537
The magazine. l just got
more work to do.

656
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,747
So what if he's 47?
47's not too young.

657
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,647
You could pass for 47.

658
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:31,110
He's ltalian? l'll call you
in the morning, okay?

659
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:53,610
ls it alright? lt's the best l could
do on such short notice.

660
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,613
lf you'd given me warning, l could've
cooked. l'm a good cook.

661
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,014
The eggs are great.
How long have you lived here?

662
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,086
Since college.

663
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,688
My mother married an Englishman.
The Major.

664
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,858
So, l came over one summer
and never left.

665
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:13,261
Partly because the Major died and
partly because of other reasons.

666
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,232
The boyfriends.

667
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,169
l meant how long have you
lived in this apartment?

668
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,771
Oh, l thought you meant
in England.

669
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:26,333
-l did. l 'm just teasing.
-Jake.

670
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,413
How come you don't have
anywhere to live?

671
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:34,984
My family has a house,
but my parents live there.

672
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:38,721
l don't go there very often.
l like to travel around.

673
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,290
Does Tina like it, too?

674
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,659
So far. Although l'm beginning to
think not so much anymore.

675
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,792
Women are different.

676
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,126
l'd sure be happy to travel
anywhere and see the world.

677
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,972
That's not an offer, though.

678
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,007
Why not?

679
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:03,206
-Well, Tina's my friend.
-That's where your loyalties lie?

680
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,483
That's the way it should be.

681
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,919
Girls sticking together,
and whatever?

682
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,821
Safer that way.

683
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:15,484
l don't know that there is
any safety, really.

684
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,487
You don't want any of
this rice, do you?

685
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,308
l'll get some coffee.

686
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,445
<i>lt's been a really wet day</i>
<i>in most parts the country.</i>

687
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:39,115
<i>lt does look as if this weather's</i>
<i>gonna continue for the next few days.</i>

688
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,986
<i>So a lot more rain.</i>
-More rain.

689
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,954
<i>Here's a list of today's</i>
<i>rainfall amounts...</i>

690
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,445
<i>and you can see London</i>
<i>topping the lead there.</i>

691
00:58:55,164 --> 00:59:01,104
-Don't answer it.
-lt might be important.

692
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,197
Not as important as this.

693
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,003
lt'll only take a second.

694
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,638
Who's this? Tina?

695
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,146
Not yet, huh?

696
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,820
l wish l could help,
but l can't.

697
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:33,464
No, tonight's not a good idea.
l'm in bed and l'm half asleep.

698
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,570
Lunch. That's great.

699
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,475
l'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

700
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,538
Hi, Tina.

701
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,376
Hi, Jonathan.
Your beard looks swell.

702
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,900
Can l come in?

703
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:57,754
-ls Larry here?
-Yes, he's here, upstairs.

704
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:01,991
He's going to Tokyo in the morning.
He's got a cold so he went to bed early.

705
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,329
-You want to see him?
-Sort of. That's why l 'm here.

706
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,433
Upstairs.
Second door on the left.

707
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,596
Hi, Melissa.
You're looking great.

708
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,729
What is she doing here?

709
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,703
God knows.

710
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,440
lt's me.

711
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,749
Can l come in?

712
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,311
You're in.

713
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,359
Sit down.

714
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,568
What's up?

715
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:50,873
l'm sorry for everything that's
happened. l just want you to know that.

716
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,911
l'm glad to know you're consistent.
You said that two years ago.

717
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,903
-What's up?
-l need your help.

718
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:04,381
Why?

719
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,324
My mother's sick.

720
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,960
She needs some money
for an operation.

721
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,029
What kind of operation?

722
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,430
Brain.

723
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,701
There's something wrong with her
brain and she needs an operation.

724
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:22,071
-Where's she having it done?
-On her brain.

725
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,908
Tina, where? What hospital?
Pensacola?

726
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:30,279
Pensacola, probably.
We just don't know yet.

727
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:34,517
What'll it cost, this operation
on your mother's brain?

728
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:38,817
50 thousand dollars
or so...

729
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,494
What are you doing?

730
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,431
l've got a headache and
l'm looking for aspirin.

731
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,233
ln the bathroom.

732
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,225
No, l already looked there.
l couldn't see any.

733
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,373
What are you doing,
going through my things?

734
01:02:57,373 --> 01:03:01,366
l've got a splitting headache,
and l'm not thinking straight.

735
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:21,264
lf you don't want to give
money for my mother directly...

736
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,966
would you consider buying back...

737
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,236
that little Henry Moore?

738
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,238
That was an anniversary
present.

739
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:34,835
l know. And l cherish it.
But, for my mother.

740
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,679
That's alright,
if you want me to.

741
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:55,259
There is one little problem.

742
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,934
And what's the little problem?

743
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,102
lt's been stolen.

744
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:04,307
You want me to give you $50,000 for
a little head which you don't have?

745
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,241
Well, we're looking for it.

746
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,235
Have you been drinking?

747
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,944
Only a little bit.

748
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,682
l used to love you, Tina.

749
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,348
l used to love you, too, Larry.

750
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,360
l don't love you anymore, Tina.

751
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,000
l don't know
what l feel anymore.

752
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,000
You're not in love with Jake?

753
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,702
Yes, l'm in love with Jake.

754
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,514
Then l can't help you.

755
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,548
Sorry.

756
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,188
They're in the bathroom.

757
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,133
l don't know how l didn't see them.

758
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:22,345
Boy, those are terrific pills.
l feel much better already.

759
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,955
You're a terrific girl. This is just
between you and me, right?

760
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,626
Are you a shit, Jake?

761
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,897
l don't think so.

762
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,607
Sometimes, yeah.

763
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,982
l'm sorry.

764
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,321
l'm sorry.

765
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,999
You're a terrific guy.

766
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,405
This is between you and me,
right?

767
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,423
Hi, Mom. lt's Jake. Yeah.
How are you?

768
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,892
No, l'm in London. Well,
after two o'clock here.

769
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:15,524
l know. lt's been a while.
Yeah, l'm happy. Very well.

770
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:21,303
You don't have to worry
about me, Morn.

771
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:25,307
Are you okay?

772
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,740
Oh, you just had dinner.

773
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:30,679
Well, it sounds like
you just had dinner.

774
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,171
A vodka dinner or a gin dinner?
Let me see.

775
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,720
She's fine, thanks.
She's very well.

776
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,723
Tina. Tina.

777
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,959
She's a nice girl, Mom.
You'd like her.

778
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:49,465
l don't know.
l guess we're just not ready.

779
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:53,903
l need to talk to Dad.
ls he there?

780
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,565
l don't know why he wouldn't be.

781
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:13,055
Dad? Hello, sir. How are you?
l was just calling.

782
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:19,328
l knew your birthday was coming up
and l found this new shirt shop...

783
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:22,932
l know you've got plenty of shirts.
l thought you might like one of these.

784
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:29,271
l wanted to check your size.
Sixteen-and-a-half, thirty-six.

785
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,807
How's business?

786
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,009
Mine?

787
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:38,173
lt's going very well.
Good... l wanted to...

788
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,373
see to...

789
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,751
ls Mom alright?

790
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,723
No, it just sounded like
she just had dinner.

791
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:59,933
Sixteen-and-a-half,
thirty-six. l see. Bye.

792
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,876
Tina, how can you have
anything left?

793
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,679
You told me you just
had half a hamburger.

794
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,082
And a bucket of martinis
and bottle of champagne.

795
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,918
Tina, you gotta get that
for me, okay, sweetie...

796
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,754
'Cause l absolutely
cannot talk to him.

797
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,949
Except if it's that
insurance guy.

798
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,692
l can't.

799
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,262
Hello.
Mr. Mercer, the Manager.

800
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,698
l 'm sorry. He's out.

801
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,068
Thanks. Tina, we are in real
trouble now.

802
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:11,874
l want you to swear that you don't know
where that goddamn statue is.

803
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,511
Tina, l will sign a piece of...
this has writing on it...

804
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,747
but l would sign a piece of
paper giving you its value...

805
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,682
when the cocoa comes in.
Tina, you have to trust me.

806
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:27,690
Listen, l wanna get engaged.
That will make you trust me.

807
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,825
And then marry, maybe, someday.

808
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:34,230
lf anything, l mean, children.
There's a Valium here.

809
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,165
lrwin, after your father.

810
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:37,723
Tina, Jr.

811
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:44,773
Children, a house maybe somewhere.
A dog, like whatever kind that is.

812
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,502
What do you say?

813
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,568
l've gotta get sick again.

814
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,794
Okay, let's see. Onions, celery...

815
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:26,409
Yeah, l know, usually 10%,
but 10% of what?

816
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,084
Yeah, l know you're not supposed
to tell me.

817
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:35,824
10% of what?
10% of 20 Grand?

818
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,224
Approximate, is it?

819
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,196
But somewhere in the neighborhood
of two thousand quid.

820
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,656
Water's trouble, isn't it?

821
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,783
lf you're drowning, it is.

822
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,597
No, l mean in dreams.

823
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,258
l'm not a dream expert.

824
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:24,106
All the dreams l've been having these
days have been full of water.

825
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:29,678
Colored water, green water,
red water.

826
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,381
Are you sure it's water
and not alcohol?

827
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:37,453
l only drink to be happy,
or if l'm a little worried..

828
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:42,057
or to celebrate,
or something's wrong.

829
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,652
-You should try it.
-l don't know that it would help.

830
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,933
lt could help your card game.
lt would make you looser.

831
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,901
Oh, l was loose enough.

832
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,028
Staying up all hours of the night...

833
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,277
and not winning anything.

834
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,802
Oh, l broke even, more or less.

835
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:13,288
-Do you have any cash?
-No, l don't, damn it.

836
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:15,190
Maybe l can get some
from Joan at lunch.

837
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,192
No.

838
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,990
-Why?
-Bad for credit.

839
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,802
What are we gonna do, Jake?

840
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,902
Tina...

841
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,647
You can cut loose,
if you want to.

842
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:48,022
l'm not in it only
for the good times.

843
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,462
lf we get it back...

844
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,396
we can sell it...

845
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,758
-You don't have it, do you?
-No.

846
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,303
lt's all gotten so distorted.

847
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,913
When you think,
where l come from...

848
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,316
$50,000 would keep 5 families
for a year.

849
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,589
Would you call it greed?

850
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:28,697
-Would l call what greed?
-What's been comin' between us.

851
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,665
No.

852
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:35,103
l'd call it...

853
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,695
fear.

854
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:10,169
l don't know where it is.
l don't even know if it was up here.

855
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:15,768
l don't know where it be gone.

856
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:20,373
lt could be anywhere.

857
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,241
-Hello, Jake.
-Hello, Gordon.

858
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:03,325
-Longish time no see.
-Longish time no see.

859
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,460
Those cuff links are nice.

860
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,899
Those? Those are
Van Cleef, 1938. Signed.

861
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,303
-How much?
-5,000 Pounds.

862
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,873
Oh, not at the moment, thanks.
l was thinking about...

863
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:21,543
selling my Cartier and getting
a different one, a pre-war.

864
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,178
What would you give me for it?

865
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,146
Take it off, Jake.
Let me have a look.

866
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,857
lt's real.

867
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:47,500
-2,500.
-3,000.

868
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,374
Okay, 3,000.
You want a check?

869
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,843
Check or cash. l'm easy.

870
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,979
Cash.

871
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,708
Alright, cash.

872
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,651
46 Pounds, 80 P.

873
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:39,721
46 Pounds, 80 P?
What's the joke?

874
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:43,225
Remember, Jake,
longish time no see.

875
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:46,628
That girl you were going out with,
the German girl.

876
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:50,499
What German girl?
Oh, yeah, the... yeah.

877
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:55,070
-What, that bracelet? l paid you.
-No, sorry, you didn't.

878
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,305
You sent me a note
saying it was coming.

879
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:01,443
No, l paid you! Canadian dollars.
She told me she brought you the money.

880
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:05,981
She bought a Lalique vanity set.

881
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,573
You're kidding.

882
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:15,924
-Eva. Very good taste. You remember?
-Yeah. Very good taste.

883
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,627
You want 46.80, or shall l
just credit it to you?

884
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,790
No, l'll take it.
Cab fare's cab fare.

885
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,486
Stop it! Stop it!
l didn't do nothing!

886
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,762
You got it back, didn't ya?!

887
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,286
Stop it!

888
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,337
Deaf kid.

889
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,343
Oh, don't cry.

890
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:29,324
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-lt is?

891
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,593
You've got everything anyone
could possibly wants.

892
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,728
l have?

893
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:37,425
Except too much alcohol in
your bloodstream.

894
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,935
You know...

895
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:44,673
l am 31 years old...

896
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,909
and l was married to a man
who l didn't love enough...

897
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:52,247
who l thought would take care of me.
Now l'm in love with a man...

898
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,883
who can't take care
of either of us...

899
01:20:54,883 --> 01:21:01,022
and l am so weak l don't know what
l'd do if we split up.

900
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:06,551
l have no confidence
and l want a baby.

901
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,166
Oh, that' s not true.

902
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:15,694
See, l'm a liar, too.
l've lied you, my dearest friend.

903
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:19,608
l should want one,
but l hate them.

904
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:24,112
l hate children, too.
What can l do?

905
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:29,751
l hate children, l lie
and my looks are going.

906
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,152
What can l do?

907
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,689
-Lots of things.
-Yeah? Like what?

908
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,626
lf Jake and l split up?

909
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:41,630
-l thought you two were very happy.
-On good days.

910
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,266
But these are bad days.

911
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,935
Jake was out late last night.

912
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,199
He said he was out
playing cards.

913
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,910
Out with some tramp probably.

914
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,380
First time, too, as far as l know.

915
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,950
Maybe he wasn't out with a tramp.
Maybe he was telling the truth.

916
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,618
Oh, what does it matter?

917
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:06,348
What is one fuck
with a tramp anyway?

918
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:14,863
Why don't you try and relax
and get some sleep?

919
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,165
l'll wake you up.

920
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,901
You're terrific.

921
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:23,359
l just need some sleep. l didn't
sleep well last night.

922
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,239
l'll see you later, honey, okay?

923
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,643
Tina?

924
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,142
Tina?

925
01:22:56,271 --> 01:23:01,309
Jake Bartholemew,
dead tonight, age 35.

926
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,878
Film at eleven.

927
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,114
Best known for his wit...

928
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,616
wardrobe and business
acumen...

929
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:12,721
Bartholemew died penniless
and without watch...

930
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:16,591
in an overpriced linen hotel room
which he could not afford.

931
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:22,697
He is survived by Tina Lesley Oates,
who is quoted as saying...

932
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:26,334
'He's dead,
but l'm still hungry.'

933
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:31,106
At the request of the deceased, his
remains will be dumped into the ocean...

934
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:35,744
along with his latest screwed
up business investment.

935
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,838
And now, sports.

936
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,324
-Where is she?
-ln the bedroom.

937
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,560
She's really not feeling well.

938
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,638
-Tina?
-What is it, Jake?

939
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,474
-Come on. Let's go.
-Careful. l feel sick.

940
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:14,339
Your little Henry Moore is back.

941
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:19,347
-lt's back? Where from?
-l don't know, but it's back.

942
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:21,382
-Tina, we're rich again.
-You're kidding?

943
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:25,053
l mean, we're not broke.
We're liquid.

944
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:28,523
We're not broke?
We're liquid?

945
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:29,757
Joanie

946
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,657
Do you have any champagne?

947
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,063
Where is it?

948
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,435
Get it...

949
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:18,306
or l'll break every bone...

950
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:20,774
in his body.

951
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:28,109
Baby, l want you to call
Mr. Mercer for me.

952
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,245
lt's kinda early
in the morning, Jake.

953
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,907
This is a call he'll wanna get.

954
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,925
Mr. Mercer... please?

955
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,739
Hello. Mercer here.

956
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:01,442
Mr. Bartholemew would
like to speak with you.

957
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:05,113
-Goddamn it!
-Jake?

958
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,748
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

959
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:10,285
He's attending to some other business
and he will return your call.

960
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,054
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

961
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:14,988
What's the matter?

962
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:19,293
-lt's been stolen.
-Again?

963
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,337
lt's not quite so simple,
Mr. Sedgewick.

964
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:34,275
l'm not saying l've got it.
l might know where it might be.

965
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:38,746
The Ad says 'subject
to the usual conditions.'

966
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,349
That's arrest and recovery.

967
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:44,409
We want two heads.
Only one of them's bronze.

968
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:50,758
Do you think that
at one time or another...

969
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:54,796
all great men throughout history
thought of killing themselves?

970
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,631
Sure.

971
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,933
What do you think stopped them?

972
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:03,638
-l don't know. Chicken?
-No.

973
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:09,944
Their perception that there will be
terrible crises to overcome...

974
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:17,452
and once you know that, it's just
your own personal terrible jam...

975
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:20,888
You have to change your direction
the arrow is pointing.

976
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:25,493
That is what adversity is for.
lt's there to help you.

977
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,696
But, you have to have the courage.

978
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:33,468
l believe kept the great men
throughout history

979
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,637
from drinking the bottle
of Liquid Plumber.

980
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:40,975
-But being smart helps. And rich.
-Smart helps.

981
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:43,277
Rich is arguably better
than courage...

982
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,646
though l don't know if
l still have that opinion.

983
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:50,351
At any rate, one day l'll have
a farm and raise cows.

984
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:54,422
That would take courage.
You hate the country.

985
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:58,559
l'd learn. l don't much
like all this anymore.

986
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:02,063
There's nothing in my life
worth sticking to.

987
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,930
But l'm young.
Perhaps l could change.

988
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,468
-l have a calling.
-A calling?

989
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:15,009
Brain surgeon, botanist,
doctor, lawyer.

990
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:17,278
Sculptor.

991
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,813
l have no talent.

992
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:24,786
You're good at numbers. Usually.

993
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,854
You're good at helping me
choose clothes.

994
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:28,583
You're talented in bed.

995
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:31,625
That's something.

996
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:50,401
And me?

997
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,378
Me?

998
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,246
Am l worth sticking to?

999
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,753
Am l?

1000
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,994
As far as l'm concerned...

1001
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,163
even though
you're not a biologist.

1002
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,032
Botanist.

1003
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:14,661
-Or sculpture.
-Sculptor.

1004
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,509
l love you.

1005
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,238
Likewise.

1006
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:36,657
-Steve Finn?
-That's right.

1007
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:40,595
My name is Martin Slaughter and l
work for an lnsurance company.

1008
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,630
Excuse me.

1009
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,232
A bronze statue
has been stolen...

1010
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,632
and l think you know
something about it.

1011
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:52,797
l don't know nothing.

1012
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:57,376
Jenny Finn?

1013
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,475
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1014
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:09,290
A valuable statue has been stolen.
lt's been recovered...

1015
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:13,494
but l think you or your sister
know something about it.

1016
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:16,230
-She could go to prison.
-Jenny didn't do nothing.

1017
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,665
You could go to Borstal
for a year or so...

1018
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:20,234
lt's got nothing to do with Jenny.

1019
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:23,871
-How'd you get that bruise?
-l don't remember.

1020
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,739
-Frankie Sedgewick hit you?
-l don't remember.

1021
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:35,708
Okay, tough guy

1022
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:39,921
l'll give you 10 seconds to tell me
what l want to know...

1023
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:43,057
otherwise l'll call the cops and you'll
be in a cell within the hour.

1024
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,492
-Now, come on.
-l don't know nothing.

1025
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:46,494
-One.
-l told you.

1026
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:47,929
-Two.
-l don't know nothing...

1027
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:50,364
-Your sister then.
-Nothing.

1028
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:51,933
-Four.
-l don't know nothing.

1029
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,701
-Busted.
-l don't know nothing!

1030
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,305
-Six.
-l don't know nothing.

1031
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:00,174
l don' t know nothing.
l don't know nothing.

1032
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:02,108
Just leave us alone.

1033
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,517
Okay, Steve. Knock it off.

1034
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,542
We'll stop it here, alright?

1035
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:17,985
You tell your sister don't go back
to the Hotel.

1036
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:31,438
l'll try and square it with them,
get in touch with whoever l can.

1037
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:37,433
Oh God, Steve, tell her
it'll be alright.

1038
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:40,740
But she'd better find
another job.

1039
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:54,161
-Why'd she do it?
-Christ knows.

1040
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:56,931
-To get money?
-Jenny doesn't care about money.

1041
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:59,365
-Why then?
-Christ knows.

1042
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:06,903
Why?

1043
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:11,001
Why?

1044
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,261
What's it say?

1045
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:40,407
lt says: 'Because it spoke, l know l heard it.'

1046
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:47,009
l'll try to square it.
You tell her.

1047
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:03,731
Don't be scared. lt'll be okay.

1048
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:07,792
One day, l will be able
to look after us.

1049
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,193
Head on bone base.
Bronze by Henry Moore.

1050
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:35,526
One of a series of nine.
Original mold destroyed.

1051
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:39,266
-Thanks.
-For what?

1052
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:42,436
For letting us do this.

1053
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:46,407
15,500.
16,000.

1054
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:49,570
16,500.
17,000.

1055
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,048
17,000 Pounds.

1056
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:58,542
-lt's for 17...17,500.
-Are you insane?

1057
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:03,657
18,000. 19,000.

1058
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:06,393
20,000. 21,000.

1059
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,997
22,000. 23,000. 24,000.

1060
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:17,335
27. 27,000 Pounds.
advance on 27,000 Pounds?

1061
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:23,010
28,000 Pounds.

1062
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,646
28,000 Pounds...

1063
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:29,377
To the gentleman
with the rose in his lapel.

1064
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:48,335
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
number 35.

1065
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,599
A portrait by Christopher

1066
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:53,871
What am l bid?

1067
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,986
Maybe we should buy
our own kitchen...

1068
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:10,457
get our own icebox, make our
own cold drinks.

1069
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:13,294
Just a kitchen?

1070
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,629
lt's a start.

1071
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:18,223
There aren't many just
kitchens on the market.

1072
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,736
-Well, maybe a bedroom, too.
-Where?

1073
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:25,606
-Anywhere.
-Anywhere?

1074
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:27,608
Not New Jersey.

1075
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:29,677
Not Pensacola, either.

1076
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:33,514
Enrico. Enrico.
Come to eat.

1077
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,778
l wouldn't finish yet.

1078
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:40,345
Ome minute more.

1079
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,426
What would it be like
if he were ours?

1080
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,266
We'd have to learn ltalian?

1081
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,063
Jake.

1082
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,361
ls this a serious
discussion, Tina?

1083
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,665
l guess not.

1084
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:06,113
lt's an interesting thought,
though.

1085
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:08,415
lt is an interesting thought.

1086
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:11,118
Why don't we go up to
our room...

1087
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:15,452
order some lunch
and pursue that thought?

1088
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,753
l'm scared.

1089
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:30,829
Everyone's scared of their
own special things, Tina.

1090
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:35,776
Walk down the beach,
ask these people...

1091
01:38:35,776 --> 01:38:38,312
if they're scared of cocoa
and they'll tell you no.

1092
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:41,338
But, to some people,
cocoa's very scarey.

1093
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:48,088
As far as l know, you've never been
scared when we've made love.

1094
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,457
l mean, except that time
on the airplane.

1095
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:53,324
That was because
it was so bumpy.
