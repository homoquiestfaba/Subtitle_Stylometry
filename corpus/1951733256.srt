1
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,233
Thie is the story
of a time long ago.

2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,100
A time of myth and legend,

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
when the earth
was still young.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,700
The ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,900
and they played mankind
for their sport.

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Aaaagh!

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,700
Plaguing them with suffering,

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,500
besieging them with terrors.

9
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
( Laughing )

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,500
For centuries, the people
had nowhere to turn,

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
no one to look to for help.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,700
Until... he arrived.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,500
He was man
like no other.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
Born of a beautiful
mortal woman,

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,900
but fathered by Zeus,
king of the gods.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,700
Hercules possessed  strength
the world had never seen,

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,500
But everywhere he went he was
tormented by his stepmother,

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,133
Hera, the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

20
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,333
Hera's eternal obsession
was to destroy Hercules,

21
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:43,733
for he was the constant
living reminder of Zeus' infidelity.

22
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,533
No matter the obstacle,

23
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,933
as long as there were people
crying for help,

24
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:12,933
there was one man
who would never rest:

25
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,933
Hercules.

26
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,967
Pithus.

27
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,967
- Let's turn back.
- No.

28
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,767
Somebody's got to make it through.
Somebody's got to bring back help.

29
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:04,567
It's no use. Think how many men our village
has sent. None of them ever made it.

30
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,167
I'm with Lethan.
We should go back.

31
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,767
Back to what?
A life of fear? Under siege?

32
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,367
At least we're living.

33
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,167
No. We're gonna make it through.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
- ( Distant Animal Roaring )
- What was that?

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
What was what?

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,800
( Sighing )
I guess it was nothing.

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,400
( Distant Animal Sounding )

38
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,433
What are you?
Show yourselves.

39
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,233
They're all around us.

40
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,193
Aaaargh!

41
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,193
Aaaargh!

42
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,233
( Screaming Continues )

43
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,833
Lethan!
I think he's dead!

44
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,313
No.
Aargh!

45
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,233
Pithus! Pithus!

46
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,833
Come on, llus, kick!

47
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,833
- ( Screaming )
- Come on, kick! Fight it, fight it!

48
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:55,033
Pithus! ( Screaming )
My legs!

49
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:59,033
( Screaming Continues )
Run! Run!

50
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,473
Run! Run!
Go!

51
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:24,747
Hey!

52
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,067
- Can I play?
- You can't!

53
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:31,667
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's a boy's game.

54
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:36,467
Now, give us back our ball
and go play with a doll.

55
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,867
He's right, Lilia. Now come
and help me wash your father's feet.

56
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,267
You wanted to know
when he got here, right?

57
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:00,867
Well, he's coming
up the street right now.

58
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:22,067
MAN: One day only!
One day only!

59
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:37,707
Aaargh!

60
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,267
Hey, wait, listen.

61
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,867
It's bad luck for the best man
to kill the groon before the wedding.

62
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,667
All right. I'll wait
'til after the wedding.

63
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,067
( Grunting )

64
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,867
( Laughing )

65
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,867
It's good to see you, Hercules.
You look great.

66
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,267
You too, Iolaus.
And congratulations.

67
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,867
Come have a drink.
Help me celebrate.

68
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,267
Sorry. I have to get to my mother's
house. She'll be worrying.

69
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,867
Why don't you walk with me?
We can get caught up.

70
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,867
( Laughing )

71
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,667
Hercules.

72
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,667
HERCULES: It's been a while, my friend.

73
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,867
IOLAUS: I'm surprised you survived
this last one without me at your back.

74
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,267
( Laughing )
It's not the same without you.

75
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,667
I'm glad you could
make it home, Hercules.

76
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,467
I hope the rest of the world can get by
without you for a week or so.

77
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,667
Are you kidding? Nothing's
gonna keep me from your wedding.

78
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,267
You know, when I got the news,
I couldn't believe it.

79
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:13,267
Now, seeing you...
I still can't believe it.

80
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,617
Hmmm.

81
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:20,467
You'll be giving up a lot, Iolaus.
Have you thought about that?

82
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,867
You make it sound like I'm falling off
the edge of the earth.

83
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,267
No, no.
Not at all. Who knows?

84
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,467
I'll probably get a wife
or two myself someday.

85
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,267
So, who is this girl?
Is she pretty?

86
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,867
Ania.
Yeah, she's very pretty.

87
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,867
I could sit and
look at her all day.

88
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:40,867
- Look at her?
- Yeah. She's, you know, beautiful.

89
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:44,067
Well, you'll eat better
once you have a wife to cook for you.

90
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,467
Actually, Ania's
not much of a cook.

91
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,667
- How bad?
- Really bad.

92
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,467
Well, at least you'll have someone
to look after your livestock.

93
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,467
You won't have to pay
a foreman who steals you blind.

94
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,867
- Well--
- She's not good with animals, either?

95
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,867
No. They're scared
to death of her.

96
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,067
Ha! She can't cook,
she's not good with animals.

97
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:04,467
Can she at least sew you
some better clothes?

98
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:06,867
Nope, can't sew a stitch.
Don't even ask what I paid for her.

99
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,867
- What did you pay for her?
- Seven cows, three goats, eleven chickens.

100
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,867
- Eleven chickens!
- ( Laughing ) Yeah, I know.

101
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:16,467
But she's got this little mole, right here.
Drives me crazy. What can I tell you?

102
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,667
You can tell me what happened
to the Iolaus I used to know.

103
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,067
Well, love happened to me,
Hercules.

104
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,867
- Oh.
- I don't expect you to understand it.

105
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,867
I can hardly understand it myself.

106
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,467
Are you really willing to give up
your whole life for a woman?

107
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,867
( Laughing )
Someday, Hercules,

108
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:36,867
you're going to meet
a woman unlike any other.

109
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,667
Then you'll know
what I'm talking about.

110
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,067
Me? Never.

111
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,867
- ( Faint Whimpering )
- Iolaus, do you hear that?

112
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,867
( Whimpering Continues )

113
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:06,067
Hey, there. What's the matter?
What are all these tears about?

114
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,867
The monster killed my father.

115
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:13,267
We were praying to the goddess,
and a monster came and ate him.

116
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,867
And after he ate him,
he spit out all his bones.

117
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,267
So, a monster
did all this, huh?

118
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,667
- Why don't you tell me about him?
- He's big and ugly.

119
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,667
He eats you. He's never full.
He's always hungry.

120
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:30,867
No one can get by him. I bet
not even Hercules could get by him.

121
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:34,867
Well, Hercules has the heart
of a rabbit compared to me.

122
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,667
Now, where's
this terrible monster?

123
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,467
I don't want it to hear me.

124
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:44,067
That's a good idea.
Monsters have excellent hearing.

125
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,467
- ( Laughing )
- Hercules.

126
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,667
Are you all right?

127
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:03,267
What is it?
What's it doing?

128
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,867
I don't know.

129
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,867
But I've got a feelin'
it's gonna be ugly.

130
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:16,867
( Growling, Hissing )

131
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,867
Don't, Iolaus.

132
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,667
Don't provoke it.

133
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,467
- ( Roaring )
- What are you doing?

134
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,467
( Roaring Continues )

135
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:32,067
( Roaring Continues )

136
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,467
- Look out!
- Aaaargh!

137
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,467
Come on.

138
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,867
( Roaring Continues )

139
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,867
( Roaring Slowly Fading )

140
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,667
Come on, let's get
out of here.

141
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,667
- This thing stinks.
- Yeah.

142
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,067
- What the hell was that?
- Ania the day after you marry her.

143
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,467
- Hey!
- ( Growling )

144
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,467
( Roaring )

145
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,867
( Hercules Shouting )

146
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,267
Iolaus, grab that torch.

147
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,267
- But the gods, they'll be angry.
- Just get it!

148
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,867
( Panting )

149
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,467
( Screaming )

150
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,067
IOLAUS: Help me!

151
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,067
Iolaus, the torch.

152
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,867
Quick, give it to me.

153
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,267
( Roaring Weakens )

154
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:24,467
What was that? If you cut off its head,
the thing grows another one.

155
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:26,867
And another one!

156
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,667
Hera. I should have known
she was behind this.

157
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,867
- You think so?
- I know so.

158
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:46,067
Hercules, don't do it.

159
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,867
Are you crazy?
She's the queen of the gods!

160
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,467
Take a lesson, Iolaus.

161
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,067
She's a pertect example of what happens
when a woman gets too much power.

162
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:16,467
Well, here we are, Hercules.
Some places never change.

163
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:20,067
The thing I never forget
about my mother's house us her flowers

164
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,067
I always thought
they smelled like her.

165
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:24,067
Yeah, yeah.
( Chuckling )

166
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,067
( Shrieking )

167
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,067
Hercules, put me down!

168
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,867
Oh, oh, it's so
good to see you.

169
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:48,867
What happened? You're hurt.
Did you get in a fight?

170
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,867
I'm just in the door,
and you're already worrying.

171
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:56,067
I always worry about you, hercules.
It's a constant, sweet ache called motherhood.

172
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:59,267
Congratulations, Iolaus.

173
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,467
- I think marriage will be good for you.
- Thank you I think so too.

174
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,867
Ania's sure a beautiful girl.

175
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,267
Yes, she is. I ought
to be getting back to her.

176
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,467
Oh, I almost forgot. Ania told me
to invite you both over tonight.

177
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,067
She... wants to make dinner.

178
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,067
- Oh!
- Mmm.

179
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,267
A dinner would be lovely.

180
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,867
Good. Then I'll see
you both tonight.

181
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,867
Uh-huh.

182
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:26,067
Sit down.
Let me wash your feet.

183
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,867
- I brought something for you.
- Oh? What is it?

184
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,267
A present.

185
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,067
- Spices from Alturia.
- ( Laughing )

186
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:37,267
- I thought you might like them for your cooking.
- How very sweet.

187
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:42,867
So, are you going to tell me
how you got that cut of not?

188
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,667
I met a kid on the road.

189
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,067
She turned into a "thing."
It was completely unprovoked.

190
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,867
Another one
of Hera's creations, no doubt.

191
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,067
That bitch!

192
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,667
I wish my father would find a way
to do something about her.

193
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,267
Has he been around much?

194
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,067
- Who? Zeus?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,067
From time to time.

196
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:10,867
Mother, if he ever starts talking
about moving in here with you--

197
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:16,067
Hercules, he gave me a son, the son
of a god. I'm happy with that.

198
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,867
It doesn't bother me
that he was never around.

199
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:22,067
In fact, it was probably
better that way.

200
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,067
Why don't I see what I can do
for that wound?

201
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,267
( Whooshing Sound )

202
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,267
She's always saying
those things, ha, ha,

203
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:34,067
but deep inside...
she's still crazy about me.

204
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:37,267
I should have known
you'd show up now.

205
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,667
Where were you when I was battling that
beast of Hera's a little while ago?

206
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:44,467
- We barely came through it.
- Aha, but you did. You always do.

207
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:48,067
I thought you were gonna talk to her,
get her off my back. She is your wife.

208
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,867
I tried,
but Hera's a woman.

209
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:54,867
And there's no changing a woman
that doesn't want to be changed.

210
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,067
I've found it best
to stay out of her way...

211
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:01,267
and find my amusements...
elsewhere.

212
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:05,267
Is that what you're here for?
To give me advice about women?

213
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:10,467
No, I'm here to see how
my favorite son is doing.

214
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,267
Well, I'm doing great.
Thank you for asking.

215
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,867
Especially now that
I'm back home.

216
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:22,067
I've got to tell you
I'm very proud of you.

217
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:26,467
Your name's become a legend.
Everywhere I go,

218
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,867
people are talking
about you.

219
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:33,267
I have to admit I haven't
been a very good father,

220
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:36,067
but you're...

221
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:36,867
a wonderful son.

222
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,667
Uh, where's your mother?

223
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,067
Oh, no, no.
You leave her alone.

224
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:51,267
- What're you talking about?
- You know. She's not one of your amusements.

225
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,867
I just want to say hello.

226
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,067
How are you?

227
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:02,067
You-- you look wonderful.

228
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,267
You haven't changed,
either.

229
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,667
Oh, come on, I'm--

230
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,067
Uh, would you care
to join us for a meal?

231
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:16,067
Um, no,
I don't think I can.

232
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:18,467
I have an appointment,
and I just came by to see...

233
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,067
how my boy was doing.
He's doing fine.

234
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:27,267
And you're as beautiful
as ever.

235
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,467
- ( Banging )
- Ooh!

236
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:41,667
Hey, there, pretty one.
Why don't you stick around?

237
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,267
( Laughing )

238
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,267
Too young for you,
anyway.

239
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:49,267
- Uuh!
- Oh! I'm sorry, I--

240
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,067
I hope they're
gonna like it,

241
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,467
because this is one
of my best recipes.

242
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:59,267
- I'm sure it'll be great.
- Try it.

243
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:05,667
- And if it's not, that's okay.
- But I want them to like me.

244
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,467
They're gonna like you.
They're gonna love you.

245
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,267
- I know I do.
- It's nice to know I'm marrying a smart man.

246
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,667
- You forgot good-looking.
- No, I didn't.

247
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,867
What's this?
A man in the kitchen?

248
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:19,267
Go on, get out
of here. Go on.

249
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:21,267
All right,
all right.

250
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,467
So, Hercules,
what do you think?

251
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:29,267
- I think there's a weird smell
coming from the kitchen. - No!

252
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:32,467
About Ania.
Isn't she great?

253
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:36,067
She's very pretty. I bet she'll give
you some good-looking sons.

254
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:40,067
Hercules! I made extra for you.
I hope you're hungry.

255
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,867
Mmm. This is, um... great!

256
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,867
- ( Gasping )
- Ania, what is it?

257
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,667
I saw somebody looking
in the window.

258
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,667
- ( Thudding )
- Oh!

259
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,667
Oooooh!

260
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,667
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry.

261
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:13,267
My name is Pithus.
I'm here to look for Hercules.

262
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,267
- I'm Hercules.
- Thank the gods.

263
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,667
I've searched the whole town
looking for you.

264
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,667
Now that you've found me?

265
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:24,867
It's my home, Gargarensia.
We're under attack.

266
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:28,067
- You have to help us.
- What kind of attack?

267
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,667
Beasts. Ferocious beasts that live
in the forest surrounding our village.

268
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:34,467
They come in the night,
attacking us as we sleep.

269
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,467
They steal our livestock,
destroy our crops.

270
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,867
- Can't your men fight them?
- We tried.

271
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:42,067
We sent out our best
warriors and hunters.

272
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:44,067
They never returned.

273
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,067
They were all killed?

274
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,467
We're just simple men left,
farmers and fishermen.

275
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,667
The beasts have turned us
into prisoners in our own village.

276
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:55,667
- How is it you were able to come here?
- By the luck of the gods.

277
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:59,667
Two others left with me.
They're dead now.

278
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,667
Please, Hercules.
They're about to attack again soon.

279
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,667
I wouldn't ask this
of you, but...

280
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,467
I don't know if my people
can survive this time.

281
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:12,067
- How far is it to Gargarensia?
- Two days' travel.

282
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:14,067
Get yourself
some food and some rest.

283
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,867
We'll leave tomorrow
at first light.

284
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:21,667
Thank you, Hercules.
May the gods smile on you.

285
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:26,067
Better they just
stay out of my life.

286
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:31,267
Sounds pretty bad.

287
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:34,067
I wonder what
we're up against?

288
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,867
We're not
up against anything.

289
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,067
Your adventure days are over.
You're getting married, remember?

290
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,067
That's a week away.

291
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:45,267
This'll be two days out, kill
a few horrible beasts, two days back.

292
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,667
- Still, I don't think--
- Come on.

293
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,067
It's our last
chance together.

294
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:55,667
Best friends, fighting,
back-to-back.

295
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,867
It'll make a great
wedding present, Hercules.

296
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:02,467
( Laughing )
All right.

297
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:04,867
Best friends,
back-to-back.

298
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:08,867
But what're you
gonna tell Ania?

299
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,667
Well, Hercules really
wants me to go.

300
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:16,467
He gave me this whole speech about "best
of friends," "last time," all of that.

301
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,467
So, you don't want to go?

302
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,467
- It's Hercules?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,467
He practically begged me.

304
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,267
I really wish
you weren't going.

305
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,667
I was hoping we'd have
more time this visit.

306
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,867
I know. I don't expect you to
understand, but... these people need me.

307
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,267
If I don't go,
it could mean their lives.

308
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:36,467
I do understand.
Just promise me you'll be careful.

309
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:40,067
- Always.
- ( Laughing )

310
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,067
They look so
wonderful together.

311
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,867
- Yeah, but she's changed him so much!
- ( Alcmene laughing )

312
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,267
Someday, Hercules, you'll find
a woman who'll do the same to you.

313
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,067
You sound
just like Iolaus.

314
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,467
I'm gonna miss you.

315
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,867
It's only
for a few days.

316
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:58,867
Besides, after next week
you're gonna be stuck with me forever.

317
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:01,667
Unless I marry somebody else
while you're gone.

318
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,867
- You'd do that?
- I might.

319
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:09,667
Well, you'll be setting
for second best.

320
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,867
You're never going to find anyone
who loves you as much as I do.

321
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,867
Are we going, or are we
just hanging around kissing the women?

322
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:24,867
Hercules, I'm counting on you
to make sure he gets back to marry me.

323
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,667
Oh, I'll have him back
in plenty of time.

324
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,667
Don't you worry.

325
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,467
Bye, Ania.

326
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,267
Gargarensia is just
beyond those mountains.

327
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:55,667
IOLAUS: Hey, Hercules.
I got a surprise for you.

328
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,867
- What is it?
- Ania made us some food for the road...

329
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,867
in case we got hungry.

330
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,067
( Together )
Pithus, did you eat yet?

331
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:06,867
( Laughing )

332
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,667
( Grunting )

333
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:16,067
( Grunting )

334
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:28,467
It's Pithus.
Hey, everyone! Pithus is back!

335
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:32,867
- Hey, everybody, I'm back.
- By the gods, I was sure he was dead.

336
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,867
This is Hercules.

337
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,667
I brought him back
to save Gargarensia.

338
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,067
Everybody, come on out!

339
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,867
Come on out, everyone.

340
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,667
It's Hercules, everybody.
He's come to help us!

341
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,067
MAN: Wonderful, wonderful.

342
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,467
Where's Franco?
Is Franco here?

343
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:55,267
Father, you made it.

344
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,667
Franco! Oooh!

345
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,067
Ha, ha, ha.

346
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,067
Look, I brought Hercules
to help us.

347
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:06,467
I've heard of you, hercules.
You're the strongest and bravest!

348
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:10,867
- Let me be your guide. I'll lead you to them.
- Franco, I don't think so.

349
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,867
Hercules already has a partner.

350
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:16,067
You know, there's something missing
in this town.

351
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:19,667
Pithus,
where are the women?

352
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,667
Well, um, they--

353
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,067
- Well, they--
- They were stolen by the beasts.

354
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,867
Yeah, Years and years ago.

355
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:30,867
- ( Crying )
- But he can't be more than a year old.

356
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,667
Sometimes babies are left
on the riverbank.

357
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,467
You mean they're abandoned?
Whose are they?

358
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,467
- They belong to us.
- But whose were they?

359
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:44,067
- We raise them as our own.
- Where do they come from?

360
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,467
I told you. They're
left on the riverbank.

361
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:53,267
Why do I get the feeling
we're not getting the whole story?

362
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:56,867
'Cause we're not. Look, have any
of you ever seen the beasts?

363
00:28:57,267 --> 00:29:00,067
- Mm-hmm.
- What do they look like?

364
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,067
The one I saw looked
like a wolf.

365
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,067
The one I saw had
a face of a bear.

366
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,467
The one I saw looked
more like a hawk.

367
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:13,667
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

368
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:18,867
But I have a feeling we'll find out as soon
as we meet these creatures face to face.

369
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,867
FRANCO: Good-bye, Hercules.
Good luck!

370
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:26,467
MAN: Good-bye, now.

371
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,867
MAN: Good-bye!

372
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,067
One thing's for sure, those men
are scared, every one of 'em.

373
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,267
- What about you?
- Me? What have I got to be scared of?

374
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,667
- Whatever's out there in those woods.
- Come on.

375
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,667
There's nothing anywhere
that can frighten me.

376
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,800
- Unless, of course, it's more of Ania's cooking.
- Hey!

377
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,200
So, Hercules. How come,
in all the years I've known you,

378
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
- I've never seen you carry a weapon?
- What do I need a weapon for?

379
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,033
Because... maybe
the other guy has one.

380
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,000
So let him carry it.

381
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
I let you do that.

382
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
( Laughing )

383
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,400
- So what do you think of "Iolaus Junior"?
- "Iolaus Junior"?

384
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Yeah. For my firstborn.

385
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
- What if it's a girl?
- No girls.

386
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,600
- Ania and I agreed. Five sons.
- All named Iolaus!

387
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I've gotta remember
them all, don't I?

388
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
( Laughing )

389
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Where are these beasts?

390
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
I hope we haven't come
all this way for nothing.

391
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,200
- Be patient. We'll find them.
- Yeah, yeah.

392
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,480
Hey!

393
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,000
What do you think?
Some kind of warning?

394
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Maybe it's just the way
these beasts have fun.

395
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
- ( Faint Animal Sound )
- Over there.

396
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Keep your eyes open, Iolaus.

397
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,533
They're watching us right now.
I can feel it.

398
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,533
Me too.

399
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,833
Well, Iolaus,
you wanted an adventure.

400
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,833
( Gasping )

401
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,033
( Choking )

402
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:57,033
- Where'd my sword go?
- Who needs a sword? Forget it.

403
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,433
- Yeah, thanks.
- Hold on.

404
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:11,433
- Be careful, Iolaus.
- No, be reckless. Careful dies, reckless kills.

405
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:13,833
Fantastic, aren't they?

406
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,843
Ow!

407
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:25,033
No, Iolaus.
Stay at my back.

408
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,833
Hercules!
It's a woman!

409
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,033
Iolaus!

410
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,233
Ugh!

411
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,033
We fought well,
you and me.

412
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:34,633
You're not going
to die, Iolaus.

413
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:37,033
You can't We said
we'd go out together.

414
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,033
Back-to-back heroes.

415
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,633
- I can't wait, Hercules.
- Iolaus, no.

416
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:50,233
Tell Ania how much I wanted
to be her husband.

417
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:56,233
Good-bye, my friend.
( Breathing Unevenly )

418
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:02,273
Iolaus.

419
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:11,033
No, stop.

420
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,033
The queen will want
to kill him.

421
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,433
The enemy may look insurmountable,
but he is just flesh and blood.

422
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:40,233
Use his strength to destroy him,
to defeat him.

423
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:43,833
His strength will be his weakness,
his pride his downfall.

424
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:48,233
We fight because we have to fight.
We fight for our way of life.

425
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,033
The day we do not fight
for who we are and what we can be...

426
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:55,033
is the day they take it away from us
again, as they always have before.

427
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:58,633
Now, that's a good one, Lysia.
I'll give you three goats...

428
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,633
and a wagon of hay for him.

429
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:05,833
- Not for sale. This one's going to the queen.
- Not the man. The horse!

430
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:31,433
My father used to chase
my mother with one of these.

431
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,233
No one chases me.

432
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:46,233
If you're looking for men, you won't
find any, not in the city of Amazons.

433
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:50,233
You're the only one. And I don't think
you'll last very long.

434
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm sure you're used
to having your way with women.

435
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,033
I bet they just fall at your feet
whereever you go. Well, not here!

436
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:14,233
- Here, you fall at our feet.
- Ugh!

437
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,233
So...

438
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:20,233
this is the great Hercules,
come to destroy us.

439
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,267
Wash her feet.

440
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,267
( Grunting )

441
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:38,267
You'd rather die than assume the role
of a woman, wouldn't you?

442
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:43,467
Women of Amazon,
this is Hercules,

443
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,267
champion of men.

444
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:49,867
He is the best the enemy has to offer,
and you've put him in chains.

445
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:52,267
Be proud of yourselves.

446
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:59,867
You don't know what to make
of us, do you, champion?

447
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:03,067
You've never been defeated before,
certainly not...

448
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,467
by a band of women.

449
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:11,867
If you only knew
how much pleasure this gives me.

450
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:18,667
Pleasure is the last thing
I'd give you, you murdering bitch!

451
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:21,467
There's not a question
of you giving it,

452
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,867
only whether or not
I want to take it.

453
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,667
Did you take pleasure
in killing Iolaus?

454
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,467
Sorry about your friend, but we have
every right to defend ourselves.

455
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:31,867
After all,
you came to destroy us.

456
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,267
- That's not true.
- What is? You were lost?

457
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,267
Two lost lambs,
wandering in the woods?

458
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,467
We were sent by the men
across the river.

459
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,067
And they sent you
to destroy us!

460
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:44,267
They sent us to destroy a beast.
We didn't know the beast was you.

461
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:49,067
Ah. They told you
we were beasts?

462
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:52,267
Still so stuffed with male pride
they had to lie to you.

463
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,467
From what I've seen
it wasn't a lie.

464
00:40:55,467 --> 00:41:00,267
We're not beasts, Hercules.

465
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,267
We are women.

466
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:04,307
Hardly.

467
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:09,867
Just because we're not the kind
of women you'd like us to be,

468
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,067
make no mistake,
these are women.

469
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:19,067
Women who will not
be controlled by men,

470
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:22,267
not beaten down,
not bought and sold like oxen.

471
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:25,067
Men will never
dominate these women.

472
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:28,667
We don't dominate you.
We protect you.

473
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:34,300
( Laughing )
Oh, I see. You protect us.

474
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Because you're weaker.

475
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Am I?
I don't think so.

476
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,700
You've got an advantage...
at the moment.

477
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Yes, I suppose I do.

478
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
What are you looking at,
Hercules?

479
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,500
Do you find me attractive?

480
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,300
My legs, my breasts,

481
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,660
my lips?

482
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,300
Your friend is dead,
I've got you in chains,

483
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,700
you hate me.

484
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,500
And yet you still
desire me.

485
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,300
You're pathetic.

486
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,700
There's no point in talking to you anymore.
You'll never understand what makes a woman.

487
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,500
You'll never understand
what makes a man.

488
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,700
You don't know
anything about me.

489
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Oh, but I do.

490
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,300
LYSIA: Come.

491
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,300
I'll show you. I'll show you exactly
what it is that makes a man.

492
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:00,300
Go back. Go back
and live your life again.

493
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,700
Let's see
who you really are.

494
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,700
( Crying )

495
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,133
( Crying )

496
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:35,067
Now we'll see
who you really are, Hercules.

497
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:41,067
Now, be a good boy
while I bathe.

498
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:53,067
Oooh-hoo, my!

499
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,867
Look at who I see.
( Laughing )

500
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,667
How has this big,

501
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:03,467
wide world
been treating you?

502
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,867
It's all out there
for you, son.

503
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,267
More than you can imagine.

504
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:14,267
Yours is gonna be
such a wonderful life.

505
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:21,067
And women. Let me tell you,
there's nothing...

506
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,867
like a beautiful woman.

507
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,667
Believe me, women are
the sweetest journey...

508
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,467
you will ever take.

509
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,667
But don't be a afraid.
Take a lot of them.

510
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:35,067
( Laughing )

511
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:39,867
Did you see, Hercules?
That's who you are.

512
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:47,067
The son of your father.
Women mean nothing to him, nor to you.

513
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:51,067
They're just play toys
to be used and then thrown away.

514
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:55,067
Your father, all fathers
teach this to their sons...

515
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,067
on the day
that they're born,

516
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:01,367
and it doesn't change
as you grow older.

517
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,367
( Shouting )

518
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,767
What-- what do you say
we call it a draw?

519
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:19,767
Good match, Hercules, Iolaus.
You should be proud of yourselves.

520
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,567
You've become the best
fighters in the class.

521
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:26,967
You've all come a long way. You're ready to
graduate. You'll be leaving here soon.

522
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:30,167
Take with you the truths
you've learned.

523
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:33,767
When you fight,
fight to the death.

524
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:38,167
Cultivate hardness,
because a man is stone.

525
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:42,167
If you have any emotions left,
grind them to the dust.

526
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:46,167
Emotions are for the weak,
the girls!

527
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:50,167
Most of all, remember:
You'll be known by the enemies you make.

528
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,967
So, make good ones.

529
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:56,567
- Hey!
- ( Boys Together ) Hey!

530
00:45:56,967 --> 00:46:01,767
You and me, Iolaus, we'll fight back-to-back
and die together, battlefield heroes.

531
00:46:01,767 --> 00:46:04,567
We die together?
A promise?

532
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:08,167
There again,
women are nothing in your world.

533
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:10,967
They're weak,
polluted with emotion.

534
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:14,167
But what great thing
is it to be a man?

535
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:18,167
Hammered into killing tools.
No feelings except for enemies.

536
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:22,167
No strengths but those
to destroy. Tell me.

537
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,367
When has a man brought
life into the world?

538
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,700
When does a man deliever
anything but death?

539
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,900
- Be careful, Iolaus.
- No, be reckless.

540
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,300
Careful dies,
reckless kills.

541
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,110
Ow!

542
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,700
No, Iolaus!
Stay at my back!

543
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
( Grunting )

544
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,300
( Hippolyta's Voice )
You have no idea what women are.

545
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,100
But you've had
your first lesson today.

546
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,100
Hercules!
It's a woman!

547
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,220
Ahhhh!

548
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,067
Iolaus!

549
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,600
( Shuddering, Whimpering )

550
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,800
It's not my intention that
you should suffer needlessly.

551
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,600
It's not a female trait.

552
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,800
You loved Iolaus.
I believe that.

553
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,000
He was my best friend.

554
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,600
We went through
a lot together.

555
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,400
I should have never
let him come along.

556
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,400
You surprise me.

557
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,600
It seems somehow that a spark
of humanity has survived inside you.

558
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
Could you love a woman
as you loved Iolaus?

559
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
It's different with women.

560
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,800
Why? Women need respect and loyalty
just as much as you do.

561
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,200
But you will never
understand that.

562
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,400
What if I tried to change?

563
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,200
You can't change.
You're a man.

564
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,200
But if I learned to be the way I am,
I can learn to be another way.

565
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,400
- Why should I believe you?
- You shouldn't.

566
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,200
But something tells me
you're strong enough to take the chance.

567
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,800
No. Men can learn nothin expect
how to deceive and dominate and kill.

568
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,267
- So show me another way.
- No.

569
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:24,067
I don't think you could
even if you wanted to.

570
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:27,667
- And why do you say that?
- Because you don't know any other way.

571
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:30,467
You've become exactly
like the men you hate.

572
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:41,667
I've had enough of this
conversation with you.

573
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,100
( Sheep Bleating,
Chickens Clucking )

574
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,700
What are you doing?

575
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,300
Who's the little girl?
Why are you looking at me like that?

576
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,100
She's never seen
a man before.

577
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,300
- And you?
- Yes. I've just never talked to one.

578
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,500
- So is that what you want? To talk?
- Sort of.

579
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,867
- What do you mean, sort of?
- I want to know somehthing.

580
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:29,600
Like what?

581
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,800
At night sometimes,
I've heard the older women speaking.

582
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,667
They don't know
I can hear them.

583
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:41,467
Is it true, in other places
men and women live together?

584
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:45,467
Why do you ask me? Doesn't Hippolyta
teach you everything you need to know?

585
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,867
Of course she does.

586
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:51,067
It's just that sometimes
I get these feelings inside,

587
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:54,267
and I wonder what
the enemy's all about.

588
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:57,467
Yeah, well, that makes
three of us.

589
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:02,267
What about you?
Is that what you've come here for?

590
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:06,667
You, you came from Gargarensia.
Did you see a little boy there?

591
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,467
Well, there are
many little boys.

592
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:14,700
Yeah, well, he'd be ten. Fair haired,
with a freckle on his right cheek.

593
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,267
- You mean Franco?
- Franco. How is he?

594
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:23,133
He's fine.
I mean, he's--

595
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,467
You're his mother,
aren't you?

596
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,200
No! Why, why, no, no.

597
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,400
What are you doing in here?
No one is to talk to this dog.

598
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Get out!

599
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
If it were up to me,

600
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,867
you wouldn't be caged,
you'd be buried.

601
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:59,667
You know, normally I like to see
a woman with a little fire in her eyes.

602
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:03,667
( Laughs )
But this one is all fire.

603
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:07,267
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to see if I could help you.

604
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:10,467
( Laughing ) Help?
From you? That's a new one.

605
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:14,867
Give me a little credit! You don't see the
other gods dropping in on their kids.

606
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:17,267
What can I do?

607
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:20,067
You can tell me
how to understand women.

608
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:22,867
Oh, understand women!
Who can understand them?

609
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:26,467
They're full of feelings
and instincts,

610
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:29,667
and they can always
outguess you.

611
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:33,667
But tell me,
what are you doing here?

612
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:38,467
I mean, this cage can't hold
the strongest man in the world.

613
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:42,067
It's not the cage
that's keeping me here.

614
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,867
It's Hippolyta, all right?
There's something about her.

615
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:48,467
Well, she's very beautiful.

616
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:53,267
It's not that.
She's... different somehow.

617
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:56,467
She's got strength
and power.

618
00:51:56,467 --> 00:52:00,867
( Laughs ) You know,
I fell for strength and power.

619
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,067
And what did
I wind up with? Hera?

620
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,867
I've just got to get her
to change her mind.

621
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:11,267
Women don't do that!
At least not when you want them to.

622
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:15,667
Son, just think back
about all the things...

623
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:18,467
I taught you about women.

624
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,667
I have been.
I'm thinking maybe you were wrong.

625
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:22,627
Oh! Huh.

626
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,467
Well, maybe I was.
But remember:

627
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:31,667
These Amazons
are Hera's favorites.

628
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:37,267
You mess around with them,
you're gonna make her very unhappy.

629
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:41,267
Since when have either of us
ever cared about Hera's happiness?

630
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:47,267
Well, I warned you.

631
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:54,867
( Thunder Rumbling )

632
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:57,267
( Bracelets Click ) Hera.

633
00:52:57,267 --> 00:53:00,067
HERA: You've done well,
Hippolyta.

634
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:04,067
You've made me proud
with the capture of Hercules.

635
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:08,067
It's only with the strength that you have
given us that we were able to defeat him.

636
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,067
We owe our victory to you.

637
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:13,267
Tell me, why is it
he's still alive?

638
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:16,067
I didn't see the need
to kill him.

639
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,567
I'm not so sure
he's the enemy.

640
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:22,300
All men are the enemy.
Haven't I taught you that?

641
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,033
But Hercules seems different.
He doesn't seem as bad as--

642
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:29,600
Don't be a fool.
Hercules is the worst of them.

643
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,667
He wants to control you,
to control everything.

644
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:37,267
You have to kill him now,
while you can.

645
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:40,867
- But I have spoken with him--
- Are you refusing to obey me?

646
00:53:41,267 --> 00:53:43,633
No, of course not.
I would never--

647
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:46,867
Then do as I say.
Kill him.

648
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:48,867
( Thunderclap )

649
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,867
Yes, Hera.

650
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,267
And the moment he's dead,

651
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:56,500
I want you to carry out
the attack on the Gargarensians.

652
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,900
( Thunderclap )

653
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,300
It will be done.

654

( Gong Chimes )

655
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,900
Lysia, spread the word
among the women.

656
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,700
We attack the Gargarensian
men tonight.

657
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,100
My warriors will be ready
and at your call.

658
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,300
Good. Now go. There's
something I've got to do.

659

( Chattering )

662
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,100
Hey, It's Hercules!
He's back.

663
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,500
- We thought you were dead.
- There's no time to explain.

664
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,100
The women are coming to attack. Gather
your weapons, get ready to defend yourselves.

665
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,300
- I don't have a weapon.
- Neither do I. I'm just a farmer.

666
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,300
Hercules, I told you.
We're not warriors.

667
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,500
- We don't know how to fight them.
- Would you rather die?

668
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Are you gonna let them
slaughter you, your sons?

669
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,300
Hercules, there's something more
we need to tell you about their attack.

670
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,300

## ( Chanting Continues ) ##

673
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,067
We ride tonight...

674
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:08,467
with the strength
that Hera has given us...

675
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:11,667
and the strength
that we have earned for ourselves.

676
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:14,467
Take what you need,
but be quick.

677
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:17,267
Stay only until
the sound of the horn.

678
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,067
The moment you hear it,
we ride away.

679
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:24,067
Now, to your horses!

680
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:27,267

( Men Chattering )

683
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,167
Hercules, they're coming.

684
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:06,167
All right, now go. Remember to od
everything exactly as I told you.

685
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:10,567
- What about the horn?
- I'll take care if it. Now get going.

686
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,400
( Horses Whinnying )

687
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,600
( Women Shouting )

688
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,600
Go, but be careful.

689
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,600
There's no telling what kind of trap
Hercules has laid for us.

690
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,400
And remember, you have only
until the sound of the horn.

691
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,600
( Horse Neighs, Whinnies )

692
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:49,867
Don't keep me waiting.
You know what I'm here for.

693
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:52,267
What's all this?

694
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,667
I thought maybe
we could talk first.

695
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,467
Talk? About what?

696
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,067
You. Who you are.
I want to know all about you.

697
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,867
There's no time for that.
Now take your clothes off!

698
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:07,467
There's plenty of time.
Please.

699
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,667
Quickly!
Take your clothes off!

700
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:28,667
- ( Gasps )
- Take... your... clothes... off!

701
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:32,267
I will
if you tell me your name.

702
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:34,667
No names!
We're in a hurry.

703
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,067
But you must tell me.

704
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:39,867
You see, I've written
you a love song.

705
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:43,067
And without your name,
it has no title.

706
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:53,467
Franco!

707
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:56,667
What's he doing here?
He's not supposed to be here.

708
00:59:57,067 --> 01:00:01,067
Are you my mother?
I sometimes dream of you.

709
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:05,467
But I can't remember your face.
Please let me see your face.

710
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:28,267
I beg you to please
be gentle with me.

711
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,867
Or, if you wish, rough.
( Laughs )

712
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:36,267
A moment is all I need. When the horn
sounds, you'll never see me again.

713
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:37,077
Oh.

714
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:44,267
Oh, after an attack like that,
I-- I suppose you're hungry.

715
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:49,067
The rules are:
no small talk, just sex.

716
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:52,267
Ah... I see.

717
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:54,707
Well...

718
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,067
( Laughing )

719
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,867
as you wish.

721
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,700
( Horse Neighs )

722
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,900
So this is the big attack
that they told me about.

723
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,500
Stay clear of me, Hercules.
You're lucky to be alive as it is.

724
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,900
I thought your women
didn't need men.

725
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,700
We don't.
But we do need what they have.

726
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,700
It's the only way to be sure there'll be
daughters to take over when we're gone.

727
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,500
And if the babies are male,
you abandon them on the riverbank.

728
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,900
- We have no use for them.
- Seems like an insane way of living you've developed.

729
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Hera's happy.
That's good enough.

730
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,700
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

731
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,500
I thought you didn't want
to be controlled.

732
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,500
No one controls us.

733
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,100
Hera does.
You obey her every word.

734
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,500
Not every word.
She ordered me to kill you.

735
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,300
Then why haven't you?
- Maybe I will.

736
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,500
Then do it now.

737
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,300
( Drops Knife )

738
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,900
Why are you in such a hurry
to separate them?

739
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,900
Why don't you give them
a chance just to talk?

740
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,700
Talk isn't what we came for.

741
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,300
Are you afraid they're gonna find out
they don't have to hate each other?

742
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,100
I'm protecting them from the lies
those men will tell if given a chance.

743
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
Those people down there
belong together.

744
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,300
The Gargarensians need your women.

745
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,300
My women don't need them.

746
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,900
Yes, they do. They told me themselves.
They feel an emptiness.

747
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,500
- Don't lie to me.
- You know I'm not lying.

748
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,300
You feel that same emptiness,
don't you?

749
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,300
Stop it. No man is going to make me
want him. I won't be that weak.

750
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,500
It's not weak to admit
what you're feeling.

751
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,733
It takes strength
and courage.

752
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,733
Don't be afraid.

753
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:03,933
I'm not afraid of anything.

754
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,143
No?

755
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:09,533
Then you're not
afraid of this,

756
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:16,733
you're not afraid of this...

757
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:21,833
and you're not afraid of this.

758
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:37,433
I told you,
I'm not afraid of anything.

759
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:51,033
( Birds Chirping,
Rooster Crows )

760
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:06,167
Do you have any children?

761
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:08,967
I have a little girl.
She's four.

762
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,767
She must be
a cute little thing.

763
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:15,767
She is. And she has
your silly smile.

764
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:18,567
Silly smile?
Silly smile?

765
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:21,367
( Both Laughing )

766
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:27,367
He's such a beautiful boy.

767
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,567
- Yeah.
- You've done well with him.

768
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:33,767
I do my best.

769
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:37,367
But what he really needs
is a mother.

770
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:42,967
This feels like heaven.

771
01:04:42,967 --> 01:04:46,167
Oh, darling...

772
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:50,167
heaven was never like this.

773
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,967
What's the matter?

774
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:09,367
This has gone on
long enough.

775
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:19,767
( Horn Blaring )

776
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,967
Her name's Chilla.
Every moment with her was fantastic.

777
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,167
We talked about her,
about me, about everything.

778
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,967
And to think, up until now,
I was always afraid of her.

779
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,767
I know what you mean.
You should've seen Ilea.

780
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:35,367
When she took her mask off,
I nearly cried. She was so beautiful!

781
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,367
Her hair glowed
in the moonlight.

782
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,967
I'm still a little afraid
I was having some kind of vision.

783
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:45,367
Well, if it was a vision...
we had one too!

784
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,767
( All Laughing )

785
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:50,967
And I met my mother.
Hey!

786
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:55,367
Hercules, you've given our village life
again. We owe everything to you.

787
01:05:55,767 --> 01:06:00,167
Thank you, Hercules. Things are gonna be
much better now the women are coming back.

788
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:02,967
That's if the women
come back.

789
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:06,567
They're gonna come back. They're gonna
want more. What woman wouldn't?

790
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:09,767
Yeah, they'll be back.
And think how much better it'll be.

791
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:12,567
Our clothes will be mended.
We'll eat better.

792
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:14,967
It'll be back to the way
it should be. Yeah!

793
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:17,767
- Right.
- What wrong with you?

794
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:22,167
Those attitudes are exactly what got you
into all this trouble in the first place.

795
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:26,967
The women aren't the ones who have to
work around here. It's you men, all of you.

796
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,167
Hercules is right. Things went
the way they did last night...

797
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:36,167
because we talked to them,
we listened to them.

798
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:38,567
That's right, you did.

799
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:43,767
If you want to keep Gargarensia from being
torn apart again, it's the only way.

800
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:46,567
( Chattering, Laughter )

801
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:49,367
Hector and I talked
for hours.

802
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:53,367
Tiber and I did too.
You know, he even sang me a song.

803
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:55,767
( All Laughing )

804
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:58,967
MEGARA: You should've seen Franco.
He's such a beautiful boy.

805
01:06:58,967 --> 01:07:02,567
I can't wait to see him again.
The both of them.

806
01:07:02,567 --> 01:07:07,367
And what about you, Lysia?
Did you get to know the man you met?

807
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:12,567
We, uh-- We didn't get round
to a lot of talking.

808
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:15,367
( Women Laughing )

809
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:25,367
- You returned successful?
- Yes, Hera.

810
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:27,367
Did the attack go as planned?

811
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:32,167
Hera, we owe you
for everything that we have.

812
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:34,967
Our strength, our freedom.

813
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,967
You've brought us such a long way,
and we're grateful,

814
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:42,567
but maybe we've gone too far,
maybe all men aren't the enemy.

815
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:44,967
I ordered you to kill him!

816
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:48,967
But he doesn't deserve to die!
He's different. He's changed.

817
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:53,367
You poor child.
Hercules only pretended to change.

818
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,767
Everything he did,
everything he said...

819
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:58,167
was only to prevent you
from sounding the horn.

820
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:01,767
Don't you see?
He tricked you!

821
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,967
No, that's not true! He--

822
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:07,367
Do you really think
you could change Hercules?

823
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:09,767
He's the son of Zeus.

824
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:12,967
Why, they probably planned
all this together.

825
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:15,367
And while he was having
his way with you,

826
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:18,967
his men were wrapping
their lies around your women.

827
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:22,567
- You've lost control of them.
- No!

828
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,367
Yes! Now you feel
betrayed as I've felt.

829
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,567
He was sent to destroy you,
and he succeeded.

830
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,567
No, you're wrong.

831
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:33,767
I know yo're wrong.
He said that--

832
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:36,567
What? Did he say
he loved you?

833
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,567
That he needed you?

834
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:42,567
Did he tell you there was no one
in the world quite like you?

835
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:46,967
You must act now
before everything is gone.

836
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:50,167
Assemble your troops
and destroy him.

837
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,567
Destroy all of them!

838
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:56,967
Ride into Gargarensia
and let no man stand alive!

839
01:08:57,367 --> 01:09:00,567
It's the only hope you have
of saving what you've worked for,

840
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:03,367
what we've worked for!

841
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:06,967
No, Hera!
There'll be no more attacks.

842
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:10,167
Obey me. I'm warning you.

843
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:12,167
We've obeyed you
for long enough.

844
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:16,167
We've been controlled by your hate,
by the blackness in your heart.

845
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:20,967
Hercules has to die!
The Gargarensians have to die!

846
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:22,967
I command you!

847
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:26,233
No! There'll be
no more commands!

848
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:30,233
( Hera Laughing )

849
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:33,467
( Laughing Continues )

850
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,567
( Laughter )

851
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,967
- The women wanted me to thank you.
- Thank me?

852
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:54,167
Yeah, look at them.
I've never seen them so happy.

853
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:57,367
And to tell you the truth,
I'm felling the same way.

854
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,367
That's nice.

855
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:02,967
We want to know when we can go back,
when we can see the men again.

856
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:05,767
How about right now?

857
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,167
Mount up!

858
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:10,967
Full battle gear.
Battle arms.

859
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:13,767
We attack Gargarensia again.

860
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:16,967
This time, no man
to be left alive.

861
01:10:16,967 --> 01:10:19,367
But, Hippolyta, wasn't
what happened last night--

862
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:22,967
You'll obey my orders!
Or have you turned against me?

863
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:26,567
No, my queen.
Never. Never.

864
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:32,967
We ride immediatley!
This time we fight!

865
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,367
Move!

866
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,900

01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,700
- Run!

( Shouting Continues )

878
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,700
Aaaaah!

879
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,100
( Screaming )

880
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,700

882
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,900
Aaaaah!

883
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,900
Aaaaah!

884
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,733
( Grunts )

885
01:12:41,933 --> 01:12:44,333
Aaaaaah!

886
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,733
( Horses Whinnying )

887
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:55,933
Burn everything to the ground!
Kill every living soul!

888
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:59,133
Megara! Megara,
where are you? It's me.

889
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:01,933
Lysia, kill that man right now!

890
01:13:09,533 --> 01:13:11,933
No!

891
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,933
HIPPOLYTA: Lysia, kill him!

892
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:20,733
Then I'll kill him myself.

893
01:13:20,733 --> 01:13:23,533
I'll kill all of them!

894
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:29,133
Hippolyta! What's going on?
What are you doing?

895
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:31,133
I'm saving my women.

896
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:35,533
But they don't need to be saved. Look at them.
Their war against these men is over.

897
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:39,133
The war against men
is never over, Hercules!

898
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:43,133
With these men it is. You've won.
You've got their respect.

899
01:13:43,133 --> 01:13:46,333
They're ready to treat you
the way you deserve to be treated.

900
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:48,733
And why should we believe
your lies?

901
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:51,533
They're not lies!

902
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:56,333
On my love for you,
they are not lies.

903
01:13:56,333 --> 01:14:01,133
Your father made promises on his love.
They didn't last a day.

904
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:05,533
( Hera's Voice )
They didn't last a day.

905
01:14:05,533 --> 01:14:07,533
Hera.

906
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:11,533
( Laughs )
That's right, Hercules.

907
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:13,933
You may have stolen
Hippolyta's heart and her mind,

908
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,333
but I-- I control her body.

909
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:19,933
I'm going to enjoy
killing you.

910
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:23,933
You and every one
of these men!

911
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:26,733
( Grunting )
Yes! Yes!

912
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:29,533

913

( Gasps )

914
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,333
Hercules.

915
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,733
There's nowhere to run,
Hercules!

916
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:49,933
HERCULES: Hyah!

917
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:53,533
( Horse Galloping Off )

918
01:14:53,933 --> 01:14:57,533
- Why is he running?
- He's trying to save us.

919
01:14:57,533 --> 01:15:00,333
But who's gonna save Hercules?

920
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:13,933
( Horse Whinnies )

921
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,533
If I were you,
I'd get back on that horse...

922
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:31,933
and keep on riding.

923
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,133
And let Hera control those women?
I don't think so.

924
01:15:35,133 --> 01:15:38,733
Ohhh!
So now they're yours?

925
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:43,133
No, they're not anybody's. They're free to make
 up their own minds in what they wanna do.

926
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:47,133
If they choose to be with those men,
I'm not gonna let Hera stop them.

927
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:51,933
Son, it's best just to get out
of her way and head back when it's over.

928
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,333
It really works for me.

929
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:57,133
Yeah?
It doesn't work for me.

930
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:01,533
I don't suppose I can count on you
for any help?

931
01:16:01,533 --> 01:16:05,533
Ohh, I'd really love to,
but you know how it is.

932
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:09,133
( Horse Whinnying )

933
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,933
Yeah. I know how it is.

934
01:16:20,733 --> 01:16:23,133
HIPPOLYTA: Don't bother hiding, Hercules!

935
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:25,533
I'll hunt you until
your head's in my hands!

936
01:16:25,533 --> 01:16:27,933
I'm not hiding, Hera.

937
01:16:36,733 --> 01:16:38,733
( Grunting )

938
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:43,133
You think you're ready for me? Let's
see what kind of legend you really are.

939
01:16:43,133 --> 01:16:45,933
- I won't fight you.
- Come on, Hercules.

940
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:49,533
I know you want to kill me.
This is your big chance.

941
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:53,933
No! It's all over, Hera.
Those women aren't yours anymore.

942
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,733
Hippolyta and all of them,
they belong to themselves.

943
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:59,533
No! They belong to me!

944
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:03,133
( Grunts )
Yes! Yes!

945
01:17:03,133 --> 01:17:06,333
( Grunting Continues )

946
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:18,733
Hippolyta, you're too strong
to be conquered. Listen to me!

947
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:23,133
It won't work, Hercules. She can't fight
this battle. Only you can.

948
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:25,933
( Grunting Continues )

949
01:17:47,933 --> 01:17:50,733
Oh, good.
The bleeding has begun.

950
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:55,533
Hippolyta, please. Don't let her
do this! If you love me, fight her!

951
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:59,133
Save your breath
to scream, Hercules.

952
01:18:02,733 --> 01:18:05,133
( Grunting )

953
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:09,933
You know, for the champion of men,
you were a big disappointment.

954
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:12,333
- No, Pithus!
- ( Grunts )

955
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:16,733
No, Hera!
He doesn't have to die!

956
01:18:17,133 --> 01:18:21,133
You don't get it, do you?
They all have to die.

957
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:23,533
- ( Laughs, Grunts )
- Nooooo!

What are you waiting for?

962
01:18:45,533 --> 01:18:48,333
Kill me.
You know you want to.

963
01:18:50,733 --> 01:18:53,933
( Panting )
No.

964
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:57,533
You can't make me hurt her.

967
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:27,133
It seems you have
no choice now.

968
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:41,533
It's either fight
or die.

969
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:43,933
I told you,
I won't hurt her.

970
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:46,733
I won't allow
both of you to live.

971
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:51,933
Then kill me.

972
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:54,333
What?

973
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,133
If one of us has to die,
it's gonna be me.

974
01:19:57,133 --> 01:20:01,133
( Laughs ) Who would've thought
that of all things...

975
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:05,133
it would be love that
kills the great Hercules.

976
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:09,533
I could never stand the pain
of living without her.

977
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:16,333
Then live without her.

978
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:22,333
- ( Screams, Laughs )
- No! Nooo!

Please.

( Horses Whinnying )

985
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:35,533
Where's my dad?
What happened to him?

986
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:38,333
Your father was
a good man, Franco.

987
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:41,933
But I want him back!
I want kim to be here!

988
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:45,933
Oh, Franco, sometimes
we lose the people we love,

989
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:49,533
and there's nothing we can do
to bring them back.

990

Don't be so sure.

ZEUS: Hercules,
it's not going to work.

994
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:25,933
What's past is past.

995
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:28,333
Let it go.

996
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:32,333
What you're thinking about
is impossible.

997
01:22:32,733 --> 01:22:35,133
Wait a second.

998
01:22:41,533 --> 01:22:44,333
- Now. Do it.
- No.

999
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:46,333
Do it!

1000
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:49,933
It's gonna change things.
This candle can only show your past.

1001
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:53,533
It's not gonna take you back there.
That's not the way it works.

1002
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:56,733
But you could make it work that way.
You do have the power.

1003
01:22:57,133 --> 01:23:00,333
Yes, I have.
But that is not the problem.

1004

01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:14,333
But I can't just go around
reversing time...

1007
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:17,133
and changing
the course of events.

1008
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:19,933
If you only knew
how complicated it gets,

1009
01:23:19,933 --> 01:23:22,733
with the stars,
the planets and all.

1010
01:23:22,733 --> 01:23:25,533
Not to mention the other gods.
I mean, they--

1011
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:29,933
They would go insane
if I started messing around with things.

1012
01:23:29,933 --> 01:23:34,733
Son, you can't imagine
th headaches this would cause.

1013
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:37,533
You don't understand
how important this is.

1014
01:23:37,533 --> 01:23:40,733
Three lives.
Three good people have died.

1015
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:45,933
Please, Father.
Do this for me.

1016
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:49,933
God, have you any idea
how angry Hera would be?

1017
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:53,533
I couldn't go back home.

1018
01:23:53,533 --> 01:23:56,733
You never do, anyway.

1019
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:05,533
( Thunder Rumbling )

1020
01:24:13,133 --> 01:24:15,533
( Screaming )

1021
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:17,533
Nooo! No!

1022
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:23,933
- ( Gasping )
- They all have to die.

1023
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:28,333
( Shouting )

1024
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:30,733
I'm not afraid of anything.

1025
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:35,933
It's a woman!

1026
01:24:43,133 --> 01:24:46,333
Hercules, I made extra for you.
I hope you're hungry.

1027
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:49,533
IOLAUS: Hercules, are you all right?

1028
01:24:56,733 --> 01:25:01,533
Iolaus!
It's so damn good to see you!

1029
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:03,533
Yeah, you too.

1030
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:06,733
Listen, if you don't wanna eat
Ania's stew, it's okay.

1031
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:09,533
It's all right.
I'll eat it.

1032
01:25:11,133 --> 01:25:14,333
Mmm. This is great.

1033
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,733
It's the best I've ever had.

1034
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:20,733
Iolaus, I know you two are gonna have
a long and happy life together.

1035
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:24,333
Well, thank you, Hercules.

1036
01:25:26,733 --> 01:25:28,333
( Gasps )

1037
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:31,933
Oh, it's-- it's all right.
It's only-- It's only Pithus.

1038
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:34,733
( Sniffs )

1039
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:44,333
- It's all right, Pithus. It's me, Hercules.
- How do you know my name?

1040
01:25:44,733 --> 01:25:47,533
It's too long a story. But I know why
you're here, and I know how to help you.

1041
01:25:47,533 --> 01:25:49,933
Then you'll come back
with me to Gargarensia.

1042
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,733
You don't need me. You can solve
your problem yourselves.

1043
01:25:53,133 --> 01:25:55,933
The next time your enemy sttacks,
don't treat them as the enemy.

1044
01:25:55,933 --> 01:25:58,733
Instead of fearing them, respect them.
In your hearts, you know who they are.

1045
01:25:58,733 --> 01:26:01,133
So talk to them.
Give them what they want.

1046
01:26:01,133 --> 01:26:03,933
But we can't do it on our own.
You've gotta come back with me.

1047
01:26:03,933 --> 01:26:08,333
I can't, Pithus. If I go back with you,
people will die. Good people.

1048
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,933
- But then, how do we--
- Just do as I've told you.

1049
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,333
Make your enemy your friend.

1050
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:18,333
In your hearts, you know who they are,
so talk to them.

1051
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:21,533
Welcome then into your homes,
share yourselves...

1052
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:23,933
and find out who they are.

1053
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:25,933
Take your clothes off.

1054
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,767
HERCULES: Even if you don't know, try.

1055
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,167
If you make an effort,
it'll change everything.

1056
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:33,167
But you have to take
the first step.

1057
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:35,167
I've written you
a love song.

1058
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:38,367
More than anything,
open yourselves up to them.

1059
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:41,167
Show them what matters to you,
what you care about.

1060
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:45,967
Believe me... it'll put
an end to all this hatred.

1061
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:49,967
And, uh, it wouldn't hurt...

1062
01:26:49,967 --> 01:26:53,567
if you washed their feet
every once in a while, either.

1063
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:57,167
Are you sure
it's gonna work?

1064
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:02,367
I know it'll work.

1065
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:05,167
Keep that for yourself.

1066
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:13,967
- What was all that about?
- Oh, just an old friend. He needed my help.

1067
01:27:13,967 --> 01:27:17,567
- Sounds like an adventure.
- You're getting married this week.

1068
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:19,967
- That's adventure enough for all of us.
- ( Laughing )

1069
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:23,167
Now get back over there and help
that beautiful woman of yours.

1070
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:29,167
Those two belong together,
don't they?

1071
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:32,767
- They sure do.
- And what about you, Hercules?

1072
01:27:32,767 --> 01:27:36,367
Do you think there's a woman out there
who can make you that happy?

1073
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:40,367
Yeah. She's out there somewhere.

1074
