00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,444
Yeah you know Bryan?

177
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,638
Which one?

178
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:07,662
Bryan Daniels?

179
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,246
Nah.

180
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,720
Aight well, he's the plug,

181
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:14,294
and apparently, they met in
rehab and got hella close.

182
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,922
Who is he, like is he dangerous?

183
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,775
Nah not really, he's the homie.

184
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,986
I mean he's a little old
to be dating her though.

185
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,429
Like it's not illegal or
anything but it's close.

186
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,016
Like, hella close.

187
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,113
But he doesn't really seem like the
kidnapping type to me, you know?

188
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,288
Okay well the cops
are at her house

189
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,023
so something has
clearly gone wrong.

190
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,583
Yeah once the cops leave
let's just stop in,

191
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:39,611
see if she's there.

192
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,750
Yeah I bet her mom just freaked out again
because she snuck out to go to a party

193
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:46,493
like three days after
getting back from rehab.

194
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,037
Yeah probably, it's
worth checking though.

195
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,747
Yeah I guess.

196
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,947
Hey, looks like the
cops are leaving.

197
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,463
Let's go.

198
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,868
Alright hold up,
give me the bag.

199
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,497
If Jane's mom is in there, we
got to be discreet with the bag.

200
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,083
We don't want to
get her in trouble

201
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,852
in case there's
anything bad in here.

202
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,521
Aight yeah, good idea.

204
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,789
Oh hey boys,

205
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,624
isn't it a little
late for a visit?

206
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,366
Hey Ms. Booker, we
were just wondering if

207
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,004
we could say hi to Jane
real quick. Is she around?

208
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,007
You know she's
actually gone missing?

209
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,915
I mean it's only been
a couple of hours,

210
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,820
but she just got back from rehab

211
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,089
and I'm trying to keep
her on a tight leash.

212
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,056
She's probably okay but.

213
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,862
I just really need
her home tonight.

214
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,914
Oh jeez, I'm so
sorry Ms. Booker.

215
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,084
We didn't even realize,

216
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,202
I mean she's probably
fine, you know?

217
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:59,940
Maybe she doesn't even know
you're looking for her?

218
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,984
She hasn't been answering
any of my calls!

219
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,309
It's not like her,

220
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,009
at least

221
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,313
it's not like the Jane
that came back from rehab.

222
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,736
It seemed to me that
she was all better.

223
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,684
She wasn't like her old self.

224
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,293
She was ready to move on,

225
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,331
and now she's just gone
with no explanation.

226
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,352
It's just so troubling,

227
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,981
especially with everything going
on with that poor Katie girl.

228
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,928
I'm just really
worried right now.

229
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,052
Us too, is there anything
we can do to help?

230
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,199
Actually yeah.

231
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,072
Um...

232
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,016
The cops wanted me to ask her
friends a couple questions.

233
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,852
If you guys wouldn't mind it
would only take a couple minutes?

234
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,126
Uh yeah sure, we
could do that, right?

235
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,346
Yeah alright,

236
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,002
but we probably don't know anything
you haven't already figured out.

237
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,026
It won't take long.

238
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,504
So I take it you haven't
seen Jane recently,

239
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:05,090
otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, right?

240
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,612
Oh well actually.

241
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:09,177
Yeah, we haven't seen her
since she left for rehab.

242
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,013
Were you gonna say
something James?

243
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,399
Oh uh no.

244
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,662
Well, yeah actually.

245
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,724
I was gonna say I visited
her once in rehab.

246
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,373
Oh that's right,

247
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,044
you two were always so close,

248
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,269
but you haven't seen
her recently, right?

249
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,402
Yes that's correct.

250
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,197
And do you know
her new boyfriend?

251
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,032
I think his name is Bryan?

252
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,637
Yeah, Bryan um...

253
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,763
Sounds familiar, I
might have heard of him,

254
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,827
but I don't think I know
him personally or anything.

255
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,547
He seems like trouble to me.

256
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,918
I've heard Jane on
the phone with him.

257
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,422
He just doesn't treat her
with the respect she deserves.

258
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
What do you mean?

259
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,990
After their calls,
I can always tell,

260
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,512
because Jane seems
anxious and distracted.

261
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,265
Do you know this
Bryan's last name?

262
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,035
I can't seem to identify
him to the police,

263
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,854
but he seems like a
prime suspect to me.

264
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,304
I want to say it
starts with like a b?

265
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,151
But like I really
couldn't say for sure.

266
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,238
I mean I wish I did, but

267
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,156
Jane hasn't even
mentioned him to me.

268
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,922
Hmm, she can be like that.

269
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,036
She hides herself from others.

270
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,663
Anyway,

271
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,310
what's the talk like in your
circles about Katie's disappearance?

272
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,795
Like, what are people
your age saying?

273
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,171
Well,

274
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,090
no one really knows
what to make of it,

275
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,648
everyone's definitely
on edge though.

276
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,262
Do the cops think this is
related to Katie's disappearance?

277
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,945
It's only logical for the
two of them to be connected.

278
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,436

the same week of each other?

In this town?

280
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,063
It just makes sense.

281
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,803
Yeah, I mean it's kind of
important to remember that...

282
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,112
Jane and Katie were two very
different kind of girls.

it's obvious you two
have been drinking.

304
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,501
Did you know that Jane, like
her father, was an alcoholic?

305
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,179
That's why she went to rehab.

306
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,503
I used to think I knew her.

307

how to raise her right.

She was gonna be perfect.

309
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,384
Then, after her father left,

310
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,911
I had to make sure she didn't
follow in his footsteps.

311

But I didn't do enough.

312

By the time I found out
she'd started drinking,

313
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,705
her alcoholism had eroded
away the girl I had raised.

I'm really sorry Ms. Booker.

315
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:26,499
I didn't mean to.

Huh, that's weird.

He hung up on me.

355

He's never hung up on me.

356
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,344
He sounded different
than usual too, like

357
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,942
I don't know, more serious?

358
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,088
Do you think he could
be hurting Jane?

359
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,424
I don't know, probably
not but like maybe?

360
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,291
If he's hurting her
we gotta act quick.

three miles from here.

Can't we just go back to my place
and figure it out in the morning?

369
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,658
No! Jane could be
dead by the morning,

we were gonna try to save you.

No no, I'm fine.

432

hung up on you Tyler?

I mean yeah, that
was part of it.

your house Jane.

missing, and we got worried

you to end up like Katie.

Well, we went to your house
to bring you your bag.

I told you I left
it at the party.

Okay well, you guys are forgiven
for interrupting our movie night

442

because we really
needed this bag.

Everything I need to
get away from my mom.

445
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,459
Is that a burner phone?

446
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,725
Yeah, her mom tracks her
iPhone when we're together

447
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:49,861
so she just puts it
on airplane mode.

448
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,594
I got her that so she could still have
a working phone while not being tracked.

What else is in there?

450

Just my hydro, a flashlight, and
some other things I wanted from home.

yet.

I just really needed to get
away from my mom for the night

455

from rehab she's been like,

when we were talking to her.

she's converted to Satanism?

00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,547
We definitely gotta
call the cops.

528
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,923
No we can't do that.

529
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:05,841
Why not?

530
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,571
Because it's my word
against my mom's.

531
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:08,844
No one would believe me.

532
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,097
Especially since I've lied to
cops before to get away from her.

533
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,765
Wait, when was that?

534
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,059
After my dad disappeared,

535
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,637
I genuinely thought
my mom had killed him.

536
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,610
But I didn't have any proof,

537
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:23,734
so I made up a story about
how I'd seen her kill him.

538
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,611
I said that I saw
her strangle him,

539
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,120
in his sleep, and

540
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,700
take the body outside in
the backyard and bury it.

541
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,323
The cops excavated
our entire backyard

542
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:35,935
but they never found anything.

543
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,542
I never said I made it up, but

544
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:39,583
it was obvious they all knew.

545
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,631
Then my mom sued the
police department,

546
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,665
and they paid to have our
entire backyard fixed,

547
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,718
so if I were to call them
up with this kind of story,

548
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:48,382
they would think it was
the same kind of thing,

549
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:51,136
and without any evidence,
they'd have to believe her.

550
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,683
Hey Bryan,

551
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:55,478
while I'm here,

552
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:57,182
you think I could get
an eighth real quick?

553
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,724
Oh uh yeah sure, I guess.

554
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:01,015
I got my shit in my room.

555
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:02,605
Let's go.

556
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,619
So there's no way we can stop
your mom without evidence?

557
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,190
I mean she needs me for whatever
she has planned tonight,

558
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,249
so as long as I'm with
Bryan I'll be safe.

559
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,037
She knows you're dating
someone named Bryan.

560
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,716
She doesn't know his last name,

561
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,221
but I feel like it's
only a matter of time

562
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,245
until the cops figure out
that you're staying here.

563
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,341
Shit.

564
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
She uh said something else too.

565
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,178
What is it?

566
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,093
She said she thought
Bryan was bad for you,

567
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:38,892
that he wasn't
treating you right.

568
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,434
Fuck her.

569
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,301
She doesn't know
anything about me.

570
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,680
She was probably just
trying to manipulate you,

571
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,857
that's what she does.

572
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,404
And also who is she to
talk about mistreatment?

573
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,198
She duct-taped me
to a fucking chair.

574
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,866
Bryan is

575
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
kind.

576
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,737
I know you guys don't
know him very well yet,

577
00:33:58,761 --> 00:33:59,914
but you'll see.

578
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,082
He's legitimately a great guy.

579
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,624
Yeah, I believe you.

580
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,810
This is stupid.

581
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,853
Like, we just need some evidence
of your mom trying to hurt you,

582
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,345
then we can take it to the cops

583
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:12,842
and you'll be safe, right?

584
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,548
Yeah great idea,

585
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,322
let's just go see my mom,

586
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,370
and you guys can film while
she sacrifices me to the devil.

587
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,101
Sounds like a plan.

588
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
No like what if we got someone
else to back up your story.

589
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,438
Like your sister.

590
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,836
Was she home when
this was happening?

591
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,734
Nah James, my
sister goes to UCLA,

592
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
she won't be home till summer.

593
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:30,833
Swear?

594
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,362
I definitely heard a girl
downstairs when we visited.

595
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,163
You probably just heard the cat,

596
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,742
no one else lives there.

597
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,704
What if it was Katie?

598
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,478
I mean, think about it.

599
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:47,021
What if your mom needed Katie for
the ritual that she's planning,

600
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,253
and so she kidnapped her.

601
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,503
That's insane.

602
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,875
This whole thing's insane,

603
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,690
but I heard the same girl too.

604
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,760
There's definitely
someone in that house.

605
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,975
She could be the
evidence you need,

606
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,345
and if she's there,

607
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,192
we'll be the people
who saved Katie Dawson.

You will,

609

I'll be the one whose mom
kidnapped Katie Dawson.

610

But if she is there,

611
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,939
she needs our help.

612
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,264
How are we going to save her?

613
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,806
We need to get my
mom out of the house

614
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,820
so then someone can go
in and rescue Katie.

there is no chance that

I'm so sorry for
everything that my mom did.

1270
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:47,728
I didn't think she was
capable of any of that.

1271
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,393
Yeah, me neither.

1272
01:16:50,596 --> 01:16:52,834
What do you think you're gonna do
when you get back to your life?

Got any tips?

Well for starters, don't become friends
with someone whose mom worships the devil.

1276
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:01,532
Yeah,

1277
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,175
that's probably a good idea.

1278

You know, I assumed that my girlfriend would be
one of the first people to show up to my grave.

1292
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:32,875
But I guess I was wrong,

1293
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,566
'cause, you didn't even care
enough to show up to my funeral.

Why?

I feel like I can't grieve
like everyone else, you know?

It just doesn't work
like that for me.

Like, I still feel like shit,

1324

but then I'll go home and have
a perfectly nice night of sleep.

should be more distraught.

If I had just
listened to my mom,

1330

Katie would've been
the only one that died.

All my fighting did
was cause more death.

You can't think
about it like that.

They knew it was
going to be dangerous,

1334
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,331
but they weren't just going
to sit back and let Katie die.

1335
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,682
Because of them,

1336
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:43,517
tomorrow, your mom is going to prison and
you're going to be free of her, forever.

die for that to happen.
