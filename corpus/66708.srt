1
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>There either is or is not
a way things are.</i>

2
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>The color of the day.
How it felt to be a child.</i>

3
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,829
<i>The feeling of saltwater
on your sunburned legs.</i>

4
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,959
<i>Sometimes the water is yellow.
Sometimes it's red.</i>

5
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>The color in memory
depends on the day.</i>

6
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>I won't tell the story
the way it happened.</i>

7
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:02,057
<i>I'll tell it the
way I remember it.</i>

8
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,702
Help! Help!

9
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:16,965
What's your name?

10
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,221
- Whisper. What's your name? Whisper!
- Finn.

11
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,139
- What's your last name?
- Bell.

12
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,558
- Where do you live?
- By the pier.

13
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,561
Do you have tools?

14
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,358
Do you know what bolt cutters are?
Do you or don't you?

15
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,986
I can find you
and gut you like a fish.

16
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:42,282
I'll pull out your insides
and make you eat them, hear me?

17
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:48,288
Be here tomorrow at dawn with bolt
cutters and food, or I'll kill you.

18
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,541
I'll kill you if you tell.

19
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,629
- Anyone! Your folks...
- They're dead.

20
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:02,928
If you tell anyone, the last sound
you hear will be your own scream. Go!

21
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,059
Finn!

22
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,104
- Oh, it's you, Joe.
- Did I scare you?

23
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,858
- So you went out today?
- Yeah! I got a nice tan.

24
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,196
No fish.
Setting traps, like everybody.

25
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:07,159
- Where's the fire?
- Nowhere. Just got homework.

26
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:12,956
Maggie's on a kind of rant today,
so you be careful, okay?

27
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,751
- Are you coming home soon?
- In an hour.

28
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,588
If you finish your work,
we'll go to Carvel's.

29
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:24,176
You rest up. We've got
a gardening job tomorrow.

30
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,721
- Joe?
- Yeah?

31
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,934
Nothing.

32
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,021
Hey, Finn!
How do you smoke a swordfish?

33
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,857
Put the bill in your mouth
and light the tail.

34
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,736
I'll see you later.

35
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:48,867
<i>I was raised with some
freedom from my sister, Maggie.</i>

36
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,703
<i>Joe was her man.</i>

37
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:56,667
<i>They banned big fishing rigs
that year, and we were poor.</i>

38
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:02,297
<i>We got by on what Joe earned
on charters and lawn work.</i>

39
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,058
Hey.

40
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,685
Hey.

41
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:51,406
Come on, come here.
Come on!

42
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,624
Are you alone?

43
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,876
- You deaf? Are you alone?
- No.

44
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,631
You're not alone
or you're not deaf?

45
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,066
Here, I brought you
something to drink.

46
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,403
Attaboy!

47
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,851
Here, I took this for you.

48
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,979
What's this?
Birth control pills?

49
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,567
Here, this too.

50
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,155
Percodan.
Attaboy, now you're talking.

51
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:24,208
What else?
Come on, come on, come on!

52
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,428
Do you bite your nails?

53
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,680
That's a bad habit.

54
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:44,686
People say the eyes
are the windows to the soul. Bullshit.

55
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:50,526
Hands. That's the sign of a gentleman.

56
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:57,032
Come on, let's go. Come on.

57
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,953
- What?
- Come on.

58
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,539
- In the boat.
- If I don't get home...

59
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:09,753
Fuck your uncle, get in the boat.
Pick up the anchor. Let's go.

60
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,261
Shut up and get in the boat.

61
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,849
- Where are we going?
- Mexico.

62
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,688
- What?
- Police boat.

63
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,609
Stop!

64
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,386
Ahoy there!
Son, are you all right?

65
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,056
- Where are you headed?
- Nowhere.

66
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:48,268
Some lady thought she saw a raft
here yesterday.

67
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,608
A man on it wearing a prison suit.
Did you see anything like that?

68
00:12:55,359 --> 00:13:00,948
- No.
- Tie up a line. We'll tow you in.

69
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,267
<i>That was the end of it.</i>

70
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:33,981
<i>Perhaps you had an experience
like that as a child and told no one.</i>

71
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,985
<i>Perhaps you had a brush with
a world so large you seldom...</i>

72
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,405
<i>... or never saw it again.</i>

73
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:20,652
Jesus! It's the land time forgot.
Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.

74
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,922
Wait here. I'll find out
what they want us to do.

75
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:47,471
- Is it all right if I look around?
- No! You stay put till I come back.

76
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,850
God knows what's in these weeds.

77
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:15,290
<i>Nora Driggers Dinsmoor,
richest lady in the gulf.</i>

78
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,211
<i>She lost her mind 30 years ago
when her fiancé left her...</i>

79
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,589
<i>... at the altar.</i>

80
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,829
What's your name?

81
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,721
Finn.

82
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,789
Hey, Finn!

83
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,381
We're out of here. She slipped me
$500 under the door.

84
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,093
Gas money, she called it.
Weirdest thing.

85
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,263
- What?
- Nothing. Can I ride with you?

86
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,183
You smell like fertilizer.

87
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:00,771
Really? I do?

88
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,944
Mag!

89
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,906
- You've got the wrong number.
- You won't believe...

90
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:16,495
Yes, well, he just...
Did he do something bad?

91
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:22,167
I'll be glad to.
That sounds really...

92
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,504
You got it. Okay.

93
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:30,926
Three on Saturday. This Saturday?
And thank you so much, ma'am.

94
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,429
You won't believe
where we were today.

95
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,016
That was Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.

96
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,395
It was too good to be true.
She wants her money back?

97
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,897
She wants him. Finn!

98
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,985
The richest lady
in the state calls me...

99
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,238
...and wants my little brother
to play with her niece.

100
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:56,827
"Why"? The old bat liked you.
He's a likable kid, he's adorable.

101
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,999
Who cares? Joe, this is
a really good thing.

102
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,836
How'd she even know...?
Dinsmoor never met Finn.

103
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,922
She slipped this under the door.

104
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,134
What is it, Joe? God!

105
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:17,723
Do you like living with all
the dead people down here?

106
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:24,479
What's wrong with people here?
I'm tired of working so much.

107
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,734
They took away the nets.

108
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:34,198
<i>Convict Arthur Lustig
was recaptured this evening.</i>

109
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,326
<i>This concludes
a four-day manhunt for Lustig...</i>

110
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,120
<i>... the convicted murderer
of Gene Valiente.</i>

111
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,291
<i>Valiente, reputed mob boss
of the Catalano family...</i>

112
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,920
<i>... was gunned down in his home
last Christmas.</i>

113
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,381
<i>Lustig will be returned
to death row...</i>

114
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:58,764
<i>... and is scheduled to die
by lethal injection March 16th.</i>

115
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,026
Holy shit!

116
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,780
Hey, you look sharp.

117
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:21,078
- How do I smell?
- You smell clean. Tea time.

118
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,332
- Be polite. "Yes, ma'am", "No, ma'am".
- I will.

119
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,128
- Are you okay with this?
- He's great. Go ahead.

120
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:35,342
Say, "May I", "Please", all that stuff.

121
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,772
Oh, the gardener.

122
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:58,866
The design of this floor is
from the Alhambra in Spain.

123
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,204
The ceiling's gold leaf, real gold.

124
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,959
It's just like the Thousand
Wing ceiling at Venice's Accademia.

125
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,379
<i>Old Ms. Dinsmoor
hadn't been seen in years.</i>

126
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,506
<i>I'd heard she was crazy.</i>

127
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,216
Go ahead.

128
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,303
Aren't you coming?

129
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:23,849
<i>But nobody knew how crazy.</i>

130
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:29,563
<i>Her room smelled of dead
flowers and cat piss.</i>

131
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,746
Boom boom.

132
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,467
Chicka-boom!

133
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:04,598
<i>Besame, besame mucho</i>

134
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:12,064
<i>Each time I cling to your kiss
I hear music divine</i>

135
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:22,533
<i>Hold me my darling and say
that you'll always be mine</i>

136
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:26,036
<i>This joy's something new, my arms
they're holding you</i>

137
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,705
<i>I never knew this thrill before</i>

138
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:33,919
<i>Whoever thought I'd be holding you
close, whispering...</i>

139
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,923
- Who are you?
- Finn, ma'am.

140
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:43,720
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- I don't know.

141
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:47,808
Give me your hand.

142
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:53,605
- What is this?
- Your... Your boob.

143
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:59,528
My heart. It's my heart. It's broken.

144
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:05,158
- Can you tell?
- I'm sorry.

145
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,954
"Sorry." Come.

146
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,165
Shoo, shoo. Tabby, scram.

147
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,253
Wow! That's the biggest cat
I've ever seen.

148
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,675
- What do you feed it?
- Other cats.

149
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:28,390
Well, go ahead.
You can proceed.

150
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,439
- Dance.
- Huh?

151
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:41,195
I'd like you to dance. That's why
you're here. To entertain me.

152
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:46,158
Pony, foxtrot, frug,
Philly Dog, fandango. Anything.

153
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:50,621
I can't. I'm sorry, ma'am.

154
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,958
You "can't"? "I'm sorry, ma'am."

155
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:59,796
Or you won't? You dance.
Dance, dance, dance!

156
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:06,637
- Get out of here.
- Wait!

157
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,723
I can draw.

158
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,190
You can use my lipstick and eyebrow
pencil on the dressing table.

159
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,112
Estella!

160
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,908
Estella?

161
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,840
- Is tea ready?
- I'd like you to sit for a portrait.

162
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,053
- A portrait? By whom?
- That boy.

163
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,515
The gardener?
I'll be in my room.

164
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,476
Come back and sit.

165
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,813
Please.

166
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:02,734
And you. Come sit by me.

167
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:22,546
She's beautiful, isn't she?

168
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:34,600
What do you think of her?
Come on, whisper in my ear.

169
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,812
Come on.

170
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,526
I think she's a snob.

171
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,654
Anything else?

172
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,703
I think she's real pretty.

173
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,999
Anything else?

174
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,507
I think she doesn't like me.

175
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:11,595
But you love her.
She'll break your heart, it's a fact.

176
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:16,975
It's tragic, you're already in love.
And though I guarantee you...

177
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:24,233
...that the girl will hurt you
terribly, you'll still pursue her.

178
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,779
Ain't love grand?

179
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,009
- I'd like to go now.
- Have you finished?

180
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,512
Before I'm a teenager, please.

181
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:57,641
Can I go now?

182
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:07,025
Would you like to come again?
Would you like to see Estella again?

183
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,279
Yes.

184
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:15,033
Poor boy, poor boy, poor boy.
This is yours, dear.

185
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:20,455
<i>The ways of the rich and all my
longing, which began that day.</i>

186
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:26,253
<i>To paint for the rich, to have
their freedom, to love Estella.</i>

187
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,673
<i>The things we cannot have.</i>

188
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:33,051
Give this to your guardian.

189
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:37,139
Would you see Finn out, please?

190
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,565
Chicka-boom!

191
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,634
Want some?

192
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:16,845
It's not poisoned.

193
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>You remember it.
You remember how it felt.</i>

194
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:18,156
<i>And then I went home to draw it.</i>

195
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:31,253
I'm going to work.
What are you going to do before bed?

196
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,630
Brush my teeth.

197
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,677
That's really beautiful, Finn.

198
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,433
Keep it up, okay?

199
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:48,562
<i>Maggie left that night.
She never came back.</i>

200
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,649
I'll see you when you wake up.

201
00:28:55,527 --> 00:29:00,115
<i>Joe raised me.
We never said a word.</i>

202
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,536
<i>I visited Paradiso Perduto Saturdays.</i>

203
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,998
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it.

204
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,085
<i>The money Dinsmoor paid
kept me in paints and brushes.</i>

205
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,338
<i>And there was Estella.</i>

206
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:28,227
Smile. Smile.

207
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:32,731
Smi... All right, don't smile.

208
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,818
Yes, feel it!

209
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:46,078
Wonderful, wonderful!
Feel it in your bones.

210
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:06,765
- Where are you going?
- Cocktails at Rewald's.

211
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,394
Lane? Another cocktail,
and we'll be able to eat him.

212
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,438
Carl Rewald. Lane is his father.
Carl doesn't drink.

213
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:17,901
Cue balls. The whole family's pickled.
Who's your escort?

214
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:22,906
- Please, this is the '80s...
- I'll bring you.

215
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:33,250
Finn will make a fine date.

216
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,586
Oh, God!

217
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,422
Then it's done.

218
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:45,345
Fine, but you meet me there. 1115
North Ocean. Wear your dinner jacket.

219
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:50,392
- How much time have you got?
- None, I'm late! I'm dead. Wow!

220
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:55,647
That'll pass as a dinner jacket.

221
00:30:56,356 --> 00:31:00,319
- This is a girl's.
- Keep it buttoned, no one will notice.

222
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:03,739
- Where did you get this?
- It's Maggie's.

223
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:08,285
- It's one of the only things she left.
- What a bitch!

224
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,413
What?

225
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:16,335
- "What?" Come here.
- Jesus!

226
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:20,756
- Are you all right for money?
- Yeah, I'm good.

227
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:26,386
- A little nervous?
- Yeah, a little.

228
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:32,017
There you go.

229
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,396
You just be yourself, huh?

230
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,024
Come on, have fun.

231
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:43,862
- You're not on the list.
- Check the name Dinsmoor?

232
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:49,159
I did, sir. You're not on this list.
Please leave now.

233
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:55,791
Hi, Mrs. Lee!
Use your usual spot.

234
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:02,381
Hi.

235
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:06,552
- Do you want to get me out of here?
- Yes.

236
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,888
Come on in.

237
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:14,685
- Where do you want to go?
- Your house?

238
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:20,858
All right. Let's go.

239
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:33,996
The moths are
from the Thousand Wing ceiling.

240
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:42,212
Joe's not here. He's...
He's playing dominoes.

241
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:46,967
- Is that your room?
- Yeah.

242
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:52,806
I wasn't really
expecting company...

243
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:56,310
...you know.

244
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:06,987
- You still draw.
- Yeah.

245
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:10,324
They're hanging a couple
at Washington Federal.

246
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:14,119
The bank?

247
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,914
- Go to New York.
- New York?

248
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,957
Center of the art world.

249
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:25,339
Here, you'll end up painting
coconuts for tourists.

250
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:36,600
- When did you do this?
- A while ago.

251
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:42,147
I don't wear my hair like that
anymore.

252
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,359
But you should.

253
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:50,030
- I mean...
- Do you like it that way?

254
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:11,134
What else do you like?

255
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:20,853
How come we see each other
every week, but we never did anything?

256
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:25,440
- "Did anything"?
- Saw a movie, whatever.

257
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,694
You never asked.

258
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:32,197
And if I had?

259
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:39,705
I'm here, aren't I?

260
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:47,379
- Are you with anyone?
- Right this second?

261
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:53,844
- No, I mean like...
- Like a steady boyfriend?

262
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,514
No.

263
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:05,898
- You could have anyone.
- No, I...

264
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,285
What about you?

265
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:40,432
- Why not?
- 'Cause I...

266
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:46,855
I just...

267
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,864
I know.

268
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,910
I know.

269
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,920
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

270
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:56,758
- It's late. What time is it?
- It's 10:30. Where are you going?

271
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:02,806
I've got to get home.
I have a million things to do tonight.

272
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,643
Stay!

273
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:18,655
Don't speak French.

274
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,350
Estella?

275
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:55,526
Excuse me. Have you seen Estella?

276
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:06,828
<i>Dinsmoor was weirder than
usual, but I had to see Estella.</i>

277
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:17,714
I never come here. Never.

278
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:23,345
Do you know why?
Twenty-six years ago, I trusted.

279
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:31,311
I saved myself. I was a virgin.
It's funny, huh?

280
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:38,402
Those were the times,
that's how I was raised.

281
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:43,699
What kind of creature takes
such a thing, such a gift, a trust?

282
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:48,787
Who does this? Takes advantage
of a 42-year-old woman?

283
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:54,918
What kind of creature leaves
this woman waiting like a fool?

284
00:38:55,169 --> 00:39:02,384
A man does this, so men must pay.
Am I right?

285
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,222
- Estella will make men weep.
- Do you know where she is?

286
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,100
She'll break them.
I taught her well.

287
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:15,439
When she returns, she'll cut through
them like a hot knife through butter.

288
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:19,443
- Returns?
- Oh, my dear boy!

289
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,404
Didn't you know?

290
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:27,201
She's left for school.
Switzerland for two years, then Paris.

291
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:34,124
Didn't she say goodbye?
I'm sure she meant to.

292
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:46,845
See you next week, dear.

293
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:09,368
<i>Seven years passed.</i>

294
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,412
<i>I stopped going to Paradiso Perduto.</i>

295
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,164
<i>I stopped painting.</i>

296
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,125
<i>I put aside fantasy and the wealthy...</i>

297
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,420
<i>... and the heavenly girl
who did not want me.</i>

298
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:25,676
<i>None of it would happen to me again.
I'd seen through it.</i>

299
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,471
<i>I elected to grow up.</i>

300
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:13,473
Finn! This is Jerry Ragno.

301
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:17,436
Jerry, Mr. Ragno
is a lawyer in Miami.

302
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:22,691
And New York. We have
offices in Manhattan. So, Finn...

303
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:28,572
...I'm empowered by my client
to make your dreams come true.

304
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:37,039
Really? Any particular dream
or just all of them?

305
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,833
Have you ever shown your work?
No.

306
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,003
They had Finn's painting
at Washington Federal Bank.

307
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:49,593
Eight years ago. I gave all that up.
I don't understand what this is about.

308
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:55,641
How would you like a one-man show
at the Thrall Gallery?

309
00:41:55,891 --> 00:42:01,230
My client, Erica Thrall, wants you
in New York for a one-man show.

310
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,108
Have you ever sent slides
to the Thrall Gallery?

311
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,320
I sent slides everywhere
in high school.

312
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,199
They made an impression.
A ticket to New York...

313
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,827
...plus $ 1000 for incidentals.

314
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:21,083
Sorry, they're all in hundreds.

315
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:38,183
The hundreds aren't the problem.
I just... I don't paint anymore.

316
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:51,530
<i>Whose business was it
what I did with my life?</i>

317
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,451
<i>Who'd gotten my life in order? Me.
I was in control.</i>

318
00:42:56,702 --> 00:43:01,206
<i>And everything I wanted, I had.</i>

319
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:06,837
Ms. Dinsmoor?
Are cocktails ready, Thomas?

320
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:11,550
No, it's me. It's Finn.

321
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,344
- I came...
Looking for Estella.

322
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:20,851
- That hook is in deep, isn't it, dear?
- I came to ask you a question.

323
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:25,355
After nearly 10 years
without a word, without a visit...

324
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:29,234
...you've come to interrogate me.
How interesting.

325
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:34,948
- I'm sorry. Things happened.
- The love of your life left you.

326
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:40,329
It hurts, doesn't it?
Come closer.

327
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:55,844
I've gone red.

328
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,016
- I noticed. It's nice.
- And look at you.

329
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:05,354
All grown up. A man.

330
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:09,399
Ms. Dinsmoor, a lawyer named Ragno
came to see me.

331
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,319
- The spider.
- Do you know him?

332
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:17,491
"Ragno" means "spider" in Italian.
You must learn other languages.

333
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:23,080
He represents an art gallery owner in
New York who wants to show my work.

334
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,085
You can draw. Can't dance
worth a shit, but you can draw.

335
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:32,130
Did you know anything about this?

336
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:39,346
- Estella is in New York.
- I doubt our paths will cross.

337
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:44,434
- So you're going?
- Should I?

338
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:52,276
I remember watching you
from that very window.

339
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:59,324
Scared little mouse scurrying across
my garden and through my front door.

340
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:07,249
Now another door opens.
What will our mouse do?

341
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,134
- I expect an invitation.
- I'm sorry?

342
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:22,681
To your opening, your show.

343
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:32,691
- What equipment are you flying?
- What?

344
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,277
Is it a wide body or a 767?

345
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:39,615
I've no idea,
I just hope it stays up there.

346
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:44,077
- You'd better get on.
- Yeah.

347
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:49,917
What happens if I get up there
and I can't deliver?

348
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:55,714
Finn. There's nothing harder
than being given your chance.

349
00:45:55,964 --> 00:46:00,969
- At least that's what I hear.
- Yeah?

350
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:56,483
Taxi!

351
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,739
- Have you got change for a dollar?
- What?

352
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:09,746
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

353
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,499
<i>Well, then, there I was.</i>

354
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:17,504
<i>Ms. Dinsmoor, as my secret benefactor,
sent me to New York to draw.</i>

355
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:20,549
<i>To have the girl, to have it all.</i>

356
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:25,554
<i>And I looked out on the great city,
as so many before, which held it all.</i>

357
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:29,016
<i>And it was that close,
and it was mine.</i>

358
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:36,190
"Liebchen, guten Morgen." Are you still
holding the red and green Picasso?

359
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,528
I think I have somebody interested.
No, I can't say right now.

360
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:47,701
Just the Picasso.
<i>Fabelhaft. Danke.</i>

361
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:51,705
Here's where you
show me your work, darling.

362
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:56,668
- I told you, I don't have any.
- Then you'd better get busy.

363
00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:00,714
Why am I here?
You saw some slides?

364
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:05,469
I gave Keith Haring a show
after he drew a sketch in my hand.

365
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,721
But which paintings did you like?

366
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:12,100
I saw the beginning of something,
and here you are.

367
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,394
Annette, Sotheby's.

368
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:21,068
What you do is up to you. Stay and
paint or enjoy the sights and go home.

369
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:25,280
Either way, I always enjoy
meeting a young painter.

370
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:29,701
Look, I mean, I'll do it.

371
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:35,082
I said that I'll do the paintings.

372
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:41,505
Wonderful. Call Marcy
when you have something for us.

373
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:52,182
<i>And I could still draw.</i>

374
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:56,353
<i>Nothing had lessened it as much
as I had abused it, abandoned it.</i>

375
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:59,982
<i>It was a gift, and it was still mine.</i>

376
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:03,318
<i>And everything else was less real.</i>

377
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,822
<i>What can it mean?
That picture of the world.</i>

378
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:11,577
<i>But when it's true, we recognize it
in ourselves, in others.</i>

379
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:18,500
<i>We recognize it, like love,
completely undeserved.</i>

380
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:38,437
You're drooling.

381
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:42,816
So, Finn Bell.
In New York.

382
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,484
That's right.

383
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:49,573
I thought I saw you last Christmas.
I was driving down 5th.

384
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,742
I just got here.

385
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:56,038
Actually, now that I see you,
this guy was bigger.

386
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:59,291
- He's bigger.
- Fatter.

387
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,586
- He had long hair.
- You thought it was me?

388
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:09,134
- I hadn't seen you in years.
- It has been a while.

389
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:13,639
And here we are.

390
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:20,938
- I have to run.
- Wait, maybe we could...

391
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,901
Tomorrow at the Borough Club
around 6. I'm meeting some friends.

392
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:29,154
If you're free, that is.

393
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:33,116
I'm free.

394
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,163
I'm glad you're here.

395
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,632
<i>A long time ago there lived
two brilliant artists. True geniuses.</i>

396
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:53,220
<i>One day one of them
was painting out in the forest...</i>

397
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,766
<i>... and he came upon this dog
who was crying, obviously lost.</i>

398
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:01,895
<i>A puppy.
Yes, sure. A puppy, fine.</i>

399
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:06,733
<i>He couldn't concentrate anyway,
so he scooped the puppy up...</i>

400
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:10,195
<i>... and took him into town
to find its owner...</i>

401
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:13,907
<i>... who turned out to be
the prince of the kingdom...</i>

402
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:17,786
<i>... who was eternally grateful
and very wealthy.</i>

403
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:22,374
That artist's name was Michelangelo.
True story.

404
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:28,172
The other artist's name was... Nobody
knows, he was never heard from again.

405
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:31,133
Right, that's so true, Walter.

406
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:34,553
Can I smoke?

407
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:42,519
- It's your last one.
- That's all right.

408
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:46,648
So you... Cigarette, please.
You're from Florida too?

409
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,943
- Yes.
- Everybody is from Florida.

410
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:53,197
I'm not, I hate Florida.
Too much sun.

411
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,907
Really?

412
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:58,368
Actually, Finn was my childhood...

413
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,164
What were you exactly?
