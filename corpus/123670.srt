- Too much oak and secondary

- Huh.

You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

266
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,285
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

267
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,880
and it just cools down the berries.

268

Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

Let me show you how this is done.

271
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,437
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

- Okay.

Now tip it.

277
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,844
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

278
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,857
That's gonna tell you how old it is,

about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

323
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,923
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,925
So I'm thinking about it.

325
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,927
But I don't know.

326
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,929
Might get a little incestuous.

A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

- No way! No.

This would just provide some stability.

00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:51,001
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

She's worked here a year,year and a half.

When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

368
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,489
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

369

Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

371

What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

about this woman.

Well, she does know a lot about wine.

focus on the negative?

it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

and gaining complexity.
