"COLLIDE"

00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:28,357
Reasons,

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,868
We all got our reasons to do crazy,

4
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:34,774
and reckless in life.

5
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,027
Mostly they don't help you none.

6
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:41,175
Not when you are left to pick up the pieces.

7
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,709
But if the reason is love,

8
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:49,793
Maybe not so crazy, because people believe in love.

9
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,644
They know it keeps the world turning.

10
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,528
And right now,

11
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,823
That's the only thing keeping me alive.

"Cologne-Germany"

13
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:03,657
What did you do?
What did you say you wanted?

14
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,469
Double.

15
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,953
American?

16
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:37,924
It is so obvious?
No, no, no I heard you at the bar.

17
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,791
I mean it's like fate right?

18
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:45,534
You know two Americans in the middle of a rave, Germany?

19
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,795
Do you believe in fate? 
Is that a line?

20
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:53,168
That's cold ...
With lines like that you better expect it!

21
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,230
I'm going to start again.

22
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,896
Oh, HI!
Hey!

23
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,584
Do you believe in fate?

24
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:07,326
I guess not, it sort of takes the fun things, you know?

25
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:09,716
What if you did more exciting?

26
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,400
Are you high?
No, no, but...

27
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:16,999
My point is everything that happens, 
has already happened. Its fate.

29
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:22,820
Oh that's more exciting, because...
You have already given me your phone number so what is the difference?

30
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,835
I knew it was a line!

31
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:29,100
I did work better in my head, like the build up and everything I don't know.
I admire the ground work.

32
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,511 
Thank-you, yeh!

33
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,158
I'm Casey. 
Juliette.

34
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,074
Juliet what?

35
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:42,415
If it's fate and we slept together you should know my last name.

36
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,179
What?

37
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,919
Wait!
Hang on!

38
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:51,938
So what are you doing here?

39
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,563
What this place?
In Germany.

40
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,204
You wanna know the truth?

41
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:58,109
Preferably...

42
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:02,403
Um I got into bad stuff in States.

43  
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:05,340
Nothing serious, just young and stupid and...

44
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:09,115
decided to use some of the money I had to leave, see the world.

45
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,459
You got to go back?
No.

46
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,249
Nothing to go back to.

47
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,189
How about you?

48
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:18,398
Originally to study.

49
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,600
and get away from my parents.

50
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,146
They did a lot of drugs...

51
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:27,717
a lot of fighting and not a lot of being parents. 

52
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,364
You um, you still studying?

53
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,074
Not, I'm not sure what I doing.

54
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:42,254
Oh, while you're not sure, you want to spend your time with me?

55
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,421
With you? 
Yeah!

56
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:45,623
Well, I um...

57
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,862
I appreciate asking and you're cute, nice and everything, but...

58
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:56,987
But I've seen here, and what you're involved in.

59
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:01,098
I have no objection, we all like to party.

60
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,395
It's just that in my experience, guys into that lifestyle...

61
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,629
It's not the guys I'm looking for.

62
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:11,199
No, I'm not your typical...
No, No I...

63 
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,202
I don't think you are.

64
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:18,738
If you ever decide to make it official... 
you can let me know.

65
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21
Wow...

66
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:29,662
Anyway it was nice to meet you. 
Ya you too.

67
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:31,064
See you around.

68
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,267
Party boy!

69
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,926
What's going on? 
Stop flirting with those guys.

70
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:45,262
Seriously, Geran is waiting for us.

71
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:53,864
Look at this!

72
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,698
You like John Travolta?

73
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,614
Have you seen this movie? "Perfect"? 

74
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,142
With Jamie Curtis, butt aerobico.

75
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:02,361
Good film.

76
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,470
Acting not so much but Travolta

77
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,432
Shit, that man! He should have Oscar.

78
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,342
Who this?

79
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,681
I'm Casey.
What?

80
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,806
I've been working for six months.

81
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,161
What?

82
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,028
Casey!

83
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,002
Oh yeah. Casey!

84
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,518
The drugs they affect my eyes.

85
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,846
She's big time car thief of America.

86
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,080
Tell her how many cars you steal?

87
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,501
I do not know...

88
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,775
I guess it was one too many.

89
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,111
You want to make more?

90
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,438
Yea.
I need someone like you,

91
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,500
Burt Reynolds, a nobody, but smart.

92
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,440
And someone like you Grease Lightning, 

93
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,047
A nobody, but crazy.

94
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,015
It's time to step up.

95
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:01,188
What is it? 
Special job. A lot of money.

96
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:02,069
You in?

97
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:02,766
Yea we're in.

98
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,313
Hang on wait no. What it is? It is dangerous?

99
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,765
What kind of question is that?

100
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,976  
Of course it's dangerous.

101
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,836
Do you want a safe job?

102
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,984
You work in IKEAs, do not question me!

103
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:15,953
If you do not want, I do not care.

104
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:18,703
You want to go out there collecting money till you get knifed?

105
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,016
That up to you, I clean the place to like that.

106
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,289
I care about my employees, offer you something better.

107
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:27,549
You want it?

108
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:29,786
Yes or no?

109
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,909
I just make it official 
Thank-you.

110
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:39,995
What?

111
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,973
I just make it official, quit my job.

112
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,831
Now you have no excuses to go on a date with me.

113
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:46,364
Are you serious?

114
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,549
Completely.

115
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,343
You're crazy.

116
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:53,544
No, no I'm just a risk taker and you seem worth the risk.

117
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:58,975
Come on, just one date, that's all I'm asking.

118
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:26,118
You know we've seen eachother 
every for the last month.

119
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,301
Yes, I have been following you around.
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,510
We should move in together.

121
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:45,451
Cool!

122
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:22,357
I love you!

123
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:34,764
Hey.
Hey, how are you?

124
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:36,576
Good how about you?

125
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,513
Good.

126 
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,773
You want a beer?

127
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,051
You look cute.

128
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,526
Come here.

129
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,390
What have you been doing?

130
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:05,848
Missed you. 
Missed you.

131
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,537
- So?

132
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,581
- So?

133
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,693
I gotta go to work.

134
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm not stopping you. 
You are.

135
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:20,848
Just a little

136
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,982
Maybe I can be late.

137
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,157
Geran.
Haggen.

138
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,519
Well...

139
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,096
How's family? 
Good.

140
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,639
Yours?

141
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:54,351
I spend more time with horses. 
They don't ask for so much.

142
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:56,764
Yeh.

143
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,275
What do you ask for, Geran?

144
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,012
What do you ask for from me?

145
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,434
Equil partnership.

146
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:11,838
I see. 
We've worked together a long time.

147
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:13,434
A long time.

148
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,525
Never never cheat you. 
Never once.

149
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
I take risks.

150
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,189
Oh I know.

151
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:25,064
You take most of the return.

152
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:26,534
Of course.

153
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,825
I supply the product. Without which would be nothing.

154
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:31,160
I accept it. I accept it

155
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:34,439
Good

156
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:37,608
Good

157 
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,236
From a business point of view Geran.

158
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:46,024
Why should I give you what you ask me?

159
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:50,118
From the point of view of justice.

160
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,705
You must appeal to my better nature

161
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,920
That is wrong?

162
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,799
It is little surprise, your pedis more money

163
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,043
No, it's not about the money.

164
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,455
- It is society - If

165
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,996
My kind keep us in our place

166
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,031
I know you'll say no, absolutely

167
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,220
I know.

168
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,510
But I needed to know.

169
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:23,006
I had to hear it.

170
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:32,546
Geran, the work you do, the risks you take,

171
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,096
They make you deserve at least half of what we earn together.

172
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:41,929
But the person you are compared to the person I am.

173
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,882
It forces me to reject, to refuse what you ask

174
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,386
It is a question of character, refinement

175
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,318
value, attitudinal

176
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:55,161
what you do not know anything.

177
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,963
Feel comfortable in your place, Geran.

178
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:02,302
Fit well in it.

179
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,767
But you never have a society with me,

180
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,957
in any sense of the word.

181
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,876
Look at these people,

182
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:33,384
They are there, in your little party, 
thinking it would last forever.

183
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:36,272
- Do nothing forever? - Nothing

184
00:14:38,132 --> 00:14:39,199
That is the point.

185
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,564
Let rise, to warm, to have sex.

186
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,892
You look sexy. 
You're so romantic.

187
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,018
I am a very lucky girl. For you.

188
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:57,274
Because you crazy psychopath alejanste of that shift.

189
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,497
I'm proud of you, Casey Stein.

190
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:04,738
It worked well

191
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,338
Okay, the challenge is ...

192
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:12,373
we stay in underwear, we get into the snow ...

193
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:15,727
walk around the block, naked ...

194
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:20,118
- Can I stay with your socks on? - Do not

195
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,877
- Okay, hagasmolo. - Naked ... NOW!

196
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,920
¿Quitate all, okay?

197
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:33,068
It's too cold, I'm going to stay with the boxer.

198
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,816
It's so cold ...!

199
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,234
Lying down ... NOW!

200
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:44,633
It is very cold....

201
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:51,731
Won

202
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,522
You're good?

203
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,856
Baby, come

204
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:04,851
You're good? Jules.

205
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:26,876
Now we have the blood pressure under control, you must take great care

206
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:33,254
We must prepare to face the protection clause

207
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,379
Sorry, but I'll be honest.

208
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,831
His status in this country

209
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,850
It does not give them a right to full medical program required

210
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:50,017
But obviously, are not you refused Hemodialysis, sorry ...

211
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,720
You say you need dialysis?

212
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,316
Yes of course.

213
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:03,148
Well, lately a kidney transplant is the only solution.

214
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:08,196
And time is critical, but we can not help you, sorry.

215
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:14,749
- Why do you hide me? - What is the problem?

216
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:19,181
You listened? I need a transplant and do not give me.

217
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,143
You know, you're everything to me

218
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,925
You can imagine how I feel?

219
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:26,509
How you feel?

220
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:58,465
For.

221
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,285
You're good?

222
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,642
Shit, almost they Shot them both.

223
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:35,257
Burt Reynolds, he returned ...

224
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:37,936
I knew it.

225
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,157
Come in.

226
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:53,856
Do not close the door?

227
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:07,443
You look slow.

228
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:10,928
You want a woman?

229
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,476
Champangne, cocaine, viagra, take what you want

230
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:14,574
I just went for the money.

231
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,296
For that we all live, to earn money.

232
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:25,235
For that, I have horses in Turkey

233
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,584
You know the difference between a career and cabllo a whore?

234
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:37,052
Me neither. You want to find out?

235
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,669
Bye Bye.

236
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,141
All outside ...

237
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:06,674
- Hagen Kahl, you've heard of him? - Do not

238
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,088
Agree.

239
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,793
He is the number one in this business.

240
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,606
Hagen Kahl Logistic, is completely legal, efficient and reliable

241
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,231
German all that shit.

242
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,564
It has extreme security

243
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,473
Not so legal, everyone watches their actions

244
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:24,967
Hagen Khal, has an army

245
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,366
Bring a lot of drugs

246
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:31,493
Which of course is not at all legal

247
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:34,155
Every six months...

248
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,016
A truck traveling from Rotterdam to Cologne spring.

249
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,513
Each truck load 4,000 cubic feet of golf balls

250
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,483
Filled with cocaine from Chile

251
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:51,137
The cargo is delivered to the warehouse of Hagen.

252
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:52,773
Emptying them in stock

253
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:55,648
Giving it to Geran for distribution

254
00:21:56,626 --> 00:22:00,359
Geran delivers gains 500 euro

255
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,471
You know, easy to transport

256
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,985
Finally Hagen money hidden inside lel

257
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,259
luxury car.

258
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,503
5 million each.

259
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:12,968
The export in ships, that after returning to Chile

260
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,140
and the cycle is complete

261
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:20,395
This businessman, Purebred English and German blood

262
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:24,658
family man, but not the best drug dealer

263
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,670
- Do not forget that. - Do not.

264
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:30,094
Now, the same type drives truck on each trip.

265
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,098
Does not drink or smoke, do not use drugs

266
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,414
no history, very reliable

267
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:36,792
No sleep for 48 hours

268
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:38,670
It does not stop to pee

269
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,381
Always on time. It is a psychopath.

270
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:44,406
As a terminator of driving.

271
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:47,576
A security camera on the roof of the truck.

272
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:48,966
GPS

273
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,051
So I need someone like Burt Reynolds

274
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:58,938
a nobody but ready

275
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,091
And you Chris Ligthning, a nobody but crazy.

276
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:04,800
If you descrubes like stealing the truck Burt Reynolds, you bring me

277
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,030
Then, you'll earn your money.

278
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:08,665
250,000 each

279
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,790
Now tell me...

280
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:16,415
Are you racehorse or a fucking bitch?

281
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,503
JULIETTE and casey

282
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:32,829
Listen, I think there is a way.

283
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:35,001
What do you mean?

284
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:39,181
We return to the United States and paid the transplant ourselves

285
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,579
You do not think I did not think the same?

286
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,906
They are almost 200,000

287
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,514
We can barely pay the rent.

288
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:50,524
Fails to work on the trailer and I will be what I was doing.

289
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:52,499
Hare honest money.

290
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:55,534
Money Honestly?

291
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:01,088
What you gonna do? Steal all Las Vegas casinos?

292
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,141
A night of glorious chaos?

293
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,311
There is a way to get money. I can do it.

294
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,347
And I can take care of myself too, but no offense.

295
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:12,973
I did long before I met you.

296
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:17,071
I go back to work only with Geran, I make real good money then ...

297
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:18,463
No, Casey.

298
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:21,917
I do not want to do that for me.

299
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,924
Are you all that I have, okay?

300
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,033
The only thing I try to do is protect you.

301
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,187
Promise you will not.

302
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,121
BOOT PUB

303
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,510
It's okay

304
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:01,118
Snake bite ...

305
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:04,147
Two parts of Jack Daniels and tequila part of Tabasco.

306
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,296
Please TPOR this is serious

307
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:10,005
I'm serious, I worked all week, and it's my day off.

308
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:12,254
And we've gone over this 100 times. I need a drink.

309
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,575
Yes, but CONCENTRATE two minutes and then we can drink.

310
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,308
I concentrate, tiger's eye.

311
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:18,980
Then we hit the truck here as we speak ...

312
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,705
- What is that? - For real?

313
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,056
The burner is the bike, the cup is the car.

314
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:27,137
We crashed the bike against the car and make it look like an accident.

315
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:29,085
When the truck stops, the driver will

316
00:25:29,147 --> 00:25:31,347
- And that's our chance - I have it

317
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:35,516
Okay, I will take the GPS and you take care of the driver

318
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:39,341
I tell these guys dominate the pressure.

319
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:43,204
They hit you with the counterattack, always one step ahead.

320
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:46,136
This year won the League, will be great.

321
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,260
What? I put money in this game.

322
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,033
It was something you said.

323
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:56,008
I say so many things.

324
00:25:56,732 --> 00:26:00,398
Yes, but mastering the pressure, stay one step adelante'.

325
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,878
We need a counter.

326
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:18,917
Jules

327
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,078
Ready.

328
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,686
He told me that if you died ...

329
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I have to move on and forget about you.

330
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:08,078
Well, I can not do this.

331
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:13,582
That wait for you to die, it is not for us

332
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,110
We have to move, we will do whatever it takes

333
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:34,947
Let's move on

334
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,749
You have them ?, you have it?

335
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,479
Com'on com'on!

336
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:04,889
Go Go...

340
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:45,501
You're good?

341
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,025
We said no guns.

342
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,457
You said no guns

343
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:16,413
GPS disconnected

344
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,444
connected GPS

345
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:56,499
Continue on the road and use the GPS.

346
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,233
¿Be careful, okay?

347
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,416
The truck has been stolen

348
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,393
They try to escape through the south road

349
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:52,342
Send the team.

350
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,039
No answer ... no answer ...

351
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:58,759
What happens friend, where are you? We need to see Geran in an hour.

352
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,227
Call now, I'm in place. Now!

353
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,498
Good morning.

354
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,631
Rarely I meet people like you.

355
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:48,435
If they try to rob me, I take what's mine, but there is something ...

356
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:53,448
what I'm very attracted to, I wonder who would be this man?

357
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,593
Who will sent?

358
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:57,902
I wonder.

359
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:06,532
What if about you is that you're American, because my friends

360
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:10,311
They tell me you were talking while you were unconscious

361
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:14,029
It is typical of an American ...

362
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:17,320
and judging by your damn refusal to talk now that you are fully aware

363
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:18,877
I guess that makes you

364
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:21,252
an American very brave or ...

365
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:25,608
one too stupid. No, you let me know.

366
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:32,080
But you and I are confident that we can skip all this boring talk

367
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,904
to Silvester Stallone, you know?

368
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:39,631
You just give me the name or names of the clowns who sent you

369
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:41,443
Your idiot boss.

370
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:43,404
I was ... It was my idea.

371
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,978
I want you to know right now, Lord ...

372
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,830
that at no time have I condemned for what you did

373
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:56,634
Our line of work, is quite brutal, ruthless rather not?

374
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:01,999
You and I sitting nuna we would expect, of course not.

375
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,614
We fight to reach the top.

376
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:10,913
Welcome to the big stupid world in which we all live

377
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:15,816
But no one gives a shit, because that's how it is, brother.

378
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,353
It always has been and will be until the end

379
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:24,298
Amen ... Hallelujah ...

380
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:27,500
Great and brave World!

381
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:30,469
And...

382
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:32,988
You....

383
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,187
They dont know anything...

384
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:43,076
You have to drink enough water to start talking

385
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:47,687
because your mouth will become very dry from fear, you know?

386
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,072
That's what they told you?

387
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,130
Ah, yes, my father ...

388
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:58,143
My father was an officer in question quite famous during the war.

389
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:00,955
A very warm Wednesday afternoon

390
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,128
July 21, 1944, no ...

391
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:07,956
No, it was in 43

392
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:13,386
God, I've always hated Wednesdays.

393
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:20,925
Yes, I remember that was hidden in the coat of my father

394
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,120
I must have been playing hide and seek with my sister, you know?

395
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,583
And suddenly I discovered this briefcase, the briefcase of my father

396
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,968
Full of photographs of the methods of interrogation of my father.

397
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:37,695
They were horrible, disgusting. My father was sinister, disgusting and evil

398
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,042
and vicious beast.

399
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,743
And he called the sense of duty.

400
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:47,130
But people who knew him respected him, he was afraid

401
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:48,683
I hated

402
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:54,960
After he died, urinate on his grave everywhere

403
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,842
So suddenly I'm your son, but I have not earned their respect.

404
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,758
I hate the pain, hate torture, but ...

405
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,434
I leave that to my friends.

406
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:07,634
I only thing I do is give the final blow.

407
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:08,736
The final blow.

408
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,959
Well, I take a flight.

409
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:18,271
Thank you

410
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:23,509
I have to attend the birthday party of my wife, you know?

411
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,000
And ah my three beautiful daughters they would severly ...  

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31:000
CHASTISE ME!!!

412
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:36,156
You know what women like, don't you?

413
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,425
So I'll leave you in good hands, okay?

414
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,914
Chao!

415
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:47,302
Oh, one other thing, I noticed your 
wrist band the name Juliette Marne.

416
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:52,258 
They tell me that you were calling
her when you were unconscious.

417 
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,663
Leave her out of this. I promise  
she has nothing to do with it.

418
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,952
Americans are extraordinary 
should be all that psychoanalysis.
 
419
00:40:56,976 --> 00:41:00,010
Maybe I should have it, oh am I screwed up for it?

420
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:04,375
So, finally, if you do not give us the information we need

421
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,719
I'm sure she will.

422
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:09,544
Auvidesein, my friend

423
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,846
Hey, I've got what you need, wait!

424
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:32,357
- Hello Hello

425
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:34,407
What's going on?  You're good?

426
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:37,095
If I'm right, just that I have just the battery.

427
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:38,538
Where were you last night?

428
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,681
It was home of Matthias

429
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:45,373
But Casey, you promised me not to come back

430
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:47,539
Yes, it's not what you think

431
00:43:47,831 --> 00:43:50,156
I was thinking we should leave town for a while

432
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,847
Just you and me, away to take a break.

433
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:53,746
Look, I saw your letter

434
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:55,874
Only me...

435
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,397
Do not I need all this lie, okay?

436
00:43:58,817 --> 00:44:00,350
Do you know what today is, right?

437
00:44:00,842 --> 00:44:01,942
Yes, I know, look ...

438
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,123
- I go home and ... - No

439
00:44:04,196 --> 00:44:05,863
I can not do this now, okay?

440
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:07,412
Jules, I'm sorry.

441
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,521
I'll be home soon, please. Just wait for me...

442
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:10,548
I have to go.

443
00:44:11,922 --> 00:44:12,922
Jules?

444
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,084

He's got a gun. He's got a gun.

452
00:50:53,993 --> 00:50:54,993
Autopista

455
00:51:12,108 --> 00:51:15,441
Listen, listen, I need you to do something for me.

456
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:16,956
Juliette is in trouble.

457
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:18,950
- What? - She's in trouble.

458
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:21,035
She's at the hospital, she's heading home.

459

Hello?

470
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:39,336
It's like a story Juliette and her Romeo.  

471
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:42,330
That's William Shakespeare, Brutal.

472
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:45,969
Many innocent characters of his died violent  
and meaningless deaths like,

473
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,160
Juliette and her Romeo. Poor Casey Stein.

00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,607
No, NO, I did not give you up! 
I didn't say anything.

490
00:53:59,747 --> 00:54:01,280
It went wrong, But I busted out, but I stole a car.

491
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:04,569
It was one of Hagen's cars drop cars, okay?

00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,885
Okay? She's at Kieser Straser 237 apartment 12b.

00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:26,915
Get her out of there.

501
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,888
Oh, Come on!

502
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:22,006

503
01:01:22,448 --> 01:01:26,215

I think someone got here first. Call me back, okay?

508
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:36,271

512
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:19,893
On Three.

513
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:24,800
[For security reasons we do not accept EUR 500 banknotes]

514
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:29,571
It's too much? 
You can keep the change, okay? Keep it.

515
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:32,744
Come on. Come on, you can see I'm in a mess here.

516
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:34,871
I need your help, I screwed up.

517
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:40,039
I really screwed this up! 

518
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:46,172
I was trying to doing the right 
thing for her but it was stupid.

519
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,513
Told her I would not do it again.

520
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:52,636
I mean she told me, told me not to this and I promised and,

521
01:02:56,061 --> 01:02:57,595
now I might of gotten her killed.

522
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:02,970
I know you do not know me, but I'm not a bad guy.

523
01:03:03,744 --> 01:03:05,611
But the people chasing me.

524
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,180
They are going to kill the love of my life 
if I do not get to Cologne in time.

525
01:03:08,949 --> 01:03:11,749
Give me that gas and let me drive out of here,

526
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:13,875
I'll be the luckiest guy alive.

527
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:17,369
You don't... I probably deserve that too.

528
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:21,057
I do but she doesn't, Okay?
  
529
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,366
She doesn't deserve any of this.

531
01:03:35,404 --> 01:03:37,004
Thank you! You are a god damn... 

532
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:40,153
I want to kiss you but I won't, 
you know you are a saint, Thank-you!

534
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:05,859
Hey, easy!

536
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,667
I do not understand what you saying.

537
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:16,749
Get down, get down!

539
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,056
I do not understand what you say.

543
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:49,196
It's okay. Look you do not want to...  
You do not want to get involved with these guys, okay?

544
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:50,995
Just put it down. Put it down. Please.

545
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:52,833
You have to get out of here.
Let them go.  

546
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:04,381

01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,951

550
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:13,375
Wolfgang

551
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:17,737
Sorry a little louder, I'm a little hard of hearing. 
It is the age, you understand.

552
01:05:18,307 --> 01:05:19,707
My name is Wolfgang

553
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,140
Wolfgang?

554
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:26,122
You mean after Amadeus Mozart?

555
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:30,795
Do you speak English, Wolfgang?

556
01:05:32,694 --> 01:05:34,094
Don't play his games, don't.

557
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,927
Please, I'm talking to my friend Wolfgang.

558
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:39,761
Sorry, Wolfy.

559
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:42,804
Do you speak the English?

560
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,507 
A little bit.

561
01:05:45,813 --> 01:05:47,213
That's good, is very good.

562 
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:48,873
Therefore I will speak slowly.

563
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:51,402
Do you like Mozart, Wolfgang?

564
01:05:52,154 --> 01:05:53,154 
Sure.
Good.

565
01:05:54,323 --> 01:05:55,756
Well, you will be meeting him soon.

566
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:57,947
Listen I've been hunting deer since I was 12.

567
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,290
and they are five times faster than you.

568
01:06:01,705 --> 01:06:02,905
And I very rarely miss.

569
01:06:03,322 --> 01:06:05,622
And from this range I barely have to aim.

570
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:07,412
And I'll blow your head from here to Düsseldorf.

571
01:06:12,716 --> 01:06:14,116
It wasn't a discussion.  

572
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:18,309
Now it is his time.

573
01:06:20,325 --> 01:06:21,992 
The painless coup de gras.

574
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:27,904
Well.

575
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:32,123
Obiously I've miss judged you, my friend.

576
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:37,608
In my experience, people who are about to die, usually cry,

577
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:40,143
or prays or beg a little.

578
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:45,197
But laugh a little, well, that is original.

579
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:49,045
You really are an exceptional young man, arn't you!

580
01:06:50,995 --> 01:06:51,995
You don't see it do you?

581
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:55,748
No...!

582
01:06:57,615 --> 01:06:59,015
Enlighten me, please.

583
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,875
I mean, you think with all your money, 
you are some how better than me.

584
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:07,085
That you are safe and in control.

585
01:07:07,635 --> 01:07:08,635
But you are not...

586
01:07:11,844 --> 01:07:13,111
I am in control.

587
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:15,264
Because still I have your truck.

588
01:07:17,684 --> 01:07:20,551
So you should think about making a deal.


590
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:13,967
Burt Reynolds 
Did you get her?

591
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,197
Who? 
You know who, Juliette.

592
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,406
Juliette!

593
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,873
No. No. We were too late.
What do you mean you were too late?

594
01:08:27,602 --> 01:08:29,469
Someone got there before us.

595
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,516
She's dead, I am sorry my friend.

596
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,380
I mess with you... I mess with you.

597
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:55,653
We got her! We got her!
Oh man you're face...

598
01:08:56,546 --> 01:09:00,613
I wish I could see it. She here, relax! She here.

599
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:03,949
I'm confused. It is there? You got her? She is alive?

600
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:07,006
My men jsut pick her up, she's on her way.

601
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,015
Come here to race track.

602
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:10,618
Yeah, okay, I'm on my way. 

603
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:13,635
Bring the money, okay? 
Yea, I got the money. I got the money.

604
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:14,908
I have to warn you, 

605
01:09:15,302 --> 01:09:18,969
From what I hear,
She's pretty pissed with you.

606
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,257
Heaven sakes Burt Reynolds!

607
01:10:19,484 --> 01:10:21,017
You give me heart attack!

608
01:10:22,224 --> 01:10:23,557
Next time I shoot you.

609
01:10:24,006 --> 01:10:25,006
Where is she?

610
01:10:30,824 --> 01:10:31,824
Where is she?

611
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:36,810
You don't see it?

612
01:10:37,687 --> 01:10:38,687
Where, see what?

613
01:10:39,362 --> 01:10:40,999
You Man, you.  
What?

614
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:44,576
You look like a Burt Reynolds.

615
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:51,289   
Fine, You've got her right? She's here?

616
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,734
Compliment. You're very handsome man.

617
01:10:54,538 --> 01:10:56,205
Well now not so much, gees you know.

618
01:10:57,268 --> 01:10:58,934
Now like manikin.

619
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:05,358
But then, Alai im, like a statue,
like in 'Deliverance' his body.

620
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,972
You could lite a match off it!

621 
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:15,515
I just need to see her.
I just need to see her.

622
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:20,079
I love Burt Reynolds
 
623
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,557
Lets walk!

625
01:11:41,957 --> 01:11:45,424
You say anything to Hagen Kahl about me I plan all this?

626
01:11:46,145 --> 01:11:47,145
Nothing.
Nothing?

627
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,501
No, nothing!
And where is she?

628
01:11:51,947 --> 01:11:54,313
Oh, I love this song...

629
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:56,973 
Beautiful...

630
01:12:13,752 --> 01:12:14,752
Hey, Hey, Geran!

631
01:12:15,106 --> 01:12:19,106
No, no, no, no It's me, Burt Reynolds.

632
01:12:22,132 --> 01:12:23,932
Burt Reynolds, what did I say?

633
01:12:24,556 --> 01:12:26,856
No sudden moves.

634
01:12:27,215 --> 01:12:28,215
I'm sorry, Yeh!

635
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:30,612
Please, the drugs are strong today!

636
01:12:36,716 --> 01:12:37,716
Jesus! 

637
01:12:43,713 --> 01:12:44,713
Traiganla!!!

638
01:12:57,684 --> 01:12:59,984
Geran...  Geran!! 
Yeh!

639
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,275
That's not her!
What?

640
01:13:02,922 --> 01:13:04,255
You got the wrong woman!

641
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:06,812
Hey stay cool man!
I did as you asked.

642
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:09,553
I picked her up from Kiser Stracer
237 appartment 12d!

643
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:11,039
 B!
What?

644
01:13:11,217 --> 01:13:12,217
Appartment 12b

645
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:13,734
Not D?
No!

646
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:16,535
Ah... that explains everything that's
why she did not want to come.

647
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,096
Now she can go!
She can go!!!

648
01:13:18,597 --> 01:13:19,730
You stupid ass-hole!

649
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:23,065
If anything has happened to her I swear I'm going...
DO WHAT?

650
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:28,822
I ask you, Burt Reynolds
Do What?

651
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:52,515
Where's the truck?

652
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:00,475
Tell me where the damn truck is!

653
01:14:07,771 --> 01:14:09,171
No

654
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:47,957
Oh my god!

655
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,500
Hello?
I believe I have something you want?

656
01:16:40,632 --> 01:16:42,365
Mr. Stein.

657
01:16:44,252 --> 01:16:47,419
Please, please don't hurt her she's nothing to do with this.

658
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:51,371
Then give me what is mine!
Okay, okay, but...

659
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,165
We do it on my terms we meet 
at the Stiefe Bar in Cologne.

660
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,264
And put her on the phone I 
want to know she is okay.

661
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:08,829
Oh my god!

662
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:11,841S
Are you okay?

663
01:18:15,872 --> 01:18:17,072
He's here, Hagen is here.

664
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:20,827
Now the day is over the night is drawing near,

665
01:18:21,498 --> 01:18:25,565
The shadows of the evening steal across the sky. 

666
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:29,478
What a day it has been Mr. Stain.

667
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:31,132
What a beautiful day.

668
01:18:33,438 --> 01:18:34,605
I see you brought the money!

669
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:44,920
Open the case.

670
01:18:52,651 --> 01:18:55,184
Yep, all seems to be in order.

671
01:18:55,919 --> 01:18:57,599
Shut the case.  
Step back.

672
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:05,464
By the way I hear about her illness,

673
01:19:05,559 --> 01:19:09,126
And your gallant and chivalrous desire to save her life.

674
01:19:09,143 --> 01:19:10,576
I was most moved.

675
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:14,002
incidentally you're free to go, Miss Marne.

676
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:19,357
You on the other hand Casey I'll need you to 
stay to sort out this truck business.

677
01:19:28,294 --> 01:19:29,294
Hi, Geran.

678
01:19:34,573 --> 01:19:36,173
I need drink.

679
01:19:39,444 --> 01:19:42,110
Will someone get me a drink before I die of thirst?

680
01:20:02,644 --> 01:20:03,744
Have some.

681
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:08,615
That's nice!

682
01:20:19,334 --> 01:20:20,334
Now...

683
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:28,513
You think I loud, brash, disgusting, 

684
01:20:28,513 --> 01:20:30,946
Got no manners? Maybe yes!

685
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:38,100
But I have do have a heart and 
that heart was sliced two.

687
01:20:40,732 --> 01:20:43,132
When you refused me equal partnership.

688
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:00,921
I take it you set up this little circus Mr. Stein?
689
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:01,979
Yea it was me.

690
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:07,143
So you gave yourself up to save her life.

691
01:21:08,933 --> 01:21:10,133
That is most interesting.  

692
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:14,132
No, I'm not leave you. 
Look, you've got the money. You've got the money.

693
01:21:14,132 --> 01:21:16,000
Why are you doing this?  

694
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,644
Why? Because I chose to, it's all in the game, Miss Marne.

695
01:21:23,823 --> 01:21:25,390
Call it the Trinity game.

696
01:21:25,606 --> 01:21:31,573
This man said, I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.

697
01:21:33,409 --> 01:21:34,409
That simple.
 
698
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:48,458
Go! Go!!

699
01:22:12,904 --> 01:22:13,904 
Wretches!

700
01:22:43,676 --> 01:22:45,243
Hey ... Stop right there.

701
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:57,371
What the hell is going on, Casey?

702
01:23:00,516 --> 01:23:04,732
Geran offered me and Matthias money to steal a 
truck from this gangster that had golf balls

703
01:23:04,732 --> 01:23:06,066
full of cocaine in it.

704
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:07,500
What ?
I wanted the money for you, 

705
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,700
to make you better,

706
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:12,000
Casey...
it went bad, I got caught and tortured me and

707
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,271
Casey...?
broke out and stole a car, there was 5 million Euros inside.

708
01:23:15,271 --> 01:23:16,699
In there? 
Yea!

709
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:20,023
Jesus, 
Hey look, I just wanted to give you the life you deserve.

710
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,215
What?

711
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:32,566
If I stuck a pair of tights over my head 
and robbed a bank you think is was a dumb idea! 

712
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:34,400
Yea, yes of course, I know! 

713 
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,547
But I had to think ssome people 
may think what I did was like... Romantic.

714
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,987
Romantic? 
Yea.  

715
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:44,130
Well, it's kinda romantic.
Thank-you!

716
01:23:55,147 --> 01:23:56,147
Wait... Wait!

717
01:23:57,634 --> 01:23:59,168
Take the money. I'll find you.  

718
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,760
You'll be okay?
Yes I love you.

719
01:24:00,817 --> 01:24:02,017
I love you.

720
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:50,961 
Cola!

721
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:54,784
And cherry.

722
01:24:56,412 --> 01:24:57,912
Makes cherry-coke!

723 
01:24:59,744 --> 01:25:01,100
My daughter taught me that.

724
01:25:11,185 --> 01:25:12,185
Take this.

725
01:25:12,592 --> 01:25:16,000
In prison, the candy is like gold dust.

726 
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:20,433
I want to make a deal.

727
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,837
With this... how do they call Americans it...?

728
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:26,454
Rapsheet, you need a miracle.

729
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:31,501
Hagen Kahl, have heard of him?

730 
01:25:32,497 --> 01:25:34,363
It is an outstanding member of the community.

731
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:37,649
And the biggest drug-lord in Germany.

732
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:44,651
With powerful allies, they bury such alligations.

733
01:25:44,777 --> 01:25:46,377
I have hard evidence.

734
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,173
Even then he could still walk.

735
01:25:48,674 --> 01:25:51,974
Well this through the door, then the rest, that is up to you.

736
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,663
I'm listening.

737
01:25:57,309 --> 01:26:00,475
The truck travels from the docks in Rotterdam to Cologna,

738
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:04,282
full of golf balls packed with cocaine from Chile.

739
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:09,688
It is unloaded in Hagen's depoit and distributed across Germany.

740
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:12,207
It happens once every six months.

741
01:26:13,912 --> 01:26:17,879
Except, last night the shipment was stolen.

742
01:26:18,979 --> 01:26:19,979
By whom?

743
01:26:20,483 --> 01:26:22,150
You think I'm a amateur?

744
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:25,704
It doen't matter.

745
01:26:28,509 --> 01:26:29,842
What matters it is ...

746
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:32,620
Decoy truck.

747
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,705
It's like you said, you have to be 
one step ahead, have a contraataque.

748
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:38,785
Why in the hell do we need a decoy truck?

749
01:26:389,786 --> 01:26:43,100
It's insurance, in case of Geran try to 
killing us instead of giving us the money.

750
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,640
Do not forget that.

751
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:48,284
Where are we going to get a decoy truck?

752
01:26:48,622 --> 01:26:49,622
We'll steal it.

753
01:26:50,046 --> 01:26:53,379
A couple of days before you and 
me empty truck minimum securtiy.

754
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:08,617
And we put the decoy truck here off the hit point.

755
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,929
And when we finish with the stop...

756
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,457
we swap the trailers.

757
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,400
Simple.
Boom.

758
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,452
I can give you that truck... full of cocaine,

759
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:09,876
With Hagen Kahl's name of the side of it! 

760
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:13,818
What makes you think I'll make a deal?

761
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:17,424
It would be the biggest drug bust Cologna has ever seen. 

762
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:19,732
The press would love it and...

763
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,800 
...your daughter would have a hero for a father.

764
01:28:47,462 --> 01:28:49,462
"HAGEN KHAL The King of Drugs"

765
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:52,230
Here, this came for you this morning. 

766
01:28:55,392 --> 01:28:56,892
[From: Burt Reynolds]

767
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,083
CASEY!!!

768
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,329
So as I said...

769
01:29:22,118 --> 01:29:25,884
We all got our reasons for doing crazy things in life,

770
01:29:26,488 --> 01:29:29,988
but Juliette have the operation he needed.

771
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,961
We'll starting a new life together.

772
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:43,756
I love you.

773
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,549
No one has ever told me that before.

774
01:29:50,228 --> 01:29:52,828
The girls never told you that before?

775
01:29:55,008 --> 01:29:56,208
No, nobody ever.

776
01:30:01,316 --> 01:30:02,316
I love you.

777
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:08,071
I love you too.

778
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,514
So if the reason is good enough.

779
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:23,258
If the reason is love,

780
01:30:26,303 --> 01:30:29,937
then maybe it is not so crazy after all.
