00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,334
Another taste
of the cat scratch

3
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,837
will get your heathen
back into the task.

Dig, you galley scum.

11
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,860
Leave him.

12
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,432
Keep digging.

13
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,752
Back to your digging.

Hey, One Eye.

You'll be digging up a king's
ransom with your own hands

17
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,840
if you keep dashing the help.

18
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,823
I believe there
is no treasure here,

19
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:27,404
just like there was no treasure
in the Tortugas or Cayman Brac

20
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,732
or anywhere else
that you selled us.

21
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:34,563
Now, have you ever
known a falsehood to leave

22
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,178
the lips of Jezebel Jack?

23
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,715
We must be reading the
map wrong, would you say?

24
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:45,650
You shall deceive
us more, Jezebel Jack.

25
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:49,717
Oh, it takes a brave man
to utter words of mutiny.

00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,400
Help.

Help, Captain.

35
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:10,562
Help, Captain.

36
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,559
You shall be a fine
feast for the scorpions.

Ah!

00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,316

Oh, hi, Mrs. Gateland.

44
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,167
Slow down, young man.

45
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,155
You nearly caused me
to have my spasms.

46
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,657
Oh, did you see that, Mr. Gray?

47
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,056
He's a menace, always
hooting around, scaring

48
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,585
the devil out of everybody.

49
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,748
That boy needs to be on a
leash, a pole in the yard,

tied up where he
can't hurt anybody.

51
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,310
Isn't that right, Cecil, baby?

52
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,499
Please calm down,
Mrs. Gateland.

53
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:13,036
I'll take care of Bobby.

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,389
You've really upset
Mrs. Gateland.

58
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,787
Upset?
He nearly killed me.

Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,164
Bobby!

61
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:30,797
He's an obstinate boy.

62
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,855
Hi, Mr. Gray, the Plantarians
will stop at nothing

63
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,420
to take me to the ship.

64
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,429
Boy's just pretending.

[laughs]

66
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,425
Well, what he needs
is some discipline.

76
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,551

00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:26,513
Oh.

Good morning.

81
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,808
I made some iced tea.

82
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:38,955
Would you like some?

83
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,076
Yes, please.

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,551
Oh, what a lovely home.

85
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:50,008
It's so rural.

00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,448
Boom, boom.

87
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,124
That was boom, boom, boom, boom.

88
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,584
Oh, no.

89
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:11,801
Out of ammo.

90
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,413
Bobby, I'm sorry, honey.

91
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,429
You can't play in
here right now.

92
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,827
But, Mom, Brent James and the
Younger gang were about to--

93
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,885
I don't want to hear any
more about the James gang.

94
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,831
No go on out to the
shed and help Grandpa.

95
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,805
But, Mom.

96
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:32,238
Go on.

97
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,385
Sorry, Mr. Skinner.

98
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,531
I'm fine, thanks.

99
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,548
He's got a big imagination.

100
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:37,973
No need to apologize,
Ms. Jennings.

101
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,171
Boys can dream up
almost anything.

102
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,838
You were saying.

103
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,541
Yes.

104
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:47,253
If your bank can just wait
till I bring this harvest in,

105
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:50,451
I'm sure I can make
up the back payments.

106
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:54,274
If this was to
me, Ms. Jennings,

107
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,429
there wouldn't be a problem.

108
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,870
But my hands are tied.

109
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,658
Frankly, the loan
committee is nervous

110
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:06,612
since your husband left.

111
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,636
There is nothing I can do.

112
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,877
My husband left two
years ago, Mr. Skinner,

113
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,441
and I've made some payments.

114
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,757
En garde, Sir Skinner.

115
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,218
[inaudible], sir.

116
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:38,937
[inaudible] your ugly looks.

117
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,482
Take this, Mr. Skinner.

118
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,906
Hey, Grandpa.

119
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,776
Yeah.

120
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,904
Mom said you needed some help.

121
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,503
GRANDPA: Oh, she did, huh?

122
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,797
OK.

123
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,291
Let's see here.

124
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,203
Why don't you hand me that
wrench over there, Bobby.

125
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,229
What's wrong, son?

126
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,454
Mom's always yelling
at me, any time

127
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,851
I try to play anything.

128
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,589
Well, you can
have to understand

129
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:16,370
that your mom's been under an
awful lot of pressure lately.

130
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,019
She says to quit making stuff
up, but you tell me Jesse James

131
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,140
and the Younger gang were real.

132
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:23,426
Well, they were real.

133
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:24,990
Legend says they came
right through here.

134
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,180
They did?
You never told me that.

135
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:30,759
Did they shoot any bankers?

136
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,914
After they robbed
the Glendale train,

137
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,791
they rode straight
through Nebraska.

138
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,980
And they had a US Marshal
right on their tail.

139
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:41,847
Now, as the story goes, the
strongbox with the silver bars

140
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,114
was so heavy that it was
slowing Jess and the gang down.

141
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,651
So they had to do
something about that.

142
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,667
So, they get rid it.

143
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,899
They hit it right here in
the Benson County area.

144
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,082
Really?

145
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,263
Yeah, I want to
show you something.

146
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,410
Hold on.

147
00:11:59,017 --> 00:11:59,955
Here it is.

148
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,448
It's a secret.

149
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,463
Don't tell anybody.

150
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,444
Right here.

151
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:15,004
Now this is a copy from a
newspaper article from 1876.

152
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,473
Now they published a
picture of the maps

153
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:20,705
that Alan Pinkerton took
from one of the Younger gang.

154
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,852
Let me show you something.

155
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,242
Look here.

156
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:28,352
There's Lincoln, and there's
the old Pennsylvania tracks.

157
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,298
What are all these things?

158
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:35,060
Well, I guess that's some sort
of a code that Jesse made up.

159
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:38,570
Fact is, nobody
ever figured it out.

160
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,559
And that old Crenshaw
Lake strongbox

161
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:43,472
is still waiting to be found.

162
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,877
You mean it's
around here somewhere?

163
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,345
Right here in
Lincoln, so they say.

164
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,944
Let's go hunt for it, Grandpa.

165
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,064
GLENNA: No, you're not going to
hunt for anything, young man,

166
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,774
until you get some
chores done around here.

167
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,806
Now, you go wrap up that
scrap bailing wire you

168
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,058
were supposed to do yesterday.

169
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:03,143
But Mom, if we could
find the silver--

170
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:06,063
Bobby, the wire.

171
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,774
OK, Mom.

172
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,554
You know, it doesn't
help, you filling his head

173
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,535
with all these tall tales.

174
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,482
Glenna, it's just a story.

175
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,506
It's a part of history.

176
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,633
I'm worried about him, Dad.

177
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:23,823
You know, these
characters, they--

178
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,700
they become so real to him.

179
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,611
It's spooky.

180
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:30,671
Look, the boy doesn't
have anybody to play with,

181
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:33,729
and it's been really rough on
him since John's been gone.

182
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:40,438
Yeah, well, it's been
really rough on all of us.

183
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:46,590
[screaming]

184
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,100
Hey!

185
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,282
Take care, man.

186
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,674
They were thick with
savages, human carrion,

187
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:03,550
if truth be told.

188
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:06,366
I laid bare my cutlass
before don't them.

189
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,999
Ah!

190
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,745
Take it easy, mate.

191
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,692
You wouldn't want
your old captain

192
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:16,063
to pass on to his certain
glory now would you?

193
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:18,531
Oh, you're a
brave one, Captain.

194
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:22,389
Those savages eat the
flesh of sailing men.

195
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,475
I tried to save the lads.

196
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:27,568
But there were herds
of the cursed devils.

197
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:30,835
By the fate of the author
of all that's good,

198
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,580
I saw this one in me leg.

199
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:37,995
And the heathen ran big beak
through with a jagged spear,

200
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,151
made by the devil himself.

201
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,236
Grieve not now, my captain.

202
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,789
I do my best, but
this is going to hurt.

203
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,534
Nothing like the
pain in my heart

204
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,863
when I realized
that I could not get

205
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:56,590
that treasure up for you boys.

206
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:59,092
Ah!

207
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,248
Rejoice, Alli, it is out!

208
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:07,156
Ah!

209
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:13,204
Sorry, Captain, might
I bear the pain myself.

210
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:15,115
Now you get some rest.

211
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,123
Out.

212
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:19,009
Yes, Captain, take it easy.

213
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:21,684
You'll be at the
helm soon, Captain.

214
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:22,970
Come on, Reg.

215
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:24,500
He needs his rest.

216
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:36,143
Don't she look
pretty, right there.

217
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,229
[laughing]

218
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,459
Well go on.

219
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:48,100
Didn't you hear
the ship's medic?

220
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:53,035
Leave this old hulk
to rest on a leisure.

221
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,642
My blood must calm
after fighting

222
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,180
off a nation of savages.

223
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:01,273
A nation of savages, was it?

224
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,697
Oh, a thousand of
the bloody things,

225
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:05,965
whooping their bloody war cry.

226
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,536
It was enough to
shiver the bones

227
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:12,256
of even the bravest soldier.

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,374
This, real map, was revealed
to me hidden in the log book.

229
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,988
Planning to split up the
treasure was never your course.

230
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:25,325
Sailing back to Kingston was
your sure plan to rid us all

231
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,889
and use the real
map for your own.

232
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,773
Well I haven't had
that much schooling,

233
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:35,717
but I reckon that half an
equal share, be a smart better

234
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:39,332
than a tenth, hey?

235
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:40,582
Mate.

236
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:43,329
Mate it it hey?

237
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:49,029
Well, I know the map and
I have no need for a mate.

238
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,747
That map is coded in the
language of an adventurer.

239
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:55,425
Demon starts in
your fool head.

240
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:56,954
You mutinous dog.

241
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,012
Time's come for Jezebel
Jack to meet his creator.

242
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,287
Hah!

243
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,885
[gunshot]

244
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:32,198
The creator is not yet
ready for a rogue such as I.

245
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,969
What's going on?

246
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:36,646
What's happened here?

247
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,619
Captain?

248
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,252
And then Mr. Skinner
says we haven't paid

249
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,512
the night for three months.

250
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,797
Three months.

251
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:58,160
Bet the Carson's haven't
paid theirs for six months.

252
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,490
Pass the potatoes please.

253
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,714
I know it's been
three months, but it's

254
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:05,008
not like he doesn't understand
the farming business.

255
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:09,143
He knows we can't even
harvest for another month.

256
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:10,326
[gunshots]

257
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,723
And he knows with John
gone, the work's harder,

258
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:16,234
and it's already been a problem.

259
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,285
If he's going to take
this farm away from me,

260
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,640
he's got another thing coming.

261
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,934
I have worked way too
hard to be intimidated

262
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:24,923
by someone like Mr. Skinner.

263
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:28,365
I'm right on the edge
here, do you understand?

264
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:29,685
Got to do something.

265
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,917
I mean, we can't afford
to take any chances.

266
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:35,525
We're not going to be
able to make ends meet.

267
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:36,775
Oh, I know.
I know.

268
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,131
Well, it upsets me, you know?

269
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,799
What does he expect me to do?

270
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,606
What am I gonna do?

271
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:45,013
I mean, I'm right on
the edge here, Dad.

272
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:46,369
Cover us.

273
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:49,044
Jesse, it's over.

274
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,721
OK, Jesse, run for it.

275
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,819
Bobby!

276
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,175
What's gotten into you?

277
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,496
Did I get him?

278
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,650
You get over there and
clean up that mess right now.

279
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:05,971
I'm sorry.
I thought I--

280
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:07,118
Oh never mind.

281
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:09,482
Go on, go to your room.
Hurry up.

282
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,984
What has gotten into this child?

283
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,895
Now, Glenna, calm down.

284
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,946
Ah!

285
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,442
Look at this.

286
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,733
[crying]

287
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,185
Looks like a big one coming.

288
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,819
We'd better lock it down.

289
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:23,792
OK.

290
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,939
Get Bobby to help you.

291
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:27,095
I'll get the tool shed.

292
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,728
Come on, Bobby, let's go.

293
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,673
Hurry, it's muscling up outside.

294
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,853
Coming, Grandpa.

295
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:46,246
Bobby, bring the
laundry in the house.

296
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,097
Oh!

297
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,209
Grandpa!

298
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,299
What happened?

299
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,793
Are you OK?

300
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,408
Bobby, Bobby,
I'm hurt real bad.

301
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:25,729
Let me help you up.

302
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,536
No, no, no.
Go get your mother.

303
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,475
Now hurry.

304
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,039
Mom!

305
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:33,132
Bobby, you cover the tractor
and then you stay inside.

306
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,763
Come here.

307
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:42,864
I want to say I'm sorry about
how angry I was last night.

308
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,845
That's OK, Mom.

309
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,661
When I get Grandpa to the
hospital, I'll call, OK?

310
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,094
Don't worry, Mom, I can
take care of the house.

311
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,088
You're going to be OK,
ain't you, Grandpa?

312
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,478
I'm going to be fine, son.

313
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,841
I'll just be out of
action for a little while.

314
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,232
Just hold the fort, soldier.

315
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,229
That a boy.

316
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:39,935
Let's go

317
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,307
If my lungs filled
with the salty sea,

318
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:48,381
my blood will be on your
hands, and ye confounded dogs

319
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:51,023
will never find the
treasure that you

320
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,483
labored so hard to acquire.

321
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:55,472
Fergus found out about
your phony map, Jackie boy,

322
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,141
and you murdered the
poor bugger for it.

323
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,017
It was self-defense.

324
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,059
[laughing]

325
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:01,485
He's a lying flacker.

326
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,945
Yeah, throw him over.

327
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,166
We've been sailing the
seven seas like fools

328
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,868
following your tall tales.

329
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:16,082
Now we got the real map, thanks
to Fergus, god rest his soul.

330
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,439
Not too hasty, lads.

331
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:21,436
If ye desire to become
rich gentlemen of means,

332
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,224
that map is coded in the
language of an adventurer.

333
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,274
We've had enough.

334
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,734
Tell your lies to the squids.

335
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:29,847
Yeah!

336
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:50,075
[non-english speech] To
drown a chief is to be cursed.

337
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,037
Listen, you swabs,
the witch speaks

338
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,957
of things that are beyond ye.

339
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,286
A captain and a
chief be the same

340
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,407
in the eyes of the spirits.

341
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:05,924
And the Author of all that
is good will cast down fates

342
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,886
upon ye that ye cannot bear.

343
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,536
You're doomed by
your own hand if ye

344
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,038
shove that sticker [inaudible].

345
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:19,062
The spirits are
angry, even now.

346
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,420
Thou has been warned by
the mouth of the witch.

347
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,841
Ah!

348
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,970
You're a lying,
thieving, murdering,

349
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:41,133
double-crosser, Jezebel Jack.

350
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:46,033
We'll not be betrayed by a
wicked such as you again.

351
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:50,378
Mr. Murzol, loose him nigh.

352
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:01,778
The curses of Sulsatan
be on your skull.

353
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,503
Can you see him?

354
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:11,962
Did he go down?

355
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:36,258
What's that?

356
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,201
Well the grass certainly
grows well in hell.

357
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,983
PA SYSTEM: Dr. Martin, please
report to surgery, Dr. Martin,

358

please report to surgery.

[phone ringing]

360
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:05,131
What governor resides on an
island in the Sea of Sargasos?

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,515
Bobby, pick up the phone.

363
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,564
Ma'am, you can
see your father now

364
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,573
before we take him to x-ray.

365
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:31,894
Great.
Thanks.

366
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,006
I'll be right there.

367
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:41,487
Hello?

368
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,911
Hello?

369
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:43,885
Hello?

370
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,910
Right, 'tis but a lad.

371
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,850
Lord?

372
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:38,489
Be I in heaven or hell?

373
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,747
Answer me, Lord.

374
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,042
I've not lived a
God fearing life.

375
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:49,367
Whatever your judgment, that
Spanish wench deserved it.

376
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:50,341
You're awake.

377
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,623
An angel.

378
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,952
I've been saved, Lord.

379
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:01,115
You've had mercy
on my black soul.

380
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,366
Hallelujah!

381
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,305
I'm in heaven.

382
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,008
No, you're not.

383
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,503
You're in Nebraska.

384
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:08,414
Nebraska?

385
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:09,596
Is that near Jamaica.

386
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,994
No, it's near Kansas.

387
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:15,470
Oh, well, why
didn't you say so?

388
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:17,347
Kansas, is it?

389
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:18,598
Kansas?

390
00:29:18,702 --> 00:29:20,752
Would that be at the
bottom of the sea?

391
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,073
I must arise.

392
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,047
Arise.

393
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:28,017
The ship is capsizing.

394
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,268
Abandon ship!

395
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,145
Abandon ship!

396
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:34,378
Every man for himself.

397
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,316
Hold on, hold on.

398
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,671
It's just a chair.

399
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,826
To the Lifeboats

400
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,834
Hold on, hold on.

401
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:40,981
Wait just a moment.

402
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,187
What?

403
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,751
You got a boo-boo.

404
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:51,617
A boo-boo?

405
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:52,764
Let me fix that.

406
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:55,232
It'll get infected.
Wait there.

407
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:11,880
Doomed to a Dutchman's hell.

408
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,711
I'm going to spray
some disinfectant on it.

409
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,971
Now hold still.
This may sting a little.

410
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:22,864
Ah!

411
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,914
Ah!

412
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:27,243
You are the devil!

413
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:29,780
You stuck me with
an invisible knife.

414
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,608
What demon possesses you, boy?

415
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,181
It's just to keep
the infection down.

416
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:42,814
It'll go away.

417
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:45,526
Please, please calm down.

418
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:46,776
[growling]

419
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,862
Hey, really, it's OK.

420
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:04,676
Now does it feel better.

421
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,152
What kind of
black magic is this?

422
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:11,141
Ah!

423
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,157
[giggles]

424
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:17,154
It's not funny.

425
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,940
It's not funny at all.

426
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:28,520
He never came up,
ne'er even once.

427
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:31,196
The sharks took him speedily.

428
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,628
There's no blood in the water.

429
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:34,845
He's dead.

430
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:36,132
Devils don't die.

431
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,243
They just evolve.

432
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:38,426
You're daft.

433
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,780
The man's dead.

434
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:42,144
No, no, no, no, no!

435
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:47,080
He lives as sure as the wind.

436
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,157
A what?

437
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:49,965
A Band-Aid?

438
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:52,502
Another form of human torture.

439
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,656
That looks pretty good.

440
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:56,742
Are you hungry?
You look starved.

441
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:12,200
The fire at your fingertips.
This ain't heaven.

442
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:16,926
I got some really neat stuff.

443
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,341
My name's Bobby.

444
00:33:21,446 --> 00:33:22,939
What's yours?

445
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,824
Hey, Jim, you're
a very young lad

446
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,292
to be left all alone in a
gentleman's country house.

447
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,231
It's not Jim.

448
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,482
It's Bobby.

449
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:34,166
Aye, Jim, tell me
again, where we be.

450
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,105
We be?

451
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,078
Aye.

452
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,225
Where be we?

453
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:40,283
We be in Nebraska.

454
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,812
They call you--

455
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,133
Jack.

456
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:46,435
Captain Jezebel Jack.
- Here.

457
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,181
Pour milk on them
like this, Captain.

458
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:52,239
Aye, Jim, captain
of the Delilah,

459
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:54,881
the most feared lady
of the Caribbean.

460
00:33:54,985 --> 00:34:01,103
Since 1713, she has carried off
more treasure from the Dutch,

461
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,821
from those confounded hounds,
the Spaniards, and even

462
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,394
good King George of reputation.

463
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,515
You're a pirate?

464
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:11,460
No.

465
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:14,346
Pirates are thieves and killers.

466
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,898
I am an adventurer
of independent means.

467
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:26,266
How did you get here?

468
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:31,446
The fingers of The Dark One
through me through the sky.

469
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,454
Gummy bears?

470
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:33,393
Oh, aye.

471
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,693
gummy bears.

472
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,089
You really think
you're a real pirate?

473
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,477
Adventurer.

474
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,805
Oh, yeah, an adventurer.

475
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:59,738
Jim, when will these
jellyfish let go of my teeth.

476
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,654
Dad?

477
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:07,627
Hi, honey.

478
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,227
Hi.

479
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:10,513
How's the shoulder?

480
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:12,841
Oh, it'll be OK.

481
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,231
Well, they're
supposed to take you

482
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,908
to x-ray in a couple minutes.

483
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:18,854
Has anybody been in
here to check on you?

484
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,009
Will you stop
making such a fuss?

485
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:24,554
I'm not making a fuss.

486
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:27,786
I think I'm going to go
try and call Bobby again.

487
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:29,421
Calm down, Glenna.

488
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:31,228
Bobby is used to spending
time with himself.

489
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:36,268
So

490
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:40,473
Might you know the whereabouts
of a nice noggin of rum,

491
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:43,740
brandy, spirits of that ilk.

492
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:45,930
The timbers that
hold this old ship

493
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:50,171
together rest assuredly
on its consumption.

494
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:54,480
Mom says drinking ain't
good for you and it's a sin.

495
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,886
Oh, it's a sin, is it?

496
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,570
Your mother doesn't
know what wicked is.

497
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:05,741
Wicked flops in the
foam aboard the Delilah.

498
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:07,583
OK, anything you say.

499
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:08,557
Arg!

500
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:14,466
Pull down the shutters, Jim.

501
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:18,150
There are them that have
no need of eying us.

502
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:19,957
OK, I'll shut the drapes.

503
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:24,614
You never know who might
shiver you in the back.

504
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:32,747
[monkey starts singing]

505
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,416
I think you better go now.

506
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,667
Say what?

507
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:36,779
I think you better go now.

508
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:39,628
My dad will be home soon.

509
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,714
Oh, aye.

510
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:47,797
Maybe so.

511
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:58,607
A gracious deed you
did, Jim, taking

512
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:02,986
in an old barnacled hull
such as I, cleaning me wounds

513
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:08,096
and tending to me nourishment.

514
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,691
A kind sort such as you deserves
the greatest of all gifts.

515
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:20,469
But I have only a small trinket
to give you for your kindness.

516
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,442
What is it?

517
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,385
A life saver, just
for you, my boy.

518
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:32,217
Wow!

519
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,885
A derringer, wow!

520
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:35,415
I can't believe it.

521
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,631
Is it real?

522
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:39,481
It's authenticity
can be testified to

523
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:44,173
by a gentleman name of Fergus.

524
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,460
This is so cool.

525
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:52,132
Well, I must be
shoving off now.

526
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,987
Hey, Captain.

527
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:00,960
Aye?

528
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:04,124
Want to watch
some TV together?

529
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,695
TV?

530
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,225
Aye.

531
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,163
TV.

532
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,763
- Mr. Thurston will see you now.
- Thank you.

533
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,274
I'll be right back.

534
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,166
Mr. Skinner, good to see you.

535
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,521
Good to see you too, sir.

536
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,815
Have you been working hard
at your craft these days?

537
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,414
Yes, sir.

538
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,604
A few obstacles here and there,
but nothing I can't handle.

539
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:05,922
Soon as we foreclose we'll be
able to turn that red section

540
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:09,674
right there into blue.

541
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:12,352
Yeah, Mr. Skinner,
and your bank account

542
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:15,584
will be a lot greener.

543
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:16,695
The auction
price would be very

544
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,268
favorable to the project, sir.

545
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:20,797
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,327
We should have been
pushing dirt by now,

547
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:23,300
I know, I know.

548
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:24,517
Just one more step.

549
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,254
All I have to do is
convinced the credit

550
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:29,487
manager that the Jennings
family can't pay their debt.

551
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,954
The bank is reluctant to throw
families off their farms.

552
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:34,179
Are you telling me there's
a chance this property won't

553
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:35,222
be auctioned?
- Oh, no, sir.

554
00:39:35,326 --> 00:39:37,168
That is not what
I'm telling you.

555
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:41,825
As a matter of fact, that piece
of property is as good as gone.

556
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:49,055
You know, Jim, I've heard
tales of the little people

557
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,400
from rum drunkards at the Brac,
but it never come to my mind

558
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,520
that they would be in a box.

559
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:57,639
You've never seen TV before?

560
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,610
What's this here?

561
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:06,434
Jewels that would ransom a
queen from the unchurched.

562
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,928
That's the Home
Shopping Network.

563
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,353
That's where you
can buy anything.

564
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,890
How do you get into
this treasure chest, Jim?

565
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:15,470
Captain, Captain, it's
not a treasure chest.

566
00:40:15,573 --> 00:40:16,478
Put it down!

567
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,043
It's a TV set.

568
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,511
It's got no lock, no lid.

569
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:23,291
What kind of treachery is this?

570
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,156
Stand and deliver.

571
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,199
Captain, no!

572
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:32,570
[gunshot, sizzling]

573
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:33,510
[phone rings]

574
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:34,934
Wait, wait a minute.

575
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:36,846
Just stay cool, Captain.

576
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:41,503
Hello?

577
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:42,998
Bobby.

578
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:43,971
Hi, honey.

579
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,083
Are you OK?

580
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:46,022
Oh yeah, sure, Mom.

581
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:47,447
How's Grandpa?

582
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,331
Oh well, we're waiting
for the x-rays right now.

583
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:52,174
Was there any
damage to the house?

584
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:53,251
Nope, no damage.

585
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:54,538
That's good.

586
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,857
You're sure you're
OK there by yourself?

587
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,526
Oh, I'm not by myself.

588
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,465
I have a new friend.

589
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:00,898
He's a pirate.

590
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:02,496
Well, that's good, honey.

591
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:05,069
Just don't tear up
anything sword fighting.

592
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,216
Oh, we're not sword fighting.

593
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,709
We're just watching TV.

594
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,629
Oh, good.

595
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,993
OK, well, I'll be home
in a little while.

596
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,114
OK.

597
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,086
Bye, gotta go now.

598
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:18,068
Hey, Bobby.

599
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:19,041
I love you.

600
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,257
Don't worry about us.

601
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,196
Bye.

602
00:41:25,158 --> 00:41:27,626
Captain, wait, wait.

603
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,372
Maybe he'll grow out of it.

604
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:33,847
I bought that shirt for
my Dad at the State Fair.

605
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:35,238
But he never wore it.

606
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,183
This was your father's shirt?

607
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,122
Where is he?

608
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:40,659
He left a long time ago.

609
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,328
Oh.

610
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,664
Went to sea, did he, Jim?

611
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,924
Not exactly.

612
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:49,974
He went to Milwaukee.

613
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:53,588
Oh, captured by the Milwaukee?

614
00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:56,995
Those African tribes
are vicious, they are.

615
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,428
No, he went to Milwaukee.

616
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:05,511
Because, well, he didn't
want to live with me and Mom.

617
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:08,048
He said he'd never
leave, but he did.

618
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:20,838
Now, Jim, don't you fret none.

619
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:26,400
I myself have
suffered a great loss.

620
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,825
Did your dad leave you too?

621
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:35,089
Jim, you must
be on your guard,

622
00:42:35,193 --> 00:42:39,085
because when a man
leaves his own blood kin,

623
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:43,604
those that are left behind
are apt to take up ways that--

624
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:50,833
that they will certainly regret.

625
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:01,365
Now, let's be
about our business.

626
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,547
Yeah, business.

627
00:43:02,651 --> 00:43:05,918
What business is that?

628
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:07,620
Don't ask questions
of your captain.

629
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:10,680
Just say aye, aye, sir.

630
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:11,653
Say it.

631
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:12,696
Aye, aye, sir.

632
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:22,254
Good Lord.

633
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:26,495
This be the biggest silver
nugget I've ever seen.

634
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,128
That would be for sure, Jim.

635
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,484
What?

636
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:30,734
Oh that's tin foil.

637
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:32,994
See, it's used to
cover up stuff.

638
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:34,941
Tin foil, is it?

639
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,582
A fool's deception.

640
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:40,189
See it comes
right of the roll.

641
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:43,838
Now, you pounded this silver
thin as parchment, did you,

642
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:44,707
Jim?

643
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:47,522
No, it just comes like that.

644
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:48,461
See?

645
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:49,712
This isn't silver either.

646
00:43:49,817 --> 00:43:53,049
It's chrome.

647
00:43:53,153 --> 00:43:57,810
And where can we get more
of these chrome canisters?

648
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:01,633
At the store, I guess, along
with ice cream sandwiches.

649
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:03,580
You want an ice cream sandwich?

650
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:04,519
Aye, lad.

651
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:13,625
We'll board the Earl of
Sandwich's ship straight away.

652
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:18,457
Aye, aye, Captain, to
the Earl of Sandwich.

653
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:22,696
That coveted prize doesn't
stay at anchor forever.

654
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:28,918
Yeah!

655
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:37,190
Jim, lad, you bring
brightness into a dark heart.

656
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:38,650
That you do.

657
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:40,735
Hold on, Captain.

658
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,743
Yee-haw!

659
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,482
[giggling]

660
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:44,420
Yee-haw!

661
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:48,973
On, James, on!

662
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:54,673
This is it.

663
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,654
I'll get us the ice
cream sandwiches.

664
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:57,940
Stay here, Captain.

665
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:08,923
A Dutch East
Indies four master

666
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:13,129
would not carry such a prize.

667
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:14,937
Mr. Gray, me
and my friend want

668
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:16,639
to buy an ice cream sandwich.

669
00:45:16,744 --> 00:45:18,482
Sure, Bobby, you know
where the freezer is.

670
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:21,262
Go on back.

671
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:23,347
Oh, yes.

672
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:25,364
[whistling]

673
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,809
Hey, Captain, you want a
Popsicle or an Eskimo pie?

674
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:40,795
Yes, sir, can I--

675
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:44,237
Stand and deliver.

676
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,017
Stand and deliver, I say.

677
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:48,477
Deliver?

678
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,562
Deliver what?

679
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,612
Oh, we can make
deliveries, no problem.

680
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,003
Captain, don't do this.

681
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,217
The silver, you
land livered scum.

682
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:00,954
Late it nye in the tilt.

683
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,380
Sir, we don't have silver.

684
00:46:02,484 --> 00:46:04,777
Captain, you're going
to get us in trouble.

685
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:05,611
You want these?

686
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:07,592
Well, yes, are you deaf?

687
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,223
And the jewels.

688
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:16,387
I'll take the gold coins.

689
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:17,742
Captain, don't.

690
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:20,175
Jim, this one is simple.

691
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,191
They don't even carry a cutlass.

692
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:26,084
Mr. Gray, I noticed
that delinquent Jennings

693
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:28,413
child's motorcycle outside.

694
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:30,845
Stand and deliver!

695
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,027
What?

696
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh!

697
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:34,426
Oh!

698
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,963
Stand and deliver, madam.

699
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,804
Stand?

700
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:41,689
Why, I beg your pardon.

701
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:42,732
I am a lady.

702
00:46:42,837 --> 00:46:44,088
No, madam.

703
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:46,382
It's OK, Ms. Gateland,
he's just an adventurer.

704
00:46:46,486 --> 00:46:47,320
The earrings.

705
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:48,293
Oh, dear.

706
00:46:54,341 --> 00:47:01,571
Another time, wench, you and
I shall split a flask of rum.

707
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,448
Oh, my.
- Come on, Jim.

708
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:04,386
Grab the dog.

709
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,569
We'll eat it later.

710
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:06,957
Just hold on, Mr. Gray.

711
00:47:07,062 --> 00:47:10,364
I'll bring that
stuff right back.

712
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,727
Now, Captain, I'm
going to have to bring

713
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,604
the stuff back to Mr. Gray.

714
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:15,785
What?

715
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:18,115
We captured it fair and square.

716
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,062
Mr. Gray is a friend of mine.

717
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:23,050
Oh, a friend is he?

718
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:26,457
A mate.

719
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:28,125
Come on, let me have it.

720
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,871
Me thinks you'd be
making a great mistake.

721
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:33,235
This was easy booty.

722
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:38,170
Captain, you don't want to
regret this later, do you?

723
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,838
Give it to me.

724
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,749
Captain, give it to me.

725
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:47,901
Thanks, Captain.

726
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:50,647
Pirates, you can't
take them anywhere.

727
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,586
Make him comfortable.

728
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,908
I'll be back to see him later.

729
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,974
Doctor, how is he?

730
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,400
He's going to be fine.

731
00:48:20,504 --> 00:48:21,547
Thank goodness.

732
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,007
It's just a shoulder
fracture and at his age,

733
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,057
it's going to take
some time and therapy.

734
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:26,274
- Therapy.
- Yes.

735
00:48:26,378 --> 00:48:27,906
I need to warn you.

736
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:30,549
Therapy can be expensive, so I
suggest you start the paperwork

737
00:48:30,652 --> 00:48:32,564
with the insurance company now.
OK?

738
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:34,198
I'll speak to you later.

739
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,171
Thanks.

740
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,064
Insurance.

741
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:41,740
Oh, the look on Ms.
Gateland's face.

742
00:48:41,844 --> 00:48:44,938
It was worth trouble
I'm going to get into.

743
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,329
It was great!

744
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:52,967
Stand and deliver.

745
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:55,017
[giggling]

746
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,034
(IN A HIGH VOICE)
I beg your pardon.

747
00:48:57,138 --> 00:48:58,667
I'm a lady.

748
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,057
[giggling]

749
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:03,706
Sometimes the taunting of
a wench makes for good sport.

750
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:05,340
Stand and deliver.

751
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:21,363
What's this here?

752
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:24,595
It's sort of a treasure map.

753
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,230
Have you been
holding out on me, boy.

754
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:27,515
Huh, uh.

755
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,600
It's not what you think.

756
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:31,548
It's a map from a guy
you never heard of.

757
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:36,379
He wasn't a seafaring man, but
he certainly was an adventurer.

758
00:49:36,483 --> 00:49:38,395
Nobody's never been
able to figure out all

759
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:40,062
these symbols and squiggles.

760
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:42,113
Well you see this?

761
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:45,171
This means a rise in the land.

762
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:48,057
And this means a buried stone.

763
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:51,185
How did you know that?

764
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:56,120
We adventurers have
a language all our own.

765
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:56,955
How you doing.

766
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:58,414
You got everything you need?

767
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:02,551
I've got more attendants
than the World Series.

768
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:04,670
Well, if you're sure
you're going to be OK,

769
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:06,825
I'd kind of like to
get back to the house.

770
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,181
Don't worry about me.

771
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:09,745
Go on.

772
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,317
I'm sure Bobby could use a
little company right about now.

773
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,645
See, right over
there's the rise.

774
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:17,217
And we're due east of the cut.

775
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:18,990
You have a good eye, my boy.

776
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:21,944
My grandpa hit a big rock
with the plow here somewhere.

777
00:50:25,142 --> 00:50:29,035
Here it is, Captain,
the buried stone.

778
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,155
As it is on the map.

779
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,337
Turn it over.

780
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:42,659
The treasure is
130 paces that way.

781
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:46,136
How did you know that?

782
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,558
I know, adventurers have
a language of their own.

783
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:53,990
If there be true
treasure here, Jim.

784
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:58,544
We could be sharing as equals
in a king's ransom, we could.

785
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:00,942
We would be partners?

786
00:51:01,046 --> 00:51:02,159
We would be mates.

787
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:06,052
Mates!

788
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:09,563
One, two, three--

789
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,300
Really, mates?

790
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:14,775
--six, seven, eight.

791
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,119
You may loose your cutlass on
my bare neck if it be not so.

792
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:20,128
12--

793
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:21,449
All right, mates!

794
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:22,248
Cool!

795
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:25,029
15.

796
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:29,443
Yeah, Jim, cool.

797
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:36,776
124, 125, 126,
127, 128, 129, 130.

798
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:39,869
You're still on 127.
You double counted.

799
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,469
My legs are longer than yours.

800
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:46,544
This be it, boy.

801
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:49,358
Now to find the
spine of Chermain.

802
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:52,869
Spine of Chermain?

803
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,155
Hey, what are you doing?

804
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:55,093
Stop.

805
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:56,970
This is my dad's shed.

806
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,777
Your dad will never know.

807
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:08,232
Jezebel Jack, lures
us into his black heart.

808
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,282
By all that is holy.

809
00:52:10,386 --> 00:52:11,499
Save us from this demon!

810
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:15,287
You yellow livered swine.

811
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,824
Jack's had our booty too long.

812
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:19,180
He'll welcome his sons.

813
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,714
Hold tight, mates.

814
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:28,182
Secure that rigging, you swums.

815
00:52:28,286 --> 00:52:30,337
This is no earthly curse.

816
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:37,879
Father, dearest to
my heart, save us!

817
00:52:42,988 --> 00:52:45,769
[men screaming, wind blowing]

818
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:15,938
[crash]

819
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:23,689
[men screaming]

820
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,739
[creaking]

821
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:35,124
Get me down!

822
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:40,546
Help me.

823
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,484
Ah!

824
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:47,358
Behold.

825
00:53:47,463 --> 00:53:50,382
The Spine of Chermain.

826
00:53:54,484 --> 00:54:00,323
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

827
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:06,648
Is this it?

828
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:07,588
Dig.

829
00:54:07,691 --> 00:54:10,958
How do you know?

830
00:54:11,062 --> 00:54:14,539
The x on the map.

831
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:15,303
Dig.

832
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:16,450
Go on.

833
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:25,000
Let me help you, my friend.

834
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:27,745
I hope you are not hurt

835
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:30,075
Hey, are you
seamen still alive?

836
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:33,793
We're broken but we breathe.

837
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:42,275
Uh, Captain.

838
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,707
I'm tired of playing
treasure hunt.

839
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:47,384
Let's outside and
play walk the plank.

840
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:50,720
I assure you, that game
is no fun at all, Jim.

841
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:51,659
Dig on.

842
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:52,632
Dig on.

843
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:58,992
[thuds]

844
00:54:59,097 --> 00:55:01,877
I found something, Captain.

845
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:03,025
I really found something.

846
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:04,067
You did?

847
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:06,673
Yeah, yeah, it's right here.

848
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:08,133
It's iron, is it, Jim?

849
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,324
It's the right size?

850
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:11,783
Step aside, boy.

851
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:13,382
This is man's work.

852
00:55:21,063 --> 00:55:24,921
It's a field.

853
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:26,693
That's all.

854
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:28,327
It be a field.

855
00:55:28,432 --> 00:55:29,821
Look.

856
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,325
There's a house in the field.

857
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,931
That house contains demons.

858
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:37,435
It sits in an in
the Sea of Sargasos.

859
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:39,032
Such a gob wit.

860
00:55:39,137 --> 00:55:41,362
You chew too much ginko weed.

861
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,343
It's a bloody field.

862
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:45,498
That's all.

863
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:47,756
Look, dirt, grass.

864
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:48,938
A bunny rabbit.

865
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,780
A bunny rabbit.

866
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:52,449
Shut up!

867
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:55,055
Right, Murzol, over the sides.

868
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,029
Have a walk around.

869
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,176
Oh, no.

870
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,532
It'll swallow us up
like that quicksand that

871
00:55:58,635 --> 00:55:59,713
surrounds the Mayan temple.

872
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:00,964
Oh, don't be a fool, Murzol.

873
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,224
If you're so sure, you go.

874
00:56:03,328 --> 00:56:06,456
Aye, you go.

875
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:07,395
Me?

876
00:56:07,499 --> 00:56:08,506
Uh, huh.

877
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,653
If

878
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:11,113
I go over the edge
and something happens

879
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:13,163
to me, who will be captain?

880
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,736
Satan, for he is here.

881
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,273
That's exactly the
kind of negative talk

882
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,697
that got us here
in the first place.

883
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:20,671
Yeah!

884
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:30,160
I knew it!

885
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,342
I knew it!

886
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,451
This ain't that
chrome mental, is it?

887
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:37,285
Nope.

888
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,606
That's old silver, all right.

889
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,352
It was stolen off the
train by Jesse James

890
00:56:41,456 --> 00:56:42,881
and buried right here.

891
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:45,661
Well, he aren't
getting any of it back.

892
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:50,146
It's mine now, every
sweet silver bar of it.

893
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,030
Now, you aren't about
to tell this Jesse

894
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:55,290
fellow what we found, are you?

895
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:57,653
He's dead.

896
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:59,808
Clubbed him, did you?

897
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:01,233
Good lad.

898
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,631
No, he was shot by Mr. Ford.

899
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:07,176
So, it's just you and me then.

900
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,147
Mate.

901
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:14,961
The problem is I don't see
any way that Glenn Jennings can

902
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:17,465
possibly pay any interest
on this note, let

903
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:18,438
alone the principle.

904
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:20,801
We're carrying her.

905
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,409
Theo, I don't know why you're
so insistent that we take

906
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:25,945
action on the Jennings farm.

907
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:28,656
We would only have to
auction the property off.

908
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,367
Look, Bob.

909
00:57:31,472 --> 00:57:34,634
I'm only worried about
you and the bank.

910
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:36,824
If the regulators knew about
the history of this loan,

911
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:40,890
and now that Raymond
Jennings is in the hospital.

912
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:43,914
Look, I just don't see
any way that there's going

913
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:45,514
to be a happy ending to this.

914
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:06,368
That be him, it is.

915
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:09,182
And that slime of a squid's
belly has the treasure as well.

916
00:58:09,288 --> 00:58:11,998
He must have made a pact
with the devil to live so long.

917
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:13,666
He is the devil.

918
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:14,813
Don't you start now.

919
00:58:17,629 --> 00:58:20,791
Now, Jim, we need to
find a really good hiding

920
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:24,441
place for my treasure,
for our treasure.

921
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:26,665
There be many a greedy
lot out there who

922
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,002
would want to lift it from us.

923
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,574
We can load it in
the four wheeler cart.

924
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:33,547
Four wheeler?

925
00:58:33,652 --> 00:58:34,729
Trust me.

926
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,406
Well, that I do, Jim.

927
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,924
Now, Jim, how can I trust you
if you don't hold up your end?

928
00:58:42,028 --> 00:58:43,209
Hey, Captain, look at that!

929
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:44,843
That's a pirate ship.

930
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:56,800
Blast!

931
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:59,407
That scum will follow
me to my grave.

932
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:04,446
Come on, lad.

933
00:59:04,552 --> 00:59:06,323
We'll need to prepare
for the battle.

934
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:18,211
That's a real pirate ship, a
pirate, a really real pirate.

935
00:59:18,315 --> 00:59:19,183
Adventurer.

936
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,309
Come on.

937
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:40,662
Mr. Ruse, prepare
battle stations.

938
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:42,089
Battle stations?

939
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:43,896
Yes, Mr. Ruse.

940
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,572
We're going to fire
on that cursed house.

941
00:59:46,676 --> 00:59:49,074
With our cannons?

942
00:59:49,178 --> 00:59:51,924
Yes, with our cannons.

943
00:59:52,028 --> 01:00:04,644
[inaudible]

944
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,279
Lock and load!

945
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:08,504
Be warned.

946
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:10,936
Do not bring harm to a chief.

947
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,778
I'm bloody tired of
being double crossed

948
01:00:12,882 --> 01:00:15,177
by that seaweed scoundrel.

949
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,713
We're going to blast
that house into the sand,

950
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:20,286
collect our treasure,
and be seeing

951
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:23,484
what's left of the bodies.

952
01:00:23,588 --> 01:00:27,689
The captain has a habit
of surviving such campaigns.

953
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:32,833
Then he will feel
the scrape of my blade

954
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:36,448
on his gnarly throat.

955
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:40,167
Why don't you take a rest
and find a happy place?

956
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:45,902
Happy place.

957
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:49,099
Happy place.

958
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:52,054
Happy place.

959
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:57,477
Behold the Delilah, her sides
a repetition of cannon menace.

960
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:01,751
She'll soon deliver ball and
shot through this flimsy frame.

961
01:01:01,855 --> 01:01:05,192
We're going to send in
our Air Force to retaliate.

962
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:07,625
Air Force, you say, Jim.

963
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:11,240
It'll take more than wind
to stop these black dogs.

964
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:13,916
They've been under me own
tutelage for three years past.

965
01:01:28,722 --> 01:01:32,754
She'll be squandering
her balls soon.

966
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:35,466
You know, Captain,
if something happens

967
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,525
to either one of us,
I want you to know

968
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,930
that you're my best friend.

969
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:44,120
Well now you be talking
with devils in your head.

970
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:51,001
I'm an old seafaring man,
with no friends at all.

971
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:52,566
It's not for one such as I.

972
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,599
Nevertheless, by my honor,
I will stick by you when

973
01:01:56,702 --> 01:01:58,475
those mutineers come for you.

974
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:07,928
And I by you, with no regrets.

975
01:02:08,032 --> 01:02:08,832
Really?

976
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:11,682
You'll stay here
and Never leave?

977
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:14,567
Till the sun bleaches
my bones white.

978
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:21,588
All right, stand easy.

979
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:30,242
Jim, she's about to
loose her cannons parade.

980
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:37,889
Fire!

981
01:02:37,993 --> 01:02:40,601
[explosions]

982
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:04,513
The house!

983
01:03:04,616 --> 01:03:06,007
Hit the house.

984
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:08,546
It's the biggest
thing in the field.

985
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:12,507
Oh.

986
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,175
See I told you.

987
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,979
[inaudible]

988
01:03:20,084 --> 01:03:22,517
[explosions]

989
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:24,568
Fire!

990
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,781
Stop!

991
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:31,867
That's more like it, ladies.

992
01:03:31,971 --> 01:03:34,230
Mr. Murzol, reload.

993
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:35,168
Reload, lads.

994
01:03:35,272 --> 01:03:37,393
Prepare another round.

995
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:39,200
How do you like
that, Jackie boy?

996
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,457
On the edge, double breach.

997
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:47,716
Go on, go on, hurry.

998
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,315
Smoke him out.

999
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:50,288
Fire!

1000
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,376
Lost all sense of direction.

1001
01:04:04,086 --> 01:04:07,666
They fall apart without
proper leadership.

1002
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:17,468
[moaning]

1003
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:19,518
Captain.

1004
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:27,408
Captain, are you
all right, Captain.

1005
01:04:27,513 --> 01:04:29,389
All right.

1006
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:31,196
You would imagine
I would have taught

1007
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:34,985
those wags to shoot better.

1008
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:36,097
Don't worry, Captain.

1009
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:39,121
We have not yet begun to fight.

1010
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:42,319
Quite profound, Jim.

1011
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:43,292
Quite.

1012
01:04:57,542 --> 01:04:59,732
One more volley,
mates, and we burn

1013
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:02,095
her to the sand she sits on.

1014
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,563
When I tell you to,
throw it out the window.

1015
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,309
You'll not have to
encourage me to do that.

1016
01:05:07,414 --> 01:05:08,317
Ready?

1017
01:05:08,422 --> 01:05:09,186
Ready.

1018
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:10,819
[buzzing]

1019
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:19,475
A flying fire.

1020
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:21,698
The boy must be possessed.

1021
01:05:24,722 --> 01:05:26,877
Or sent my the Author himself.

1022
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:36,366
'Tis a wooden seagull.

1023
01:05:39,286 --> 01:05:41,996
Shoot it down
with the pistols.

1024
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,160
Surely, one of
the evil spirits.

1025
01:05:45,264 --> 01:05:46,793
Seeks you out, DeGroot.

1026
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:49,921
Reload and fire, Mr. Ruse.

1027
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,009
No.

1028
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:04,901
Pull it down, you swabs, before
she catches the main mast.

1029
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:06,708
Tear it down.

1030
01:06:06,813 --> 01:06:08,378
Coming down, sir.

1031
01:06:15,676 --> 01:06:16,615
Suey!

1032
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:17,657
Put it out!

1033
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:18,665
You heard him.

1034
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:19,777
Put it out.
You heard him.

1035
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:20,716
I did.

1036
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,914
You'll burn me ship.

1037
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:24,887
Yeah!

1038
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:26,624
[laughing]

1039
01:06:26,728 --> 01:06:30,100
Oh, Jim, you be a
clever skink of a lad.

1040
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:31,352
Look at the deck.

1041
01:06:31,456 --> 01:06:35,626
She leaps with flames and fury.

1042
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,600
Come on!

1043
01:06:36,703 --> 01:06:38,234
Move it!

1044
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:39,241
Bring the water!

1045
01:06:43,794 --> 01:06:45,289
Hey, I'm here.

1046
01:06:45,393 --> 01:06:48,139
I'll move it right now, OK?

1047
01:06:48,243 --> 01:06:49,356
Come on, give me a break.

1048
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,129
I had to take my
father to the hospital.

1049
01:06:51,233 --> 01:06:52,554
Yeah, I heard it all before.

1050
01:06:56,238 --> 01:06:57,107
Have a nice day.

1051
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:23,487
It's a Nor'easter.

1052
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:27,414
This may be the smile of fate.

1053
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,423
Mr. Murzol!

1054
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:29,535
Captain.

1055
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:31,098
Get the weather
topgallant, standing sail.

1056
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:34,053
Get Get the weather
topgallant, standing sail.

1057
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:35,165
All taut, rig out.

1058
01:07:35,269 --> 01:07:36,972
All taut rig out.

1059
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:38,015
Secure the mizzen.

1060
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:39,545
Pull tight [inaudible] aloft.

1061
01:07:39,649 --> 01:07:41,143
Secure the mizzen.

1062
01:07:41,248 --> 01:07:44,516
Pull tight and
[inaudible] aloft.

1063
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:47,157
What do you
think you're doing?

1064
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:49,485
Sailing, Mr. Ruse.

1065
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,841
Sailing.

1066
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:52,475
[men yelling]

1067
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,303
It's starting
to move, Captain.

1068
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:13,919
[inaudible] Hold tight,
lads, and steady as she goes.

1069
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,570
An extra share of
treasure for the man who

1070
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:19,619
lifts the hair of Jezebel Jack.

1071
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:22,122
Yea!

1072
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:24,347
[inaudible]

1073
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:36,650
She sails.

1074
01:08:41,724 --> 01:08:42,837
We're under way, Captain.

1075
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:44,575
Shall I rig her in?
- Carry forward.

1076
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:48,503
Lower standing sails, and
swing her towards the house.

1077
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:54,551
We'll board her and rid the
world of Jezebel Jack forever.

1078
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:59,068
Are you certain this sword
will find the wags off.

1079
01:08:59,173 --> 01:09:00,598
It's too short.

1080
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,170
Trust me, just pull the cord.

1081
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:04,109
Cord?

1082
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:09,149
Captain, look.

1083
01:09:09,253 --> 01:09:11,026
They're going the other way.

1084
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,971
She be off course a mite.

1085
01:09:13,076 --> 01:09:16,587
She's a lost honey
without her old captain.

1086
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:19,679
We won't be needing
this stuff anymore.

1087
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:25,240
Bring her about, Mr. Ruse.

1088
01:09:25,346 --> 01:09:27,847
[inaudible]

1089
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:36,224
Don't be too hasty, Jim.

1090
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:38,275
She's coming about, I see.

1091
01:09:38,379 --> 01:09:41,159
prepare yourself for
the battle of your life.

1092
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:42,202
What?

1093
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:44,287
Bring her alongside, Mr. Ruse.

1094
01:09:44,392 --> 01:09:48,007
Mind your spirit.

1095
01:09:48,111 --> 01:09:50,057
Ramming speed!

1096
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:51,100
Ramming speed.

1097
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:55,652
Stand firm, Jim.

1098
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,338
Boy, Mom's going to be mad.

1099
01:10:21,443 --> 01:10:24,848
I said, bring her alongside.

1100
01:10:24,953 --> 01:10:26,378
You said ramming speed.

1101
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:29,784
It's a figure of speech.

1102
01:10:29,888 --> 01:10:30,896
Attack!

1103
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:31,835
Attack!

1104
01:10:39,204 --> 01:10:40,733
[roaring]

1105
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:43,235
[clanking of swords]

1106
01:10:45,807 --> 01:10:47,372
[shooting noises]

1107
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:06,383
Come on then.

1108
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:08,886
Ah!

1109
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,146
[scream]

1110
01:11:13,821 --> 01:11:14,656
Ah!

1111
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:29,428
Nice try, Jack.

1112
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:30,921
You confounded dogs.

1113
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:33,251
I'll be the talk of the
seven seas with Jezebel Jack

1114
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:35,997
ears pinned to me
belt. Which limb do

1115
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:38,812
you want to lose first, Jack?

1116
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:40,828
[chain saw buzz]

1117
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:49,378
Now, who was it
bragging about me ears?

1118
01:11:49,482 --> 01:11:51,394
I'd rather pass on me ears.

1119
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:52,714
T'weren't me, Captain.

1120
01:11:52,818 --> 01:11:54,314
T'were him, Captain.

1121
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:56,329
I've only ever had the best
things to say for you, Captain.

1122
01:11:56,433 --> 01:11:58,658
And how will you
speak without your head?

1123
01:11:58,762 --> 01:11:59,597
Ah!

1124
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:05,331
[chaotic yelling]

1125
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:25,004
[humming]

1126
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:30,878
Ms. Yates, I'll
be out for a while.

1127
01:12:30,982 --> 01:12:32,059
Where can we find you, sir?

1128
01:12:32,163 --> 01:12:33,658
Well, I have the
unfortunate task

1129
01:12:33,762 --> 01:12:36,230
of delivering the repossession
papers to the Jennings farm.

1130
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:38,316
Oh that's too bad.

1131
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,880
They're such nice people.

1132
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:44,329
These things happen sometimes.

1133
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:46,415
[humming]

1134
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:50,133
[chaotic shouting]

1135
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,472
All right!

1136
01:13:02,576 --> 01:13:07,685
Child, you have
been menace enough.

1137
01:13:07,789 --> 01:13:09,040
Thanks, Captain.

1138
01:13:09,146 --> 01:13:10,709
Quite the armory
you got here, Jim.

1139
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:11,682
Captain, duck!

1140
01:13:11,786 --> 01:13:12,656
Ah, ha!

1141
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:16,895
I like this game.

1142
01:13:20,198 --> 01:13:21,066
Come on.

1143
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:33,405
Move [inaudible], mates.

1144
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:34,518
Now we've got him.

1145
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:35,456
Ah!

1146
01:13:47,274 --> 01:13:49,429
Beat that.

1147
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:50,611
Watch this.

1148
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:58,917
Ah!

1149
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:03,505
Beginners luck.

1150
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:14,940
[men yelling]

1151
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,580
Bobby!

1152
01:14:21,683 --> 01:14:23,247
[screaming]

1153
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:30,928
Where is he?

1154
01:14:36,837 --> 01:14:39,201
Here.

1155
01:14:39,305 --> 01:14:42,711
I'm gonna rip his
little head off.

1156
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:47,855
Stand back or I'll
cut you to ribbons.

1157
01:14:47,959 --> 01:14:49,593
With what, laddie?

1158
01:14:49,696 --> 01:14:50,983
I see no blades.

1159
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:53,312
It's just a stick with a
noise on the end of it.

1160
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,189
It's your last stand, hey?

1161
01:14:55,293 --> 01:14:56,231
[laughing]

1162
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:57,760
I'm warning you, stand back.

1163
01:14:57,864 --> 01:14:58,907
Get him.

1164
01:14:59,012 --> 01:14:59,846
Ah!

1165
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,481
[yelling]

1166
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:08,570
Get him!

1167
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:10,204
Get him!

1168
01:15:10,308 --> 01:15:11,247
Get him!

1169
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:12,116
Captain, help!

1170
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,166
I need reinforcements!

1171
01:15:14,271 --> 01:15:17,468
You're mine now,
you little land rat.

1172
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:18,442
[sniff]

1173
01:15:18,546 --> 01:15:19,485
Oh!

1174
01:15:19,589 --> 01:15:20,527
[crack]

1175
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:21,465
Oh!

1176
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,115
Get him!

1177
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:26,783
Get him!

1178
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:29,286
Get him!

1179
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:30,328
Get him!

1180
01:15:30,433 --> 01:15:33,108
Get him!

1181
01:15:33,213 --> 01:15:34,047
Get him!

1182
01:15:38,322 --> 01:15:39,678
Stop!

1183
01:15:39,782 --> 01:15:40,720
Cannon fire.

1184
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:45,517
[bam]

1185
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:46,456
Ow!

1186
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:55,319
Get him!

1187
01:15:55,423 --> 01:15:56,778
Captain, help me.

1188
01:15:56,882 --> 01:16:01,123
I'm surrounded.

1189
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:03,034
[pounding]

1190
01:16:03,139 --> 01:16:04,667
I'll get you for
what you did to me.

1191
01:16:04,772 --> 01:16:06,753
[pounding]

1192
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:08,838
Open this door, you worm.

1193
01:16:08,943 --> 01:16:10,472
[pounding]

1194
01:16:12,662 --> 01:16:15,685
[crash]

1195
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:33,689
Stand down or I'll shoot.

1196
01:16:33,793 --> 01:16:35,254
Give me the gun, boy.

1197
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,444
Stand back, I'm warning you.

1198
01:16:37,548 --> 01:16:38,834
Give him the gun.

1199
01:16:38,938 --> 01:16:40,850
Now, you won't be
shooting ne'er a one of us.

1200
01:16:40,954 --> 01:16:41,823
Captain.

1201
01:16:41,927 --> 01:16:43,144
Help!

1202
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:47,349
I wouldn't be putting my
faith in the likes of him.

1203
01:16:47,455 --> 01:16:48,392
Give me the gun.

1204
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:51,903
Captain, I'm in the bedroom.

1205
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,537
[laughing]

1206
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:01,322
[motor running]

1207
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:05,110
Captain.

1208
01:17:05,215 --> 01:17:07,300
Expecting the captain
is a fruitless effort,

1209
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:09,142
I can assure you, my lad.

1210
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:11,644
[sobbing]

1211
01:17:11,749 --> 01:17:12,826
You left.

1212
01:17:17,935 --> 01:17:18,770
You promised.

1213
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,160
Suey, fetch your
skinning knife.

1214
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:39,485
Now you'll be telling
us, boy, where Jack

1215
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,162
be going with our treasure.

1216
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:48,104
Or Suey here will
skin you alive.

1217
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,738
I don't know.

1218
01:17:49,843 --> 01:17:50,850
Of course he knows.

1219
01:17:50,954 --> 01:17:53,145
He's in with Jack,
partner in the treasure.

1220
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:56,689
I don't know where Jack went.

1221
01:17:56,794 --> 01:17:59,262
He left me.

1222
01:17:59,366 --> 01:18:00,999
He's covering up for him.

1223
01:18:01,104 --> 01:18:03,363
Ye seen how clenched
he and Jack was.

1224
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:04,927
They fought hand
in hand against us.

1225
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:07,499
That's enough.

1226
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:09,098
You'll muddle me head.

1227
01:18:15,146 --> 01:18:17,336
Now, you be telling us, boy.

1228
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:21,403
Because I'm losing
patience with you.

1229
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:22,410
Where is he?

1230
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:24,008
I told you, I don't know.

1231
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:30,091
Bring her out.

1232
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:37,251
Bobby!

1233
01:18:37,356 --> 01:18:38,398
Mom!

1234
01:18:45,593 --> 01:18:46,774
Mrs. Jennings,
I'm afraid I have

1235
01:18:46,878 --> 01:18:48,617
some terrible news for you.

1236
01:18:48,721 --> 01:18:50,736
You're not going to be
able to keep your house.

1237
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,614
[laughing]

1238
01:18:54,004 --> 01:18:55,290
Because it's mine.

1239
01:19:18,578 --> 01:19:22,122
That's the problem
with all this machinery.

1240
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:27,962
The Great Author never intended
man to ride bit of iron

1241
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:30,256
twisted around cart wheels.

1242
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,924
Hey, you there.

1243
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:34,078
You almost killed me back
here, do you know that?

1244
01:19:34,183 --> 01:19:36,685
You people need to
stay where you belong.

1245
01:19:36,789 --> 01:19:38,389
You, where'd you get
that motorbike thing?

1246
01:19:38,493 --> 01:19:39,570
Did you steal that?

1247
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:40,509
Yeah.

1248
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:41,864
I stole it.

1249
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:44,297
And what business
is it of thine?

1250
01:19:44,402 --> 01:19:45,792
It's none of my business.

1251
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:49,059
I just thought, I thought
you might want to sell it.

1252
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:50,032
You know what?

1253
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:51,874
I've got cash over here.

1254
01:19:51,978 --> 01:19:53,195
Stop.
Wait!

1255
01:19:53,299 --> 01:19:55,037
Look, I know where there's
something you might like.

1256
01:19:55,142 --> 01:20:00,564
I know where there's a
woman alone, you know,

1257
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:03,066
I could show you.

1258
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:03,866
Alone?

1259
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:04,908
Yes, no.

1260
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:07,445
No, there's a little boy there.

1261
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:08,454
Little fart.

1262
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:09,252
Crazy .

1263
01:20:09,358 --> 01:20:11,755
But he won't be a problem.

1264
01:20:11,859 --> 01:20:12,902
We can get rid of the kid.

1265
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,950
A lad, about eight or nine?

1266
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:20,550
Yeah, that's the one.

1267
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:21,939
Look, I'll make you a deal.

1268
01:20:22,043 --> 01:20:22,981
I'm a banker.

1269
01:20:23,086 --> 01:20:25,971
I'm here to take their house.

1270
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:27,501
When I do, you can
have everything in it.

1271
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:31,011
You can have the TVs, the
microwaves, everything.

1272
01:20:31,115 --> 01:20:32,713
I'll show you.

1273
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:35,530
The house with the boy in it?

1274
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:39,004
Look, we'll do
away with the boy.

1275
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:43,071
We'll be partners.

1276
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:44,044
Partners, hey?

1277
01:20:47,278 --> 01:20:49,814
Mates?

1278
01:20:49,918 --> 01:20:53,360
Yeah, mates, whatever you say.

1279
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:03,961
Cut her where it won't show.

1280
01:21:04,065 --> 01:21:06,636
We don't want damaged goods
on the slave market in Aruba,

1281
01:21:06,741 --> 01:21:07,402
do we?

1282
01:21:07,506 --> 01:21:10,737
Don't you dare touch me.

1283
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:12,476
Oh.

1284
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:14,561
She's soft.

1285
01:21:14,664 --> 01:21:17,516
Be no good by the time
we get there anyway.

1286
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:18,941
I'll take her now.

1287
01:21:19,045 --> 01:21:20,505
Leave her alone!

1288
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,478
Bobby, stop.

1289
01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:23,806
Or you'll what?

1290
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:24,953
Hey?

1291
01:21:25,058 --> 01:21:26,413
Seems to me you're
in no position

1292
01:21:26,518 --> 01:21:27,943
to be threatening anybody.

1293
01:21:28,047 --> 01:21:29,090
Leave him alone.

1294
01:21:29,194 --> 01:21:30,376
I'll do whatever you want.

1295
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:38,752
Maybe, if I carve up
your pretty, pretty mom,

1296
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:42,297
it'll loosen your tongue.

1297
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:49,248
Now, you tell me
where is Jezebel Jack?

1298
01:21:49,353 --> 01:21:54,045
Right here, you scurvy-ridden
whale [inaudible].

1299
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,984
Jack.

1300
01:21:57,903 --> 01:21:59,989
Can you see him over there?

1301
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:01,970
He came back!

1302
01:22:02,074 --> 01:22:04,784
Who came back?

1303
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:06,071
It is Jack.

1304
01:22:06,175 --> 01:22:06,836
Jezebel.

1305
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,191
What is that with him?

1306
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:11,667
Well, well, looky here
what the tide washed up.

1307
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:14,691
Let the boy and his
mother go, DeGroot.

1308
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:15,942
Why should I?

1309
01:22:16,046 --> 01:22:18,966
Because I have
the whole treasure,

1310
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:22,928
50 gleaming bars of silver.

1311
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:25,674
Had a change of heart,
did we, Jackie boy?

1312
01:22:25,778 --> 01:22:27,551
You might say that.

1313
01:22:27,655 --> 01:22:29,775
I peered into the looking glass.

1314
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:31,200
And what did you see?

1315
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:32,139
The devil?

1316
01:22:36,032 --> 01:22:40,098
Aye, regretfully so.

1317
01:22:40,203 --> 01:22:41,384
What are we waiting for?

1318
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:43,331
Let's kill him and
take the treasure now.

1319
01:22:43,435 --> 01:22:46,355
You think you're cursed now?

1320
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:49,239
Try shooting a
captain, and you will

1321
01:22:49,343 --> 01:22:54,383
gnash your teeth in the
molten fires of hell for sure.

1322
01:22:54,488 --> 01:22:56,121
He speaks the truth.

1323
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,928
What?

1324
01:22:58,033 --> 01:22:59,597
Don't trust him, DeGroot.

1325
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:05,748
Aye, Jackie boy,
we be making a trade.

1326
01:23:05,852 --> 01:23:09,086
But we'll not be taking
the silver alone.

1327
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:13,673
You, Jezebel Jack, must be
in the company of the chest

1328
01:23:13,777 --> 01:23:17,567
with us, on board the Delilah.

1329
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,539
Yeah.

1330
01:23:22,049 --> 01:23:25,352
I didn't reckon you was
so fond of your old captain.

1331
01:23:25,456 --> 01:23:28,133
Enough of your talk, Jack.

1332
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:29,627
Hook the treasure to the wench.

1333
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:37,448
First, show me the goods
for which I am bargaining.

1334
01:23:37,552 --> 01:23:40,054
Bring them over.

1335
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:41,445
Bring the wench.

1336
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,877
Captain, you came back.

1337
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:46,831
Aye, Jim.

1338
01:23:46,936 --> 01:23:48,604
Are you harmed, Jim?

1339
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:50,134
Jim, who's Jim?

1340
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:51,072
That's me, Mom.

1341
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:52,254
Huh?

1342
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:54,269
It's a long story.

1343
01:23:54,374 --> 01:23:55,694
I'm OK, Captain.

1344
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:58,162
And you must be
his sainted mother.

1345
01:24:00,596 --> 01:24:01,638
Madam.

1346
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:11,439
Tell that scum to let you
down real gentle like.

1347
01:24:11,544 --> 01:24:17,244
And I will ascend like an
angel with just a small portion

1348
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:19,051
of heaven's paving bricks.

1349
01:24:21,693 --> 01:24:25,517
You had best be square
with us, Jackie boy.

1350
01:24:25,621 --> 01:24:27,462
You're going to
regret this, DeGroot.

1351
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:29,721
You have your silver, DeGroot.

1352
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:31,946
And you have me to make sure.

1353
01:24:34,726 --> 01:24:36,777
What else could you want?

1354
01:24:36,882 --> 01:24:40,010
You have it all.

1355
01:24:40,114 --> 01:24:41,157
Heave ho.

1356
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:42,548
Get that treasure
on board, lads.

1357
01:24:42,651 --> 01:24:43,555
Step lively.

1358
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:49,499
They'll take the silver
and kill you, Jack.

1359
01:24:49,603 --> 01:24:51,132
Don't you worry none.

1360
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:54,642
Your old captain has a life
boat waiting with his Creator

1361
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:58,083
in the sea of eternity.

1362
01:24:58,188 --> 01:25:03,436
We adventurers have a
language all our own.

1363
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:04,445
But Captain.

1364
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:11,986
Have you got them yet?

1365
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:14,524
Welcome aboard, mate.

1366
01:25:14,628 --> 01:25:16,991
The Devil
[inaudible] the terms.

1367
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:24,672
Hold on, lads.

1368
01:25:24,776 --> 01:25:27,349
We're about to sail
the skies again.

1369
01:25:48,654 --> 01:25:51,643
Jack's gone forever.

1370
01:25:55,293 --> 01:25:59,672
Bobby, you want to
tell me about Jack?

1371
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:04,643
(TEARFULLY) We're adventurers,
Mom, with a language

1372
01:26:04,747 --> 01:26:08,327
all our own.

1373
01:26:08,432 --> 01:26:10,412
I'm really gonna miss him.

1374
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:18,649
With a language all our own.

1375
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:20,110
I know.
I know.

1376
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:21,153
Come on, Mom.

1377
01:26:21,257 --> 01:26:22,160
I know.

1378
01:26:22,264 --> 01:26:23,134
Bobby?

1379
01:26:25,775 --> 01:26:28,834
I ought to finish you
off right now, Jackie boy.

1380
01:26:28,938 --> 01:26:31,198
You have your
treasure, DeGroot.

1381
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:34,812
You'll not be wanting to call
down the curses on your head

1382
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:38,531
for the sole purpose of revenge.

1383
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:40,269
Leave him be.

1384
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:43,084
Let's split the treasure
now before anything else

1385
01:26:43,188 --> 01:26:44,231
goes amiss.

1386
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:51,669
Suey, haul it to, mates.

1387
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:04,702
Finally, our rightful purchase.

1388
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:19,371
Bobby, where are you going?

1389
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:21,004
I knew it.

1390
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,608
It's the silver.

1391
01:27:31,674 --> 01:27:32,544
Aye, the silver.

1392
01:27:35,428 --> 01:27:36,853
Sorry, Jackie boy.

1393
01:27:36,957 --> 01:27:39,668
Looks like there's just not
enough booty to go around.

1394
01:27:39,772 --> 01:27:42,762
Oh, well, ye
shall have my share.

1395
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:44,570
You and the lads deserve it.

1396
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:46,759
[laughing]

1397
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:51,312
Don't thank me now.

1398
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:53,641
Come on, lads, get
your rightful dividend.

1399
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:03,963
What is this?

1400
01:28:04,067 --> 01:28:06,431
It's a trick.

1401
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:10,707
You never give up,
do you, Captain Jack?

1402
01:28:10,811 --> 01:28:11,888
Lynch him.

1403
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:20,091
My old mate, DeGroot.

1404
01:28:20,196 --> 01:28:25,061
Witness that Jezebel Jack
is still your captain.

1405
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:35,489
Stand all.

1406
01:28:35,593 --> 01:28:40,180
I'll save you the trouble,
you have mutinous dogs.

1407
01:28:40,285 --> 01:28:44,421
May you all hang at
London's bloody Tower,

1408
01:28:44,525 --> 01:28:49,669
cut by the hand of
good King George,

1409
01:28:49,773 --> 01:28:53,666
whilst I go to a better place.

1410
01:29:00,097 --> 01:29:04,615
Now, there are no regrets.

1411
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:12,886
Oh.

1412
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,590
Our treasure!

1413
01:29:14,694 --> 01:29:15,528
Jack!

1414
01:29:27,797 --> 01:29:29,674
I can't believe it.

1415
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:30,995
This is the wildest story.

1416
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,767
Did you hear that?

1417
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:34,401
Hear what?

1418
01:29:34,506 --> 01:29:35,340
Yuck.

1419
01:29:41,213 --> 01:29:47,087
Well, I ain't in heaven
and I ain't in hell.

1420
01:29:52,127 --> 01:29:55,811
I'm must be in Nebraska.

1421
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:57,202
[laughing]

1422
01:29:58,765 --> 01:29:59,636
It's him.

1423
01:29:59,739 --> 01:30:00,851
It's him.

1424
01:30:00,956 --> 01:30:03,006
Come on, Mom, it's him.

1425
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,979
It's who?

1426
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:09,714
[laughing]

1427
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,215
Jack!

1428
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:17,013
Jack!

1429
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:18,647
You came back.

1430
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:19,620
Jack!

1431
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:23,444
Come on.

1432
01:30:23,548 --> 01:30:24,382
Come on.

1433
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:48,260
[music playing]
