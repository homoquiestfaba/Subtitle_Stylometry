1
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,980
Slow down, Fred.
We wanna get there in one piece.

2
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,660
We're already late. It's the grand
re-opening of the Grimsley Mansion.

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,820
And we would've been there by now if
someone didn't have to stop us for take-out.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,080
Two someones.

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,240
Like, let's dig in.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,280
Fred, the mansion's been there
for over a 100 years. It's not going away.

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm just anxious to take a crack
at finding its secret treasure.

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,860
- Maybe, we'll even see the ghost.
- Ghost?

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,700
It's supposedly haunted.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,820
We better eat up, Scoob.
This might be our last meal.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Whoa!

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,640
Like, these sandwiches
could use a seat belt.

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,840
You may have recognized Grimsley Mansion
from several movie productions.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,340
There are even films on its founder.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,360
Augustus Grimsley. Fascinating man.

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,480
For example, did you know
that he was a Roman history buff?

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,340
An amateur astrologist
and a scratch bowler.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,960
Who cares about all that stuff?
What about the treasure?

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,180
Yeah. And what about the ghost
that haunts this place?

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,160
Gentlemen, there is no real evidence
that there even is a treasure or a ghost.

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,020
Ghost!

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,800
- Please, don't drain my blood.
- Please, don't haunt my dreams.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,620
No, dear. We didn't mean
to scare you that much.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm Charlie Grimsley and that's
my brother Kyle. We're your host.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,000
Hi, there. Enjoying your stay?

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,980
We figured folks
would expect a little scare

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,480
while they are looking for our
great-great grandfather's treasure.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,260
- So this is all a hoax?
- What's going on here?

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,600
I told you this was a terrible idea, Kyle.
The guests want real treasure.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,800
- Not fake spooks.
- But there is no treasure, Charlie.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
What do you mean no treasure?

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,000
My brother is just kidding.
There may be a treasure.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,740
But nobody's ever found it yet.
Maybe you will.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,120
- Then, join us for breakfast.
- Yeah, there's a waffle bar.

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Nah, I wasn't really scared.
At least, we're done with that lecture.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,120
Look at that.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Hey, the treasure could be inside.

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,680
Pulling some more tricks again, eh?

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Phil, I don't think he's kidding.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,620
No, comeback.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,520
Fred, look out!

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,060
Is everyone okay?

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,880
Now we're going to have to find the treasure
to pay for the Mystery Machine.

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,000
Howdy-ho there travelers. Looks like you've
got yourself a smidgen of car trouble.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,440
Wanda Grimsley. Groundskeeper, mechanic,
and and Jill of all trades.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,780
I can handle this.

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,960
You can fix the mystery machine?

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,240
Well, I think I'm gonna upgrade you
from a smidgen to a scooch.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,020
But not to worry,
I'll get it purring by morning.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,960
Meanwhile,
my cousins can take care of you.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Monsters!

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,840
What? Oh, right. Sorry.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,120
You see. It's all just for fun.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Phew.

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,560
Come on in. Welcome to Grimsley Mansion.

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
They were frightened by a suit of armor?

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,480
Yes, it's so silly. Their imaginations
must have run away with them.

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,980
- The black knight, it's gone!
- What do you mean gone?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,720
I mean it's gone. It ran away.
This whole thing's been a disaster.

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,480
- There's no treasure and I never should...
- Kyle, please. Customers.

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh, sorry.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,200
Maybe we should hear more
about this black knight.

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
- I might be able to help you there.
- Oh, this is Adam, our house historian.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,760
Is that a MENSA honors pin?

65
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,920
Why yes. Yes, it is.

66
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,400
- It's very impressive.
- You think?

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,660
- Uh, the uh, story?
- Yes, the story.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,780
Well, it's all part of the legend
of Grimsley Mansion.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,200
<i>In the late 1800s,
Augustus Grimsley was a prospector.</i>

70
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>A very lucky prospector.</i>

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,880
<i>Wealthy beyond his wildest dreams,
and not trusting banks,</i>

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,720
<i>he decided to build a huge mansion
where he would hoard his gold.</i>

73
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,260
<i>He also gave in to his rapacious appetite
for furnishings and antiquities</i>

74
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,640
<i>including his prized purchase...
a beautiful suit of black armor.</i>

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,200
<i>But all this wealth would take its toll.</i>

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,460
<i>Late at night,
Gus Grimsley start to hear noises.</i>

77
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>Clanking noises.</i>

78
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,760
<i>Could only have been the suit of armor
marching down the halls.</i>

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,920
<i>The next day, he found out why.</i>

80
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,100
<i>The armor was once worn by the black knight
who tried to steal his king's riches.</i>

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>But he was caught and thrown
into a dungeon never to be seen again.</i>

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
<i>Augustus was convinced the black knight
was now after his gold.</i>

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,220
<i>He had the armor taken away.</i>

84
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,640
<i>But he still feared the black knight
would return one day.</i>

85
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,100
<i>So, he hid the treasure vowing,
"Though the ghost may search forever,</i>

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,700
<i>"it's my family that shall find.
It's only a matter of time."</i>

87
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,320
Will you guys stop fooling around?

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,380
- Like, sorry, we're just hungry.
- Yeah, hungry.

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,260
Kyle, why don't you take them to the dining
room? We have an all-you-can-eat buffet.

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,680
- They had an all-you-can-eat buffet.
- Oh? Yeah.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,600
I don't understand. If the black knight
was in storage, how did it get back here?

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,220
Wanda brought it back in her obsession
to turn this place into a museum.

93
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,340
And what's wrong with that? It's not like
the treasure hunters bringing in the crowds.

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,660
- Excuse us. Family squabbles.
- What do you want, Wanda?

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,780
Well, it sure would make
my life a lot easier

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,350
if we could take those
heavy boxes out of the van.

97
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,440
Oh, those are my monster traps.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,080
Will any of them catch a ghost?

99
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,280
Since we're staying,
might as well get the luggage.

100
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,640
Why don't I show you around?
This place has such a splendid history.

101
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,840
That would be sweet.
Good. That would be good.

102
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Like, thanks for the buffet
and the midnight snack, Kyle.

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
What does it matter if we're out of food?

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,100
We don't seem to be getting
anymore customers.

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,200
My brother thought the lore
of a treasure would bring everyone.

106
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,440
And it's only brought disaster.

107
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
Huh? Like, what was that?

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,540
A booby-trap.
Our great-great granddad put in a bunch.

109
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,080
Wanda has been trying to remove them.

110
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,040
Like, Scoob, you almost saw stars.

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,380
Yeah, big ones.

112
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,800
Nah, this whole place is a trap.

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Get out while you can.

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,440
He seems so sad.

115
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,500
Yeah, like, isn't it funny how sadness
can sometimes make you hungry?

116
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.

117
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,900
Pretzel?

118
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,600
It's the black knight!

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
Yikes! Oh!

120
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,400
Shaggy! Come on!

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,520
Like, help!

122
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Whoa!

123
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,200
Yikes!

124
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,360
Come on, Scoob. Let's get out of here.

125
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,760
Phew. I think we lost him, Scoob.

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah. And look what I picked up?

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,780
Like, halfsies, right, old buddy, old pal?

128
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
What was that?

129
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,880
Hey, where's my sandwich?

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,060
- Maybe you ate it.
- Maybe someone else ate it.

131
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,240
Like, dude. No way.

132
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,940
And that is my half.

133
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
- Hmm? Hmm.
- What happened to the rest of it?

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
- I don't know.
- I do.

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
Uh-oh.

136
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,240
- Shaggy!
- Like, hugs are not gonna help.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Yikes!

138
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,600
Even though Augustus chose
a Victorian sensibility for the house,

139
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,000
he included eccentric touches.
Like the death traps.

140
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,840
I hope I'm not being tiresome.

141
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,860
Jenkies, no. Coming from you
it doesn't sound boring at all.

142
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,640
- Boo!
- Ah.

143
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,600
Ha, it's just me.
Hey, did you guys find anything?

144
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,060
I think they have, Fred,
but it isn't clues.

145
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,080
You know, my great-great granddaddy
did leave a clue to the treasure in his will.

146
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,280
So, there really is a treasure.

147
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,900
Well, Augustus was a bit of a kidder
and crazy to boot.

148
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,320
He said that the clue would smack you
in the kisser when you saw it.

149
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,220
And I know where I'd look for it.
In his study.

150
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,660
Come on, I'll show you.

151
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,780
We'll join you in a minute.
I still wanna explore the lobby.

152
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,340
Yeah, uh-huh.

153
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't think she thought
you were serious.

154
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,380
The truth is Adam, I'd much rather
spend a little more time with...

155
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Oh, jenkies, what's that?

156
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh, that's a painting
by Augustus Grimsley.

157
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,400
- I didn't know he was a painter.
- He wasn't.

158
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,320
This was the only picture he ever painted.
Right before he died.

159
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,240
I suppose it has a certain
primitive charm. What do you see?

160
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,940
I see a clue.

161
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,460
Here's the study.

162
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,880
- Are those Roman gladiators?
- Yup.

163
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,580
Uncle Augustus sure loved his Roman history.
Well, I gotta keep working.

164
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Happy hunting.

165
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,160
What's wrong now?

166
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,880
- We're being stalked by a hungry hibiscus.
- And the black knight too.

167
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,660
- You saw the black knight?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,260
Like, someone's gotta tell that dude
that knights are the good guys.

169
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,360
Oh, no. The Romans are roaming.

170
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,800
Yikes!

171
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,300
We're locked in.

172
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,900
Yikes!

173
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
Whoa!

174
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,900
They are running on tracks.

175
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,960
If I could just time this right.

176
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,460
Oh, there you are.
Have I got something to show you.

177
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,460
According to the position in the picture,
this is Sirius. The morning star.

178
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,120
Morning star? What could it mean?

179
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,940
We saw a star. A big star.

180
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,540
Just down this hall.

181
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,420
Here it is.

182
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,580
Like, sorry.

183
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,360
Hmm.

184
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,460
A morning star. That's what they used to call
a spiked club like this in Medieval times.

185
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,420
Hey, there's an opening.

186
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,540
I can't see anything.

187
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,080
Wait. In the picture
the star was shining, right?

188
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,780
Right.

189
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,780
The key to the treasure.

190
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,860
Huh?

191
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,780
Like, what do you hear, Scoob?

192
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,940
Check it out.
It's crazy, old, great grandpa Grimsley.

193
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,300
Like, there's something written here.

194
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,000
"This thing runs but cannot walk,

195
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,640
"sometimes sings but never talks,

196
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,400
"lacks arms, has hands,

197
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,400
"lacks a head but has a face."

198
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,160
- It's a riddle.
- It's not very funny.

199
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,820
Let's see. It runs and it sings...

200
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,200
- And it has a face and hands.
- A clock!

201
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,880
Jeepers. Didn't Augustus also say something
about, "it's only a matter of time?"

202
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,940
It's in the clock tower. Come on.

203
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,840
Wait, don't worry, buddy.
I'll find a ladder.

204
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,320
I don't see any door that fits this key.

205
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,500
Maybe it's not for a door, Fred.
Maybe it's a key to the clock.

206
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,340
A-ha.

207
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,940
It fits.

208
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,460
The clock hands are moving.

209
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,660
It's unlocked.

210
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,180
- You did it. You've found it.
- We found it.

211
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,260
- Hey!
- No!

212
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,140
We're trapped.

213
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,680
Like, I hope there's
a snack machine up there.

214
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,380
'Cause this is one long climb.

215
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,760
Like, time to net the knight, Scoob.

216
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,740
Oh!

217
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,080
Yikes!

218
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,020
Over there, Scoob!

219
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,220
Go.

220
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,460
Oh.

221
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,520
- Yikes!
- Dude, what are you doing?

222
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,020
Black knight.

223
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,180
Oh, no!

224
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,740
Hmm?

225
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,760
- Whoa.
- No!

226
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,420
- Bye-bye.
- Scooby, I can't see.

227
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,460
It worked. These bars
are worth their weight in gold.

228
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,860
Like, do you think we lost him?

229
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Hey, Scoob,
does this hallway look familiar?

230
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,140
Yeah.

231
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,440
- Uh-oh. Like, I think he knows.
- No!

232
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,740
Oh, no.

233
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,720
You did it. You caught the black knight.

234
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,340
What is that?

235
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,060
No, Eugene. Come here.
Who's a good fly-trap?

236
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,540
Who's a good baby boy?
You are. Yes, you are.

237
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,000
He's harmless.
One of uncle Augustus' exotic plants.

238
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,380
Raised him from a seed.
Didn't he baby? Yes, he did.

239
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,740
Okay. Now, let's see
who the black knight really is.

240
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,460
Like, it's nobody?

241
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,860
It's somebody, all right.

242
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,940
Kyle? Good heavens. What's going on?

243
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,760
It's pretty evident, Charlie. Your brother
wanted all the gold for himself.

244
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,620
That's why he was so insistent
that there was no treasure.

245
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,460
And when Wanda brought the black
knight armor back to the mansion

246
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,340
he saw his opportunity to scare away anyone
who might come looking for the gold.

247
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,320
Oh, and my plan would've worked too,
if it hadn't been for you meddling kids,

248
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,120
and your dog. And that stupid plant.

249
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,360
Oh.

250
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,060
You're not stupid.
Don't you listen to him. Don't you do it.

251
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,200
You know, deep down I never believed
there was a real treasure, but...

252
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,300
since you've found it, I guess
you should be the ones to have it.

253
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,200
That's okay, Charlie.
We know it belongs to your family.

254
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,560
We're just happy to have found it.

255
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,900
Oh, if you're gonna be that generous,
then the car repair is on the house.

256
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,400
I wanna come with you, Velma. I really do.

257
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,940
But I can't leave the mansion.
They need me here.

258
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,960
And my friends need me. Sometimes
it's such a curse to be the smart one.

259
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,300
We're on our way, Velma.

260
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,140
Where's Scooby?

261
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,820
Like, he's sharing his Scooby-Snacks
with his new friend.

262
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,540
Scooby-dooby-doo!
