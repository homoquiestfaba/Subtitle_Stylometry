Sure, dad.

be doing a lot better.

187
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,735
Yeah.

190
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:21,055
Hey, it's only been three weeks.

191
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,262
Gotta give yourself a break.

192
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,407
Baby, I just see him.

193
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:26,930
I see him everywhere.

194
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,977
It's like this house
felt like a home,

195
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:30,847
when it was the four of us.

196
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,110
Hey, hey, hey... Now, it just...

197
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,590
It'll feel like a home again.

198
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,985
Maybe.

199
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,814
Baby, maybe we should try again.

200
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,904
Seriously?

201
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:44,992
Yeah.

202
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:51,128
You know what Dr. Horgan said?

[Bethany sighs]

204
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,437
But listen,
that was two years ago.

205
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,178
Maybe my body just needed rest.

206
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,788
Don't you want another one?

207
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,876
Of course, I do.

208
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,791
I just...

209
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,359
You didn't see the pain
in your eyes that...

210
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,102
The constant defeat over
and over again.

211
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,494
And I had to feel it.

212
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,107
That's not fair.

213
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,935
You're right.

214
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,284
I'm sorry.

I just...

I can't watch you go through
that again.

I just know that there's a void
in our family

okay?

00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,291
I don't wan to get through it.

224
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,573
I want to solve it.

threatened to kill you.

dull their pain.

around them.

00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,700
He went absolutely mental,
which doesn't even make sense,

320
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,702
'cause it's not like
he's the father, but...

321
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,269

by the water.

It's nothing fancy,

337
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,797
but I think it'll be
a good place to start over.

338
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,843
After I say goodbye.

339
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,847

Hm, yeah.

Do you believe in signs?

What kind of signs?

360
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,042
You know, like little winks
from the universe,

361
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:07,869
that let us know

that some things
are intentional.

363
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:13,179
Sometimes. Why?

- I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

545
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:51,455
- I just um...
- You're having a panic attack.

546
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,915
Or two.

547
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,395
- Oh...
- It's okay, it's okay.

548
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:55,526
Just breathe.

549
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,702
[Breathing heavily]

550
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,355
Breathe.

551
00:26:58,442 --> 00:26:59,879
I used to have them
all the time.

552
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,750
Really?

553
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,841
You didn't think you were
the only person burdened

554
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:05,774
with the crushing psychological
weight of being alive.

555
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:06,798
Did you?

556
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,409
Oh my goodness.

557
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,585
Who is the jerk
with the receding hairline?

558
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,848
Oh, he is a very unhappy client
that I wish

559
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,043
that I could just tell to go
to hell.

560
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:14,894
So, why don't you?

561
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,547
[Chuckles]

562
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,134
You know, I know we just met
and it's really sweet

563
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,788
that you think I'm the type
of person that can do that,

564
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,509
but I'm really more
of the rollover

565
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:22,996
and give you anything
you want type.

566
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,122
What's his name?

567
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,950
Kyle Morgan.

568
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,281
GEORGIA:
Does he have any kids?

569
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,651
Yeah, like three girls.

570
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,393
Perfect. Follow me.

571
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,084
What are you gonna...
What are you doing?

572
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,835
Mr. Morgan! Hi.

573
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,271
Quick question.

574
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,118
Do you enjoy threatening
and gaslighting everyone

575
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,622
with textbook verbal abuse.

576
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,905
Or is that a technique
you save specifically for women?

577
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,167
What the hell are you
talking about?

578
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,627
Oh, I'm sorry.

579
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,542
Should I speak slower
or do you want to call

580
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,607
one of your daughters
and have them explain it to you?

581
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,458
Who the hell is this?

582
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:58,851
[Snaps fingers]

583
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,896
Patricia Allen,
Mrs. Horby's attorney.

584
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,158
You're a lawyer?

585
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,638
Oh, I'm just here as a witness.

586
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,075
Witness, for what?

587
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,562
Would you like to take it
from here?

588
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,433
From this point forward,

589
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,654
all contracts
with Halo Interiors

590
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,962
and Morgan Estates
are officially terminated.

591
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,487
Your business is no longer
welcomed here.

592
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,619
Neither is your nauseating
drugstore cologne.

593
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
[Chuckles]

594
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,235
Your father would be ashamed.

595
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:41,981
The only thing he would be
ashamed of

596
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,896
is me letting you walk over me
for this long.

597
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,771
[Sighs]

598
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,817
Yes, girl. [Chuckles]

599
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,862
I can't believe I just did that.

600
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,386
I have been dreaming
of doing that

601
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,823
for the past seven months.

602
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,128
Well, congrats.

603
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,869
You are officially no longer
a pushover.

604
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:04,524
Hey, Georgia.

605
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,967
This may sound really crazy,
but do you want a job here?

606
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:13,795
As what? Your lawyer?

607
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,232
I think I might be
a few degrees short.

608
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,365
No, no, no, no.
As... as my assistant.

609
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:19,627
It would just be temporary.

610
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,542
I know you're going to Florida,

611
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,197
but maybe you could stay
an extra month, or two.

612
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,765
Just until I find somebody else.

613
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,307
I mean you'd collect
a couple of paychecks

614
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,594
in the process.

615
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:33,032
Wow, um...

616
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,468
BETHANY:
Okay, listen, don't...

617
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,775
You don't have to feel
obligated to just say...

618
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,733
- Yes.
- Really?

619
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,735
Yeah, a 100%.

620
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,390
Okay. Well, great.

621
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,913
Do you wanna step
into my office,

622
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,284
and we can discuss the details?

623
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:55,445
Okay, but you offered her a job?

624
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,449
You should have seen her.
She was amazing.

625
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,104
Okay.

626
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:04,803
Well, wasn't he one
of your biggest clients?

627
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,457
Uh yes, and biggest headaches.

628
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,416
[Keys clatter on table]

629
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:11,157
Hey, are you at home?

630
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:14,900
Uh, no. No, no,

631
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:17,772
I just got back into the office.

632
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,209
Anyway, I should probably
get back to it.

633
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,645
Big day.

634
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,517
Oh, okay.
Well, love you.

635
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,127
Love you, too.

636
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,482
BETHANY:
Okay, here we go.

637
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,880
And this, this is where we

638
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:42,014
that no longer fit in the home's
new design aesthetic.

639
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:45,800
I know, I know, but I promise
you, this is organized chaos.

640
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,324
It's boxes full
of snow globe collections

641
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,892
and mugs from around the world.

642
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,590
Anything that would kind
of scare off potential buyers.

643
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,028
Ah, like this little gem
right here.

644
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,077
"World's greatest mom."

645
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,284
Yeah, you'd have to be allow
that thing in your house.

646
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,691
Oh, hi, Tony, Bradley.

647
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,780
Please be careful with that.

648
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,217
It is worth a fortune.

649
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,438
- Hey.
- Hey.

650
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,005
Oh,
and who's this glowing goddess?

651
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,485
Desi, this is Georgia.

652
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,270
Georgia, this is Desi,
one of our lead stagers.

653
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,012
Um, she's a pretty good
with the clients.

654
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,535
I.e. I scare them.

655
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,797
- [Chuckles]
- Pretty much.

656
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,234
[Chuckles]

657
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,670
Georgia is my new assistant.

658
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:32,107
Ah. And just when I was
beginning to think,

659
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,849
I would never hear
those three words.

660
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,070
And Georgia is staying
with us for a little bit.

661
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,203
Oh, well, that's intriguing.

662
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,639
But also a mini crisis.

663
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,337
We have another
hostage situation.

664
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,904
Wh... what's going on?

665
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,688
The upholsterer
for the Hodge Project,

666
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,579
apparently he's having
some financial problems,

667
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,797
and they're behind
paying their team.

668
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,214
So, the staff had a mutiny,

669
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,390
and now they're holding
our items hostage.

670
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:55,826
So, when is the install?

671
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,393
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

672
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,960
As in less than 24 hours,

673
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,875
hence the slight panic
in my tone.

674
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,809
And we do have other projects
with him, correct?

675
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,226
- Regrettably.
- BETHANY: Great.

676
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,533
Okay, well, just
pay the scumbag,

677
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,970
give him an advance,
so that he can pay his workers.

678
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,016
However, make sure they have
the furniture there

679
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,932
before 9:30 a.m.

680
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,629
Crisis averted.
Oh, please,

681
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,283
make sure to tip them well,

682
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,956
so that when they leave
and start their own business,

683
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,939
we will get a first new
customer discount.

684
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,028
Money's in the safe,
you know the code.

685
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:25,552
Did you have anything to do
with this newfound confidence?

686
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,032
- Maybe a little bit.
- [Chuckles]

687
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,294
Well, it's sexy as hell.

688
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,383
- Thank you.
- But I gotta go.

689
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,297
Stay rich and fabulous.

690
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,515
Yes, ma'am.

691
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,042
- It was nice to meet you.
- So nice.

692
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,564
- She seems fun.
- She is.

693
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:38,845
- Just don't sleep with her.
- Ha.

694
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,697
- [Chuckles]
- Noted.

695
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,962
- Come this way.
- [Cheering on TV]

696
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,100
Hey.

697
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,710
- Hey.
- BETHANY: So uh,

698
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,409
when did you find time
to fold the laundry?

699
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,455
Oh yeah, I got home like,
half an hour early.

700
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,848
Hm.

701
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,173
So, does this mean
I'm doing the dishes?

702
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,285
Already done.

703
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,158
BETHANY:
What? Okay, Superman.

704
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:09,117
So, why don't you uh, bring some
of that productivity upstairs?

705
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,466
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:12,816
I'll be right up.

707
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,471
BETHANY:
Mm-hmm.

708
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,169
[Bethany laugh]

709
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,826
[Sighs]

710
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,767
GEORGIA: Do you mind if
I'm a little late today?

711
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,272
I'm meeting a couple for brunch
about a potential adoption.

712
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,708
- Oh yeah?
- GEORGIA: Yeah.

713
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,188
They reached out last night.

714
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,494
I don't know,
uh, we'll see how it goes.

715
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,211
Um, I was just gonna get
an Uber to pick me up here,

716
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,280
if that's cool.

717
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,195
Of course.

718
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,979
I mean, or I could drive you.

719
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,154

- Hi.
- Hey.

731
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,192
So, how'd it go?

732
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,846
So good.

733
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,674
Yeah, better than good, great.

734
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,197
They were so sweet and cute.

735
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,418
And they've been trying
to get pregnant forever.

736
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,570
And their last two adoptions
fell through at the last minute.

737
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,987
So, they are desperate
and exhausted.

738
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,033
And very, very generous.

739
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,904
Yeah, how so?

740
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,862
They offered to buy me a car.

741
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,690
But can they do that?

742
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:46,040
I guess.

743
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,694
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

744
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,541
And they offered to pay
for that fancy midwife

745
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:52,132
we saw at the store,
and more than enough money

746
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,657
for me to get set up
in Florida after the birth.

747
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,268
So, what happens now?

748
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,922
I don't know.

749
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,509
I told them I'd let them know
tomorrow,

750
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,665
but now that I'm hearing
all this out loud,

751
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,754
that sounds insane, right?

752
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,800
I think I should just say yes.

753
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,125
I mean, what if they change
their mind?

754
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,977
This could be the best offer
I get.

755
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,624
Well, maybe you should just
sleep on it.

756

[Sighs] I don't know.

757
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,767
I feel like I should
just say yes.

758
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,639
Listen to my gut,
and go for it, right?

759
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,183
I'm just gonna call them
and say yes.

760
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,247
Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.

761
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:25,253
Yeah?

762
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,648
What if you had another offer
on the table?

763
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,916
It's not like we haven't thought
about adopting a thousand times.

764
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,484
Yeah, through an agency

765
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:41,269
with a reputation,
and... and fancy plaques.

766
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:44,794
Plenty of people
don't use an agency to adopt.

767
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,927
It's more common than you think.

768
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,408
Okay, and we will still use
an adoption attorney.

769
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,429
Georgia already has one
picked out that she likes.

want me to get poked

and prodded anymore,
this is our chance.

773
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:03,683
No injections, no trauma,
no drawn-out adoption process.

774
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,629
Okay, how much does she want?

775
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,734
$30,000.

buy her a car.

You're joking.

779
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,047
She already has an offer
from another family.

780
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,703
And let me guess,
she wants the money up front.

781
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,358

who needs a father.

Someone to wrestle with,
and play football.

789

Georgia can...

790
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:53,733
Can work with me

900
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:15,889
[♪♪]

901
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:52,630
[Alarm blaring]

902
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,459
Okay, go.

903
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:05,504
[♪♪]

904
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,671
[Sighs]

905
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:42,806
Come on, come on, come on.

906
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,686
Okay, let's go.

907
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,648
- Go, go, go, go!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

908
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,345
- Hey!
- [Scream]

909
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:57,496
Why are you acting like this?

910
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,608
I just want to talk to you.

911
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,021
- Leave me alone!
- Drive, drive, drive.

912
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,045
Okay, okay.

913
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:07,879
[Takes deep breath]

914
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:26,898
- Hey.
- Hey.

915
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:27,855
BETHANY:
How are you feeling?

916
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:29,204
How's the baby?

917
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,990
GEORGIA:
Oh, okay.

918
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:34,035
Better knowing there's
an officer out front.

919
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,602
- Yeah.
- GEORGIA: Yeah.

920
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,689
Carmen says everything's fine
after the fall, so...

921
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:40,186
Can I talk to you
about something?

922
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:42,087
Oh, of course.

923
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:43,174
What about?

924
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:49,094
You and your ex, I just...
I just don't understand

925
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:53,141
how a woman who is so confident
and so self-assured,

926
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:55,143
in every other aspect
of her life,

927
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:57,755
would allow a man
to treat her like that.

928
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:59,060
It just doesn't...

929
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,147
Add up.

930
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,196
Well, I wasn't gonna say
it exactly like that, but...

931
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:06,676
You're right though, it doesn't.

932
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,635
Why do you think I ran?

933
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,419
When I'm not with him,

934
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:14,467
I finally start to feel like
myself again.

935
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:17,818
Or at least the version of me

936
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,168
that I hope is still in there
somewhere.

937
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,256
She is.

938
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:27,206
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about, too.

939
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:30,700
Please don't take this
the wrong way 'cause I'm...

940
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,398
- [Sighs]
- so grateful for everything

941
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,617
you've done for me,

942
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:36,489
but I am not sure
that I feel safe

943
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,057
now that Puck knows I'm here.

944
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:41,973
My heart's been racing non-stop,
and I'm afraid with my high BP,

945
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,100
that staying just might not be
healthy for the baby,

946
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:46,238
and I can't help

947
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:47,693
but feel like it might be
better for everyone

948
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,154
if I just disappeared again.

949
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:50,546
No!

950
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:51,677
Are you kidding?

951
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,114
You are a godsend.

952
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:56,248
We are so incredibly thankful.

953
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:57,815
Please, let me figure this out.

954
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,600
Let me find a solution, okay?

955
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:03,298
I promise that I won't let
anything happen to you

956
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,691
or the baby.

957
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:06,736
- Really?
- Absolutely.

958
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,904
Don't worry about anything.

959
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:11,654
Thank you.

960
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,926
You um, get some rest.

961
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:23,188
Okay. Goodnight.

962
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:24,275
Goodnight.

963
00:47:34,547 --> 00:47:36,157
GEORGIA:
Wow.

964
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,333
It's a lot bigger
than the others.

965
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,118
Well, two beds, two baths.

966
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:41,989
Twice the square footage.

967
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,339
And with us being
on the first floor,

968
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:46,211
you have your own little oasis
in the back.

969
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,606
Total transparency.
It's a tad over your budget.

970
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:53,261
Well, there was plenty of space
in the studio apartment,

971
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:54,392
don't you think?

972
00:47:56,177 --> 00:47:58,223
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

973
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,027
The view on the third floor
are definitely a bonus.

974
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,052
Oh.

975
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,012
Are you okay?

976
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:07,319
Here come, sit down.

977
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,190
Oh. Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

978
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:10,844
I was just...

979
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,935
Oh, I think my blood pressure
might be a bit high.

980
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,284
[Sighs]

981
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:18,504
You don't um,
you don't think it's

982
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:21,463
because of all the stairs
at the last unit, do you?

983
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,638
There are quite a few.

984
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:24,510
[Sighs]

985
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:25,859
It's... it's fine.

986
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:26,946
I'll be fine.

987
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:30,908
Oh, boy.

988
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,564
[Clears throat] Okay.

989
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:39,264
So, if a client asks
for rusted Southwestern.

990
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,789
GEORGIA:
Ooh, okay.

991
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:47,925
I think I'd go
with Spanish textiles.

992
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:49,796
- Okay.
- GEORGIA: Iron work.

993
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:51,058
- Yes.
- Terracotta

994
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:53,017
with natural materials.

995
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:56,368
And industrial touches.

996
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:58,196
You're a natural.

997
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,435
Can't remember the last time
I was this good at something.

998
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,374
Oh now, all you need
is your own computer

999
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:04,158
and your own car.

1000
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,073
What?

1001
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:08,162
- [Clicks tongue]
- Stop.

1002
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:10,512
- You didn't?
- Listen, it's nothing fancy,

1003
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:11,644
but it'll do.

1004
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:13,037
No, I can't accept this.

1005
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:15,865
Yes, you can.

1006
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,389
You are too good to me.

1007
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,088
No, honestly you could have
chosen any family.

1008
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:22,761
And probably a family
that could have done more

1009
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:23,961
than we can.

1010
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:26,572
So, we're grateful for you.

1011
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:27,965
Thank you so much.

1012
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,273
Mmm.

1013
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:37,539
Okay, now let's get
this apartment unpacked.

1014
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:38,671
Oh, phew.

1015
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,542
- I know.
- [Chuckles]

1016
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:41,848
Alrighty.

1017
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:58,422
[♪♪]

1018
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,264
DESI:
So, hot delivery guy came by.

1019
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:08,614
Oh, I hope you tipped him well.

1020
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,398
- Of course.
- [Bethany chuckling]

1021
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:12,618
You know you should really
write a book

1022
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,011
documenting your...

1023
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,360
Slut shenanigans?

1024
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:16,709
I was gonna say lovers.

1025
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:17,927
Ew, why?

1026
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,494
To avoid sounding crude.

1027
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,844
Honey,
if I avoided sounding crude,

1028
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,195
I'd be silencing one of my
biggest personality traits.

1029
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:25,525
Well, that's true.
That's true.

1030
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:30,157
Speaking of dominating
personalities...

1031
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,029
Uh-oh.

1032
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,658
I thought we were done
letting people walk all over us

1033
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,032
like cheap linoleum.

1034
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,424
What are you talking about?

1035
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:39,775
Rhymes with Porja.

1036
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,101
Yeah,
and that's what you're gonna be

1037
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,624
if you keep showering
your new bff with gifts.

1038
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:43,823
They're not gifts.

1039
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:45,564
They're necessities.

1040
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,261
And it's completely normal.

1041
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:50,177
DESI: Look, I like
her and everything.

1042
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:51,831
But I like you more.

1043
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,789
And I know that gorgeous
little heart of yours

1044
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,878
has no bounds.

1045
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:57,769
I just want to make sure
you're being safe about things.

1046
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:00,535
Well, I do appreciate
your concern.

1047
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:03,930
Just promise me you're not
gonna ignore any red flags?

1048
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:05,584
I promise, we're good.

1049
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,065
Just... just trust me.

1050
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:11,416
Okay.

1051
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,635
Now, let's get back
to talking about me.

1052
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:14,897
[Chuckles]

1053
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:20,120
[Gasps]

1054
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:21,730
Oh.

1055
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:23,254
How cute is this?

1056
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:26,170
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh, we have to get this.

1057
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:27,257
Absolutely.

1058
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:39,313
You're back.

1059
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:40,445
How's baby?

1060
00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:43,665
Good, thanks.

1061
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,552
Wait a minute,
I thought you're having a girl?

1062
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,368
I'm... I'm sorry. You must have
me confused with someone else.

1063
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,298
SALESWOMAN: Oh no, but
we met a few months ago.

1064
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:53,926
You were in
with that really nice couple.

1065
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,895
No, never been here before.

1066
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,987
- I could have sworn...
- Uh, do you have this in sage?

1067
00:52:01,074 --> 00:52:02,989
We're trying to stick
with a theme.

1068
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:05,513
I... yeah.
I can check in the back.

1069
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,211
- Thanks.
- BETHANY: That's so cute.

1070
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,561
That was weird.

1071
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:12,041
What'd you find?

1072
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:13,478
Isn't this cute? Look.

1073
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:14,348
I don't know what it is though.

1074
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:15,480
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

1075
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,110
- Oh God! I think I broke it.
- How cute!

1076

Definitely needs some caffeine.

I knew I didn't like you.

1091

I just couldn't quite
put my finger on it.

1092
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:02,239
Until now.

1093
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:03,649
Yeah, I saw the security footage

1094
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:05,851
and I know you stole
from the Diaz's collection.

1095
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:07,331
What?

1096
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:09,071
I didn't steal anything!

1097
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:11,422
Oh, you mean the jewel thing?

1098
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,250
- Yeah.
- I took that to get polished.

1099
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,948
I thought it was scuffed,
but it was fine.

1100

I... I thought it would be
a nice gesture.

1101
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:18,796
I can show you the receipt.

1102
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,518
Oh, fabulous. I'll wait.

1103
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:21,693

to take something
from inventory,

1108

you run it by me.

a good excuse.

for the cheater type.

it's not the first time.

that I didn't have any um,

we... we had a really dark patch.

a one-time thing,

1179

been really tough.

It was before Mila was born.

1184
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,911
But I thought you said
that it was...

1185
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,261
Mila was born via donor egg.

1186
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:20,312

of that list.

You have no idea

1190
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:40,724
what it feels to wake up
every day and feel broken,

1191
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:44,162
because you are unable to do
what every other woman can.

1192
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,516
It doesn't make her
any less yours.

1193
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:54,475
Or him.

1194
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,219
Well, I uh,

1195
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:01,266
I guess the baby saved
our marriage once.

01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:03,094
It can happen again, right?

01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:11,492
Please.

1205
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,945
we'll swing by
the hospital tomorrow,

1206
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:30,774
and we can drop off some
supper, or maybe a couple of...

1207
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:32,558

1208
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:36,866

pressed the wrong button

1212
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:58,802

he's on the floor

1213
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,673
and I'm out of the job.

1214
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,414
You got fired?

1215
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,851
Isn't that what
we're talking about?

1216
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,419
I'm talking about the affair!

1217
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:09,595
- What affair?
- I saw you.

1218
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:11,205
You saw me what?

1219
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,077
With her at Blackbird.

1220
01:02:16,254 --> 01:02:19,605
No, no, hun, that...
That was a job interview.

1221

Terrence, don't lie to me.

1222
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,043
I'm not lying to you.

1223
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,393
I'll show you
the job application.

1224
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,570
Beth, sweetheart, look at me.

1225
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:32,052
I am not having an affair.

1226
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:35,839
You promise?

1227
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:39,973
On my life, okay.

1228
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:42,802
I would never do that
to you again.

1229
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:44,108
Are you kidding me?

1230
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:46,458
That was the biggest mistake
of my life.

1231
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,592
I mean, look, if you're...
You're unhappy.

1232
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,179
When the baby comes, I know
it'll be just like last time.

1233
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:53,508
What? No, Beth.

1234
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:54,596
Time-out.

1235
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:04,258
My love, having a baby did
not save our marriage, okay?

1236
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:08,393
That was you and I,
we did that as a team.

1237
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:10,917
Having Mila,

1238
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:12,745
that was just the icing
on the cake,

1239
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:16,096
that you and I built together.

1240
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:17,968
Then why didn't you tell me?

1241
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:21,101
After the whole Gavin fiasco,

1242
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,801
I didn't want to add
to the stress.

A couple. [Chuckles]

1246
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:37,335
But nothing really exciting.

1247
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,293
Why don't you come work
for the company?

1248
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:41,556
- Seriously?
- BETHANY: Yeah.

1249
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:43,820
I mean, you could handle
all the business stuff.

1250
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,169
That would give me the time

1251
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:46,616
to do the job
I'm actually good at.

1252
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:49,564
Wouldn't we get tired
of each other?

1253
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:50,783
Oh, absolutely.

1254
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,268
But as you said, we're a team.

1255
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:59,444

No. No one else is dying.

Just like last time?

are so clean, right?

Your hands might not be clean,

have blood on 'em.

before your hands are so dirty,

01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:52,043
and turn it into a meet-cute.

1610
01:24:53,478 --> 01:24:54,478
Take notes, young one.

1611
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:56,352
Um, absolutely not. [Chuckles]

1612
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:00,791
Oh, by the way, uh,
Mrs. Fielding's cat,

1613
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:02,203
she just finished having
another litter,

1614
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:03,924
in case you're interested, so.

1615
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:05,404
DESI:
I read an article once

1616
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:07,841
that cats are a gateway to BDSM.

1617
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,669
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1618
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,758
- Please ignore her.
- Okay, I'm kidding.

1619
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:12,909
Not about the cat thing though.

1620
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:14,213
Seriously,
you should look it up.

1621
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:17,895
So, is that a yes?

1622
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,898
You know, I'm good.

1623
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:22,552
I have all the family
I need right here.

1624
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:27,252
Did you really just say that
out loud?

1625
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:29,472
Okay, it sounded a lot less
corny in my head.

1626
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:31,343
But give me your mama a pass.

1627
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,952
[Chuckles]

1628
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,740
Is that Gavin's biological mom?

1629
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,438
Yeah, sweety, it is.

1630
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,616
Um, give me one second.

1631
01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:44,746
I'll be right back.

1632
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:45,835
TERENCE:
Okay.

1633
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,669
- Hi.
- Hi.

1634
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:54,105
I hope this is okay, us talking.

1635
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:56,020
Oh, of course.

1636
01:25:56,107 --> 01:25:56,977
I just don't really know
the rules

1637
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:58,196
for this kind of thing.

1638
01:25:58,327 --> 01:25:59,502
Me neither.

1639
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,548
Oh, hi.

1640
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,246
- It's okay.
- Can I please play with Gavin?

1641
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,422
- Uh...
- Please?

1642
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:07,509
Oh, yes, of course.

1643
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:08,677
I think he would love that.

1644
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:15,082
- [Sighs]
- I'm Cynthia, by the way.

1645
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:16,756
- Oh, Bethany.
- It's so nice to meet you.

1646
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,389
So nice to meet you, too.

1647
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:19,739
Hi, Cynthia.

1648
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:21,523
- Nice to meet you.
- [Chuckles]

1649
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:24,222
Oh baby, I missed you so much!

1650
01:26:24,353 --> 01:26:25,963
Look at you.

1651
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:28,705
- Hey, buddy.
- [Chuckling]

1652
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:31,925
- Let's go play.
- Yeah, come on.

1653
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:33,536
What? Whoa, whoa, hey!

1654
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:34,885
Oh, okay.

1655
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:39,933
BETHANY:
Good, just adjusting.

1656
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,892
[Indistinct chatter]

1657
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:47,811

1658
01:26:50,987 --> 01:26:56,820

1659
