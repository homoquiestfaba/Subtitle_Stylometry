Hi! Are you Johnny? - Yes.

8
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,532
Congratulations
to your profit. - Thank you.

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,507
Charlie, where are you then?

10
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,398
Hello?

11
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,177
Cool hut. - Because I can
get used to it. - Yes, is not bad.

12
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,984
Krasser shit.
- Not bad?

13
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,641
Sorry, folks,
have probably eaten something bad.

14
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:26,895
Have you in the car actually in the pocket
puked or could you's keep in stomach?

15
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,314
www.zvi.com, okay?

16
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,401
Sorry?
- Well, too much information.

17
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,505
Speaking of information.
I know why I'm here, but ...

18
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,990
You guys can not yet
all have won.

19
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,093
What's coming then
here at this rally?

20
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,540
Can I get a bit
Ask attention?

21
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,927
I believe,
I can answer all your questions.

22
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,017
First of all:
Welcome.

23
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,881
Hi! - Hi!
- On behalf of Winfree,

24
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,094
the brand new download service
for cutting-edge, international films.

25
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,107
My name is Maureen.
I'm the housekeeper.

26
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,727
You've already seen me in the clip,
in which the winners have been notified.

27
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,455
First, I say to each
of you briefly what. Charles ...

28
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,751
You are interested in
Technology and Computer.

29
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,610
A little.

30
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,946
Okay.
And Johnny, you are very athletic.

31
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,156
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,908
Vincent, a medical student, right?
- Correct.

33
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,079
Toll! Lola, you know by now, if you
want to make your Master? - Not yet.

34
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,707
Maggie,
how's your clothing line?

35
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,460
Fantastic.
Would you like safely.

36
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,212
And Jenna, I am pleased,
that you care for a few days

37
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,881
from your teacher
free might.

38
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,217
Now, you see, we have
a little research operated.

39
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,721
As a precondition to you
to invite in the Beach House.

40
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,516
My job is, you stay
to make as pleasant as possible.

41
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,729
As the winner of all your costs are covered
and you have the whole house.

42
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,273
You can watch freely
the refrigerator and the bar operate.

43
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,860
Also you have access to the pool,
the barbecue, all sports equipment

44
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,281
and one of the most beautiful private beaches,
has to offer to our country.

45
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,074
For a whole week.

46
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:07,454
Two rules. First:
This is really for each of you.

47
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,684
If one of you home earlier
want to go, then you must all go.

48
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,877
Secondly:

49
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,389
Nobody goes into the sea
after nightfall.

50
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,686
Well then, if you still
have any questions, ask me.

51
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:25,639
Everything, what you should know about the beach,
Joe tells you, the lifeguard.

52
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,869
You can find him from sunrise to
Sunset in his station on the beach.

53
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,901
So much for the rules.
Do you still have any questions?

54
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,880
Well, the allocation of rooms
depends on the bulletin board.

55
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,908
All right. - I would say,
we bring our luggage to the room

56
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,829
and head to the bar,
as long as the hot tub heats. And off!

57
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,136
Since I'm in.
- I've heard bar?

58
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,686
That's what I call "trÃ¨s chique".
Here's can withstand up. - Wow!

59
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,223
So, unfortunately, I still do not know,
which bikini to wear.

60
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,559
If you have multiple doing?
- Yes it is.

61
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,270
I like the purple.
- To me or to you?

62
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,939
Really?
- Yes, I have designed.

63
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,110
These are all sample parts.
And that's perfect now, to try them.

64
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,196
Yes. - Your steamer trunk
is still around in the way.

65
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,115
Oh ...
Yes, I imagine it away later.

66
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,201
Age, look,
This is the bedroom of the women.

67
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,759
What?
- You can see everything in detail.

68
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,540
Charlie, you're
really a tensioner, man.

69
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,959
It forces you no mitzugucken.

70
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,462
So I want. - Me too.
But Depends which undresses.

71
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,226
So, ladies, come on,
always nice to get out of the clothes.

72
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,679
Now making a
after another naked.

73
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,890
Very beautiful.
There you are. Keep it up.

74
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,994
Wait.
Before you go forth what, wait. - Why?

75
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,187
Perhaps here,
just like in these reality shows,

76
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,290
any hidden cameras.

77
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,611
I have in this computer freak
a really strange feeling.

78
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,529
I do not trust.
- There is something on that.

79
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,699
The was also a long time
in the house in front of us. - Precisely. - And ...

80
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,828
I do not know how you stand to
but I do not let me film determined.

81
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,885
I have an app
on my phone.

82
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,460
The automatically recognizes the frequencies
by all camera models. - Really?

83
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,754
Yes, if there are cameras here
we notice that.

84
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,006
What are they doing there?
- Who cares?

85
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,392
But wait a minute ...

86
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,773
What was that?

87
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,014
There is a camera.
Certainly. - Really?

88
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,516
Okay.
- And she's turned on at the moment.

89
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,493
These perverts
Watch us straight.

90
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,829
These Lola-brat is really hot.

91
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,944
But if we report,
might send us home all.

92
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,832
No. It's out of the question.
We're barely here. - Okay.

93
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,825
We have a plan and only,
then to avenge us. - Okay.

94
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,161
Sounds great.
You know what?

95
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,830
If the want to clamp,
we will give them what to tension.

96
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,809
The will
still surprised. Music, please. - Okay.

97
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,850
Wow, cool thing.
Maggie, what a show.

98
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,561
Are they in reality strippers?
- No idea.

99
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,450
Just as moving are the
perhaps supermodels or so.

100
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,329
Real juicy and plump.
Guys, this is indeed so hot here.

101
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,176
The thinking determines
we would always do.

102
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,142
Take off you. But not give them
the full program. That they do not get.

103
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,272
Real beautiful mares.
- Yes man. Krass.

104
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,236
Damn it.

105
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,306
Hey, Hypno-Boy.

106
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,600
Are you on reception?
Earth to Vincent.

107
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,102
Total kicked off.

108
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,440
Only that it's you know, not a bad word
about Jenna. Otherwise I'm going to kill you.

109
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,827
No, whence?
I am focussing more on Maggie.

110
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,872
No, ah northeast.
- What's going on at once?

111
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,665
Is only just
become interesting.

112
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,641
Well, sorry, guys.

113
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,132
They strapped that we sit and watch.
- Vincent, excellently observed.

114
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,218
The finger I had
almost overlooked. - That's not good.

115
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,722
Gentlemen, not good. - At least
I can rewind the recording

116
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,724
and all over again
run from the front.

117
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,282
But then you do not want
be in the room, because ...

118
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,189
But if you want, then remain.
- No I do not want this.

119
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,523
A second hand
can I always need.

120
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,358
I am happy,
if I may leave the room.

121
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,944
I plan an interesting technique.
- We'll just go out.

122
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,581
We will treat your privacy.
- Scratch you a calm.

123
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,129
The makes me crazy.

124
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,639
Which one?
- Maggie, the brunette.

125
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,294
The area is hot.

126
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,464
But actually, I have to say,
all of which are of the finest quality.

127
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,272
This is really frustrating.
I'm just air for them.

128
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,608
Then you must
not change what, kid.

129
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,892
Man, do not misunderstand. But I
take of an old lifeguard

130
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,280
but no advice
in matters of love. - Very friendly.

131
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,774
Then I'll times
verklickern two things. First:

132
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,026
I have a trunk
like a baby elephant.

133
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,834
Hello, My Big,
you have plenty of room in there?

134
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:20,160
Second: The talk about
that it would not arrive on the size,

135
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,329
is a huge bullshit.
Can you fully depreciate.

136
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,249
Look at me. You have to admit,
I look damn good.

137
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,918
Am well built,
Class complexion and so on.

138
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,171
I have in my
Lifeguard house just wait

139
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,089
they come to me automatically.

140
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,677
I also add very much that I
have already saved many relationships.

141
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,599
If I'm not even in it over there,
Then I push myself as a marriage counselor.

142
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,020
Dr. Joe, the lifeguard,
Slash marriage counselor, at your service.

143
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,857
You kidding me yet. - With what?
So that I am a marriage counselor? - No.

144
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,153
But I just do not think you
the women fly on its own, man.

145
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,406
I swear that's true.
No shit, buddy.

146
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,951
But if I am to be honest,
it is not enough that you want them.

147
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,870
You must namely
want to have you.

148
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,789
And how do I do that?
Tell me that. - Okay.

149
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,167
Then listen well.
I'll tell you this only once.

150
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,669
Go down to the harbor
Get a candle.

151
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,381
And so you stand easy
tonight at her bedroom window.

152
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,258
But do not get too close, get it?

153
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,471
Perhaps she finds it but shit.
Are you really sure?

154
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,058
I tell you, stand at the window, okay?
With your candle.

155
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,368
Unselfish you keep vigil.
In any weather.

156
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,874
Wow! - Cool.

157
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,303
The Hammer.

158
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,149
All right.
Shall We Dance?

159
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,001
Do not be shy.

160
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,757
Good night, ladies.

161
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,467
Good night.

162
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,760
What was that?
- A seal or so.

163
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,897
Well, do I sign out.

164
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,888
So, we'll see you tomorrow morning.
Good night, ladies.

165
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,865
Good night.
- What about your jacket?

166
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,288
Keep them. It reflects.
So I recognize you in the dark.

167
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,013
May I keep you company?
- Sure, come on in.

168
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,211
That's the Pleasant
at my job.

169
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,672
In addition, I am learning
always know cool people.

170
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,591
What exactly are you doing?

171
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,010
I do not know
where to start.

172
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,762
The manager.

173
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:30,475
Sometimes I cook
or yoga teacher or tour guide.

174
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,270
Girlfriend, if someone needs a.
- I'd like to do but have not yoga.

175
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,315
Seven clock tomorrow morning.
In all its freshness. - Ouch!

176
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,567
And when does the second hour?

177
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,204
Only to be number two,
you're accustomed.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,206
Very funny.

179
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,795
That was a splash.

180
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,338
I like the prelude.
Especially if he knows what he's doing.

181
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,644
Yes, great.

182
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,274
Okay, so,
I must confess to you what.

183
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,233
I've never really done.

184
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,935
Hey, I can muck, myself.

185
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,397
Already clear.
I make the guys pretty sharp.

186
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,276
But I was very conservative upbringing.
So, after all. I'm still virgin.

187
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,112
But that's okay for me.

188
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,001
Everything else I've done.
No shit, everything.

189
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,388
Want to wait until the wedding?
- No. That's not it.

190
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,789
For the right person happens's.

191
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,641
What are you waiting, Lola?

192
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:41,045
At a friend, a lover,
a married types, an ax murderer?

193
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,853
So, if I'm honest,
I've never been in love.

194
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,193
I do not even know
how love feels.

195
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,846
Can you tell me that?

196
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,573
I can try.

197
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:58,990
I might even say,
that love and I are old friends.

198
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,293
Anyway, there is nothing better,
as the feeling of love or ...

199
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,791
... The feeling in someone
really love to be.

200
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,845
I guess,
does not help me.

201
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,264
Only patience.
That will come.

202
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,876
Well, I think,
I'm going in now.

203
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,754
Or I'll go walk on the beach.
I can not decide anyway.

204
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,391
So to me
now waiting for my bed.

205
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:31,512
I have, in the middle
at night a yoga class.

206
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,024
Me too.
- Thank you for the good conversation, Maureen.

207
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,432

208
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,813
Come out! Is okay!

209
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,119
I'm sorry,
if I scared you.

210
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,456
I have looked at Maggie.

211
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,917
She looks damn good.

212
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,251
But you're not bad either.

213
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,389
You can indeed look calm.

214
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,431
Did you her already said?

215
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,770
I could never do.

216
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,381
Hey, never say never.

217
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,269
If you hire the right,
makes you go that way already.

218
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,026
Would you give me
my robe rich?

219
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,365
Clear.

220
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,932
This coat here?

221
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,314
Yes, the Blue.

222
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,964
Easy Leg him down here.
- Okay.

00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,008

224
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,682
Thank you.

225
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,224
I'm going again.

226
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,101
Hey!
That's you.

227
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,866
With you I have no more today
expected. - And what are you doing here?

228
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,736
I can not sleep.
- Why not?

229
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,287
Because I always
must think about you.

230
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:15,027
Jenna, Jenna!
Say, why are you?

231
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:20,509
Keep The Love lighter wings

232
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:25,764
Now you leave me so unsatisfied?

233
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,597
And what satisfaction
can it be today?

234
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,336
He did not
written exactly

235
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,965
but how do I know Shakespeare,
he would now say: "Come to me".

236
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,772
Give me a moment.

237
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,886
Come on, I catch you.
Come on!

238
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,389
Really now? - Yes.
Come on now.

239
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,640
Okay.

240
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,026
Absolutely no thing.

241
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,237
Ready? - And how.
- Ready? Good.

242
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,231
Everything OK?

243
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,859
If you anhÃ¤ttest no panties,
I could start right away.

244
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,903
I understand you so bad.
Say that again please just.

245
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,407
I could set it aside.
I'm a master of the tongue.

246
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,493
Aha, a master of the tongue.
- Convince yourself of it.

247
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,550
Wait.
- Do you like that?

248
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,174
Someone's coming.

249
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,806
Stop, someone's coming.

250
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,939
Are you all right, kid?
Are you about all alone?

251
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,779
Yes.

252
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,237
Yes.

253
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,796
But I would not want you here
my favorite walk sit stay.

254
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,873
I need a lot of movement.

255
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,603
As a compensation. For my age
I'm always pretty namely wuschig.

256
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,592
Say, you're with your parents
or a couple of friends here?

257
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,978
Or all alone?

258
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,858
I ...

259
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,984
No, lady, I mean ...
I, I'm alone.

260
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,206
Oh, my darling,
you might cold?

261
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,649
Do you want to know ...

262
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:22,154
... Actually else

263
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,381
Ma'am?

264
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,301
Oh God!
- Shall I get you a blanket?

265
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,247
No thanks.
- Here, take my scarf.

266
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,416
No. - Yes Yes.

267
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,053
Good. - Yes, much better.

268
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,822
Cuckoo!
I found you.

269
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,741
Was it just for you horny
as for you, young man?

270
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,037
Now it's my turn.

271
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,281
Just do not, Lady!
I'm warning you! - Shame.

272
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,840
But I Publish my phone number
at Miss Maureen, okay?

273
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,874
I live very close.

274
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,960
In the senior residence 'Feierabend'.
- Yes OK.

275
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,189
And you, my child, have to learn,
to share in life.

276
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,939
Bye! - Bye!
Nice to meet you.

277
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,890
What did you do to your
Defense put forward?

278
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,867
Thank you. Okay?

279
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,287
Now you're with the supervision of it.
Not to look away.

280
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,860
Sharks are not particularly
keen on human flesh.

281
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,447
They confuse people with Robben.
The only reason it comes to shark attacks.

282
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,835
Are you crazy? Why you hang here
so lazy rum? I need you.

283
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,132
So, I have to ask very.
I do not hang around here.

284
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,264
I am cool
after the starting yoga exercises.

285
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,046
Okay, you've caught me.
I cool my cunt.

286
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,966
I hope that they
even still works.

287
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,818
These are pain,
I tell you.

288
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:54,223
I really have to say,
Yoga is very dangerous. No shit.

289
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,392
So, help me up.
Help on me.

290
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,655
No, not you.
Let me go. Hands off!

291
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,065
What do you need me?

292
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:07,420
<I> Well, Lola was jogging on the beach and
has a stranded baby seal found. </ i>

293
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,923
Are you hurt?

294
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,968
<I> They ran to Joe and has
then phoned the vet. </ i>

295
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,556
Make, please,
open the door. - Clear.

296
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,517
Is a funny guy.

297
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,841
<I> Dr. Spencer has his him in
Brought Institute for marine mammals. </ I>

298
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,593
<I> Now Lola wants a Charity Party
on the legs, </ i>

299
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,525
<I> for donations
to collect the seal. </ i>

300
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,889
I find really strong.
- Thanks man.

301
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,868
At the party I am
definitely at the start.

302
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,105
So, then I'm
definitely at the start.

303
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,025
You wanted to come anyway.
- I wish that? - Yes.

304
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,278
Here's it but pretty cool.
- Out here? - Sure, of course.

305
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,905
Namely, with a live band.

306
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:56,243
We have space for more than
hundred partygoers. Bar tables, bar.

307
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,745
Oh yes, that is good.

308
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,248
While we have a whole list
aufgebrummt with rules get,

309
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,418
But we can
certainly talk to Maureen.

310
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,421
You have really a plan.
- Oh yes, and as I have to.

311
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,174
Is like a fashion show,
just without Models.

312
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:14,678
So with less Zickerei. And who knows,
what I still think of everything to Friday.

313
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,597
Incidentally, the party is on Friday.

314
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,265
Yeah!

315
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,446
Not you.

316
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,248
Hey, excuse me!
Do you have a second?

317
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,696
Yes, already. What's up?
- Excellent, man.

318
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,925
Andy West. For friends:
Andy West Coast. Tips joke, huh?

319
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,870
I'm Agent. And in this job
I'm always looking for Models.

320
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,373
You have a really interesting face.
My card. - No shit? - Yes.

321
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,042
But you hear
probably ever.

322
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:49,056
Because you, my friend,
look like a real movie star.

323
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,008
Suppose I am interested.
- Did you Headshots?

324
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,815
Is that something to drink?

325
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,887
Real funny, buddy!

326
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:01,308
Just go once a bartender and say,
you would have liked a few headshots with ice.

327
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,645
No, little one, now let's be serious.
These are pictures, man.

328
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:08,107
So professional photos.
Do you have any? - No I did not.

329
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,025
I ... - It does not matter
we do it like this:

330
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,944
I call to a colleague.
The cares drum.

331
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,405
Be easy back here tomorrow.
Namely, at the same time. - Cool.

332
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,448
Cool thing, man!

333
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,575
Do me a Favour
and wear something fancier.

334
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,257
I would say,
a white shirt.

335
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,706
Wait a minute. Perhaps the police chief.

No shit. - Thank you.
- What is the secret truth?

361
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,999
How do you mean?
- Why it tastes so good?

362
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,711
Well, the recipe is from my mother,
and she always said,

363
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,714

Is a gustatory orgasm.

00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,931
Fuck it all.

371
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,193
Let nothing go to waste.

372
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:06,980
Saugut.

373
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,622
This is too good.

374
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,826
Revenge is sweet.

375
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,712
Especially with a pudding.

376
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,846

00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,073
For sure?

383
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,105

Okay.

00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,704
So ...

387
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:10,659
We want to male
Roommates avenge their Spanner action.

388
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,121
And now is the camera

389
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,415
I installed it.

00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,350
Okay, and now comes the best part.

392
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:29,094
Perhaps they have chocolate pudding with
tons of really nasty laxative gefuttert.

393
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,515
Holy shit. - That's right,

So a lousy digestion.
You two really totally weak stomachs.

00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,730
Oh, fuck!

Drink this.

407
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,527
Beer has the opposite effect.

408
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,831
Shit, really bad.

409
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,663

One more time!
Oh man!

422
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,254

Unbelievable.

00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,762
Three kilos weggekackt.

425
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,716
The abdominal muscles feel great.

426
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,184
Oh, fuck!

427
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,732

428
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,681
Dude, no! Dude! No!

429
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,517
No, no ... - Dude!

00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,062
Damn it all!
Listen only on, dude!

431

Here, my hand.
- Okay.

433
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,093
A satisfaction. - That comes but
something from the Internet, right?

434
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:42,180
Sure, of course. What do you think, how many
You-Tube-clicks we get for it?

435
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,692
Much shit?
- Then it fits yes!

436
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,452
The sluts we do cold.

437
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,287
However.

438
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,165
Briefing.

439
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,114
What you have there?

440
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,549
That's my secret,
small security camera.

441
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,620
I've found in the toilet.

442
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,416
And here I have the unique
Proof that we were poisoned.

443
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,803
Of these damned
Bitch wives.

444
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,254
That was in the garbage.

445
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,688
Our shits
comes from the pudding.

446
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,970
Then who so your
small hidden camera tensioner

447
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,974
and palmed us because
in their super delicious chocolate pudding?

448
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,727
Actually it was quite funny
and we survived it. - Toll!

449
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,772
Probably, it is already online,
if I judge this Lola properly.

450
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,251
If they want war,
then she gets him.

451
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,071
Hey, dude, so I do not think
that it has put online.

452
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,449
Get your easy loose.
Funny is funny.

453
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,994
You've got the fucking camera in their
Room hidden. Have you started.

454
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,370
That's not the same.

455
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,957
We must make it clear to them,
that they have gone too far.

456
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,919
Because maybe I get
Reparation sex of Maggie.

457
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,589
Or maybe as
Excuse me a video.

458

So one that I then me alone

00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,233
I'm a likeable guy.

461
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,358
Jenna!

462
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,521
I'm sorry, honestly.

463
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,828

That was mean.

465
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,626
Honestly not.
Otherwise I would have warned you.

Have ye found not funny?

470
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,749
No,
So I can not say.

471
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,841
You're doing a great noise.
- Hey, so please. We walk a bit.

472
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,344
Do you think you already
Nasties from?

473
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:24,384
Well, to be honest, we are ashamed
all of us for what we have done.

474
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,345
Even Jenna, although they
has it knew nothing.

475
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,348
We will prepare you
We are sorry for dinner.

476
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,735
An especially
delicious Thai food.

477
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,354
That will put you
the guys do not buy.

478
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,650
I also do not know if I sisters you
after this shit action still to be trusted.

479
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,129
Please, please, please,
Accept the apology.

480
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,952
Well, I suppose they,
but that only applies to me.

481
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,163
With Charlie and Vincent
you will still need to talk.

482
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,498
Sure, of course.

483
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,804
Good.

484
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:06,009
I think Johnny is a very honest
and pretty nice boy.

485
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:09,512
And he looks good enough to eat,
have you not noticed.

486
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,850
That just adds properly. - Displays Lola,
"That does not know how love feels,"

487
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,227
about interest
the opposite sex?

488
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,365
I just said,
He's a nice guy and no more.

489
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,662
You know what?

490
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,946
I ventured enough
to know that when someone says:

491
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,255
and no more,
which actually means the opposite.

492
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,829
You tolerate anyway
no contradiction.

493
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,998
So what.

494
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,585
<I> âª Lola loves Johnny!
Lola loves Johnny! </ I>

495
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,837
Stop!
He might hear you yet.

496
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,257
You like him, then?
- Just not. Just not!

497
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,843
Oh.
- Oh but. Oh but

498
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,402
Liar, liar,
you're an old liar.

499
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,868
Well,
He's a hot guy.

500
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,823
Well finally.

501
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,536
I'll tell you what we are doing now.
We show him the way.

502
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,985
Before dinner, you will make yourself up.
You have to make yourself really sexy.

503
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,155
I also have a top case.
That is it in combination with your tits

504
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,450
simply cut only from the stool.
But really. - All right.

505
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,579
Do you promise me that you behave,
while I'm away? - Of course.

506
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,386
Okay, see you later.

507
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,254
What are you already doing again?
- Nothing, why?

508
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,642
If only once again a secret ingredient.
For those who love boys.

509
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,345
What is it now?

510
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,904
A little finesse,
supports their masculinity.

511
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,701
Aha, their masculinity.

512
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,815
For someone who has never had sex,
you have it but sly old ears.

513
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,901
We Jenna promised,
that we no longer do such things.

514
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,038
You might.
And if.

515
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,300
Food is ready!

516
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,382
Smells so yummy.

517
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,177
Oh, no, Charlie.
The place is only reserved otherwise.

518
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,504
Is indeed something completely new.
I did not realize,

519
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:11,315
that the spaces are allocated here.
- Charlie, sit down next to me, please, okay?

520
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,578
Johnny.

521
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,735
Earth Johnny!

522
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,872
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

523
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,657
Tell me,
what does that mean?

524
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:39,787
An Asian, good food.
Muay Thai.

525
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,956
Does not
a martial art?

526
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:46,377
Is not it. - Who says we
can trust you? - Yes that's true.

527
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,856
Oh please, but everything is back
came out, is not it?

528
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:56,679
My dad always says, and is a doctor,
over Poop will not talk while eating.

529
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,066
Guys,
We're really very sorry.

530
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,154
Maggie was the whole day in the kitchen
and has toiled without end,

531
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,106
order you to cook this delicious food.
Of course they expected because that ...

532
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,992
... Her pure skin.

533
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:16,365
Here, this special sauce
belongs necessarily so.

534
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,342
What do you all have
after eating before?

535
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,205
So we go afterwards
definitely a party.

536
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,708
There is a band playing and we want to check,
whether it is good for our fundraising event.

537
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,095
Cool, we are the
Daredevil troupe.

538
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,426
Okay, well, cool.

539
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,054
So, we are not yet
the daredevil troupe.

540
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:44,036
You do not like the term well.
Forget it. No shit, I ...

541
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:51,400
Sorry, friends. That's a private party
and you will not get in.

542
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,127
Take care, friends, makes it good.

543
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,715
Waits
let me through times. Thank you.

544
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,951
Let me take care of it ...
- What. Hi!

545
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,537
Hi! - What's going on? - We are on
Looking for a strong man.

546
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,998
Because you are right with me.
How can I help you, friends?

547
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,417
You look so familiar.
Do we know each other?

548
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,919
We are friends of Maureen.

549
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,838
You mean maybe my brother.

550
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,770
Brother From Another Mother.

551
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,261
<I> âª Sweet Maureen </ i>
You know determines this song.

552
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:21,319
Could it be,
that you speak of Sweet Melissa?

553
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:26,018
There is a difference because there ...
- Listen.

554
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,657
I know the difference.
Are you telling me I'm stupid?

555
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,235
I'm doing a video.
So if you ... - I do not care.

556
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,738
So, Maureen has ...
- Oh, Sweet Maureen.

557
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:42,660
Of course, friends. You can now
all go in. Have fun, and friends.

558
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,745
You can do,
what you want.

559
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,665
Enjoys it.
You can stay as long as you want.

560
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,053
Everyone of you.
Each of you except him.

561
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:17,584
The band's really cool!
Of course we need for our party!

562
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,002
That you were.

563
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,201
Man silk, disturbed her.
- Shit wives.

564
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,181
Hey people,
where are you going? Oh, men.

565
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,560
They will surely not about
be offended, do not you think?

566
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,250
I do not find that funny.
Not at all.

567
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:42,071
Do you know what we just
by making had? - Tell it to me.

568
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,992
We did not know how we go again
should come, so we hitchhiked.

569
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:49,161
We have with our rock-hard
Tails standing by the roadside.

570
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:53,416
Of course, no one has stopped.
Only this crazy old woman.

571
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,895
Hi, guys!
If you want, we will take with you.

572
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,425
Very happy, but have you
plenty of room for the three of us?

573
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:06,929
No problem.
We sit down on top of you.

574
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:11,225
We sit down on top of you all. - Please?
That would suit you so. Are you kidding me? Are you serious when you say that.

575
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,352
Come on, guys,
brings you in safety!

576
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,704
I think I'm crazy.

577
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:19,585
Oh, Uschi. Afterwards, Uschi!
Afterwards! Driving first to the beach.

578
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,153
We are cut off
namely to the beach.

579
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,740
We thought we got rid of them.
- Guys, can you please help me?

580
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,702
I can in this darkness the
Not recognize Bannister properly.

581
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,509
Bad if you're old ...

582
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,886
A beautiful banister, yes.

583
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,439
Au, not so rough.

584
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,982
Oh, Lord,
get me not to you!

585
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,567
Watch out,
that they do not fall down, Charlie.

586
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,783
Thank you for helping me.

587
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,524
Juhu, dear boys!
- Which has a force. - You are welcome!

588
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,110
Goodbye!
- A nice old lady.

589
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,216
Yes, and how. You she has not even
grabbed by the tail. So shut the fuck up!

590
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,829
You're really mad at me, right?

591
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,307
Or we find
Use for this part?

592
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,045
That's not funny.
The has torn us almost the tails.

593
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,632
I wanted to also not be funny,
but rather practical.

594
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,301
All right. - But if you do not ...
You already know...

595
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,610
Can we perhaps it
use as a hat rack?

596
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,850
As a shoehorn?
We can also throw horseshoes.

597
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,408
Enough penis jokes.
I'm serious now.

598
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:49,299
<I> FOURTH DAY </ i>

599
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,693
With you is yes

600
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,500
Hey guys, good morning.

Today is your lucky day.
I'll make you my famous namely,

602
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,453
candied smiley-face pancakes
with whipped us maple syrup.

603
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,371
How much appetite did you?

604
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:42,001
After your real nasty attack
last night on the most intimate area,

605
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,889
is surely clear,
that we eat your stuff ever again.

606
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,478
You have for the last time
euern had fun.

607
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,062
Well, more remains for us.

608
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,723
I do not know how it's done to you,
but after many dancing at the party,

609
00:49:55,743 --> 00:50:00,227
I have a hammer moderate Kohldampf.
I suppose six. Please stacked.

610
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:04,064
Come immediately. - I can not's
suffer when food is thrown away.

611
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,276
So, I take a few.
- I like that about you. - On principle.

612
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,570
Here please.
- I'll show you how to be eaten.

613
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,156
We eat from the same plate.
- No, we are not.

614
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,587
Too late.
- It's okay.

615
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:23,459
Small, you have something
Eaten bad or ...

616
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,628
I'm doing so crappy.

617
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:31,110
Although is very intimate,
but you had sex in the last few days?

618
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,737
But I have not rumgehurt.

619
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:39,808
Well, you're too late
or you have not you protected?

620
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:44,198
You do not think that ... - I think
you should take this test, Jenna.

621
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,362
You know how that goes?

622
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,532
Have previously never made a,
if that's your question.

623
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:58,387
Is everything in the package.
Let me know if I can help you.

624
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,513

What is it to you for a warthog
raced through the liver?

632
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,903
Hey! - So see you soon.
- Bye, Honey. - Bye.

633
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,856
Call me from Paris.
- Yes I do. - Promised? - Yes.

634
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,335
Okay I got it.
I wish you a good flight. Bye Bye.

635
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,751
Damn it. I guess I'm at
a turning point arrived, man.

636
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,202
You need Joe,
Be the lifeguards.

637
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,538
Johnny, right?
- Yes, how did you know?

638
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,875
I am pleased. I deal
me always with the winners.

639
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,932
I want to know,
who depends here.

640
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,347
So what's up?

641
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,467
I'm not sure, because I
have never thought about it.

642
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,025
Who pulls the well
serious consideration?

643
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,389
Believe me,
Such problems have very many.

644
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,642
You're out of here.

645
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,144
Is anyone ever
come to the beach

646
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,158
and has offered you
To become a movie star and model?

647
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,540
Was that a guy or a woman?
- That was a guy.

648
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,113
Did he touch your penis
or a different part of the body?

649
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,699
Oh no, in this direction it is
not gone. - If yes may be.

650
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,302
I have to exclude it.
Well, listen.

651
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,427
I think something comes
every now and then before.

652
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,708
And if you believe,
that what is for you,

653
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,015
Then Try it out for yourself.

654
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,339
Thank you, Joe.
No thing, man. Good luck with it.

655
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,146
Thank you.
- Keep me up to date.

656
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,233
That should not have happened.
Not really.

657
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,320
That was a few weeks ago
and he is a huge asshole.
658
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,741
At least for one thing
he had to use surely.

659
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,566
This is not now
the right time for such a thing.

660
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,986
It just developed
everything really well with Vincent.

661
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,572
I thought,
that could be really something,

662
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,742
and if I say it to him,
He will hate me for all time.

663
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,799
And if not you tell him?

664
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,706
You make it easy
your little secret.

665
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,959
If yes just typical.
But I pull something not.

666
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,187
I would never do that to him.

667
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,424
Want to have the baby?
- Can I get you now not answer.

668
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,677
I am actually much too young.
- You do not have to justify yourself.

669
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:05,347
Not really. Before anyone.
Do what you think is right.

670
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,434
Perhaps the bond
between Vincent and you strong enough.

671
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,061
No she is not.
I can not do this.

672
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,199
I can not do that to him the real.
I can not but ...

673
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:17,828
Shit.

674
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,457
You have to give time to her now.

675
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:39,770
Hey, Johnny!

676
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,853
Hi, Lola!

677
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,638
Beautiful bikini. - Thank you.

678
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,617
I hop into the hot tub now.
Want to come in with?

679
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,905
According to me.
- I do not want to compel yes.

680
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,858
Sorry, I'm just
not particularly good mood.

681
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,319
Is somehow a
pretty strange day today.

682
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,705
What happened?

683
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:06,718
Nothing at all. Have still no owner
what belongs. That's the problem.

684
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,928
Then come on in now.

685
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,873
Actually, you're
not my type,

686
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,931
but I'll simply times
make an exception with you.

687
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,430
That is nice of you.

688
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:22,257
I am not only
the successful college athlete.

689
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:26,271
I have more hopes
and dreams. I have a degree.

690
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,598
What did you study?
- Sport Sciences.

691
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,935
But one day, as I had
an experience that everything has changed.

692
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,572
That was nice
a while ago in a theater.

693
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,209
Since I had my doubts.

694
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,252
What? I thought,
I'm not your type.

695
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,044
I told you that I
when you make an exception.

696
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,915
But you did not
something tipped into the water?

697
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,895
I'm understandably cautious.
- Is nothing in it except me.

698
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,223
All right.

699
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,097
If a horse in a bar.
The bartender says:

700
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,858
"Why the long face?"

701
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:16,395
Checked?
- The Gag is 100 years old.

702
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:19,231
I think I am
really at a crossroads.

703
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,818
No matter which way I look,
everywhere just wasteland.

704
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,172
I have until a week ago
not even seen the sea.

705
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,366
Now I swim in it rum.
Only a few days ago

706
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,870
a stranger comes up to me
and offers me that he helps me,

707
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,256
my dream to live.

708
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,040
No shit,
how often does something like that before already?

709
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,418
Was clear that he
now no longer reports.

710
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:44,381
I could see already that it on
the world is so much more than I thought times.

711
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,802
Everyone has actually a lot more options.
I think I'll move here.

712
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,031
Very impulsive, do not you think?
- Well, if you say so.

713
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,863
At home keeps me
Simply nothing.

714
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,286
I'm as good as here.

715
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,885
I do not know,
What I should say.

716
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,384
You must indeed say anything.

717
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,060
What you up to?

718
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,469
Okay.

719
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:12,650
What was that? - Sorry, I thought
Anyway, that brings women in the mood.

720
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,041
Jenna?

721
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,207
Hey, Jenna.

722
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,261
I have you
been looking for everywhere.

723
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,762
Now you've found me yes.
Unfortunately, you did.

724
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,013
So please,
what do you mean "unfortunately"?

725
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,091
Hey. - Have the whole day
I tried, you go out of the way.

726
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,898
Here we have to talk.

727
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:23,318
This is all much too fast to me.
Well, I really want to ...

728
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,410
I can not...
I do not think this is going to work.

729
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,328
Okay.

730
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,116
We were maybe
really fast.

731
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,535
We do now
just a little slower.

732
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:44,621
That's fine for me.
Honest. - No, Vincent, no.

733
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,679
You did not understand me.
This is not a good solution. I ...

734
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,795
I think I got us
since purely ridden almost in what.

735
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,602
I want to in any case.

736
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:58,301
I ... I can not tell you,
if I'm still here tomorrow.

737
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,563
I probably go
home. - What?

738
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:04,057
You ...
You can now not go easy.

739
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,810
If you do that,
it was really with us.

740
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,104
And all the others
must then also home.

741
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,106
Do you really want do you mean?

742
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,024
You can not be serious.

743
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,412
That was until now
really nice with us two, right?

744
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,262
I would still do anything for you.

745
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,500
You can not just now but
disappear from my life.

746
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,886
Farewell, Vincent.

747
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,681
I hope,
that we are never again.

748
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,675
When I least
would know your reasons.

749
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,063
Well, then I'm going.
- No, I'll go.

750
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,195
I want you to stay.

751
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,287
Your cute,
nocturnal visitor is back.

752
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:10,015
Was clear. That's cute.

753
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,841
Let yourself his efforts
actually completely cold?

754
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:23,929
What should I do? Should I bring a
blow, just because he holds a candle stupid?

755
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,181
I think it's beautiful
quite romantic.

756
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,017
If you do find that great,
then you could it perhaps

757
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:34,231
on behalf of us both suck a.
But I should do it,

758
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:38,211
then it will last a lifetime
on this action to masturbate.

759
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,113
I would for all time
burning in his brain

760
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:46,844
as the little bitch that he
his brain has blown out of the tail.

761
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,163
Get ready would him.

762
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:54,143
Sorry, Charlie.
No, this is not.

763
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,145
Hi.

764
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,054
I'll be right back.
Or not.

765
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,361
Have fun.
- I have that safe.

766
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,313
Hi! - Hey!
- That's a surprise.

767
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,150
Shall we two a bit
to take a walk on the beach? - Good idea.

768
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,377
Well then go.

769
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,558
Hey, you take a chair.

770
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,697
Do you want a beer?
- Yes, I could well tolerated.

771
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,042
So what's up?

772
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,633
I can bury my future plans.

773
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,011
What are your plans?

774
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:18,710
Jenna wants again
drive back home. Tomorrow.

775
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,628
You know maybe, why?

776
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,516
No, I have not heard anything.

777
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,052
I can anhauen Lola,
which is to talk to her.

778
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,470
What was that?

779
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,138
Jenna?

780
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,195
You do not want to
come to me down?

781
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,896
You know exactly
that the situation does not change,

782
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,482
just because you're in your
Schneckenhaus verkriechst.

783
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:42,960
So now come down,
otherwise I get high.

784
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:49,366
You're really very friendly and I know
appreciate the fact that you look after me.

785
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,619
Even in places that I thought,
that no one will find me there,

786
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,455
and the already
the second time this week.

787
01:04:55,475 --> 01:05:00,543
But just because you found me,
that does not mean that you know me.

788
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,421
Or?
You do not know me, no.

789
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:07,133
And you also do not know anything
about me and my life, Maureen.

790
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,190
Okay, that's enough now.
I'll be high.

791
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,516
But I know you well enough,
to know that you like children.

792
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:18,576
And that you never do anything
would that could endanger a child.

793
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,251
I just want to
think in peace.

794
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,997
The thing about Vincent
I have finished.

795
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:32,283
And I know,
that you will not hear the,

796
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:36,343
but I will here certainly
can get through a day longer.

797
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,389
So. - I'll leave the Beach House.
I can not do this.

798
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,730
So what happens.

799
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,360
And I beseech thee,
Meet any hasty decisions.

800
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,608
Sleep over it again.

801
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,612
Who comes here?

802
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,412
Can I? - Yeah, right.

803
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,255
On the love.
- Hey, fuck you.

804
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:15,803
Say, only is Vincent shit plan
and now you. What happened?

805
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,220
Hey, all right?
- Can I have one more thing, brother?

806
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,948
Yes, if you still want one.

807
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,203
Respect.

808
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,047
Krass, right?

809
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,302
Wow! - That was pretty bad.
So what I have never seen man.

810
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,477
Dude, why are you doing this?
- What?

811
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,184
What?
So much booze.

812
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:13,176
I hate beer.
I hate how it smells.

813
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:16,906
I hate what it tastes like.
I hate it really totally.

814
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,350
That's why I can only drink so's.

815
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,989
If a trick I
learned in the fraternity.

816
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,626
One trick
you've learned since.

817
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,737
Frankly, you do not look
as a connecting brother.

818
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:37,127
Yes, I am indeed none.
- I do not fit to those who say that.

819
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,287
Although I all their
Shit took part.

820
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,264
I was shot the same.

821
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,637
The only thing that I as
could pull out, is that stupid trick.

822
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:52,645
And an idea,
what I am and what is not.

823
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,051
Then we change that.

824
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,858
New meeting.

825
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,098
The meeting of the Brotherhood
is hereby opened.

826
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,767
I nominate Charlie
as our President.

827
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,495
Those in favor, raise your hand.
- Here! - Here!

828
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:11,077
The result is unanimous.
Charlie is the new president of the Brotherhood.

829
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,584
Response!

830
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,877
Only a beer,
then the speech.

831
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,676
I want at
the Brotherhood to thank.

832
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:39,655
For recognition
my leadership potential.

833
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:48,994
I would add that this is the largest
Is honor that I have ever approached.

834
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,998
On the Brotherhood.
- In the Brotherhood!

835
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:01,010
Do you think he was injured?
- No, the grass is still soft.

836
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:05,135
So, he likes me
actually best.

837
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,259
Well.

838
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,367
You've expressed, but nice.

839
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,895
Oh man,
is the ass hard.

840
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,981
You know what?
You're a pretty decent guy.

841
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,735
The Brotherhood leaves no
her brothers alone. - That's how it looks.

842
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,291
Time for the box, Charlie.

843
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,410
Today is a great day.

844
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,913
Much larger is the evening.

845
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,140
Party!

846
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:52,460
Subsequently, immediately after Yoga,
we go over

847
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,296
and help others at
the preparations for the party.

848
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,882
I'll call the vet also
and wonder how it's Stanley.

849
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:00,635
Honestly,
there's even more trouble, folks.

850
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,147
Jenna has with Vincent
Final done.

851
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,683
Oh, here they have yet
so well fitted together.

852
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,519
Yes, we have last night
on the beach talking about it.

853
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:14,023
She wants to go. If she does that,
then you have all home.

854
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:17,610
We can not let that happen.
Thus it ruins everything. Even for itself.

855
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,445
I can not stop them.

856
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:23,004
The only you can and you should
not leave you much time.

857
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:30,220
I know you're doing anyway,
what you want, but we can talk?

858
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,209
Exactly, I have
made my decision,

859
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,129
and I do not,
that her mind yet what you can change.

860
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,106
For so what friends are for.

861
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:45,138
Vincent and you all had such a strong bond.
He deserves to know the truth.

862
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:49,698
I do not know.
I really love him very much, but I can ...

863
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:53,531
Well, I can not do that to him.
I do not want that.

864
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,065
That would not be fair.

865
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,318
In this week
but is totally much happened, right?

866
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,070
So many great things.

867
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,458
And we do not want to lose
and you still do not.

868
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,078
Maybe you commit
the biggest mistake of your life.

869
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,248
Since I have the matter
already committed.

870
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:16,002
And I find it hard enough,
having to live with the consequences.

871
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,309
There are usually
several solutions.

872
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,314
Sit down.
I'll make you some tea.

873
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:58,085
One may a decision,
which affects the rest of life,

874
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:01,506
not break above the knee.
For everything that we decide, the following applies:

875
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:05,092
This results in
perhaps unplanned developments.

876
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:08,930
Everything you've done
and everything you will do even,

877
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,098
based on these decisions.

878
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,769
Everything has to do with everything.
The right decision is important.

879
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,854
It's okay,
I have understood.

880
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,525
Take your time, you need to especially
choose wisely.

881
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,653
What do you think?
How will he react to the truth?

882
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:26,989
Hey, baby,
I'm pregnant, but not from you.

883
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:31,911
Is not bad, right? Come on, we're getting married.
How is it looking? I bring not.

884
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,413
It is a bond
received with you.

885
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,642
Did he not also a right to
to decide how it's going on?

886
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,585
Tomorrow.

887
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,587
If I disturb,
then tells me.

888
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,564
No, you do not disturb.

889
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:47,093
Pretty underpants.
- Thank you, I also find.

890
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:52,233
So, I'll be honest.
I was here all the time forward.

891
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,310
Already spying again?
- No, that was not really my plan.

892
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,438
I'm just awake, because I
had brutally piss. - Hey, hey!

893
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,066
ZVI!
- This means that again?

894
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,124
Too much information.
Again. - And further?

895
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,741
I've heard everything,
I believe.

896
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,535
Well, sit down.

897
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,704
Then you are now
also one of the girls.

898
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,091
We commit yourself
to silence.

899
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:22,879
Silence is okay, but I have to
not be a girl, right? - But.

900
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,214
This is a sisterhood.
Swear.

901
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,842
Then I am a brother
and a sister?

902
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,445
Promise easy
you's keep to yourself.

903
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:32,690
Well, I promise.

904
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,284
Okay, and now go pee.

905
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,128
Can I keep you company?

906
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:48,751
Sure, of course.

907
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,715
So, what brings you over here?

908
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,642
I come up here forever,
if I can.

909
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,420
The sea has something
incredibly magical about it.

910
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,478
If you share your feelings with him,
it can heal you.

911
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,570
I do not know,
what to feel.

912
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,652
I'm proud of you.

913
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,643
I'm just trying it,
doing the right thing.

914
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:21,604
You did not have to say,
that you were in the hallway.

915
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,991
So I thought
briefly about it, but ...

916
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,042
You remember me
of someone I once knew.

917
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,631
To whom?

918
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:36,546
My friend.
- Where is he?

919
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,261
He was a professional soldier, officer.

920
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:44,335
He's not out
Afghanistan repatriated.

921
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,687
I'm sorry.

922
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,893
He has worked for,
what he firmly believed.

923
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,487
I agree
a little in you.

924
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,057
You're a good guy, Charlie.

925
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,644
You did not deserve it,
Maggie treated you, not really.

926
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,623
It is strange,
because I wanted to.

927
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,876
But now it does me only suffering.

928
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:14,884
Well, I think,
I was probably not the right person for them.

929
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,077
Maybe you're the right person.

930
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,386
Just as you said,
not for them.

931
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:32,855
Want to have the, what you
thought the hot tub on the first night?

932
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,326
What?
That to me almost explode the eggs?

933
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,495
Sorry.

934
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,947
You're a great woman and you
not know how he will react.

935
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,867
Do not you think,
you should give him a chance.

936
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,844
The falls really hard for me.

937
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,552
Also because my parents
have never married.

938
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:14,187
So I was a love child. It's has
Love never existed when I was a little kid.

939
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:18,799
And I have my, since
I was five, never seen again.

940
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:22,278
So you can say,
I'm sensitive. - Wow.

941
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,639
I've had no idea.

942
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:29,027
I do not run so well with
a shield around at the stands on it's.

943
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:35,983
Who creates it, between the lines
read, reads it, then:

944
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:40,373
Gorgeous, intelligent dream woman
with a painful childhood.

945
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:46,327
Sacrifices for their interests to
unplanned children of others raise.

946
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:49,580
Hopes for the man of her dreams,
of her simply as traveling towards.

947
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,666
And when he does that
and everything is not perfect,

948
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:56,646
then she throws out everything
and get scared like a chicken during a thunderstorm.

949
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:07,692
Not bad. - Thank you. - Were a cool
Candidate for "Got to Dance". - Really?

950
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,935
What would you do then?

951
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,729
Never done Miss "I've got it
and also do not know if I want "?

952
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,787
Drag him to the altar
and myself believe it would be his?

953
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,462
Yes, quite possible.
Sounds like me.

954
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,950
Just as I know my Jenna,
showered your child with love,

955
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:29,620
which she herself has not experienced.
Together with a man,

956
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,457
she loves above all else
and with whom she wants to build a family.

957
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:36,669
Do you really not want you to him
at least should give a chance

958
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,754
also to make a decision?

959
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,562
Exactly would you
namely also expected.

960
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:49,974
Thank you for you today all
look let. We are "Nylon Pink".

961
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,485
Thank you!

962
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:56,915
I want to now the organizers
Lola and Maggie ask on our stage.

963
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,533
Hi guys.

964
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,512
Hey!
Hi together, all right?

965
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:15,040
Welcome to the
"Help the Robbe" -Benefizparty.

966
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,178

Of course we also thank Big Guy
and the whole crew for the party!

969
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,395
You are great!

970
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,606
Yes, let us also walk
our knights in shining armor,

971
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:44,246
the really very great people,
welcome: Dr. Spencer.

972
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,281
Hi, Doctor!

973
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,035
Thanks, guys, unfortunately, could
Stanley does not provide for the Party,

974
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:55,122
but he told me that here as a sign
his appreciation given.

975
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,508
Thank you from him!

976
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,796
All right, dear friends,
enjoying the evening and although with "Nylon Pink"!

977
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,273
Now it's celebrating!

978
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,484
Johnny,
where have you been, tell me?

979
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:26,362
I've been looking for you everywhere.
- You should only need to call back.

980
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,822
That's what I want, yes, but my
Smartphone has fallen into the toilet.

981
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,700
I've lost all my contacts.
I am fully screwed.

982
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,088
A nightmare, man.
I'm so glad to have found you here.

983
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:38,123
Charlie, that's Andy West.
Andy West, Charlie.

984
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,601
Hi, Charlie, Andy West Coast.
Glad man.

985
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,172
Okay.
Johnny, no shit, man.

986
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:48,425
I told you that you are a white
Shirt attract shalt. You know what? - Yes.

987
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:52,155
I have attached a photographer for you.
He has a few pictures of you shot.

988
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,808
Great photos.
I told you clearly made an audition.

989
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,102
Cool, thanks.
But how can I reach you now?

990
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,604
No, I will contact with you.
All right, kid?

991
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,774
And because you me
this great job have taught,

992
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:07,003
you can not refuse me,
to dance with you.

993
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:09,964
Sorry, Big Guy.

994
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,200
The Lady dances with me.

995
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,203
For each song,
all night.

996
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,340
Is not that right, Maureen?

997
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,849
Is that Maureen?

998
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:26,630
I would really also
love dancing with you, but

999
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,882
tonight I'm with Charlie here.

1000
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,690
And when saying this,
then it will probably be so.

1001
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,113
I ...

1002
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,268
...congratulations,
my little friend.

1003
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,745
Give me Five.

1004
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,148
See you.
Beautiful evening.

1005
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,442
All right, Johnny.
Now Enjoy this evening.

Hey people?
We have made us all right to worry.

But cool party.

1015
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:29,415
This is now the right time
for a small announcement.

1016
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,913
We are engaged.

1017
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,517
I'm looking really totally for you.

1018
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,874
So, we ...

1019
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,448
... Do not have
a lot to talk about.

1020
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,586
We can not all our
Lifetime discuss things.

1021
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,179
Do you find genuine,
which must be now?

1022
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,935
No? No.

1023
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:38,071
You're wasting too much time,
other people nervous with this thing.

1024
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:41,399
With falling since but something better.

1025
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,203
Without your stupid filming.

1026
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,422
Good or?

1027
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,086
Okay, okay.

1028
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,354
Can I?

1029
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,599
Can I?

1030
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:18,361
Come on, pull it out.
- At it.

1031
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,156
Do you need a ladder?

1032
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,077
My lipstick looks good on you.

1033
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,834
Toll how you laugh.

1034
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,448
Except that you
beautiful and pretty are,

1035
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:43,452

1036
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,455
Thank you.
- And caring and unselfish.

1037
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,040
This is hard to find.

1038
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,972
You mean to me really a lot.

1039
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,036
That is fine.

1040
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,043
How was it for you?

1041
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,824
That was perfect,
I would say. - Yes?

1042
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,243
Yes.
- Fancy a second round?

1043
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,220
Now?
Okay, in five minutes.

1044
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,720
I come back to it. - Okay.

1045
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:35,212
Did not you also feel
that we are being watched?

1046
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:38,691
So I do about me
no thoughts. Ignore the simple.

1047
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,906
<I> Seventh day </ i>

1048
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,245
Have you seen Vincent?

1049
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:57,859
Oh no.
Why what's going on?

1050
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:00,028
Nothing at all. I'm just...

1051
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,365
I'm just woke up and he was gone.
I do not know where he is.

1052
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:06,284
There is still no one lost.
The dive again soon.

1053
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,341
How's me this morning?

1054
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,511
So what of damned cool!

1055
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,585
Does anyone what to feed?
I die of hunger.

1056
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:19,645
Now I want biscuits or burgers,
Pizza, donuts, pancakes ...

1057
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,818
A sandwich would be okay.

1058
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,195
Oh, save me. Thank you.

1059
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:28,991

Good morning people.

1061

Do you know where Vincent is?

1062
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,398
Honestly, yes.
You might like to get out.

1063
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,125
Because what awaits you.

1064
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,832
Not too sparingly.

1065
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,426
Sorry, but now I am a man.

1066
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,984
<I> END </ i>

1067
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:44,376
Are you laughing because I rumgefurzt?

1068
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,869
Come at once
a stranger to me and

1069
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:58,373

To be a movie star or television star.

1070
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,385
So what experienced before?
- Sometimes it.

1071
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:05,481
Was that a guy or a woman?
- It was ... It was a guy.

1072
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,441
Has he looked like?

1073
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:12,439
So you're at a turning point.
I see immediately.

1074
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,736
Is that funny?

1075
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,667
Yeah, so like I said,
I'm at a turning point.

1076
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,746

Okay.

Many girls I made
television know are from Malibu.

1081
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,598
I can hardly wait.

1082
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,813

01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:56,199
No no. No, I do Photos
of birds and squirrels.

01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,741
No, not from the birds.
From birds. Yes.

1086
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,330
Mom, NE!

1087
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,494
Why did Dad say,
that I am fully behÃ¤mmert?

1088
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:12,781
He said, I am behÃ¤mmert,
because I'm out crawled out of you!

1089
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:16,451
I won a trip to Malibu
and am now times for a week away!

01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:26,680
Oh please,
I know I'm behÃ¤mmert.

1093
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,106
No, not you.

1094
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:33,356
But, you're behÃ¤mmert.
Damn it, I hate you.

1095
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:38,598
Hey, no! I had not the interim
Available, I would have a job, right?

1096
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:42,328

01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:45,438

01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:49,275
Mom, that would have really cool for
I should be and what are you doing?

1099
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:53,630
You've ruined everything, because you think,
that I would have messed up your life, man.

1100
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:56,992
However, I would!

1101
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,661
Anyway, I would
marry a whore.

1102
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,830
I would bring them here.

1103
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:05,500
And Grandma, I would imagine they also.
The still behÃ¤mmerter.

1104
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,933
I'm sorry,
I should not have said.

1105
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,090
Because of you I always say things,
I do not mean.

1106
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:15,478
I mean you have so,
but you understand it anyway wrong.

1107
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:20,974
You know what? I turn now easy

1108
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,360

But yet, I'll leave you.
Goodbye forever.

1111
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,946
Actually, I wanted
yes only a week away,

1112
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,991
but if I find something cooler,
then you've done it.

1113
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,826
Even if it is hell.

1114
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:42,714
Exactly!
I live in hell anyway, Mom!

1115
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,932
And with you!
