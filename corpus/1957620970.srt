Why don't you give them some

159
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,289
-Why do you let him eat that
fat, buttery, death food, mom?

160
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,757
-It's angel food.

161

162
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,961
-Oh, sweetheart, I've been
with your father long enough

163
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,062
to know that he's going to
do whatever he wants to do,

164
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,030
anyway.

165
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,999

Hey, I'll get back to you.

170

that for a few months now.

185
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,770
-Well, does it mean
anything that I'm

186
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,905
doing something that's
going to help mankind?

187
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,240
-Of course it does.

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,243
But that is no consolation
to a kid with a broken heart.

189
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,881
-Did you tell him
how sorry I am?

190
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,681
-That's you job, mister.

191
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,622
-Stupid jocks.

192
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,756
I hate them.

193
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,759
-You know, I bet we
wouldn't get picked on

194
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,530
so much if we band
together like the X-Men.

195
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,664
-Yeah.

196
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,866
That way we'd get
beat up as a group.

197
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,435
-no, I'm serious.

198
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,771
Ever notice how jocks like
Ronnie always travel in packs?

199
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,605
They're a team.

200
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,907
-We'll never beat those guys.

201
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:34,874
-Maybe we could.

202
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,377
If we started a
club or something.

203
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,378
Strength in numbers.

204
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,379
United we stand.

205
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,180
That sort of thing.

206
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,548
-What do we call it?

207
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,016
-Guys who like to get beat up.

208
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,719
-I was thinking more like,
The Action Adventurers.

209
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,657
-Ooh, A.A. That kind
of has a ring to it.

210
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,925
-Who would join?

211
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,759
-No one likes us.

212
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,761
-We'd be like the X-Men.

213
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,896
Everybody has something
they're good at.

214
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,766
Miles, you'd be
the science whiz.

215
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,634
I'd be the idea man.

216
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:07,173
And Lanny, well, Lanny's
got to be good at something.

217
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,909
-You know what, I
have a better idea.

218
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,946
Let's start a Wrestlemania club.

219
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,916
Right now the Undertaker's
having is way with Mr. Perfect.

220
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,784
Get up poor boy.

221
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,860
-Come here.

222
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,761
Here comes [inaudible].

223
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,829
Drops him like a bad apple.

224
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,268
-One, two--

225
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,636
MOM: What are you
kids doing up there?

226
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,804
-Uh, aerobics.

227
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,605
Ow.

228
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,406
MOM: OK, work those bodies.

229
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,113
-[inaudible]

230
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,248
-What's this?

231
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,151
[inaudible] under the ring.

232
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:51,951
-[inaudible]

233
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,358
-Oh, yeah, yeah!

234
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,900
-Happy birthday,
13-year-old son.

235
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,739
I'm sorry I'm late.

236
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,907
I'll make it up to you, though.

237
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,707
I promise.

238
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,978
-No big.

239
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:19,913
-DId you, uh--

240
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,713
-Yeah.

241
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,814
Sang it.

242
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,615
Ate it.

243
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,817
Opened it.

244
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,919
-You didn't open this one.

245
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,328
-What's this?

246
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,498
-It's a fish tank.

247
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,766
-Where are the fish?

248
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,336
-Well, you can use it as a
terrarium for other pets.

249
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,304
It's your call.

250
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,640
-Thanks.

251
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,079
-Say, how would you
and your friends

252
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,214
like to come to work
with me tomorrow?

253
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,518
You can play on a supercomputer,
and surf the net. huh?

254
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,619
How does that sound?

255
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,020
-Sorry, Mr. U. I can't.

256
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,456
Tomorrow's Saturday.

257
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,692
WWF Royal Rumble?

258
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,626
Don't miss it!

259
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,395
Yeah!

260
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,296
-Is he on steroids?

261
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,972
VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
Project desigates [inaudible]

262
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,939
report to research.

263
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,274
-Go, go, you've almost got it.

264
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,745
Dang, you lost.

265
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,546
-You having fun?

266
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,248
-Yeah, this is cool.

267
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,185
-You boys are
really good at this.

268
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,152
-Apple?

269
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,090
Crow wants you.

270
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,459
-I-- I gotta go.

271
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,728
-OK.

272
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,430
Dude, what does
your dad do here?

273
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,633
-He's a biochemical engineer.

274
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:54,340
He designs this robotic gizmo to
stimulate muscles or something

275
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,242
-These files read like a
top secret defense project.

276
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,043
I can't believe it.

277
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,580
Everything's classified.

278
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,619
What do you think APR means?

279
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,889
-Advanced project
research, maybe?

280
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,257
-Couldn't tell you.

281
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,726
-There's one way to find out.

282
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,161
-Do it.

283
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:15,962
-Enter.

284
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:19,866
-Classified.

285
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,347
-With all due respect, Mr.
Crow, I designed the augmenter

286
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,582
specifically for
civilian rehabilitation,

287
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,151
and the control
motion unit as well.

288
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,287
Heck, in the wrong hands,
something on that scale

289
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,456
could upset the whole balance
of global power as we know it.

290
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,326
-I will not even dignify
that with a response.

291
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,229
Why don't you just worry about
what you can actually do.

292
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:54,300
Like get the control motion unit
online before the next demo.

293
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,735
-It won't be ready, sir.

294
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,837
Not even for a hardened convict.

295
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,972
-You're absolutely right.

296
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,241
It would be much more
impressive to the investors

297
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,344
if the inventor himself
wore the augmenter.

298
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,681
-I'm trying to tell
you it's not safe.

299
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,749
-Right.

300
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,653
So make it safe, because
you're wearing it.

301
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,687
-What?

302
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,089
-Well, let me put it this way.

303
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,391
If you don't want your life's
work going up in smoke, if you

304
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,827
don't want to be taken
off this project for good,

305
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,662
you'll go to the mat
for this project.

306
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,463
Got it?

307
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,968
-Yes, sir.

308
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,069
-Good.

309
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,337
Hey, you know what we're
doing this weekend?

310
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,572
We're going to take
the corporate jet

311
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,640
and we're going to
go squirrel hunting .

312
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,375
You want to come, Hutley?

313
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,345
Huh?

314
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,849
A gun like this
almost shoots itself.

315
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,554
-What's the sport in that?

316
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,456
-It's the way I like it.

317
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,791
Would you go back to work?

318
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,159
My bird hates you cologne.

319
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,960
-Yes, sir.

320
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,761
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,709
-Looks like I found something.

322
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,084
An electrobiostatic
stimulation augmenter.

323
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,418
This is cool.

324
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,755
-This classified augmenter
thingy sounds dangerous.

325
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,825
Crow wants to test it on my dad.

326
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:26,759
-So?

327
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,828
-So, my dad has a
heart condition.

328
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,430
I mean, maybe they're
trying to get rid of him.

329
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,133
You know, make it
looks like an accident.

330
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,601
We've got to find out more.

331
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,602
-OK, let me try this.

332
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,406
I can't.

333
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,177
Not without Mr. Crow's
super user password.

334
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,978
-Drew?

335
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,779
We have to leave.

336
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,486
-You don't think Utley is
going to cause us any trouble,

337
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,287
do you?

338
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,354
-No.

339
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,323
No, he still thinks
we're going to use

340
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,659
the augmenter for
medical purposes.

341
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,527
The idea would
never occur to him

342
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,496
that we're going to sell
it on the open black market

343
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,565
to foreign regimes.

344
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,733
-Poor sap thinks he's going
to win the Nobel Prize.

345
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,935
-Well, he might.

346
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,735
Posthumously.

347
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,574
You know that if
this contract fails,

348
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,276
I lose my entire company.

349
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,311
I'm banking everything on this.

350
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,846
So this is your job.

351
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:26,385
I want you to keep those big,
beautiful eyes on tall boy.

352
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,687
And I want you to
keep him on schedule.

353
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,892
-Even if it kills him?

354
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,594
-Especially if it kills him.

355
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,199
The government sells to every
Saddam, Dick, and Harry.

356
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,000
Why can't I?

357
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,155
-Hi, Dad.

358
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,256
-Hi.

359
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,625
-I thought we were going
to go fishing today?

360
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,093
-I'm sorry, son.

361
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,497
I have to test something
for Mr. crow this weekend.

362
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,900
-No, no, no, let's go
go-kart racing instead.

363
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:56,642
-Drew, things will be totally
different after this weekend,

364
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,443
OK?

365
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,079
-But you always say that, Dad.

366
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,247
Why can't work wait?

367
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,782
Come on, please?

368
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,452
I mean, just a few days.

369
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,988
-I'll make it up to you, OK.

370
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,724
I promise.

371
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,860
Where's your mother?

372
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,728
-She's in the kitchen.

373
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,874
-Brad.

374
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,710
Oh, they're plastic.

375
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,812
They're beautiful,
you shouldn't have.

376
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:42,488
-Honey, I have to work all
weekend at the office again.

377
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,823
We're testing the augmenter.

378
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,428
-You know, you promised.

379
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,130
I mean, fist it was
his birthday, now this?

380
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,666
-I know, Honey, I
know, but I just

381
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,968
can't blow it now
that we're so close.

382
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,637
I mean, there's
too much at stake.

383
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,008
Mr. Crow could pull
me off the project

384
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,210
and I'd lose everything.

385
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,148
Besides, he already-- he
already thinks I'm a big wiener.

386
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,753
-Hey.

387
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,122
Buck up, pilgrim.

388
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,157
You know what they say?

389
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,559
A wiener it's just a
winner spelled wrong.

390
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,158
-Hello?

391
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,626
-Miles?

392
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,560
We're on.

393
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,097
-Ronnie.

394
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:58,998
Ronnie!

395
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,300
Ron, listen to me!

396
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,569
I'll get you the
money that I owe.

397
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,974
Ronnie, big guy, I'm paying you
50% for protection as it is.

398
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,676
OK, OK.

399
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,745
I said I'll get it, and I will.

400
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,579
Later.

401
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,780
-Hey, Johnny.

402
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,682
We're starting this club
and it's for these guys--

403
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,483
-For what?

404
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,784
Nerds of America?

405
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,453
-No, no.

406
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,222
We're embarking on a
clandestine, highly sensitive,

407
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,725
dangerous operation, and
we need your expertise.

408
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,726
-Gee, thanks.

409
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,262
But spying doesn't pay well.

410
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,164
And besides, I'm booked solid.

411
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,566
-OK, tell you what.

412
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,734
If you don't help us, I'm going
to tell Ronnie and those jock

413
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,837
friends of his that those
autographed Seattle Mariners

414
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:42,374
baseball cards you
sold him are fakes.

415
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,410
-Fakes?

416
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,444
-OK.
I'm going to kick your butt.

417
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,245
You're gone.

418
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,514
-Uh, you know what?

419
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,483
My schedule just opened up.

420
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,857
-Wow, cool garage.

421
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,326
-Yeah, it's my
dad's old home lab.

422
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,560
Never comes out here anymore.

423
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,370
-I'm in Radio Shack heaven.

424
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,406
Electronics, amps,
transmitters, receivers,

425
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,143
robotics, surveillance
equipment.

426
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,978
Could I borrow a few parts?

427
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,412
I'm going to come up
with a science project

428
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,415
to beat that Marty Spangler.

429
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,216
-Lofty goal.

430
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,755
-Oh!

431
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,556
Aw!

432
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,873
-What is this?

433
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:48,874
-Hey, hey hey.

434
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,675
I wouldn't--

435
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:55,814
-Oh!

436
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,817
-Touch that.

437
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,818
-I'll be down here.

438
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,487
-Oh, uh, stun gun.

439
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,690
He'll revive in a few minutes.

440
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,491
Come on.

441
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,503
CROW (VOICE): This is Crow,
and this better be important.

442
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,038
You've got 30 seconds.

443
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,239
So do make it short.

444
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,713
-I've recorded his
voice into the computer.

445
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,748
And I'm editing it.

446
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,084
CROW (VOICE): So
do make it short.

447
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:32,885
Make it short.

448
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,686
Do it.

449
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,020
[inaudible] This is Crow.

450
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,855
This is Crow.

451
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,322
Crow.

452
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,122
Crow.

453
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,023
Crow.

454
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,958
-Aw.

455
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,227
[inaudible] Do you
have any snacks?

456
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,131
COMPUTER VOICE: Crow.

457
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:46,932
Crow.

458
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,800
This is Crow.

459
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,770
-A radio [inaudible].

460
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,875
OK, I'm tapping
into core research.

461
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,311
Main menu.

462
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,145
I'm into the directory.

463
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,185
Changing Crow's number to here.

464
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:06,986
And I'm out.

465
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,295
-Twinkie lite.

466
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,730
-Call this number right here.

467
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,868
-[inaudible].

468
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:23,936
Carlson speaking.

469
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,505
- Yeah, that better
be you, Carlson.

470
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,508
I got Crow calling me about
a problem with the server.

471
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,609
-Server problem?

472
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,878
-Yes, now do you want
it fixed, or are you

473
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,747
just going to repeat
everything I say?

474
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,547
-Sorry.

475
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,548
-Darn right, you're sorry.

476
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,217
Now I'm going to
need you to type

477
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,486
in the super user password.

478
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,788
We're going to get this thing
straightened out pronto.

479
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,990
-Not unless Mr. Crow tells me.

480
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,325
-No kidding, genius.

481
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,827
I'm the one who
installed the system.

482
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,430
Now, you got the dad-gum
mouse in your hand?

483
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,868
Be a good little boy
and go to the directory.

484
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,536
Select Edward Crow.

485
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,744
CROW (VOICE): This is Crow.

486
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,446
-This is Carlson in systems.

487
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,784
Sir, we got a computer fix-it
guy who wants a password.

488
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,986
CROW (VOICE): You've
got 30 seconds.

489
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,321
-He says you called him.

490
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,323
Should I give him the go-ahead?

491
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,657
CROW (VOICE): Do it.

492
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,993
-Okey doke, just
wanted to clear it.

493
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,027
CROW (VOICE): Do it.

494
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:22,594
Do it.
Do it.

495
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,495
This is Crow.

496
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,596
Make it short.

497
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,765
[inaudible] Do it.

498
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,666
Crow.

499
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,101
-I beg your pardon, sir?

500
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,669
CROW (VOICE): Do it.

501
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,570
-All right-y, then.

502
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:43,515
-We did it, Miles.

503
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:44,316
-Way to go, Miles.

504
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,526
-Hey, what are you cool
cats scratching at in there?

505
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,961
-We're stealing
top-secret technology

506
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,664
from corporate databases, mom.

507
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,732
-OK, daddy-o.

508
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:00,532
Don't break anything.

509
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,673
-Well, you've got
your disrupter,

510
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,708
your neuralprocessor,
and you megabyte

511
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,378
deck, micro-surgical
CPBs, adrenal boosters,

512
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,546
and electrochemical amplifier.

513
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,048
If I didn't know
better, I'd swear

514
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,785
it's that electrobistatic
augmentation unit.

515
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,121
-The what?

516
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,422
-An augmenter.

517
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,757
An enhancer.

518
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,392
A booster for the
nervous system.

519
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,626
Pretty powerful.

520
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,161
Judging by this gauge here,
I'd say in 20 minutes,

521
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,163
you could fry your
whole nervous system.

522
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:34,533
-So what would it do to
someone with a heart condition?

523
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,435
-Kill them in five.

524
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,171
-Guys, my dad's in deep.

525
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,440
-It's bad news if your
dad straps this thing on.

526
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,511
-But they can't make
him wear it if we--

527
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,346
-Steal it?

528
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,147
-Are you insane?

529
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,715
We'll get so busted.

530
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,951
-I really need your help here.

531
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,787
Let's make it our
first official mission.

532
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,855
-Hello, security everywhere.

533
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,791
How can we possibly break in?

534
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,192
-No prob.

535
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,360
I got this cousin.

536
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,161
Sam.

537
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,566
-OK, I'm about to
charge us $1 a mile.

538
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,367
Pay up, everybody.

539
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,802
Come on, come on.

540
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,438
Cough it up, there
you go, good boy.

541
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,639
-You know, wouldn't
it be dope if we

542
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,240
made up a name
with our initials?

543
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,176
-That'd be cool.

544
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,144
-Well we've got a

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,683
That doesn't sound very rad.

548
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,753
-I like A.A. Personally,
but what about K.N.U.P.?

549
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,154
Silent K.

550
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,422
-Oh, you're going
to make my K silent?

551
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,757
I don't think so.

552
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,792
Let's make your N silent.

553
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,093
-K.N.U.P.?

554
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,995
-On that's strike fear into
the hearts of our enemies.

555
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,864
Watch out, guys, it's K.N.U.P.?

556
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:39,765
-Hey, hey, wait.

557
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,166
What about P.U.N.K.?

558
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,201
-Yeah, P.U.N.K.

559
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,068
-That sounds rad.

560
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,636
Like, you know, like cyberpunk.

561
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,939
-So P.U.N.K. it is.

562
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:47,773
-P.U.N.K.?

563
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,173
-Yeah.

564
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:48,707
-Cool.

565
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,274
-All right.

566
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,075
-Cool.

567
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,743
-P.U.N.K.

568
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,545
-Sam's as tough as they come.

569
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,714
Four older brothers,
all mechanics.

570
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,217
His dad's a repo man, Uncle Al.

571
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,854
-'Sup, cuz.

572
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:02,821
Nice ride.

573
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,802
SAM: '71 Camaro Rally Sport.

Pretty tricks.

578
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,981
So what's shaking?

579
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,048
-Oh, no, not this.

580
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,685
-Guys, meet my cousin
Samantha Swoboda.

581
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,723
Sam, the guys.

582
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,091
-These are them, huh?

583
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:39,892
-Yep.

584
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,337
-Who's the guy eating styrofoam?

585
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,006
-That would be Lanny.

586
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,208
-Um, it's a rice cake.

587
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,976
High in complex carbohydrates.

588
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,146
Um, less than a gram of
far and six grams of fiber.

589
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,948
I just thought yoou should know.

590
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:03,715
You weren't even close.

591
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,189
-And, uh, where'd
you get this one?

592
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,424
The weenie factory?

593
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,525
-Excuse me.

594
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,327
I have an I.Q. of 160.

595
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,161
-Oh, really?

596
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,062
Well I've got a calculator.

597
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,703
-No way.

598
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,138
She can not go with
us on the mission.

599
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:26,939
-Says who?

600
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,206
-She's a girl.

601
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,274
Drew, back me up on this.

602
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,610
-Well, technically
it's not in the bylaws.

603
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,579
-Technically there
are no bylaws.

604
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,514
-Who cares what she is?

605
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,616
I mean, Jonny says
that she can help us.

606
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,785
-Her name's Swoboda
for crying out loud.

607
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,587
What are we going to
be called, S.P.U.N.K.?

608
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,056
-That sounds like something
my grandmother drinks.

609
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,091
-OK, she's a trial
member on probation.

610
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,660
-She messes up once, she's out.

611
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,196
Hey digit head get
over it already.

612
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,431
I've got an errand to run.

613
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,199
You guys want see me in
action, you can come along.

614
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,376
-This is it.

615
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,711
My dad's been sick for awhile,
so I've been picking up

616
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,713
some of his repo
jobs on the sly.

617
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,048
I've tagged along so many these,
I can do them in my sleep.

618
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:10,983
-Isn't this stealing?

619
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,117
-Not if you don't
pay your bills.

620
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,353
See, you got your master
keys, your lock picks,

621
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,855
your right-handed screwdrivers,
your extractos, and of course,

622
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,557
the modified slim jim.

623
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,225
-Miles, she's better than
you on your computer.

624
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,233
-Uh, oh.

625
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,835
Hysterical mama
at three o'clock.

626
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,636
We're busted.

627
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,803
-Hey!

628
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,973
hey you little runny-nosed,
peach-fuzz-having,

629
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,376
beady-eyed little punks!

630
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,276
Get out of that car!

631
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,077
-No way!

632
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,479
We're not runny-nosed!

633
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,647
Does that look
runny-nosed to you?

634
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:42,447
Huh?

635
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,548
Huh?

636
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,917
-Oh, yeah, good comeback, Lanny.

637
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,718
-OK, OK!

638
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,753
That's it!

639
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:48,453
-Oh, she looks mad,
you guys, come on.

640
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,221
This isn't a good idea.

641
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,022
Let's go, let's go.

642
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,089
Come on, let's book!

645
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,929
-Guys, guys, I think

646
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,297
-Chill pill, dudes!

647
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,532
God!

648
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,467
It's just a matter of
breaking open the ignition.

649
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,803
WOMAN: I am so going to get you!

650
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,038

651
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:09,041
-Finding the wires, and

652
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,308
[inaudible].

653
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,110
WOMAN: [inaudible]

654
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,446
-We should hurry up, now, OK.

655
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,781
WOMAN: Bruno!

656
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:16,581
-Yeah.

657
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,549
-Uh.

658
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,350
-Oh.

659
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,921
BRUNO: Drive now!

660
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,223
-It's shortening together.

661
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,024
Duck!

662
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,000
BRUNO: Come back with my car!

-Nice driving, cuz.

669
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,511
-It was so rad!

670
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,380
It was like that Hummer
Ferrari chasing The Rock!

671
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,352
-Bruno's BMW!

672
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,856
Very nice, Sam.

673
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,658
Hey, where's your dad?

674
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,659
-Home sick.

00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,400
-Hey, have a nice day, huh?

678
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,568
-Better cout that again.

679
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,436
-Yeah, I think he
counted one bill twice.

680
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,174
-40?

681
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,008
My dad will be impressed.

682
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,545
-My mistake.

683
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,782
-Yeah, right.

684
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,685
-So cuz, about this job,
how much does it pay?

685
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:27,486
-Millions.

686
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:57,816
-Lanny!

687
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,302
-First things first.

688
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,603
We need to swear in new members.

689
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,808
-What about--

690
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,744
-The g-i-r-l?

691
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:26,978
-Forget it, Miles.

692
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,780
This is a tough mission.

693
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,249
We need her skills just as
much as we need yours, OK?

694
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,050
-Oh, you'll live.

695
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,125
-Lanny made these
special gloves.

696
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,059
-You sew?

697
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,460
-Among going things.

698
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,795
-All right, everybody.

699
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,031
Put on your gloves.

700
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,199
Let's take the oath.

701
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,707
Being tired of seeing the
strong pick on the weak.

702
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,276
We, the P.U.N.K.S.,
are hereby united

703
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,346
for one solemn, secret purpose.

704
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:08,854
To protect the underdog with
nerve, knowledge, and strength.

705
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:12,057
-To defend the inalienable
rights of the Constitution.

706
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,860
-With liberty and
justice for all.

707
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,663
-On earth as it is in heaven?

708
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:23,435
-To boldly go where no man has--

709
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,004
-Where no one has gone before.

710
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,206
-OK.

711
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,274
Guess that's it.

712
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,075
Uh, Amen.

713
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,847
-P.U.N.K.S.

714
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,749
-All right, so I take
out the security cameras?

715
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,050
-No, Jonny and I will do that.

716
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,485
-So I take out
the alarms, right?

717
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,553
-No, Miles does that.

718
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,387
Then break into the lab?

719
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,488
-No, Sam does that.

720
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,723
-So what do I do?

721
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,523
-Anti-security.

722
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,558
-What's that?

723
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,359

Why?

And no auxiliary to either.

782
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:08,733

785

I enter it in the science fair?

786
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,488
-Let's get it first, Miles, OK.

787
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,091
-Can't you just see the
look on Spangler's face

788
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,392
when I unveil it.

789
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,694
-You are such a nerd.

790
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,664
-This is so sad.

791
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,366
It's no wonder you're
out like a sack of spuds.

792
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,001
I mean, look at this.

793
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:43,802
Where's your fiber?

794
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,570
Where's your protein?

795
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,072
My god.

796
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:47,872
What is this?

797
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,677
You can't even salvage this.

798
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,381
And peanut butter.

799
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,982

-Come on.

804
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,211
-I thought you were supposed
to be a pro at this?

805
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,645
-It's a separate code.

806
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,746
You try, nimrod.

807
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,748
-Give me the card.

808
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:35,754

815
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:48,927
-Yeah, good, good.

816
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,112

00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,125
This isn't about being
cool or making money.

910
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,627
It's about saving my dad.

911
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,427
And if you guys--

912
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,142
-Hey, dangerous.

913
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,710
CROW (VOICE): Mr. Flutey?

914
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,112
-Hey, it's Crow.

915
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,514
CROW (VOICE): Unfortunately, Mr.
Flutey, they took the augmenter

916
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,984
and they erased most of the
files, but hey, I always say,

917
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,086
thank god for back
ups, you know?

918
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:49,921
-Back ups?

919
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,756
-Shh.

920
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,024
-No.

921
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,826
Your buyers are
covered because we

922
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,563
have the prototype
augmenter, that's why.

923
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,831
Well, it runs a little hotter,
it reds a little higher,

924
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,402
but it will do just fine
for the demonstration.

925
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,636
Yes.

926
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,738
We're still in business.

927
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,774
Yeah, I'm right here.

928
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:11,809
You know what, I can't
wait to show you the CMU.

929
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,411
The controlled motion unit.

930
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:16,013
CROW (VOICE): Well, it's
an add-on to the augmenter.

931
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,416
-It allows you to control
who's ever in the suit.

932
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,451
Oh, it's wild, you're
going to love it.

933
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:25,389
Well, of course I'm confident,
because the police have prints.

934
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:30,962
I promise you Mr. Flutey, that
in 90-- make that 48 hours,

935
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:33,097
we will have the thieves.

936
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,099
Goodbye Mr. Flutey.

937
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,934
-Hey, at least none of
us have police records,

938
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,705
so none of our prints
come up on file.

939
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,040
-Well, uh, that's
not entirely true.

940
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,510
-Oh, don't tell me,
you guys have records?

941
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,745
-You know what?

942
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,448
This whole operation is just
really starting to suck.

943
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,350
Beaucoup.

944
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,417
Excuse my French.

945
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,518
-He's right.

946
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,620
If we go to the feds
with nothing on Crow,

947
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,956
we'll all go to jail
for grand theft.

948
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,926
-I was just talking about we're
all out of granola rice cakes.

949
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,962
-I say we give up Samantha
and Jonny like ugly stepkids.

950
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,399
It's their stinking prints
mucking up the works.

951
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:09,900
Oh.

952
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,901
-Yeah, right.

953
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,371
We are not going
down our accomplices.

954
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,372
We'll name names.

955
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,707
-I told you she was trouble.

956
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,775
She's evil.

957
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,576
-No.

958
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:19,844
No, we stick together.

959
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,545
United we stand.

960
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,114
To protect the underdog.

961
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:26,017
-Not if the dog
leaves fingerprints.

962
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,385
-We hit Crow where he lives.

963
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,687
We tell him if he doesn't turn
over the prototype augmenter

964
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,822
backpack, we'll go public
with the one that we have.

965
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,167
-Mr. Crow?

966
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,735
It's gonna go down like this.

967
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,971
We're gonna meet
in a public place.

968
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,772
Golf course.

969
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,106
Seventh and Main.

970
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,108
I'll be dressed as an Egyptian.

971
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,077
Be there at 4 PM sharp.

972
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,780
And bring the prototype,
or the deal is off.

973
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,248
Got it?

974
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,182
Have a nice day.

975
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:05,756
-All right, hubcaps.

976
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,191
Be back in an hour.

977
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,359
Stay out of trouble.

978
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,160
-Always, Mom.

979
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:20,571
[music playing]

980
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,530
-Hey, Drew, Miles, Lanny.

981
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,331
Nice.

982
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,372
-Some disguises these are.

983
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,507
[radio whistling]

984
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:00,044
-Hole 9, please don't
climb on those sphinx.

985
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:00,845
Thank you.

986
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,953
So, uh, what's with the outfits?

987
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,388
-What's with yours?

988
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,689
-I'm working.

989
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,724
-So are we.

990
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,761
Five putters, five balls.

991
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:17,828
Straight up.

992
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,531
-OK.

993
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:21,899
-Good, King Putt.

994
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,070
-So, uh, you seen any
suspicious characters around?

995
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,937
-Besides you?

996
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,106
No.

997
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,375
-That's what happens when
you don't stay in school.

998
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,176
-I heard that.

999
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:35,579
Ugh.

1000
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,380
[radio whistling]

1001
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,649
-Hole 9, I mean it!

1002
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,917
Don't make me ban
you from the course.

1003
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:44,722
-Nice outfit.

1004
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,291
You've got some nerve.

1005
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,194
-Well you, you get used
to it, you know? [groans]

1006
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:52,463
-Where's the backpack?

1007
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,166
-You have a claim check?

1008
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,400
Oh, gee.

1009
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,671
[man gasping]

1010
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,008
-I don't-- ugh!

1011
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,442
-Uh-oh.

1012
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,778
Crow's goons are about
to embalm King Putt.

1013
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,579
Let's go, guys.

1014
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,415
Plan A.

[grunting]

1016
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,319
-Hey, you want
some of that, huh?

1017
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,387
-You guys want some free tokens?

1018
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:17,421
Or something?

1019
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,489
-Start talking or
you'll be swallowing

1020
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,591
the whole River Nile.

1021
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,327
DREW (ON PA SYSTEM):
Hey, over here.

1022
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,762
-Leave the king alone.

1023
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,497
DREW (ON PA SYSTEM):
You want the unit?

1024
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,033
-Come and get it.

-Come on!

1028
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:41,846
-Run, guys.

1029
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,386
-Let's get him.

1030
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,187
-Got him.

1031
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,863
-Ah!

1032
00:49:58,863 --> 00:49:59,797
-Oh!

1033
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:00,764
Whoa!

1034
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:01,565
-Ugh.

1035
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,637
Gah!

1036
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:07,571
-Damn.

1037
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,473
-Get back here,
you little twerps!

00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,413
-Yeah!

00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,415
-Whoa!

1041
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,417
-Look at them roll!

1042
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,887
[laughter]

1043
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:23,888
-All right, guys.

1044
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:24,388
Let's go.

1045
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,189
Come on.

1046
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,858

[ball falling in hole]

-Come on!

1049
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,828
Into the crypts.

1050
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:31,629
Let's go.

1051
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:32,429
Let's go.

1052
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,330
-Can I borrow these?

1053
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,832
Thank you so much!

1054
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:35,799
-Here, give me one.

1055
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,774
-Fore!

1056
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,243
-Ah!

1057
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,312
-Hey, nice slice.

1058
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:50,381
-Yeah, well it drifted
a little to the left,

1059
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,815
but I'm happy with it.

1060
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,117
-Golf clap?

1061
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,585

-Oh.

1064
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,503
They didn't bring the Augmentor!

[heavy breathing]

1066
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:19,343
-Come on.
Let's go.

1067
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:20,544
Let's go.
Move!

1068
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,012
-Let's go this way.

1069
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,614
Let's go the other way.

1070
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:24,415
Uh.

1071
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,215
-Uh.

00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,054
-Jump!

00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:30,854

Yeah!

1078
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:40,698
All right!

1079
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,766

1081
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,970
Miles, come on.

1082
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,937
Help us out.

1083

-Come on.

1088
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,160
Crow's still got the prototype.

1089
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,563
-Which means he's
still going to test it.

1090
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:13,831
-Hurry, Mom.

1091
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:14,965
Step on it.

1092
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,601
These goons are going
to hop us because we're

1093
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,936
about to blow up in
the whole operation.

1094
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:19,403
Go!

1095
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:19,870
Hurry!

1096
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,671
-Great.

1097
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,006
OK, 007s, I'm going.

1098
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,353
I think you kids can sit up now.

1099
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,454
The coast is clear.

1100
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,595
Oops!
There's one!

1101
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:45,095
-Huh!

1102
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:45,796
[giggling]

1103
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,231
-Just kidding.

1104
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,032
-Oh.

1105
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:48,799
-What?

1106
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:49,600
-Mom!

1107
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,701
-What?

1108
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:53,704
I think you kids should
cut back on the TV.

1109
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:57,975
[projector clicking]

1110
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:58,942
-Oh, great.

1111
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,644
We're back to
Pasiotopolis again.

1112
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,578
Go through it again.

1113
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,079
Come on.

1114
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,213
Right now.

1115
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,015
Are you telling me that
you don't recognize one

1116
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,316
of these kids from
the golf course?

1117
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,451
Not one?

1118
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:08,619
-They were wearing sunglasses.
What can I say.

1119
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,054
-(HIGH VOICE) They were
wearing sunglasses!

1120
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,523
All right.

1121
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,624
What about the security card?

1122
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,993
-Sir, they crashed the
entire system files.

1123
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,628
We're doing everything we
can around the clock to

1124
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:18,662
rectify the situation.

1125
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,798
-It is somebody close to us.

1126
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:21,999
We're going to hear
from them again.

1127
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,934
I can feel it.

1128
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:24,735
-Are you with me?

1129
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:25,436
-Yes.

1130
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:26,236
CROW: Are you with me?

1131
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,306
-I'm with you, sir.

1132
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,008
-You stay on top of your game.

1133
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:31,809
-Yes, sir.

1134
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:34,478
-You find them.

1135
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:37,214
-Crow won't come to
us, we'll go to him.

1136
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,116
-We'll set up a
surprise meeting.

1137
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:40,484
Get him alone.

1138
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,820
-So how do we do that?

1139
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,023
-My dad says Crow hangs out
at Kramer's Bar after work.

1140
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:49,026
[music playing]

1141

[cases dropping]

1142
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,957
-We're the band.

1143
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:21,725
-What'll it be, gentlemen?

1144
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,595
-Chocolate milk,
uh, on the rocks.

1145
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,629
-Ha.

1146
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,364
Well, this is all
we have right here.

1147
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:31,235
-We'll have three 57 T-birds
on the little plates.

1148
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:32,035
-Right.

1149
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:51,522
-So when's your
birthday, big boy?

1150
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:56,827
-Uh, September 5, 19--

1151
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,829
LADY: You're a Virgo.

1152
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,933
Virgos are very creative people.

1153
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,135
They have these
really powerful auras.

1154
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:11,041
You have a very powerful aura.

1155
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,743
-Thanks.

1156
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:13,911
I have been working out.

1157
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,723
[coughing]

1158
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:27,791
-Excuse me will you?

1159
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,693
I-- I have to speak to someone.

1160
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,169
-You like baseball cards?

1161
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,205
-Yeah, sure.

1162
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:42,906
-Check these out.

1163
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,642
You're going to flip.

1164
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,879
-Edward Crow, you
have something I want.

1165
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:54,718
-You little punk!

1166
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,720
-I wouldn't.

1167
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,988
It's a very public place.

1168
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:06,930
-August 2, '84.

1169
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,333
-In return for the
Augmentor prototype,

1170
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,203
I will not release the countless
required conversations,

1171
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,206
photographs, the memos,
et cetera, et cetera,

1172
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:21,078
and I will not expose you for
the criminal rat that you are.

1173
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:24,414
Fail to cooperate,
we'll take you down.

1174
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,117
It's that simple.

1175
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,986
-Are you finished?

1176
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,787
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with here

1177
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,590
because I would squash
you like a little bug.

1178
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,195
I will squeeze your guts
out until they become juice.

1179
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:39,496
-$50 huh?

1180
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:40,497
-Yep.

1181
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:44,234
It's a '79 autographed
Lyman Bostock.

1182
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,168
Very rare.

1183
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:45,969
-Yeah.

1184
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,404
Rare.

1185
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:51,575
Except Lyman Bostock
died in 1978.

1186
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,678
This little hustler is trying
to con me in my own bar.

1187
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,179
Boys.

1188
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,547
-Uh, you know what?

1189
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,083
If you're a little light on the
cash today, I could always--

1190
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,385
-Uh-huh.

1191
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,654
-Come on, you.

1192
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:07,591
[electrical hum]

1193
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,026
-(WARBLING VOICE) Yeah!

1194
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:12,329
And you!

1195
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:15,032
[inaudible] It's
a battle royale.

1196
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,033
-Ugh!

1197
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,434
-(WARBLING VOICE)
Last man standing

1198
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,902
kisses the trophy girl!

1199
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,572
You Scottish Nozzola,
how does that feel?

1200
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,208
I'm such an animal but
with a sensitive side.

1201
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,045
You realize this is
going to hurt, right?

1202
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:28,845
Good!

1203
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,347
[thunk]

1204
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,815
-(WARBLING VOICE)
Oh, that had to hurt.

1205
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:32,783
Ugh!

1206
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,283
Stay there!

1207
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:33,784
-Hey, kid.

1208
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:34,818
Come here!

1209
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,220
-(WARBLING VOICE)
Woo-hoo. [grunting]

1210
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,689
-Jeez.

[grunting]

1212
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,627
-(WARBLING VOICE)
How's that feel?

1213
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,796
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1214
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:46,897
How's that feel?

1215
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:47,698
Ah.

1216
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:50,567
Who's next?

1217
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,903
Listen up, cheese butt.

1218
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,705
Hey, listen to me.

1219
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,707
Failure to comply
with our demand

1220
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:59,509
will result in the
all time greatest,

1221
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:03,146
King Kong monster
wedgie of the century.

1222
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,649
And it feels a little like this.

1224
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:08,618

-Oh yeah.

1226
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,088
-(WARBLING VOICE) Good.

1227
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,823
Get out of here.

1228
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,664
Mwah!

1229
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,665

video system.

My dad's a surgeon.

00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,750
-This is a trans off
of a '73 hardtail.

1234
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,486
It turns rotational energy or
torque into electrical energy.

1235
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:49,025
-This, my friends,
is a leaf blower.

1236
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,994
It blows leaves.

be out for blood.

1239
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,403
So we better make
ours better than his.

1240
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:02,472
Miles, Samantha, do your stuff.

1241
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,273
-Done.

1242
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,508
-Sh!

1243
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,109
Crow's on the phone
with that Flutie dude.

CROW (ON RADIO): This is
nothing we can't handle.

1246

Well, we already have IDs on
two of these petty criminals.

1247
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,151
Believe me, that
will be my pleasure.

1248
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,452
-I will take care of
them in such a way

1249
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:17,354
their mothers won't
recognize them.

1250

just show up at the--

-Shareholder's meeting, OK?

1252
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,292
I will make it worth you while.

1253

CROW (ON RADIO): Bye-bye.

1254
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:25,796
-We better crash at your guys'
places for a while in case

1255
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,097
they come after us.

1256

-Oh sure.

00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,132
Hi, Mom, Dad.

00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,101
This 14-year-old girl is
just sleeping over tonight.

1259
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,235
Don't mind me.

1260
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,205
I'll be upstairs, in my
room, entering puberty!

1261
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,440
Are you nuts?

1262
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,741
-You guys can crash
in my basement.

1263
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,543
Just don't steal anything.

1264
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:40,911
-We won't.

1265
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,779
-So what's with this big
shareholder's meeting?

1266
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,847
-I don't know.

1267
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:46,116
But my dad's been
working on a remote

for the Augmentor,

1269
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,589
In fact, this is the prototype.

put yourself on the line,

1271

don't you?

Do you know that?

1274
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,831
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

1275
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,833
I'll wear the Augmentor.

1276
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,367
Does that make you happy?

1277
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,870
Because I don't want to
leave one scintilla of doubt

1278
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,438
about this thing's safety.

Is the remote

1282
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,014
-Well, technically, yes.

1283
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,750
I've been working out the
bugs on the prototype at home.

-You see?

1285

I've got the
prototype suit online.

1293

-What does that mean?

1294
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,882
-It means I booted up
the controlled motion

down at Crow Research.

1298
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,888
Someone could be testing
even as we speak now.

-Wait!

1300
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,290
What if they're
testing it on my dad?

great day for Crow Electronics.

What you are about
to witness is a first

1304
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,439
in the history of technology,
the coupling of two fields,

1305
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,475
both in their infancies.

1306
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:22,612
On the one hand you have
electro-biostatic stimulation.

1307
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,316
On the other, controlled
motion robotics.

1308

the first time ever!

Hello?

-Son, what, what, what are
you doing calling me at work?

1316
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,095
-Are you all right?

1317
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:39,896
-I'm fine.

1318
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,665
OK?

1319
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:42,899
I'll get back to you.

Um, bye.

1321
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,005
-All right, boys,
we've got a picture.

1322
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,942
And guess who's
on the Augmentor.

Now the computer is going
to interpret her motion.

And it will send

An easy way to say it--
when she moves, I move.

01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:45,261
-We could get nailed
on the way over there.

1449
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,330
-Then I'll wear the Augmentor,
and I'll go to Houlihan's.

1450
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,131
-Yeah.

1451
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,832
I'm sure you will, Drew.

1452
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:53,169
I say we cut our losses,
disappear for a while.

1453
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,671
Every man for himself.

1454
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:56,739
-Maybe we'll all be
better off on our own.

1455
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,740
-You know what, Drew?

1456
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,574
They're right.

1457
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,209
Let's just lay low for a while.

1458
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,177
-Totally agree.

1459
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,013
You know I'm on
probation right now.

1460
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:07,483
[interposing voices]

1461
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,156
-Wait!

1462
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,657
This isn't just about you.

1463
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,093
It's about all of us.

1464
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,095
I mean, don't you guys get it?

1465
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,297
Crow is the bully
now instead of Ronny.

1466
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,832
And the bullies keep
on winning because we

1467
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,703
all bolt instead of
sticking together.

1468
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,740
I mean, we've come this far
together taking chances.

1469
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:36,512
And now when my dad needs us
the most, how can you all bail?

1470
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,148
What happened to the P.U.N.K.S.?

1471
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,117
United we stand.

1472
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,720
-Nice speech, Utley.

1473
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,921
I'm gone.

1474
01:08:44,921 --> 01:08:46,723
-I just thought we
were all friends here.

1475
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,127
-My friends?

1476
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,896
-Yeah, Jonny, why?

1477
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:55,732
-Nothing.

1478
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:59,435
I just never really had
any real friends before.

1479
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,709
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1480
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,346
-He's right, Drew.

1481
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,981
We're in over our heads.

1482
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,249
We're just kids.

1483
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,751
Let your dad handle it.

1484
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:15,918
Make him turn in Crow.

1485
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,029
-Drew, I'm sorry.

1486
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,298
I just-- I can't.

1487
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,767
You gotta understand.

1488
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,701
I just-- I can't.

1489
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:32,669
See ya.

1490
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,280
-I'm too young to die, Drew.

1491
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,683
-Go then.

1492
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:47,950
Get out of here!

1493
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,762
[beeping]

1494

[phone ringing]

1495
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,206
-I'm not here.

1496
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,944
Just picking up
something for the office.

1497
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,780
-Utley residence.

1498
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,881
It's your boss.

1499
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,085
He wants you back at
the office immediately.

1500
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:25,388
[grunts]

1501
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,990
-Pat, if the horse
is dead, get off.

[door opening]

1503
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,340
-Hey, Drewster?

1504
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,141
Drewster?

1505
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,482
Son, there's something very
big that I have to do today.

1506
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:53,816
And I need your support.

1507
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,051
Dad, don't go.

1508
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,352
-I have to.

1509
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,820
If I don't do it
now, I might not

1510
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,222
have the courage to do it all.

1511
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:04,927
I need to take this.

1512
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:05,862
-Dad.

1513
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,164
Dad, please don't go.

1514
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:09,065
Dad.

1515
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:10,299
Dad, don't go!

1516
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,234
Dad, please!

1517
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,068
-Drew, please.

1518
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,503
Now don't make this any harder.

1519
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:20,443
Are you all right?

1520
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,244
-Dad.

1521
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,150
I have to get back
to you on that.

1522
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:00,016
[tape rewinding]

1523
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,984
CROW (ON TAPE): Oh, and then
there's one other thing.

1524
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,086
There's an FBI agent.

1525
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,988
Houlihan.

1526
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,925
Houlihan is Crow
enemy number one.

1527
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:35,418
The address, 1140 Peach Street.

1528
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:37,053
-Hi, I'm Special Agent Houlihan.

1529
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,621
You must be Drew.

1530
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:41,257
Are you alone?

1531
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:43,759
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

1532
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:44,594
-I'm glad you called.

1533
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:47,697
You're doing the right thing.

1534
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,698
Come in.

1535
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,305
Make yourself comfortable.

1536
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,106
Thirsty?

1537
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,474
Can I get you anything?

1538
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,342
Lemonade?

1539
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:00,176
Soda?

1540
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:00,977
-No thanks.

1541
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:04,180
I'm fine.

1542
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,815
-Well, I'm glad you came.

1543
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,516
Tell me what's going on.

1544
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,085
-My dad's in trouble.

1545
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,620
He works for this
guy named Crow.

1546
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,021
-I know.

1547
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:14,924
The FBI has been investigating
Edward Crow for some time now.

1548
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:18,594
Your testimony is just what
we need to solidify the case.

1549
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,663
You were right to
come in when you did.

1550
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:21,464
-I was?

1551
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:22,265
-Absolutely.

1552
01:13:26,469 --> 01:13:30,006
Have you ever been deputized?

1553
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,507
-Deputized?

1554
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,643
-We're allowed to
deputize civilians

1555
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,145
under special circumstances.

1556
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,613
Here.

01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:41,951
This badge represents
your official appointment.

1558
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,420
Hmm.

1559
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,923
Hmm.

1560
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:51,827
Now, where is that
little Augmentor?

1561
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,596
SAMANTHA (ON EARPIECE):
Hey lover boy,

1562
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,498
pay attention to
what you're doing.

1563
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:57,099
-Is this what I think it is?

1564
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,601
-United we stand, right?

1565
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,635
-You betcha.

1566
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,405
You're a full-blown deputy now.

1567
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:03,739
-Gee, thanks.

1568
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,241
-You're welcome.
-I hate to say it, Romeo.

1569
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:06,042
But I smell a rat.

1570
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:06,742
-What?

1571
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:07,510
-I said you're welcome.

1572
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,477
-Get her out of the room?

1573
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:09,512
-How?

1574
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:10,546
-How, what?

1575
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:14,116
-How did I get so thirsty?

1576
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,852
Maybe I will have
that lemonade, please.

1577
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,390
-Drew, it's Miles.

1578
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,560
Put your glasses on so
we can get a visual.

1579
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,035
DREW (ON MICROPHONE): She
sure drinks a lot of coffee.

1580
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,409
-You smoke?

1581
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,311
HOULIHAN: No, I don't Why?

1582
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,579
-Tell her you smoke.

1583
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,748
-Just wanted to bum
a cigarette is all.

1584
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:46,816
HOULIHAN: Smoking's bad for you.

1585
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,885
You know that?

1586
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,287
-Yeah.

1587
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,189
What can I say.

1588
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:55,391
I'm trying to quit.

1589
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:59,028
Hey, uh, can I
use your bathroom?

1590
01:14:59,028 --> 01:14:59,829
-Upstairs.

1591
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,131
The second door to the left.

1592
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:02,932
-Thanks.

1593
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:11,173
-Come on.

1594
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,408
Man.

1595
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:13,209
I gotta eat.

1596
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,321
-Drew to master control.

1597
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,589
Samantha, Miles--

1598
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:28,357
DREW (ON MICROPHONE): I'm
glad I have you guys back.

1599
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,392
-We're all back.

1600
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:31,260
We decided you're
hopeless without us.

1601
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,361
-Gee, thanks.

1602
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,764
Listen, I think we've
got a problem here.

1603
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:35,931
I'm thinking this is a trap.

1604
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,266
SAMANTHA (ON
EARPIECE): Affirmative.

1605
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,603
-We tried to radio contact
Crow but the signal was dead.

1606
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:41,570
He must have found the bug.

1607
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,571
Abort the mission.

1608
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,372
Get out of there.

1609
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,742
-Way ahead of you.

1610
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:48,944
-Going somewhere?

-Ah!

1615
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,557
-He's getting away.

1616
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,324
Get him!

1617
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,526
What are you waiting for?

1618
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:04,326
Move it!

1619
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:04,960
Move it!

1620
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,761
-That's all right.

1621
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,564
He's not going to lose us.

1622
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,966
Let's do it.

-Yo, base.

1625
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,011
This is Drew.

1626
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:23,446
I've got a situation here.

They're creeping up on me like
a pair of ladies underwear.

1628
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,785
Any ideas?

1629
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,187
-Go faster.

1630
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:33,022
-I can't lose them.

1631
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:34,423
They're going to run me down.

1632
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,025
Augment!

[zapping and yelling]

1634
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,228
-Go right.

1635
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:39,728
Go right.

1636
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:40,429
Go right.

1637
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:45,734

-Is this map right?

1641
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:50,539
According to this
tracker, he just

1642
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:55,744
got on the freeway
doing 60 miles an hour?

-Don't worry, Drew.

1650
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,200
I got you covered.

1651
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,101
Take the next exit.

1652
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:22,004
I gotta plan.

1655
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,043
-Looks like the U-district.

1656
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:29,144
-Oh yeah.

1657
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,412
That's the ice cream
shop right off Pioneer.

1658
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,681
I'd know that in my sleep.

-Drew, it's Lanny.

1671
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,341
In this movie on Mars
with Arnold, you know,

1672
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,776
his eyes were like
popping out of his head.

1673
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:01,977
They put a homing
device in his head

1674
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,679
so that he could track him.

1675
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,581
Did anyone, like, you know--

1676
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:06,482
DREW (ON MICROPHONE): What?

1677
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:07,983
Put anything up my nose?

1678
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,218
No!

1679
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,886
Jonny, when does this great
plan of yours kick in?

1680
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,555
-Right now.

1681
01:18:12,555 --> 01:18:13,355
Remember Bruno?

1682
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,924
He got his BMW back.

Deputize me, huh?

1686
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:30,306
Chase this.

1687
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,443
Ugh.

-Stop right there.

1695
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,451
Not one more step.

1696
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,152
You were supposed to
mow the lawn today.

1697
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:17,953
Dad's orders.

1698
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,021
-I will later, Mom.

1699
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:19,855
-No, not later.

1700
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,123
Now.

1701
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,559
And when you finish mowing
the lawn, blow the leaves.

1702
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,494
And you gotta rake the
grass and put it in a pile.

1703
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:26,895
-Come on, Mom.

1704
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:28,597
-Come on, just pretend you're
on one of your little missions,

1705
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:29,932
you know?

1706
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:33,068
And that like you're this
big international spy, right?

1707
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,605
And it's like all cloak and
dagger and the danger's on.

1708
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:40,142
And your cover will be,
let's see, I got it!

A kid doing chores.

1710

-I'm in the middle of
a delicate mission.

1711
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:44,980
-There you go!

1712
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,848
That's the spirit!

1713
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:50,152
-Unbelievable.

1714
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,086
-Just do it.

See, that wasn't so bad.

1720
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,353
-Mr. Crow.

1721
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,688
-We've been waiting for you.

1722
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:32,795
-Sir, I've been agonizing
over this for weeks.

1723
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:37,866
And I've come to the conclusion
that I can no longer condone

1724
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:41,704
or be a part of what
this project has become.

1725
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:46,308
My family and my peace
of mind must come first.

1726
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,309
Therefore, I am resigning.

1727
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,581
-Are you sure?

1728
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:53,382
-Yes.

1729
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:01,423
-Nothing can change your mind.

-No.

1731
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,160
-All right then.

1732
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,829
-What are you doing?

1733
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:07,896
-Make a fist.

1734
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:08,697
-Arg!

1735
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,170
-Enjoy your peace of mind.

1736
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,342

-Hello, Drew.

Guess what?

1743
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:54,743
You've got exactly one
hour to get that Augmentor

1744
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,813
and the files back here to
the lab or your little friends

1745
01:21:57,813 --> 01:21:59,948
get it.

-A good general knows that
giving a directive is one

1754

thing, having it carried
out is quite another.

1755
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,576
With our Augmentor,
not only will a soldier

1756
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:30,412
have super human
strength but a general

1757
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,981
can virtually send him
into the teeth of battle

1758
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,151
with 100% percent certainty
that that directive

1759
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,153
will be carried out.

1760
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:42,591

that our demonstration is going

to be carried out one of our
creators, one of our designers.

I know that you
will be impressed.

Not yet.

you were today.

building, weren't you?

your father had nothing

is help people who were weak.

I'm sorry I neglected you.

1904
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,021
I was weak.

rake the lawn today.

you're messing with.

This is safety
commissioner Utley.

You're going to the principal's
office one way or the other.

1935

Now we can do this the
easy way or the hard way.
