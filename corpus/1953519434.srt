You can't stay in Italy.

No. We made the decision
together.

discuss it with me.

got totally swept away,

you threw him out.

did or didn't do--

he didn't do.

He's young, gorgeous,
italian,

105
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,763
He's the heir to
a textile fortune--

106

Women throw themselves at him.

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,567
And boy,
does he catch 'em!

108
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,036
Not anymore.
He's done playing the field.

109
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,339
He's left that all behind.
He promised.

110
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,875
Promises. What about
the promise you made to me

111
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,411
To come back
after the wedding
and be my star?

112
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,515
I know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna
change my mind.

Who's this?

225
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,854
It's me.
<i>Harper?</i>

226
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,355
Are you okay?

227
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,123
You sound weird.
<i>Ahem.</i>

228
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,959
Ahem! My throat is
a little swollen.

229
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,627
I must have caught
something on the flight.

230
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,529
How's the knee?
<i>It's, um...</i>

231
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,098
Better. A lot better,
actually.

232
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,366
That tonic really
did the trick.

233
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,303
One of the dancers found it
here in the theater. Why?

234
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,139
I had the tiniest,
sort of miniscule,
you know...

235
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,207
Harper.

236
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,642
Reaction.

237
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,011
What kind of reaction?
Are you sick?

238
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,313
I am definitely feeling
very strange right now.

239
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,948
You should go
to the doctor.

240
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,317
Amanda, I am fine.
I'm fine. I just--

241
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,887
I need you to figure out
where this stuff came from.

242
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,056
<i>I'll see what I can do,</i>
<i>but you need to come home</i>
<i>right now. We need to find</i>

243
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,058
A replacement
for mirabella <i>today.</i>

244
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,561
Yeah. I came here
to convince mirabella

245
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,564
That marco is not worth
giving up her career for.

246
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,167
And now I know
how to prove it.

247
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,970
What are you going to do?
<i>I'm going to seduce marco.</i>

248
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,539
<i>You're going to seduce</i>
<i>the playboy prince?</i>

249
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,343
I'm going to show her
that lover boy here
isn't cut out to keep promises.

250
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,912
Just find out what you can
about that tonic

251
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,513
<i>And call me back.</i>

252
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,541
Excuse me, sir.

253
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,344
I'll have you know that
I'm an almost-married woman.

254
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,114
Oh, that's all right,
I'm an almost-married man.

255
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,686
And this is how you choose
to spend your last few
precious hours of freedom?

256
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,355
Hours?
I only need five minutes.

257
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,523
Ew!
( both laughing )

258
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,192
What do we have here?

259
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,961
Put that down!
No, no!

260
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,629
In a marriage
there are no secrets.

261
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,465
We're not married yet!
Not for a couple of days.

262
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,467
So we do have secrets!
You started your novel?

263
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,602
No!
Oh, great!

264
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,705
Like father, like daughter.
No!

265
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:18,109
He's not a novelist.
He teaches comparative
literature at nyu.

266
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,313
Besides, I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all day
and have six kids. Stop!

267
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,348
They're my vows.

268
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,649
Sorry. Sorry.

269
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,152
Hmm. So...

270
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,388
How are yours coming along?
Great!

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,457
I mean, that's really
important to you, right?

272
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,126
That we both
write our own?

273
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,162
Yes.
It's very important.
It's the <i>most</i> important.

274
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,199
It's the one chance we have
to stand up in front
of everybody

275
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:46,004
And say how we really
feel about each other,
speak from our hearts.

276
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,507
And I do love you
with all my heart.

277
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,642

00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,858
And--and you are?

303
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,827
You don't remember me?

304
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:20,331
Debbie hayworth.
Second cousin once removed.

305
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,334
Aunt marjorie's side?
Ohh. Okay,

306
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,571
Your grandmother
and my great-uncle--

307
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,106
I'm sorry,
too many details.

308
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,141
You must be on
my mother's list.

309
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,810
We played together
all the time as kids.

310
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:36,781
Remember the treehouse
uncle eddie built in
the back of the barn?

311
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,850
Of--of course!
The old treehouse!

312
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,652
God, it's been forever.
You look so...

313
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,291
So much like my mother
when she was young.

314
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,127
Really?

315
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,430
Yeah,
the spitting image.
It's weird.

316
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,233
It's <i>really</i> weird.

317
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,469
Aunt marjorie always
said the same thing.
And--and I said,

318
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,304
"well, if I have to
look like somebody,

319
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,839
I'm so glad
it's aunt harper."

320
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,175
I mean, is she just
a timeless beauty, or what?

321
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,410
And--and so talented.

322
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,180
Aunt marjorie always
called her "superstar."

323
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,915
I really hate to break up
the family reunion,

324
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,351
But we have
a rehearsal dinner
nightmare on our hands.

325
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,786
See?
Oh, gosh, these
italian family feuds.

326
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,555
They last for 700 years.

327
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,490
And I don't know where I'm gonna
put my great-aunt birdie.

328
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,259
She came in
all the way from boston.

329
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:25,196
Interesting color scheme.
Is that...Puce?

330
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,398
Bold choice.

331
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,667
I thought your mom said
you were going with

332
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,203
Dusky rose
and gold accents.

333
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,205
No, that's what her mom
<i>wanted</i> her to go with.

334
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,174
Pink and gold are classics.

335
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,241
Old-fashioned.

336
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,210
Tasteful.
Boring.

337
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,316
Oh, my gosh!

338
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,885
Debbie,
you fixed it!
Thank you!

339
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,289
Oh! You have <i>got</i> to come
to my bachelorette party.

340
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,823
Bachelorette party?

341
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,227
Oh, yeah, we're family.
You have to come.

342
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,596
We have champagne
and mani-pedi's.
Mani-pedi's.

343
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,331
Yay!
Yay!

344
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,600
Well, I'll get
settled in, then.

345
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,901
Okay.
All right.
All right.

346
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,871
We'll see you
for mani-pedi's.

347
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,573
All: Mani-pedi's!

348
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,410
Amanda!

349
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,612
The tonic.
What have you got?

350
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,215
We have a bigger problem.

351
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,218
I spoke to the investors.

352
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,686
Amanda, the tonic.

353
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,487
Harper, this is serious.

354
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,923
You need to come home
right now. I can't do this.

355
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:30,361
I am in a situation here,
amanda. I need information.

356
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,230
What kind of situation?
How crazy

357
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,732
<i>Is it over there?</i>

358
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,933
( camera snaps )

359
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,405
I'd say it's getting
pretty crazy, don't you think?

360
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,974
Who's that?
She looks familiar.

361
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,809
Are you in my office?
What?

362
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,345
<i>Look around.</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>

363
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,256
Aaaaah!

364
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,790
<i>Amanda!</i>

365
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,261
<i>Amanda.</i>

366
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,263
Amanda?

367
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,998
Who is this?

368
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
It's <i>me,</i> amanda!
Now focus! The tonic!

369
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,371
No, you're not.
That is impossible.

370
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,939
You have worked
for me for 15 years.

371
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,307
<i>We have mounted</i>

372
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,441
22 productions together,
and turned

373
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,310
<i>Three unknowns</i>
<i>into broadway stars.</i>

374
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:23,014
And help me figure out
what is in this tonic
that turned me young,

375
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,816
I will fire you
without hesitation or regret!

376
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:26,984
Now pull yourself together!

377
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:31,289
Oh, my god. It <i>is</i> you.

378
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,025
Thank you.
What have you got?

379
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,693
<i>Um...</i>

380
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:39,063
Oh, god. The stuff
is really old, harper.

381
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,998
It was used for

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,301
<i>Rheumatism, gout, um...</i>

383
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,936
Melancholia, and impotence.

384
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,538
What about side effects?

385
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,473
Well, I've already
looked online.

386
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,776
The company's been
out of business
for decades.

387
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:02,653
Find out: Does it wear off,
and if so, can I take more.
You got it? Find out.

388
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,539
( exhales )

389
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,342
The things I do
for my daughter.

390
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,115
Hi.

391
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,516
Hello.

392
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,884
Debbie hayworth.

393
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,386
Marco vitturi.

394
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,789
You must be related to
mirabella. You look like her.

395
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,859
She looks like me.
We're second cousins.

396
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,095
Once removed.
Aunt marjorie's side.

397
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,730
Right. Listen to this.

398
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,498
"dear mirabella,

399
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,600
"you are so beautiful.

400
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,104
"I want to never sleep
or even blink again

401
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,742
"just so I can stare at
your beautifulness forever...

402
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,977
Until I die."

403
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,480
Too over the top?

404
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:06,050
Wow. That is, um...
Yeah, that's really bad.

405
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,919
It's terrible.

406
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,123
But it was mirabella's idea
for us to write our own vows
for the wedding,

407
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,125
And...I don't know,

408
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,794
I have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

409
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,630
Looks to me like
you can't <i>stop</i> figuring out
what to say.

410
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,031
True enough.

411
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,902
Love can make you
a little crazy sometimes.

412
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,405
That's not your reputation,
you know.

413
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,140
Yeah. I know.

414
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:32,076
Must be really hard
to give that up.

415
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,413
Not really.

416
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,116
Mirabella must be
very special to you.
Oh, she is.

417
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,118
She has this--

418
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,521
I mean, she's so--

419
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:47,458
When we first met,
I was like--

420
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,127
Oh, god.

421
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,062
She's--everything.

422
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,199
So it's kind of hard,
you know, to--

423
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,770
She has <i>the</i> most
beautiful blue eyes.

424
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,473
Yeah. Yeah,
she got those
from her dad.

425
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:07,044
And this beautiful smile
where one side of her mouth
kind of turns up--

426
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,147
Kind of like yours.
Think she's got a secret?

427
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,852
Yeah, right.
Something, uh...Secret.

428
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,489
Oh, and she--she has
these beautiful hands.

429
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,925
Oh, dancer's hands.

430
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:24,061
You're...A dancer too?

431
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,030
Runs in the family.

432
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,703
I'm--I'm sorry, have--
have we met before?

433
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,773
Not in this lifetime.

434
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,576
Are you sure? Because--
oh, I'm sure.

435
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,979
You would definitely
remember meeting me.

436
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,683
You know, for second cousins,
you and mirabella...

437
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:49,086
Yes?
It's strange how much
you remind me of her.

438
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,864
This is so going to work.

439
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,071
Noelle, how many times
did you lose your virginity?

440
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,773
I have no idea, but hey,

441
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:13,143
If the stars align
I might lose it again
this weekend.

442
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,513
( laughter )

443
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,682
Seriously though, em,
you're so lucky to have
found a guy like marco.

444
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,852
He's so hot and rich...

445
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,756
And hot and rich! Hello!

446
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,057
Okay, mirabella,
it's your turn.

447
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,226
Oh, no.
Somebody else go.

448
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,161
But your story's so good.

449
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,531
Okay. She was 16 years old,

450
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,000
She told her mom
she was spending the weekend
at a friend's house--

451
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,735
I'm that friend,
that influence--
and instead,

452
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,105
We snuck off to paris!
What?!

453
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,141
I mean, wow.

454
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,144
And there,
after staying up all night

455
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,979
Walking the banks of the seine
hand in hand,

456
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,282
Talking until sunrise,

457
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,150
Whispering their life stories
to each other--

458
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,953
Noelle, no!
You have got
to be kidding me.

459
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,989
Our dear, sweet,
innocent mirabella

460
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:03,327
Laid herself down
with that hot, sexy
french man

461
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:07,064
And gave up
her precious flower.
At sixteen?!

462
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,966
It was very romantic.

463
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:11,635
By the end of the night
we knew everything
about each other

464
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,904
And we were like
two ships passing.

465
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,307
And he was really very sweet.
Wait a second.

466
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,044
How the heck did you
get out of the country
without your mother knowing?

467
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,179
Her mom was at
an out-of-town preview.

468
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,648
Her dad gave us permission.
We told him it was
a class trip.

469
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,584
My mom didn't even
notice I was gone.

470
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,587
Okay, that is not fair.
She's a very busy woman.

471
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,755
A single mom,
a demanding career--

472
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,992
Debbie, my mom is, was,
and always will be

473
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,928
Way too self-centered
to think about anybody
but herself.

474
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,932
She took you to dance classes
three times a week
when you were a kid.

475
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,341
Noelle:
What are you <i>doing?</i>

476
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:52,309
The sun is very bad
for your skin.

477
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,679
So, mirabella, tell me
about this french guy.

478
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,281
Did you think
you were in love with him?

479
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,818
Okay, uh, no.
I mean, it was
a great experience,

480
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,053
But it wasn't like
how it is with marco.

481
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,657
Right. Marco.
The playboy prince.

482
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,194
I'm sorry. I just--
I read that.

483
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,263
He retired that title
when he met me. Besides,
he's not a real prince.

484
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:16,033
( laughter )
but he is a real italian.

485
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,235
I wouldn't worry too much
about that, though.

486
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,405
Not every italian guy
has to have a mistress,
right?

487
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,074
Right?
I'm not worried about it.

488
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:28,245
I knew marco was the right guy

Hello?

531
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,964
Any good news, amanda?

532
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay. Okay, okay.

533
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,035
<i>The good news.</i>
<i>The trunk that the tonic</i>

534
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,105
Was found in was owned

Tom dorian.
<i>Never heard of him.</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

536
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,176
And now the not-so-good news.

537
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,812
The investors found out about
mirabella leaving the show.

538
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,447
Oh, no! How?!
<i>One of the dancers</i>

539
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,116
Spilled, and it gets worse.

540
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:21,185
They're going to recast her.

541
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,920
They can't do that.
<i>Yes,</i>

542
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,421
They can. Look,

543
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,989
<i>I told the investors</i>

544
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,391
<i>Mirabella'd be back</i>
<i>for rehearsal on Monday,</i>

545
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,827
But if mirabella is not
back here for it,

546
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,996
They're going to replace her.
And you.

547
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,933
We don't need a new lead.
Mirabella is coming back.

548
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,267
( laughing )
whoo!

549
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,169
And they wouldn't dare
replace me.

550
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,571
Why am I scared?

551
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,039
Don't say anything to anybody.

552
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,240
Tell them I will
be back on Monday

553
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,975

00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,010

I can't believe
<i>I</i> just did that.

568
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,157
I've had too much to drink.

569
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,059
Oh, my gosh,
I am so sorry!

570
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,627
I don't know
what came over me!

571
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,697
Maybe it was the champagne--
no, no, no,
you don't understand.

572
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:18,135
I swore I was through
with other women, for good.

573
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:22,673
Debbie, mirabella dared me
to be a better person,
and I thought I could.

574
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,342
Because she believed in me
more than anyone has

575
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,444
In my entire life.

576
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,950
But now this?

577
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,987
I don't think I can be
the man she wants me to be,

578
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,156
Or the man she deserves.

579
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,961
I'm not good enough
for her. Right?

580
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,633
I'm sorry, debbie,
this isn't your fault.
It's mine.

581
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,702
I have to go.

582
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,693
Oh! This is it.

583
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:20,464
Can you believe
I'm getting married tomorrow?

584
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,733
No, I really can't.

585
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,137
Debbie, what's wrong?

586
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,039
Nothing. Nothing.

587
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,075
I'm fine, it's just
this is the first time
I've seen you in your dress.

588
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:36,213
It seems like just yesterday
you were a little girl.

589
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,149
We. <i>We</i> were little girls.

590
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,084
Dancing around
the back yard together,

591
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,687
Playing with
each other's hair...

592
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,459
This is the most
beautiful you've looked
in your entire life.

593
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,228
Are you happy?

594
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,263
Yes!

595
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,232
How could I not be?

596
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,068
I'm getting everything
that I ever wanted.

597
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,206
But you're giving up
your dream to be a dancer
to stay here with marco.

598
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,576
( laughs )
debbie.

599
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:11,181
Can I...
Can I tell you a secret?

600
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,184
I never wanted
to be a dancer.

601
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:19,189
That was my mom's dream,
not mine.

602
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:24,194
What? Never?

603
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,632
I mean, maybe for
a little while,
when I was a kid.

604
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:32,369
I mean,
I worshipped my mother.

605
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,238
You remember, she was
this big glamorous star

606
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,340
And everyone loved her.

607
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:40,343
And I wanted to be
just like her...

608
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,313
For a while.

609
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,082
What happened?

610
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:48,285
I grew up.

611
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,524
I can't believe
you never said anything
to your mom.

612
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,094
Well...

613
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,130
I didn't want
to disappoint her.

614
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,599
When my mom blew her knee out,

615
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,268
She wanted me
to be the big star that...

616
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,804
She couldn't be anymore.

617
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,774
And when I met marco,

618
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:16,313
I finally realized
I can't live my life for her,

619
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:19,416
No matter how much I love her.

620
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,288
It was like...

621
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,524
The first time
marco and I met,

622
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,759
I could hear this little voice
telling me,

623
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:33,163
"this guy's the one."

624
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,631
Ya know? Like...

625
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,234
The future was talking to me,

626
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,171
Telling me I had already
spent a whole lifetime with him.

627
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,474
Does that sound crazy?

628
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,210
No.

629
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,881
It's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

630
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,183
Woman:
Senorina mirabella?

631
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,790
Oh. You know, I forgot
to thank you for standing in
for noelle today, debbie.

632
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,359
I--

633
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,297
I have no idea where
she could possibly be.

634
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,201
Debbie, where are you going?

635
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,470
See you at
the rehearsal dinner!

636
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,297
( speaks italian )

637
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,639
Scott: Dude,
you gotta slow down.
I can't keep up.

638
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,681
But wait a sec.
She said <i>she</i> kissed <i>you?</i>

639
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,449
Why are we freaking out
about this?

640
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,919
Because I didn't stop her--
and I should have.

641
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:07,224
I shouldn't have even
put myself in a situation
where that could have happened.

642
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,959
I broke my promise
to mirabella.

643
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,295
Dude, you only have to feel
guilty <i>after</i> the wedding,

644
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,231
That's the whole point
of getting married.

645
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,933
Sage advice from the guy
who defines a long-term
relationship

646
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,768
As a three-day weekend in aspen.

647
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,504
I promised her
I was done with other women.

648
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,307
I don't know,
maybe I'm just not
cut out for monogamy.

649
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,810
(laughing) fantastic!
I've got a number
of two swedish flight attendants

650
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,980
Who can meet us on your boat
in three hours!

651
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,616
What? I'm not
judging you, man.

652
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,952
You weren't there.
She was like
some fairy creature.

653
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,687
She put a spell on me.

654
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,624
She had these
soulful brown eyes,
like a gypsy.

655
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:45,695
And she smelled like
the perfume my mother
used to wear.

656
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,365
It was weird. There was
something about her,

657
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,368
Like...Magical.

658
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,574
I have to cancel
the wedding.

659
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,046
Oh, god, what have I done?

660
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,951
I've got to fix this.

661
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,727
Name?
Ryan hutton.
Father of the bride.

662
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,330
Is harper hutton here?

663
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,998
She is not on the list.

664
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,035
About fifty,
eyes like a tiger shark.

665
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:30,006
The unmistakable aroma
of chanel number 5 and pure evil
gives her away.

666
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,608
Not on the list, sir.

667
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,077
Keep an eye out.
She'll never be able
to stay away.

668
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,479
I got your back.
Thanks.

669
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,928
( voices outside )

670
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:00,070
...About my age,
about this tall?

671
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,005
Ryan.

672
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,986
Mirabella: <i>Debbie,</i>
<i>are you in there?</i>

673
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:20,056
Something's happened.
Debbie?

674
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,826
(falsetto) I'm here.
<i>Can you come out?</i>

675
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,127
I need to talk to you.

676
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,129
Not feeling well!

677
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,864
Why don't you
talk to noelle?

678
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,734
That's just it,
I can't.

679
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:33,670
<i>She and marco</i>
<i>kissed last night.</i>

680
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,539
Just a sec!

681
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,974
<i>Debbie, what's wrong?</i>

682
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,977
I thought--you know,
didn't we sort of bond?

683
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,714
<i>I haven't seen noelle</i>
<i>all day. She disappeared.</i>

684
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,383
<i>I know it was her.</i>

685
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,052
Debbie, are you okay?

686
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,820
Not so good!

687
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,090
I shouldn't go through
with it, right?

688
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,627
<i>He kissed another girl.</i>
<i>He broke his promise to me.</i>

689
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,062
What choice do I have?

690
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,431
Oh...Oh...

691
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,666
Debbie?

692
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,969
<i>I can't go through with it.</i>

693
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,470
Right?

694
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,173
Oh...Ohh...

695
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,182
Oh!

696
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,792
Uhh! Uhh!

697
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,896
Ohh!

698
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,038
<i>Hi, this is amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

699
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,508
Amanda, where <i>are</i> you?
Call me back.

700
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,046
I need to know does this stuff
work more than once! Ohh!

701
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,684
Mirabella!
Dad!

702
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,453
I'm so glad you're here!

703
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,087
Oh, honey.

704
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,825
Is she here?
Dad--

705
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,695
I'm telling ya,
she won't be able to resist.

706
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,931
Honey, what's wrong?

707
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:11,134
Dad, I think
mom might have been right
about marco the whole time.

708
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,037
Your mother hasn't been right
about anything since 1987

709
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,840
When she said,
"let's name her mirabella."
noelle: Look who it is.

710
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,208
Hi, noelle.

711
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,746
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

712
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,648
Pre-wedding jitters,
I guess.

713
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,083
Have you talked to her?

714
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,252
Harper: <i>Oh!</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

715
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:32,088
Sounds like an elephant
passing a kidney stone.

716
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,157
Has to be debbie.
Who's debbie?

717
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,926
Mirabella's cousin,
debbie hayworth?

718
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,228
Never heard of her.

719
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,832
Ooh. Too many
tequila shooters.

720
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,668
Debbie, are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

721
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,038
Okay, well, then you need
to suck it up,

722
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,942
Because I have got a hangover
that could bring down a t-rex.

723
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,712
After the dance-off
is all a blur.

724
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,714

Harper?

00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,015
Harper.

775
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,207
Oh, my--

776
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,018
This is not

777
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,054
( door opens )

778
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,757
What are you doing?

779
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,259
Why aren't you getting dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

780
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:08,231
I'm leaving.
Marco and noelle
kissed last night, remember?

781
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:12,135
Moonlight magic. Gag.

782
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:15,371
My mom was right
about him, debbie.
He's never gonna change.

783
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,107
Have you...
Talked to him yet?

784
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,343
No. I know that I have to--
don't. Don't!

785
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:24,280
This could all just be
normal jitters. Cold feet.

786
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,985
It's not just about
a kiss, debbie.

787
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,520
Marco can't--

788
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:33,523
He can't express
his feelings for me.

789
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:38,094
Every single time
it comes up, he clams up.

790
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:42,098
I just-- I think
that I made a big mistake.

791
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,202
I don't think that
he's ready for marriage.

792
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:50,173
That is not true.
It's not true. Marco <i>loves</i> you.

793
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:54,043
Look, I know how you're feeling.
My ex cheated on me.

794
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:58,314
And I bet that
you dumped him.
Oh, I did. But....

795
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,883
I didn't dump him
because he cheated,

796
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:04,987
I dumped him because he cheated
and lied to me about it.

797
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,024
I gave him a chance
to come clean,

798
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,259
But by then it was too late.

799
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:14,897
That's terrible,
debbie. I'm sorry.

800
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,166
Listen, I speak
from experience.

801
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,102
If marco tells you the truth
about what happened,

802
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,172
You will know that
it was just a stupid mistake

803
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,208
And he is so sorry.

804
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,911
Can you handle that?

805
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,847
I don't know.

806
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,883
We have this huge dance
in front of everyone

807
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,618
At midnight after
the rehearsal dinner.

808
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,855
It's a vitturi
family tradition.

809
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:42,558
Okay. Give him until
midnight, then.

810
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,894
Can you do that?

811
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,632
Okay, until midnight.

812
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,934
Good.

813
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:54,570
How'd you get so smart
about this stuff?

814
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,139
Because I have an old soul.

815
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,976
It's gonna be okay,
pumpkin.

816
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,114
"pumpkin"?
My mom calls me that.

817
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:09,218
Does she?
That's so funny.
My mom calls me that too.

818
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,153
All right, well,
I gotta go.

819
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,422
But debbie,
what if he doesn't--

820
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:16,092
Doesn't tell the truth?

821
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,060
Mr. Hutton.

822
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,062
I'm so glad you're here.

823
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,397
Marco.

824
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,035
Oh, I'm sorry I missed
your bachelor party.

825
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:28,237
I hope you
behaved yourself.

826
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,640
Well, actually,
I messed up.

827
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:34,443
I got drunk, and I don't know
how it all happened,

828
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:41,584
But it ended up
with me kissing someone
who is not mirabella.

829
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:46,055
But it didn't mean anything,
and the other girl
kind of kissed me, really.

830
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:50,092
But I made this promise
to mirabella that I was
through with all that.

831
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:54,130
And now I don't
know what to do.

832
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,299
Sit down.

833
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,505
I want you to
look me in the eye
and tell me the truth--

834
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:06,542
Do you love my daughter?
Absolutely.
With all my heart, sir.

835
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,112
All right, then.
I can help you fix this,

836
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,214
But you have to do
exactly what I say.

837
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,350
I know I have to
tell her the truth.
<i>No.</i>

838
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,153
Don't tell her the truth.

839
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:20,122
You'll only end up hurting her,
and I don't want that to happen.

840
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,359
Believe it or not,
I was once in your shoes--

841
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:26,295
And <i>now</i> look at me.
You're divorced.

842
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,532
Exactly.
Because I told the truth!

843
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:35,137
You know, your divorce
is why mirabella is
so worried about me.

844
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,007
It was really hard on her.
I know it was.

845
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:41,544
Telling mirabella the truth
won't change anything.

846
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:44,013
I don't want to lie to her.

847
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:47,183
If you love her,
you    <i>ha</i>to lie.

848
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,619
You can't tell her the truth,
no matter what.

849
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,521
Clear?

850
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,025
All right.

851
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,994
Hey, where ya goin'?

852
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,264
To talk to a ghost.

853
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,603
Oh! Where did that boy go?

854
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,306
Harper.

855
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:13,476
It <i>is</i> you!
It is not!

856
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,311
What the hell's
going on here?

857
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:18,147
How can--how can you
look like this?

858
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,649
I'm sure I don't know you,
so if you'll just excuse me--

859
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,020
Harper, your ass.
What?

860
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,689
I recognized it
in the bathroom.

861
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:30,626
I know that ass.
I fell in love with that ass.

862
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:34,096
God help me, I spent
the better part of the eighties
worshipping that ass.

863
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,264
Really?

864
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,633
It <i>is</i> you.

865
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,171
Hello, ryan.
It's been a while.

866
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,308
I need a drink.
I'll get it for you.
Come.

867
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,113
I also need a priest.

868
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:54,183
Gotta be a priest
around here somewhere,
this is Italy.

869
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,218
Where are
all the priests?

870
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,487
Oh, my god. Will you stop
being so dramatic?

871
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,456
I have a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

872
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,559
There is <i>nothing</i>
<i>reasonable about this--</i>
<i>or you.</i>

873
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,361
Okay, just take
a deep breath--

874
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,130
Don't--
don't tell me what to do.

875
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,403
Where are you going?

876
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,706
To find a cop.
This can't be legal.

877
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,393
( coughing )

878
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,663
W-what happened?

879
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,265
You're going to be
very angry.

880
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,701
Distinct possibility,
if you're involved
in any way.

881
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,803
My knee was the size
of a grapefruit, ryan,

882
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,339
And--and there was this tonic,
and it is <i>magical.</i>

883
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,274
And I took a sip
and I turned young.

884
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,110
Amanda found it
in the back of the theater--

885
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,711
Lord knows how long
that's been there--
but I had no choice.

886
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:58,147
So in a way,
it's kind of like fate.

887
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,682
And I hated marco,
I hated him,

888
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:04,253
But it turns out
he really loves her,
and she really loves him back,

889
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:09,358
And okay, I admit,
I originally came here
to stop the wedding--at first.

890
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,161
But    <i>the</i>you know,
as it turns out,

891
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,897
I, um, I kissed him...
Of course.

892
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,900
And now it's all gone
terribly wrong somehow.

893
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,569
Well, then,
you haven't
lost your touch.

894
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,841
This isn't a joke, ryan.

895
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:29,478
Seriously, harper, how could
you do something like this
to our daughter?

896
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,448
I know, I know,
it's terrible.

897
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,817
Are you mad?
Hold on.

898
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:38,220
Did you drug me?
Of   <i>cours</i>i drugged you.

899
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:41,524
You were gonna drop the dime
on me. Plus, I really need
your help with this.

900
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:43,225
You...Drugged me!

901
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,194
I was <i>thinking</i>
<i>about our daughter!</i>

902
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,795
Oh, sure you were!

903
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,840
Wha--

904
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,478
Aaaah!

905
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,851
Right.

906
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,687
Ryan?

907
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,222
Ryan!
Hmm...

908
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:15,558
Ryan. Ryan.
Huhh!

909
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,927
What did you
do to me this time?

910
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,695
Whose voice is that?

911
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,798
Is that--(coughs)--
(shrill) hey, that's me!

912
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,934
(deeper)
hey, that's <i>me.</i>

913
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:27,670
Why do I sound so weird,
harper?!

914
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,277
Oh, my god.
Harper, this...

915
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,579
Is a miracle.

916
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,781
I know, I know,
you're young,

917
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,950
I've been there,
I've done that.
Listen to me.

918
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:44,520
Yeah!
I have ruined our daughter's
one chance at love.

919
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,921
So I need you to
help me fix it.

920
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,757
Yeah, well, you can check that
off your to-do list,

921
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,627
Because I already fixed it.
What do you mean?

922
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,929
Marco spilled
the whole can of beans.

923
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:58,901
I told him no witness,
no crime. Just deny
till he dies.

924
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,236
It's all good.

925
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,304
No. Ryan! No--

926
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:03,939
Ryan!!!

927
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:07,776
Mirabella overhead marco
talking about the kiss.

928
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,279
He   <i>ha</i>to confess.
Uh-oh.

929
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:12,781
Yeah. I told her that
if he tells her the truth,

930
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,817
That means he loves her
and she can trust him.

931
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:18,020
So if he doesn't tell her,
she'll just think he's
trying to cover it up

932
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:21,657
And that means
he'll cheat on her again.
We have to fix this.

933
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:26,962
Wow. To see your mind at work
is at once fascinating
and repugnant.

934
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:30,666
Oh, my god.
You are completely useless.
I remember why I divorced you.

935
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,268
It was not a divorce--

936
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,969
It was an exorcism!

937
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:37,039
You cheated on me!
One time!
Mid-life crisis.

938
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,707
And then you lied about it.

939
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,310
And when I told the truth,
you kicked me out!

940
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,945
We do not
have time for this.

941
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,947
Where could marco be?
Think, ryan.

942
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,917
Think? I can't think
because I'm 30 years younger
than I was 20 minutes ago!

943
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,287
I can't believe
you got me into this!

944
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,989
Wait-- yes, I can.

945
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:59,061
Okay, look, I just read
this guy's diary on the plane,

946
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:01,297
Oh my god,
I hope I'm not too late.

947
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:04,767
Look, whatever happens,
do <i>not</i> take a third dose.

948
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,568
( disconnects )

949
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,876
Mirabella.

950
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,011
Wow. You look...

951
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,616
What's wrong?
Nothing.

952
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,419
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.

953
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,055
So we're both good.
We're great.

954
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,660
Look...

955
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,430
I don't want any secrets
between us.

956
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,067
That's not the way
to start a marriage.

957
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,601
I totally agree.

958
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:46,041
So...You would tell me the truth
about anything stupid

959
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,976
You might have done
in the past?

960
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:52,681
Distant, recent, whatever?

961
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,519
Well, um, mirabella,

962
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:02,524
What I'm trying to say
is that, well, I...

963
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,960
Wait! He's gonna tell her.

964
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,895
Um...

965
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,800
Of <i>course</i> I would.

966
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:15,104
If I had something,
you know, to confess.

967
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,972
( grunts )

968
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,841
Damn.

969
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,813
Mirabella...

970
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,949
Young harper:
I've seriously messed this up.

971
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,984
And how.

972
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,019
Okay,
what's our plan?

973
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,689
Ha! "our" plan?

974
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,998
Would you stop, <i>please,</i>
look what I can do!
How long does th<i>ohh! Ow!</i> Last?

975
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,635
And help me? We only
have until midnight when
the rehearsal dinner ends.

976
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:49,638
I can't help it.
This stuff <i>really</i> works.

977
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,774
Of course it works.
It's--(gasps )--

978
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,843
Oh, my gosh, the tonic!
I left it at the bar!

979
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,098
Hmm.

980
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,810
No! No, no!
Where is it?
I don't see it.

981
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,979
( gasps )
what?

982
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,615
Oh. What happened?

983
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,684
Oh, aunt birdie.

984
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:38,654
She must have chugged
the whole bottle.

985
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:42,124
What's that
gonna do to her?

986
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,593
I don't want to know.

987
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:46,929
Aunt birdie?

988
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,064
( gasps )

989
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,833
Oh, my god.
What?

990
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,971
There goes great-aunt birdie.

991
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,007
Proud matriarch
of the hayworth line.

992
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,777
Wow.
She's got some moves.
Runs in the family.

993
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:05,180
You have really
screwed this up.

994
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,755
( music, chatter )

995
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,959
( whispering )

996
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,596
Hey. I am debbie,
and you are...?
Angus.

997
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,965
Angus?
Angus.

998
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:27,102
Okay, we only have
until midnight to
get this fixed, <i>angus.</i>

999
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:31,106
Hey. I know it goes
completely against
your nature

1000
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:34,576
And ever fiber of your being
is screaming at you
to do the opposite,

1001
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:36,745
But you have to
tell the truth.

1002
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,615
Let marco off the hook
for this kiss, harper.

1003
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,984
Tell him <i>you</i> kissed <i>him.</i>

1004
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,086
He's gotta understand
none of this was his fault.

1005
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,655
It's the only way
to fix this mess.

1006
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,156
You're right.

1007
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,125
Ugh!

1008
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,961
God, I <i>hate</i> it
when that happens.

1009
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,601
Noelle: No, I'm serious.
You look <i>amazing.</i>

1010
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:02,304
Oh, the bride-to-be is here.

1011
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:04,139
Mirabella.

1012
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,209
Hey.
Mirabella: Hi.

1013
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,979
Thanks for ruining my life.
I thought we were
best friends.

1014
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,116
Excuse me?
Back up a sec.
You can drop the act,

1015
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:17,286
Because I know that
you and marco kissed last night.

1016
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:19,555
What are you <i>talking</i> about?

1017
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,723
I heard him and scott
talking about it
under the bridge.

1018
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:26,028
"soulful brown eyes,
full of life,
embracing the moment."

1019
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,831
Mirabella, I was
really drunk last night,
but I wasn't <i>that</i> drunk.

1020
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,934
"mirabella,
you're so lucky!

1021
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:34,102
He's so hot and rich,
<i>and</i> hot and rich!"

1022
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,571
Okay, fine!
I was plastered.

1023
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,306
After I left you guys, I--

1024
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:40,042
I hit up the bachelor party...

1025
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:44,646
And I can't remember
much after that.
Convenient.

1026
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:48,283
We've been best friends
since seventh grade.
I would never hurt you.

1027
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:55,057
Besides, I'm not
the only one around here
with brown eyes.

1028
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:58,026
The jig is up!
No, no, no! She can't
find out it was me!

1029
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,095
What do we do?

1030
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,631
We have to
convince her

I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1098
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,342
Hey, honey. What's up?

1099
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,010
<i>Where are you?</i>

1100
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,047
Who    that guy?
And how did I miss him?
Uh....

1101
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,049
<i>Upstairs. Uh, I'm...</i>

1102
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:15,483
Jet lagged.

1103
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:18,220
<i>You sound weird.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1104
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:20,121
I do feel
very strange right now.

1105
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,489
<i>I'm not myself at all.</i>

1106
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,860
I'm gonna
go find marco.

1107
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,063
Dad...
<i>What is it, honey?</i>

1108
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,531
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

1109
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,366
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can go through</i>

1110
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,168
With this wedding.

1111
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:44,045
It's just that mom said
mthat he would never
mbe faithful to me.

1112
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,214
<i>And then debbie said</i>
<i>the way I could find</i>
<i>if he would be</i>

1113
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,250
<i>Is if he confessed to</i>
<i>kissing noelle last night,</i>

1114
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:50,018
<i>Because that would mean</i>
<i>that he's sorry,</i>
<i>and he didn't.</i>

1115
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,054
And I think that it speaks
to a larger character flaw,

1116
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:57,659
And on top if it all,
he can't even tell me
how he feels about me.

1117
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,327
Honey, listen.

1118
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,429
<i>People are human.</i>
<i>They make mistakes.</i>

1119
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:04,299
I made a lot of mistakes
with your mom.

1120
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:06,568
And she definitely
punished me for it.

1121
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,103
But I never stopped loving her

1122
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,204
Through any of it.

1123
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,907
<i>Even asset seizure?</i>
<i>All the lawyers</i>

1124
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,109
In the world weren't able
to change the way
I feel about her.

1125
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:17,545
So then why
did you cheat on her?

1126
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,553
( sighs )
because I was selfish...

1127
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:30,225
And lonely and...Insecure.

1128
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:34,062
Your mom was a real star,
honey.

1129
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:37,299
When she blew out her knee,
I wasn't sad. I was thrilled.

1130
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,034
I thought, finally

1131
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,303
I don't have to share her
with the rest of the world.

1132
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,705
But that didn't happen.
She went right back to work

1133
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:47,008
And became
the star choreographer,
the one everyone

1134
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,110
Wanted to work with,
everyone adored.

1135
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,247
And there I was,
still nobody,

1136
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:54,316
Holding her coat
at parties.

1137
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,185
Dad, I had no idea.

1138
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:02,624
What I did to her was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1139
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:07,128
I think I must have always
hoped for a second chance.

1140
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,065
But I never thought
I'd get it.

1141
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,534
I never felt I deserved it.

1142
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:19,174
After you cheated on mom,
she couldn't trust you anymore.

1143
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,109
<i>And now I know why.</i>

1144
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,113
And I can't trust marco.
<i>No--</i>

1145
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,082
He loves you, honey.

1146
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,316
<i>Really?</i>

1147
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,552
Where's the proof?

1148
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,454
<i>He can't even</i>
<i>talk to me anymore.</i>

1149
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:36,691
I can't go through
with this wedding.
I'm going home.

1150
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,593
Mirabella--

1151
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,203
Damn.

1153
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,683
Oh, no! Not now!

1154
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,736
Hello?

1155
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:25,040
Mrs. Hutton?

1156
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,542
What are you doing here?

1157
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,378
I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

1158
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,214
If you came to stop the wedding,
you're too late.

1159
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,216
The wedding's not happening.

1160
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,419
I know. I spoke to debbie.
She told me everything.

1161
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,121
What? W-why?
We're very close.

1162
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,257
You were right about me
all along.

1163
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:46,528
I broke my promise to her,
and then I lied about it.
When mirabella finds out--

1164
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,197
Marco, shut up.

1165
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,132
I flew all the way here
to tell you.

1166
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:55,336
I know debbie.
I've known her
all her life.

1167
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:58,206
She's a rare
and beautiful creature--

1168
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,809
Incomparable, actually,
one of a kind.

1169
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:03,711
But she has a problem
letting go.

1170
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:06,748
She loves mirabella.

1171
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,650
They used to be
very close...

1172
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:11,719
When they were younger.
Really?

1173
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:16,724
Debbie pushed herself on you.
She wanted to prove that
you weren't good enough.

1174
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:20,161
But why would she do that?
She doesn't even know me.

1175
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,197
She...

1176
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:25,300
Had her heart broken
a long time ago.

1177
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:28,136
She loved a man
more than she wanted to,

1178
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:32,207
And it made her feel
out of control, and...

1179
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,442
And he cheated on her.

1180
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:39,214
I don't know, I guess
she just stopped believing
in love after that.

1181
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:42,517
And when mirabella
met you...

1182
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:45,753
The playboy prince?
It was like deja vu.

1183
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,556
Debbie expected
the worst from you,

1184
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:53,228
And when the worst
didn't happen on its own,
she made it happen.

1185
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:58,199
She made a <i>terrible</i> mistake,
and she is so sorry, marco.

1186
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,605
I know I never
approved of you,

1187
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:06,875
But I was wrong--
I should have
given you a chance.

1188
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,478
You're a good man.

1189
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,814
Don't give up
on mirabella.

1190
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,183
I think she might have
given up on <i>me.</i>

1191
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:19,187
Go. Look for her.
Tell her how much
you love her.

1192
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:22,257
I don't think
she'll believe me.
Prove it to her.

1193
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,892
Find a way.

1194
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:25,560
I'll try.

1195
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,757
Oh, ryan, look at you.

1196
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:58,293
The tonic didn't
last very long, did it?

1197
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:01,296
Probably from trying
to keep up with you
on the dance floor

1198
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:02,730
Like back in the day.

1199
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,732
I knew I still
had it in me.

1200
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,701
(groans)
now I have proof.

1201
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,204
Oh, my gosh. Proof!
Wha--

1202
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,539
What?

1203
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,442
What are we doing?

1204
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,811
We're looking for a book.
A big book.

1205
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,280
What's in the book?
Marco's wedding vows.

1206
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:20,448
We have to find it--

1207
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,918
( men speaking italian )

1208
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,955
What the hell
are you doing?
I'm trying to hide you.

1209
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:30,225
Ryan, they're on marco's side.
They don't even know me.

1210
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:32,994
Oh. I didn't think of that.
I'm sorry.

1211
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:36,898
Apology accepted.
Actually, you're still
a pretty good kisser.

1212
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,600
You're not bad yourself.

1213
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,840
It's locked!
Why is it locked?!

1214
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:48,309
How important is it
to get into this greenhouse?

1215
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:51,646
The future happiness
of our daughter may
depend on it.

1216
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:53,848
All right.
Get out of the way.

1217
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,951
Ohh! Oh...

1218
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,287
That was a bad idea.
Are you all right?

1219
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:02,023
Ahhh. Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,325
Oh...

1221
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,562
I'm so sorry, harper.
For what?

1222
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:10,565
I don't know.
For all of it.

1223
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,934
Everything I didn't do,
everything I did.

1224
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,303
Well, it was
a long time ago.

1225
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:17,505
Not so long.

1226
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:22,510
Ever since we split up
I feel like I've been living
someone else's life.

1227
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,913
I love you, harper.
I miss you.

1228
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:27,749
I want to come home.

1229
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:31,452
I love you too,
you idiot.

1230
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,321
( laughs )

1231
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:36,024
I always have.

1232
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:39,027
Now let's finish this--
for mirabella.

1233
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:53,508
( sighs )
which ones are the vows?

1234
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,843
I think all of them.

1235
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,946
Grab as many as you can.
And do what?

1236
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:03,851
We have to find mirabella.
You have to show these to her

1237
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:07,922
So you can prove that
marco really loves her.

1238
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:11,025
You think
that's gonna work?
It has to.

1239
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,028
Come on.
Right behind you.

1240
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,102
Where are you going?

1241
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:23,538
Where does it
look like I'm going?

1242
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,939
Wait.
I-I have to tell you--

1243
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,375
What?!

1244
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:31,012
Go ahead, marco,
tell me how you really
feel about me.

1245
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:35,383
You're--you look--um...

1246
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,020
Well, um...Um--

1247
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:41,989
Wait. Give me a second.

1248
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:46,027
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1249
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:49,664
Whenever
I'm around you lately,
I can't speak.

1250
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:54,068
I know. All right?
About the kiss.

1251
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,038
So there's nothing
left to say.

1252
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,840
But there is.

1253
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:00,975
I love you <i>so</i> much.

1254
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:02,877
I know what
I did was wrong.

1255
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,113
I should have never
let it happen.

1256
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:07,615
So then why <i>did</i> you?
I don't know.

1257
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:11,619
But all I can think about
since it happened
is how much I hurt you.

1258
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,459
Oh-- this way.

1259
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:19,961
Come on.

1260
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,968
Marco: <i>...So beautiful...</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

1261
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,070
<i>I can--I want to never...</i>
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

1262
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,638
What?

1263
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,107
Just talk to me.

1264
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,813
Tell me right now
in your own words
why you want to marry me.

1265
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,585
It's them.

1266
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,994
Wait!

1267
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,007
What is this?

1268
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,544
Here, take some.

1269
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,159
"to mirabella
on our wedding day."

1270
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,763
Are these...
Your vows?

1271
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,136

01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,149
Still?
<i>Always.</i>

1307
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:30,985
Oh, harper,
thanks god!

1308
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,588
Amanda!
I have been driving around
these back roads for hours.

1309
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:36,090
This place is
impossible to find.
What are you doing--

1310
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,092
Move away from that bottle.
Why? What--

1311
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,661
Harper, the third dose
is permanent.

1312
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:43,097
Permanent?
Yes, as in "forever."

1313
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:46,033
And that's a bad thing
because...?
( sighs )

1314
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:47,768
What?

1315
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,072
I mean, we're talking
about immortality here.

1316
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:54,942
This is an unimaginable gift--
to be young forever?

1317
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,145
You can't just throw this away
without even considering it.

1318
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:02,216
No, no, no.
It's not a gift,
it's a <i>curse.</i>

1319
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,755
There's only
one dose left here.

1320
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:11,158
You were going to be
the biggest star broadway
had ever seen.

1321
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,928
The stage, the fans,
the spotlight...

1322
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:17,632
And it all would have
happened for you, except...

1323
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,867
My knee.

1324
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:23,337
You can have that
all back now.

1325
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:27,341
You can be the new star
of your show.

1326
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,814
I could, couldn't I?

1327
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,052
And you really
want that for me?

1328
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:41,255
I just want to
make you happy, harper.

1329
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:44,859
That's all I've ever wanted
from the first day we met.

1330
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,061
I've just never been
very good at it.

1331
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:49,430
So...Yes.

1332
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:53,067
If this is what
makes you happy,
this is what I want.

1333
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,903
No, no, no, no.
Don't be crazy, harper.

1334
01:17:55,905 --> 01:18:01,142
You will lose everything.
Can you really say goodbye
to mirabella forever?

1335
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:04,011
Never see your grandkids?

1336
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:08,149
Come on. You can't
give all that up.

1337
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:10,384
It's your choice,
harper.

1338
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,701
You were the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

1339
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,108
Noelle: Girl, I cannot believe
but you look so hot! Married.
Thank you.

1340
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,418
Mom.

1341
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,220
What are you doing here?

1342
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,356
Hi, mrs. Hutton.

1343
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,326
I'm gonna leave you two
to talk.

1344
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,266
I know. I'm banned.

1345
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,470
But I've had time
to think about it.

1346
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:40,775
I've just been so wrong
about everything.

1347
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,379
I was--
I was wrong about marco.

1348
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,783
So wrong.
He's a wonderful guy.

1349
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:53,187
And he loves you,
and love is what
really matters.

1350
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,261
I mean, everything else
fades away, but love lasts.

1351
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,233
And I'm so proud of you
for knowing that...

1352
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,169
And following your heart.

1353
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,209
You still mad at me?

1354
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,981
Can I come to your wedding?

1355
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,287
I couldn't do it
without you.

1356
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:27,521
Oh!

1357
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,426
Oh, I love you so much,
pumpkin.

1358
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,496
I love you more
than you'll ever know.

1359
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,869
How did I ever get
such a smart girl?

1360
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:45,172
(laughs) I don't know.
I guess I had a good teacher.

1361
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,110
Wait.
What about the show?

1362
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,279
( laughs )

1363
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:56,450
Today is about
celebrating your dreams,
not mine.

1364
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:03,123
Today my daughter
is getting married! Ha!

1365
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:09,129
Who are you
and what have you done
with my mother?
