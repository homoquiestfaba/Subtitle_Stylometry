<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

<i>Although I can assure you,
they'll be joining us very soon.</i>

19

Then it must be about
my best bouncing buddy, Tigger.

<i>Ah, Tigger's right in the
thick of things, as always.</i>

It certainly is a
beautiful day for it.

Me and Tigger are gonna find every
egg in the Hundred Acre Wood.

first come and eat your breakfast.

If I find any pink eggs,
I'm giving them to Piglet.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,568
The pink ones are his favorite.

How sweet of you!

gonna bring you a blue one,

Well, you better eat up then.

You can't hunt eggs
on an empty stomach.

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,121
That's what
Winnie the Pooh says, too.

52

And he's exactly right.

53

Just a little something
to help you find Eastery eggs.

First a compass, so you'll
know where you are.

61

A backpack for Eastery eggs.

Rope for whatnots,
and in case you don't need a knot.

forget this, little extra of that. Ah!

Yeah, we're supposed
to be celebrating...

117
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,364

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,244
aren't you forgetting something?

120
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,086
Your detailed list of chores and
duties. I've got it right here.

121
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,291
But, Rabbit, today's the day that
I always get my very special...

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,529
Mop and bucket,
that's right, Pooh.

123
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,763
Now, step lively, everyone.
Can't afford to dilly-dally.

124
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,842
You've got a lot of work to do.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,446
Ah, you fooled us good, Rabbit.

126
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,127
- Now, we can go celebrate...
- Enough chit-chat, Roo. [LAUGHS]

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,168
This is no time for fun and games.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,087
- No, no.
- But it's such a pretty day outside.

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,811
Yes, and it will be
just as pretty inside.

130
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,168
As long as you all do exactly

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,686
as I say.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,246
Oh, pay attention now, everyone.

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,891
The theme for this year is,

134
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,123
"Spic and Span for Spring."

135
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,487
Kinda catchy,
if I do say so myself.

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,168
Now, if you'd all direct your attention
to this scale model I've created.

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,642
Oh, please excuse
the rudimentary workmanship.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,610
I just threw it together
at the last minute.

139
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,205
When I give the signal,

140
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,204
you will disperse to your
assigned cleaning stations.

141
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,850
Tigger, Piglet, Pooh.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,163
You'll dust, sweep, mop and scrub.
And don't spare the soap.

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,163
You can never be too clean,
you know.

144
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,891
On the floor, go with the grain.
Always...

145
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,328
You don't suppose
this could be a honey pot?

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,765
Do you?

147
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,366
No, Pooh, I don't suppose.

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,484
Empty. Not even a smackerel.

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,122
And Eeyore, your job is to sweep
all the soot out of the chimney.

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,602
Thanks for noticing me.

151
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,762
[ECHOING]
I beg your pardon, Rabbit.

152
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,365
Yes. What is it, Pooh?

153
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,162
Well, this honey pot appears
to be rather, um,

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,046
empty.

155
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,203
That's because it's not
a honey pot, Pooh.

156
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,601
- It's a bucket.
- Oh, bother.

157
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,447
Because if it were a honey pot,
I should fill it with honey.

158
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,363
No, no, no honey!

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,762
Honey's no good
for anything but making messes!

160
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,285
And eating, Rabbit.

161
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,566
Doh!

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,203
Mm... On second thought, Pooh,

163
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,682
I'm going to promote
you to supervisor.

164
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,010
Hey! Congratulations,
Mr. Super-de-dupervisor!

165
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,570
Oh, how exciting, Pooh!

166
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,883
Yes, it is exciting!
[CHUCKLES]

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,130
What is a supervisor, Rabbit?

168
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,250
A supervisor is someone
who sits right here

169
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,085

All the colors are
in their proper order.

Well, maybe this is a
different kind of rainbow.

532

There's only one
kind of rainbow, Tigger.

Oh, it's flawless. Precise.

Why, it's an absolutely
perfect Easter.

547
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,965
And why shouldn't it be?

548
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,327
I was the Easter bunny.

549
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,404
Of course you were, Long Ears.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

550
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,246
It'd be kinda ridickerous to have
an Easter Tigger, wouldn't it?

551
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,930
Yes, it would,
as a matter of fact.

552
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,081
You see,
when I was the Easter bunny,

553
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,403
Easter was a sheer delight.

554
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,051
I created the plans and
organized the schedule,

555
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,845
and everyone did exactly
what I told them to do.

556
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,970
I loved being the Easter bunny.

Oh. Sounds like
you do miss Easter.

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,809
- What?
- It's okay. We all miss it.

559
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,530
Especially little Roo.

do not miss Easter.

Oh, but look. Look.

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,047
You used to love being
the Eastery bunny.

You were the head bunny in charge!

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,122
Yes, and that's why I liked it.

569
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,928
But I certainly
don't like it anymore.

570
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,604
But on account of why?

571
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,765
I had Roo's first Easter
planned to perfection,

572
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,650
until you had to get involved.

573
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,724
I remember it like it
was only last year.

574
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,002
It was only last year.

575
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,527

Um, Tigger,
what's an Eastery egg hunt?

594
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,244
Why, an Eastery egg
hunt is practically

the mostest fun a little
nipper can have is all!

596
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,050
Or even a big nipper, too!

597
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,966
- Are Easter eggs hard to catch?
- No. Hoo-hoo-hoo.

598
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,327
You just gotta have
the right technique.

First, you sneak up on 'em,

- Tigger.

everything he knows.

everything to be perfect.

Oh, come on, Rabbit.

619
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,041
He's really got his little
heart set on this.

620
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,327
Let him hunt just
one Eastery egg.

621
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,528
But they aren't even decorated yet.

622
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,888
You're right. We'll hunt them
first and decorate them later.

Good idea, Tigger!

624
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,321
Then we wouldn't have to worry about
grass stains on our colored eggs.

Have you all gone mad?

626
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,651
You can't possibly do
these things out of order.

it's not decorated.

We use the checklist, number one</i>

<i>Tie the ribbons,
stuff the baskets</i>

<i>When it's done</i>

637

<i>Then we count them out precisely
And we decorate them nicely</i>

We'll have fun</i>

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,562
A disaster in the making.

684
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,769
Yes, yes, that's it.

685
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,525
You were completely
out of control.

686
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,570
That's why I had
to put my foot down.

687
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,884
I think you all need a remedial
lesson on the rules of Easter!

688
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,930
There certainly are
an awful lot of rules, Rabbit.

689
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,562
I'm sorry. But I'm the Easter bunny,
so I make the rules!

690
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,887
And rule number one is,

691
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,887
the Easter egg hunt does not begin
until the Easter bunny says so!

692
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,362
That, of course, would be, uh...

693
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,051
Me.

694
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,806
Where did they get off to now?

695
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,206
- Found another!
- Good boy!

696
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,285
Oh, how pretty.

697
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,807
[ROO] Hey, look! Here's some more.
[EEYORE] Prettiest egg I ever saw.

Nice catch there, Roo boy.

701
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Just lucky, I guess!

702
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,687
Luck had nothing to do with it.

703

707
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,284

[ROO] Over there.

712

[ROO] Here's some more.

Mm, yes, and so much honey!
[CHUCKLES]

Roo boy, I think you're just about
the bestest Eastery egg hunter, ever!

719
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,687
And you gave me
the greatest Easter, Tigger!

720
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,481
So, I guess that makes you
the best Easter bunny ever.

- [ROO] Hooray for Tigger!

[EEYORE] Hooray.

one thing most of all.

733
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,690
You took that away from me.

Well, we... We never
meant to hurt you, Rabbit.

735
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,528
We were just trying to
give Roo a happy Easter.

736
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,406
I mean, didn't you want to
give him a happy Easter, too?

737
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,608
Go away, Tigger.

738
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,523
I want to be alone.

739

Well, I guess I better
tell Roo the bad news.

- We're getting ready for Easter!

Well, we were all out of eggs.

758

So we're hunting for
Easter rocks instead!

My goodness,
you've certainly been busy!

760

We're practicing,
so when Tigger gets back,

761
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,206
we'll be ready to go
on our Easter egg hunt.

762

it spring training.

We even made new decorations.

764
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,642
The old decorations kinda
got broken by Rabbit.

Oh. So, when does
the official celebration begin?

766
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,526
As soon as Tigger gets back
from Rabbit's.

767

Tigger?

774
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,407
Well, it's probably best
to get right to the point

in the most briefest and
directificated manner possible, so...

776

Um, the answer is no.

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,760
Does that mean
Rabbit's still not happy?

778
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,364
But, Why?

779
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,651
Well, you see, when we did
the Eastery egg hunt without him,

780
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,089
we took away Rabbit's most
special Eastery thing of all.

781

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,530
What's going on here?

1031
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,604
Easter! That's what!

1032
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,365
Now Tigger, [CLEARS THROAT]

1033
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,207
I thought perhaps you might
like to lead the Easter egg hunt!

1034
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,250
- But, Rabbit...
- No buts! I'm the Easter bunny,

1035
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,608
and I make the rules!
Rule number one is...

1036
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,682
There aren't any
rules about Easter!

1037
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,048
Now go, go have fun!
Go! Go! Go!

1038
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,088
[ROO] Everyone, wait!

1039
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,005
You can't have Easter!

1040
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,809
What I mean is...

1041
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,643
You can't have Easter

1042
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,643
without this.

1043
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,971
Is that my Easter bunny hat?

1044
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,809
For our one and only Easter bunny!

1045
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,210
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- [CHEERING]

1046
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,645
Hooray for Ra-Ra!

1047
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,521
I came here this morning to
give you a very special Easter.

1048
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,681
But,

1049
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,926
you've given me
the grandest Easter ever!

1050
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,086
Now, what do you say
we go hunt some Easter eggs?

1051
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,845
- Think you can teach me?
- Yeah! Come on!

1052
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,207
First you sneak up on 'em,

1053
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,686
and then you bounce!

1054
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,724
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1055
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,644
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1056
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,602
Pooh Bear!
What happened to Rabbit?

1057
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,650
Well, I would like to explain.

1058
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,404
But I can't.

1059
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,769
You see, Rabbit isn't who he was
on the holiday that wasn't,

1060
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,401
and he is who he wasn't
on the holiday that was.

1061
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,801
So there you have it,

1062
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,968
if you see what I mean.

1063
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,724
Which we don't.

1064
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,765
Oh, well, what I mean is,
he's the Easter bunny!

1065
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,889
<i>'Cause what I like
most about Easter</i>

1066
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,930
<i>Is the way we show
our pals that we care</i>

1067
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,368
<i>For the fun never ends
When you give to your friends</i>

1068
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,643
<i>[ALL]
And you share the wonder of</i>

1069
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,042
<i>A bright and sunny honey
of an Easter!</i>

1070
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,329
<i>With painted eggs and
jellybeans too!</i>

1071
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,563
<i>Of all the fun and neat stuff
The candy and the sweet stuff</i>

1072
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,450
<i>My favorite Easter
wish'll come true</i>

1073
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,165
<i>When we share this Easter day</i>

1074
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,564
<i>With you!</i>

1075
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,408
Oh! [SNIFFLES]
I just love a hoppy ending.

1076
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,085
<i>[NARRATOR] And so,</i>

1077
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,004
<i>they all hopped off together</i>

1078
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,209
<i>on this grandest Easter ever</i>

1079
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,527
<i>in the Hundred Acre Wood.</i>

1080
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,524
B-B-F-N! Bye-bye for now!
