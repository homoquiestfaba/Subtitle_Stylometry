1
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:40,733
(howling)

2
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,000
(squeaking)

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,767
(wind blowing)

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,533
(groaning)

5
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,900
So. It begins.

6
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,200
(chanting)

7
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Alright, alright, enough.

8
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,400
(door squeaks open)

9
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,433
(chanting)

10
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,467
-Zack: Mom. 
-Jeffy: Jim.

11
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,767
-Zack: Mom. 
-Jeffy: Dad.

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,533
(laughing)

13
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,267
What are you laughing at?

14
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,700
Mom, this really blows.

15
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,133
I was going to be in the
nationals, I have a girlfriend.

16
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,600
You don't have a girlfriend...

17
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,533
Well, almost a girlfriend

18
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,900
as good as a girlfriend...
That's right, you know

19
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,733
Zack, it's not
the end of the world.

20
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,233
You'll make friends
in the city...

21
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,733
and I'm sure their
fencing program

22
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,267
is much more advanced
than it could ever be here.

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,133
Zack: But it's not my team.

24
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,200
I probably can't even
get in this late in the year.

25
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,633
Ah, did it ever occur to you
to consult me before

26
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,367
making this huge decision?

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,567
Zack: What did you think? 
 You could demolish our lives,

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,833
and everything would be peachy?

29
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,333
Well, I don't mind moving...

30
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,067
-Zack: Shut up, Jeffy
-Jim: Zack!

31
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,567
-Honey...
-No, Gail, enough coddling him.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,533
Zack, we've given you
a pretty free reign so far

33
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,867
to let you grow
and I see now why

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,733
that hasn't been so wise.

35
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,467
It's given you
a serious attitude problem.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Dad, no...

37
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,700
We're moving
for the good of this family

38
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,933
and, as to your say
in the matter,

39
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,933
Dad: frankly, 
 you don't have one.

40
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,667
-Zack: Mom? 
-Gail: He's right, Zack...

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,867
We're moving regardless.

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,567
Gail: You might as well 
 make it easy on us.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,733
Zack: Yeah, well 
 that's just great.

44
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,233
I can't believe this.

45
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,833
I never knew you
guys were total fascists.

46
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,067
Zack!

47
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,867
Jim: Let him go, Gail. It's time
for him to grow up a bit.

48
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,800
May I please be excused?

49
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:21,467
(tense music)

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,700
(jaunty music)

51
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,200
Zack, wait up.

52
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,833
Where did I leave my sand?

53
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,733
(grunting)

54
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,200
No, not there.

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,867
Ah, that's where that went.

56
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,433
(groaning)

57
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,600
Grave dust.

58
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,067
Grave dust.

59
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,633
(spluttering)

60
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,667
Grave dust that is not.

61
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,567
Grave dust,

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,633
grave dust and tail of lizard.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,433
(whooshing)

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,133
Suil immale.

65
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,867
(metal clanging)

66
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,900
Kay: He'll only mess
things up for me.

67
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,133
Sir Ector: Nonsense!

68
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,367
Arthur! Arthur boy,
come over here.

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,167
Yes, father?

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,833
How'd you like to come with us
to London tomorrow,

71
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,167
help Kay with his gear?

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Sir Ector:
 He'll be knighted Palm Sunday,

73
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,600
and he will need some help 
 for the jousts.

74
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,967
I can be a page?

75
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,700
You do well tomorrow
and we'll see...

76
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,133
Oh, Father, thank you.

77
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,300
Kay, I will not let you down,
I promise.

78
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,333
(yelling)

79
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:48,300
(chanting)

80
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,633
Merchant: Knives, 
 handmade knives,

81
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,633
come and buy my
handmade knives.

82
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,833
Merchant 2: Blankets,
beautiful wool blankets.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,600
(whinnying)

84
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,767
Lovely woodwork!

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,867
Come and see
my lovely woodwork.

86
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,800
We are getting too far back,

87
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,100
forward.

88
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,400
We are getting
ahead of ourselves.

89
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,533
What to pack?

90
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,800
Mix them together,

91
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,067
that should do it.

92
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,933
Now...

93
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,733
(bats squeaking)

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,267
(whipping)

95
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,967
(whipping)

96
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,633
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

97
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:55,367
Yeah well, you shouldn't try
to kill everyone who does.

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Zack: What do you want, Jeffy?

99
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,967
Just leave me alone.

100
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,433
Jeffy: Zack, come on,

101
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,733
it's not that bad.

102
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,133
You'll still have me...

103
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,367
Thrilled, I'm sure.

104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,467
Plus, the city will be cool.

105
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,700
We can go to all the museums
take taxicabs,

106
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,900
play basketball.

107
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,467
We can play
basketball here, goof.

108
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,067
Hey, don't call me a goof, yeah?

109
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Then leave me alone.

110
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,067
-Fine.
-Fine.

111
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,333
I thought you were leaving.

112
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,133
I'm leaving you alone. OK?

113
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,367
(Zack sighing)

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,867
This just...

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,167
-Blows?
-Big time.

116
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,400
You know, Jeffy, I like it here.

117
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,800
Now I know
how things work and...

118
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,900
I feel like I was
just getting control.

119
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,233
I wish...

120
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,167
Huh? Wish what?

121
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,867
I wish it were
a different time...

122
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,167
Like when?

123
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,233
The time of chivalry.

124
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,067
The time when your skill

125
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,533
with a sword mattered.

126
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,333
Then, things were easier.

127
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,267
Everything was easier.

128
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,933
Easier how?

129
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,733
Zack: Simpler.
I mean, everything was black,

130
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,100
white and simple.

131
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,900
There was honor,
and there was evil.

132
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,800
Everyone knew
what they were fighting for.

133
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,767
I'm 15.

134
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
At 15,
I wouldn't have to live my life

135
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,433
according to Mom and Dad.

136
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,367
Zack: There weren't any
corporate takeovers

137
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,733
or transfers or moving.

138
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:19,433
Man, I'd be master
of my own destiny.

139
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,967
Zack: By 15, I... You know,
I'd be a page.

140
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,167
I'd be a squire by now.

141
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,500
What's that?

142
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,967
Zac: It's the second step
in becoming a knight.

143
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,567
First you are a page, right.

144
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
You know, you do errands
for all the knights.

145
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,867
Then, you become a squire,

146
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,633
you're assigned to one knight.

147
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,700
You follow him into battles
and you carry his gear.

148
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,100
Like a caddy?

149
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,667
Yeah. Sort of.

150
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,600
Anyway, I'd be, going places,
anywhere I wanted.

151
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:48,067
Mom and Dad, they couldn't
do anything about it.

152
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,333
I'd be a killer knight too.

153
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:54,067
-Fight jousts, rescue damsels...
-Damsels?

154
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,100
You know... babes.

155
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,800
Yeah... babes...

156
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,867
I could be one of
King Arthurs's knights,

157
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,000
fight for honor and peace,

158
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,300
sit at the Round Table
in Camelot.

159
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,867
Now you've lost me.

160
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,667
(sighing)

161
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,833
Forget it. Get lost.

162
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,267
Dad's right.

163
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,633
You've got a serious
attitude problem.

164
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,233
Never mind. I'll go.

165
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,667
(whipping)

166
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,067
Zack, come on.
I didn't mean it.

167
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,400
I was just... Zack, wait up.

168
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:29,567
(Morgause chanting)

169
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,067
(chanting)

170
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,300
(chuckling)

171
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:45,500
It's working! It's working!

172
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,033
(laughing)

173
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,367
Jeffy: Zack, where are you?

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,700
(whipping)

175
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:03,167
(bird cawing)

176
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,067
It's warm.

177
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
(panpipes)

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,833
(plays jaunty tune)

179
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,533
(wind blowing)

180
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
(wind increasing)

181
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,367
Jeffy?

182
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,467
(bird cawing)

183
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,900
(distant screaming)

184
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,433
-You recognize that.
-The Sword in the stone.

185
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,800
Cool.

186
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,633
Come on. Get a little closer.

187
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,233
"Whose pulleth out
this sword of this stone...

188
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:07,167
and anvil is rightwise
King born of all England."

189
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
It's THE sword in THE stone.

190
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,600
Give it a tug.

191
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,767
You know you want to.

192
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:21,800
(chanting)

193
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:28,633
(chanting continues)

194
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:35,700
(chanting)

195
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,733
(chanting)

196
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,867
(Zack gasps)

197
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,200
No way...

198
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:52,767
My brother!

199
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,133
My brother has pulled the sword
from the stone!

200
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,467
Run, tell everyone,

201
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,700
there is a King
once again in England!

202
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,700
But, wait, wait,
I'm not... I didn't...

203
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,067
(excited yelling)

204
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,500
Why not?

205
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:12,067
Yeah, this is definitely cool.

206
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:16,733
(fanfare)

207
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,267
Something's wrong.

208
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,433
Something is very, very wrong.

209
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:27,400
Hail King Zackary.
Hurray!

210
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,067
Hurray!

211
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,633
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

212
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,633
How could I forget
his stupid sword!

213
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,700
Excuse me, excuse me.

214
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:42,200
Stupid. I've never... Stupid...
Excuse me. Excuse me.

215
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,700
Pardon me? Pardon me?

216
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:44,867
Pardon me!

217
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,333
Thunderation, man,
will you move?

218
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,367
This is an emergency...

219
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,867
Oh, pardon me, sir.

220
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,600
Um, what's the ruckus?

221
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,500
Somebody's pulled the sword

222
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,733
from the stone.

223
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,067
England has a king again.

224
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,767
Hurray.

225
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,367
Hurray.

226
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Hurray.

227
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,200
Hurray.

228
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:20,367
Arthur,
something is terribly wrong.

229
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,900
Out of my way, old man.

230
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,533
Where are you going
with that sword?

231
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,333
This is my brother's sword and
I have to get it to him at once.

232
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,733
But, but...
What about the other one?

233
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,933
-The one in the square?
-What, are you daft?

234
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:32,333
This is my brother's sword.

235
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,467
Besides, someone's already
pulled the sword from the stone.

236
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,167
Now out of my way,
you lunatic.

237
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,467
This can't be... wait.

238
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,467
No, really, it was nothing.

239
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Please stand up.

240
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,467
Just let me handle everything.

241
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,200
Who are you, anyway?

242
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,067
I'm your fairy godmother.

243
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,667
Good enough for me.

244
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,300
Morgause: England has a King!

245
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,133
King Zackary!

246
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,567
Long live King Zackary!

247
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,967
Long live King Zackary!

248
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,100
Hurray...

249
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,433
Long live King Zackary!

250
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:09,500
This is a fraud.
No one king rules England!

251
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,700
Certainly not this boy!

252
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,967
King Carados,
and your fellow kings...

253
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,300
Morgause: Uriens, Claudus,

254
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,833
Nentres, Agwisanco,

255
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,633
will you not swear fealty

256
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,667
to the true king of England?

257
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,533
We will never serve
another king,

258
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,067
let alone a fraud.

259
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,233
People!

260
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:28,233
We have a king
and Excalibur has proven him so!

261
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,733
Defend your king!

262
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,167
Get him.

263
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
This way.

264
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,300
(horse whinnying)

265
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:40,533
(confused yelling)

266
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,900
Leevia.
The king is in danger.

267
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,167
Stop them.

268
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
What was that all about?

269
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,200
There was bound to
be a little rebellion,

270
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,467
I didn't expect it so soon.

271
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,233
At least
the people didn't buy it.

272
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:03,067
Zack: What uh, what now?

273
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,133
Morgause: I know
another way out. Come on.

274
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,167
Now!

275
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,067
Where are they?

276
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,767
-Who, sire?
-The girl and the boy.

277
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,133
Which girl and which boy?

278
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,367
The boy who pulled
the sword from the stone!

279
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,667
-Oh, that one.
-Claudus: Yes.

280
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,467
-What about him?
-Where is he?

281
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,833
I don't know, sire.

282
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,867
(confused yelling)

283
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,100
Man: Where are you going
you fools?

284
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,300
We must go home,

285
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,300
Claudus: and come back
more sufficiently prepared.

286
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,433
We must gather the armies.

287
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:41,733
Out the back.

288
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,433
Come, to the castle.

289
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:00,533
(Medieval music)

290
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,133
Not too shabby.

291
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,900
You will forgive my brother,

292
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,133
he is yet unfamiliar

293
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,767
with the niceties of being king.

294
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,100
They cannot eat until you do.

295
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,700
Oh. Let's see about a fork.

296
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,967
Eat something.

297
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,067
Mmm...

298
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:33,933
(clearing throat)

299
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,067
You may begin.

300
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,167
(drink being poured)

301
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,767
No, thanks.

302
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,333
Zack: I mean,
I'm trying to cut back.

303
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,800
Do you have any...
let's see,

304
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,767
what do you people drink here?

305
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,967
Mead.

306
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,533
May I have some mead?

307
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,267
(Zack chuckling)

308
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,133
Zack: Gross.

309
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:14,433
Yeah, Martha Stewart
would not be pleased.

310
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,733
I can't believe this worked.

311
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,933
What worked?

312
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:19,867
Mead.

313
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:22,967
Zack: Thank you.

314
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,467
This castle is known

315
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,467
for the excellence
of its mead, sir.

316
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,333
Um, yes, I can see that.

317
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,333
Don't you people drink anything
but alcohol?

318
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,367
How about some uh, milk?

319
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,433
Zack: You know, leche ,

320
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,900
comes from a cow.

321
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,733
It does the body good.

322
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,233
His Majesty would
like some milk.

323
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,433
Please be good enough
to fetch it for him.

324
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,067
Aide: Of course.

325
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:50,167
So where is the suckling pig?

326
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,300
There's always supposed
to be nice juicy pigs here...

327
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,100
Zack: Big old apple
in their mouths.

328
00:19:56,167 --> 00:20:00,767
Whatever. Okay.
So, what worked?

329
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,567
Don't worry.
You'll know soon enough...

330
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,733
Morgause: In the meantime,
Gwynneth will do nicely

331
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,800
as your handmaid.
There she is at the foot

332
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,467
of the table waving.

333
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,000
Does it get any warmer here?

334
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,033
What do you want?
It is a castle.

335
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,867
You want a cozy cottage
go back to being a peasant.

336
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Drink some mead,
it'll warm you up.

337
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,667
No, thanks.

338
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,833
I was thinking that
after the coronation,

339
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,167
we should have a banquet.

340
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,100
A banquet? What is this?

341
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,767
Morgause: This is just supper.

342
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,267
Zack: Will there be roast pig?

343
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,400
Morgause:
You are the strangest boy.

344
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,633
I'm not a boy.
How old are you?

345
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,800
Do they ever
clean the floors in here?

346
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,300
They just cleaned it last month

347
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,433
besides it won't be Autumn
cleaning for a while yet.

348
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,667
I was thinking
that I should be the one

349
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,967
to appoint the guards too.

350
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,767
Morgause: I'm an excellent
judge of character.

351
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,333
But who are you, really?

352
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,233
I told you, I'm your fairy...

353
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,967
Godmother... Yes. I know.

354
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,833
That really clears
things up for me.

355
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,667
I am called Maeve,
by those that know me.

356
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,133
Zack: So Maeve, tell me

357
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,667
why am I going along
with you being my sister?

358
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,600
Because I made you king.

359
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,100
Hey, I don't know
where you were at the time

360
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:20,200
but I was the one who pulled
the sword from the stone...

361
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,200
Zack: Why should I take orders
from you?

362
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:26,067
Because I am the one
who made it happen.

363
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,533
Okay...

364
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,500
But tomorrow... more jousts...

365
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:30,833
Real jousts?

366
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,567
Morgause: We can start
choosing knights

367
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,767
for your court.

368
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,333
Now, it is time for
you to go to bed. Gwynneth!

369
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,467
Will you be kind

370
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
and show King Zackary
to his bed chambers?

371
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,867
Yes, madam,

372
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,100
it would be my pleasure.

373
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,600
Now then,
Your Majesty, shall we?

374
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,967
Oh, yeah...

375
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,633
This is sweet.

376
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:28,667
(distant music)

377
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,833
(music getting louder)

378
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,267
(Gwynneth gasping)

379
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,433
I think you're not quite ready
for that yet.

380
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,433
What was
that terrible contraption?

381
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:46,600
Uh, it's a CD player.

382
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,567
Pop in a CD and press play.

383
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,333
The music goes up
in to the ear phones.

384
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,900
It's a piece of magic
I brought from my home.

385
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,933
Well, I hope you
will feel comfortable

386
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,633
making this your home,
Your Majesty.

387
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,400
Please... just call me Zack.

388
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:06,367
Ooooh... isn't he
just the sweetest little King,

389
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,500
he wants me
to call him a nickname.

390
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,433
Okay, Zack it is.

391
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:11,867
But only in private.

392
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,300
In front of everyone else,

393
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,867
it's Your Majesty.

394
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
We don't want anyone thinking

395
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,300
that I've overstepped
my station.

396
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,733
What are you doing?

397
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,067
I'm just getting
you ready for bed, dearie.

398
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,100
Don't squirm so...

399
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,567
Well, stop it...

400
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,867
That's a royal order!

401
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:32,367
Gwynneth... I'm sorry.

402
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,067
No, I can undress myself,
it's okay.

403
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,467
Why don't you just go to bed.

404
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,800
Everything is fine. It's cool.

405
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,367
I'm good, okay?

406
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,867
-OK.
-Good night.

407
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,067
-Good night.
-Good night.

408
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,633
-Good night.
-Goodbye.

409
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,567
Zack:
You're not sleeping in here?

410
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,533
I am your handmaid, sir.

411
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,767
I must be at your side
at all times.

412
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,633
I don't think so...

413
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,167
It's your sister's orders,
Your Majesty.

414
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,067
Well I order differently...

415
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,800
She is still
older than you, sir,

416
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,800
and until the coronation
I must do as she says.

417
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,867
Okay, okay. Whatever.

418
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,333
Good night.

419
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,900
(thunder)

420
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,100
Zack: Oh, man.

421
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,567
Either I'm having one
messed up dream

422
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,300
or I have gone completely
round the bend insane.

423
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,300
Gwynneth: Pardon me,
Your Majesty?

424
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,133
Good night, Gwynneth.

425
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Put me on... Sure.

426
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,333
Okay...

427
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,567
(whooshing)

428
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,500
Zack: Whoa. I'm invisible.

429
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,467
Zack: Quick! Hide!

430
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,133
It goes well, my darling.

431
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:42,867
Well, Miss Maeve.
Miss Morgause.

432
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,633
Lady Morgause.

433
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,667
Queen Morgause.

434
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,067
(chuckling)

435
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:54,167
This was so much easier
than I thought it would be.

436
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,733
Now let's just get that brat

437
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,067
crowned before
Merlin can interfere.

438
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:11,533
(intense music)

439
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:17,567
(howling)

440
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,233
Good. Good work.

441
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,833
At least I think so.

442
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:28,867
Boy, are you out there or not?

443
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,067
Zack: Right here.

444
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,967
Merlin: Well,
thundering typhoons, boy,

445
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,167
take off the cloak
so I can see you.

446
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:40,067
Merlin: Get inside.
Come in here, boy.

447
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,967
We have things to discuss.

448
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,533
Are you... are you...

449
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,833
Tired? Angry?

450
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:55,367
Are you Merlin the magician?

451
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,833
What gave me away,

452
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,900
the cloak of invisibility
or was it the beard?

453
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:01,633
Oh, Merlin... Mr. Merlin... man,

454
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,600
I am very pleased to meet you,
I am a big fan.

455
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,633
Yes, and the boy
who has muddled things terribly.

456
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,267
You know,
one thing's bothered me though.

457
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,767
If you could see in the future

458
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,700
then, why can't you fix things?

459
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,300
I mean couldn't you make
things go better for Arthur?

460
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,200
Will you please just be quiet?
I mean just listen to yourself.

461
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,367
This is great.

462
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,233
I can't believe
I am actually standing here

463
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,367
talking to Merlin.

464
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:30,533
lf I'm king here,

465
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,067
you could be my advisor, right?

466
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh, I give up.

467
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,933
I mean, I don't know exactly
what I'm doing here.

468
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,267
That much is apparent.

469
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,800
Now, silence.

470
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,767
(mumbling)

471
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Merlin: What I can't understand

472
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,667
is how anyone
could change destiny.

473
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,267
Don't bother.

474
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
Merlin: You see, my boy.

475
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:54,233
Everything that will happen

476
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:57,700
has already happened,
in a way.

477
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:00,433
You see, my boy,
it is all a matter of destiny.

478
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,267
I have mine, you have yours,

479
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,867
and Arthur has his.

480
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,633
Except the tricky bit now

481
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,733
is that Arthur
no longer has his,

482
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,600
thanks to you.

483
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,667
Merlin: Do you understand
what I am saying here?

484
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,600
Your pulling the sword
from that stone

485
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,833
has altered the
course of all history.

486
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:21,500
Not even I can predict
what will happen now.

487
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,833
No, this is not a dream.

488
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:25,533
This is a very harsh

489
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,667
and terrible reality.

490
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,500
And I don't know
how it happened.

491
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,467
But there we are.

492
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,733
Our challenge now is

493
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,333
to set things back on track.

494
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:37,500
Merlin: First of all,

495
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:40,333
how did you pull that sword
from that stone?

496
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,600
What kind of sorcerer are you?

497
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,633
(frustrated mumbling)

498
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,100
Merlin: You must have had help.

499
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,067
And very powerful help indeed.

500
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,067
Would that we all
could change destiny.

501
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:52,200
I wouldn't have to spend
eight centuries

502
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,633
locked in an oak
and Arthur, well...

503
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,867
Arthur definitely deserves
an easier fate.

504
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,967
Don't you think
I'd do something if I could?

505
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,567
Well. just take it off boy.

506
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,367
(sarcastic chuckling)

507
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,700
Thank you.

508
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:10,533
-Now...
-Now, first of all,

509
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:12,133
I did not do this, alright?

510
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,400
Zack: Enough already.

511
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,067
Will you let me finish?

512
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,433
There is this bitter,

513
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:20,467
bossy, freaky chick who actually
turns out to be Morgause.

514
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,567
Yeah, that's right,
Arthur's half sister

515
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,900
who later screws him over and

516
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,800
well, you know the rest
of the story better than I do.

517
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,300
Anyway,
the chick is like totally

518
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,633
psyched to get me
crowned this Sunday,

519
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:32,833
I don't know,
supposed to make this

520
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:35,533
whole mess stick or
something like that.

521
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,567
Very clever.

522
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,833
Yeah, well.
Anyway secondly...

523
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:43,233
Zack: I am totally sorry about
this like, major disaster

524
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:44,767
I seem to have caused here...

525
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,533
If I knew what was going on

526
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,733
I'd have left that
stupid sword in the stone

527
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,067
for Arthur to pull out.

528
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,267
Those things are heavy anyway,

529
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,467
I don't know
how they fight with them.

530
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,867
Thirdly,
if you are supposed

531
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,400
to knew the future, well, dude,
why didn't you see this coming?

532
00:29:57,433 --> 00:30:00,000
Because destiny
has been changed.

533
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,067
Because destiny
has been changed.
I don't know
what will happen next.

534
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,733
I don't know
what will happen next.

535
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,267
Oh, dear. Morgause.

536
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
I mean,
who would've thought it?

537
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,833
I mean, she's only a girl yet.

538
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,667
How can she have the power?

539
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,333
We are in a great deal
of trouble here.

540
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,533
You see, my boy,

541
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,900
anything in good magic,

542
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:21,633
that is magic
that works at one with nature,

543
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,033
has the power to change
destiny or history

544
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,567
That applies to the past
as well as the future.

545
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,100
Only very particular forces

546
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,333
of evil can interfere.

547
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,833
Morgause is too young

548
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:37,400
to have these powers unless

549
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,800
she got a hold of
the Dark Book .

550
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,633
The what book?

551
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:42,967
The Dark Book.

552
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,833
It's a very ancient book indeed.

553
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,767
Merlin: It holds such powers
of evil

554
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,567
that it was banished
to a forgotten place

555
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,433
by a very wise wizard

556
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,900
hundreds of years ago.

557
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:55,333
Merlin: Now, we've got to

558
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:58,300
get you back to the castle
before she suspects.

559
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,433
Tomorrow we will
get a hold of Arthur...

560
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:03,133
Merlin: And we must,
we have very little time.

561
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,867
What happens if I am crowned?

562
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,533
If you're crowned,
you'll be crowned

563
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,633
in front of most of London.
Restoring Arthur to the throne

564
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,467
after that would be
near impossible.

565
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
And I couldn't get back home?

566
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,833
You'd be too busy
ruling England, my boy.

567
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,933
We can't have you
just disappearing...

568
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,167
Who could succeed
after a scandal like that?

569
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,500
Arthur'd be accused of murder
before they'd let him

570
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:25,867
take the throne.

571
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,133
Look, I've obviously
screwed things up here

572
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,800
like it or not.

573
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:33,433
Zack: I will stick around
and I'll help as best as I can.

574
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,167
How generous.

575
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,833
And when things are all fixed,

576
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,067
I'll go home.

577
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,700
Zack: You can send me home?

578
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,933
There, this should do it.

579
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,400
What are we gonna do
when we find Arthur?

580
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,600
Help him to regain his destiny.

581
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:49,067
Now, goodnight.

582
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,633
Now, keep your eyes open

583
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,300
for an ancient book
you'll know it when you see it.

584
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,967
And if you do find it,
bring it to me.

585
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,767
Okay, but...

586
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,333
back to the getting
me home thing...

587
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,067
Zack: You can get me home,
right?

588
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,533
I mean, I have a
fencing tournament next week...

589
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,200
Zack: I have things to do...
(echoing)

590
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,367
I certainly hope so, my boy

591
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,800
but I don't quite see how.

592
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,133
Zack: Not to mention...

593
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,167
(gasping)

594
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,733
(chuckling)

595
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,133
Nice seeing you, Merlin.

596
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:27,200
OK, I help him out,
he sends me home.

597
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,400
That's easy enough.

598
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,667
I mean,
he is Merlin after all, right?

599
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,367
Yeah...

600
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
(bird cawing loudly)

601
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:41,367
Now... to practice.

602
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,967
I master this book

603
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,867
and I won't need any pesky kid
to help me rule the land.

604
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,300
Invisibility. Love potions.

605
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:11,200
Aaaah...
the Spell of the Making.

606
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,933
(chanting)

607
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,500
(screeching)

608
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,833
We'll leave that one
until later.

609
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,900
Here is an easy one.

610
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,767
Wind.

611
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,267
(chanting)

612
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,800
(wind blowing, chanting)

613
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:38,933
(gasping)

614
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,833
(chanting)

615
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,233
Important lesson number one.

616
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:55,300
Learn the undoing of a spell
before the doing of one.

617
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:01,200
(rooster calling)

618
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:04,967
(birds tweeting)

619
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,200
Get up, you sleepyhead,

620
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,800
there are things to do.

621
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,533
I wasn't dreaming.

622
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:16,067
Now, I've laid out your clothes

623
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,700
as you seem to
hate to be dressed,

624
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:20,267
and I'll wait
behind the curtain until you do.

625
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,967
It's freezing in here.

626
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:24,467
All the more reason
to get dressed.

627
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,067
Can I take a shower?

628
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,067
A what?

629
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,300
Bathe myself...
maybe wash my face

630
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,833
or brush my teeth.

631
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,133
Why, dearie,

632
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,300
it's a long way until Saturday,

633
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,433
Gwynneth: and Saturday's
bath day in this castle

634
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:40,967
As for your teeth,

635
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,200
you're young yet.

636
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,467
They won't be giving you
trouble for years.

637
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,567
Well.

638
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,733
(mumbling)

639
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,267
Ew...

640
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,167
I think I will go
for a ride this morning.

641
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,967
You have things to tend to here.

642
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,067
And I'll go for a ride.

643
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,567
You are needed
at the castle today, sire.

644
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,867
Why don't you back off
for the morning, Maeve.

645
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,300
I am going for a ride
and if you don't like that

646
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,733
Zack: I'll have to raise
such a stink that...

647
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,133
Listen, you little...

648
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,600
I will be back in a few hours.

649
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,133
I promise.

650
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,067
All right, then you may go.

651
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,200
But be back by three bells.

652
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,800
There will be jousts to watch.

653
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:47,500
Then I'll back. Thanks, Maeve.

654
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,367
Cassian, will you take
His Majesty for a ride today?

655
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,633
Cassian: Yes, ma'am.

656
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:54,700
(horse whinnying)

657
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,500
Cassian: I think Ginny
will do well, Your Majesty...

658
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,600
She's strong and fast
and gentle as a lamb.

659
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:07,167
Very nice.
Cassian, could you...well

660
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,967
I've never really ridden before.

661
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,500
Never ridden, Your Majesty?

662
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,433
My family lives in...

663
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:16,667
Uh... We grew up very poor.

664
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,200
Zack: The only horse on our farm
was a workhorse.

665
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,333
Of course, Your Majesty.

666
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:23,200
I forget that you grew up
as one of us.

667
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,400
So, first thing to remember.

668
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,900
Always the mount from the left.

669
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,300
OK.

670
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,967
Cassian: Whose horse is this?

671
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,567
I've not seen him before.

672
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,667
Yeah, he's a beaut.

673
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:44,900
Yeah, I think
I'll take this horse.

674
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,867
Cassian: But I am not sure to
whom it belongs.

675
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,133
I will ride this horse.

676
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,733
Yes, Your Majesty.

677
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,567
-Whoa!
-Cassian: Sire!

678
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,333
Oh, great, Cassian.
Lose the king...

679
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,900
Merlin: Well, don't I get
a good morning at least?

680
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,900
Merlin?
I thought you sent me

681
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,933
the horse or something.
Where are we going?

682
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,467
Patience,
you'll see soon enough.

683
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,833
-Merlin?
-What now?

684
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,367
How can you see the future?

685
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,933
You really want to know that?

686
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,333
-Yeah.
-It doesn't interest you

687
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:24,200
in the least that I can shift
my shape into animals?

688
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,633
It does, but I dunno

689
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,167
the whole future thing
interests me.

690
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,667
It's what made you
so useful to Arthur.

691
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,733
Listen well,

692
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:32,833
I am only going to
explain this once.

693
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,900
For me, what's hard
is seeing the past,

694
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,233
not the future.

695
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,100
You've lost me already.

696
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,867
I had the ill fortune to be

697
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,967
put onto this earth
living backwards.

698
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:44,900
So seeing the future is no trick

699
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:46,500
as it is really my past.

700
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,667
It is remembering
what happened yesterday

701
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,600
that gets me all befuddled.

702
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,933
Then why do you walk
and talk forwards?

703
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:54,933
Don't get all
technical on me, boy.

704
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,300
It is what it is.

705
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,267
Ah!

706
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,833
Remind me never to do
that one again.

707
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,167
Oh, my poor old bones.

708
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,367
That was awesome.

709
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,667
Well, gee golly whillikers

710
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,400
aren't we having so much fun.

711
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,867
Come on, my boy,

712
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,133
we have work to do.

713
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,667
I went to Arthur
to try to explain

714
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,200
he won't have any of it.

715
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,233
He doesn't believe me.

716
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:40,900
Did you find that book?

717
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:43,267
I haven't had the chance
to look yet.

718
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,733
Well, that's just wonderful.

719
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,500
Why not put it off another day
let the entire country wither

720
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,967
under a reign of evil.

721
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:51,200
It'll be hard enough
getting him on the throne,

722
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:54,333
I can't do it without his help.

723
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,767
We've only got four days

724
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,433
before the entire kingdom

725
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,633
recognizes you as its King.

726
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,400
Zack: What do we do
about those

727
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,200
who already think I am king?

728
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:05,567
I'm working on that, my boy.

729
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,100
All right, well,
I'll just go to Arthur

730
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,533
and convince him.

731
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,267
Of course you can accomplish

732
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,633
so much more
than feeble old Merlin

733
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,167
impudent pipsqueak.

734
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:17,700
He'll be king

735
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,800
and I'll be home by Sunday

736
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,633
but not before some jousts.

737
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:27,500
(horse grunting)

738
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,200
Arthur: It was just one
stupid mistake,

739
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,533
I had all that other
stuff to carry.

740
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,667
So what if I forgot
the stupid sword?

741
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,867
I got it to him in time
for the joust, didn't I?

742
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,067
You know,
if Kay weren't such a pig,

743
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,067
Arthur: I'd be a full page
by now.

744
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:43,833
Now let me do the talking.

745
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

746
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,733
Arthur: Instead I'm cleaning up

747
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:52,067
after you and
all your friends all afternoon

748
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,633
when I should be out training.

749
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,867
Oh, it's you again.

750
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,567
Why don't you go away?
You crazy old man. I'm busy.

751
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,333
A little more gently, please.

752
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,533
You have no idea

753
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,800
how sensitive the back
gets around the saddle.

754
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,933
What would you know?

755
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,400
Trust me, I know.

756
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:15,433
Arthur. Hi, man,
it's so cool to meet you

757
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,633
I just wish things
weren't so crazy

758
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,300
-Who are you?
-I am Zack.

759
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,233
I'm the guy
who kinda screwed things up.

760
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:23,567
What things?

761
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,333
I pulled the sword
from the stone.

762
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:29,533
Oh, Your Majesty. I'm sorry,
I didn't know you'd be so young.

763
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,233
I am just a teenager
like yourself.

764
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:33,233
Get up, already.
I should bow for you.

765
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,300
What do you mean?

766
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,300
You were supposed to
be the guy who...

767
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,567
Oh, please don't tell me

768
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,867
you've been listening
to this old man. He's crazy.

769
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,067
No, a little tense maybe,

770
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,467
but not crazy.

771
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,967
But look I understand,

772
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,400
things are a little loco here.

773
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,733
But trust me,
he's a powerful wizard

774
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,700
he will your advisor
and you'll be king.

775
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,300
You are insane,

776
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,633
you're both completely insane.

777
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,100
See, there is bad mojo
involved here.

778
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:00,800
and your sister actually...

779
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,067
Zackary, let's not divulge.

780
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,067
I don't have any sister.

781
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,733
You do, you just don't know
about it yet, all right?

782
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,733
Sir Ector is not your real dad.

783
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,167
Now you are talking
as crazy as the old man.

784
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,233
Ector is my father.

785
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:15,200
Kay is my brother.
It's that simple.

786
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:18,133
I've got a lot of work to do
between now and supper.

787
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll get it for sure
if it doesn't get done.

788
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:21,933
So, excuse me,
Your Majesty.

789
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:25,333
You gotta listen to me, man.
We don't have much time.

790
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:28,667
Kay! Kay, come here
I need your help.

791
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,900
I think, we better go.

792
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,167
But he's not hearing me

793
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,933
Come on, Zackary, let's go.

794
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,900
It's enough for today.

795
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,933
(magical whooshing)

796
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,267
What? What's wrong?

797
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,233
Nothing.

798
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,767
Nothing.

799
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,933
(eerie music)

800
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,833
An enslaving spell.

801
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:59,800
This is just what I need.

802
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,333
Man, I wish I had
that invisible thing now.

803
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:41,633
(door creaking)

804
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,333
Right on.

805
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,867
This castle is phat!

806
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,867
(Morgause chanting in distance)

807
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:52,533
(chanting getting louder)

808
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:01,733
(chanting)

809
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,600
(chanting)

810
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:17,067
We are under thy power.

811
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,367
Morgause: Now...

812
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,167
listen carefully.

813
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,433
You are now my servants.

814
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:26,467
You must do anything I say.

815
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,133
Understand that I am your Queen.

816
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,400
Your Majesty.

817
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:34,300
Oh, really, you are too much.

818
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,367
Your reign is supreme.

819
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,700
Thank you, that is enough.

820
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,967
Now, your assignment is to keep

821
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:44,300
an eye on that little brat
King Zackary.

822
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,900
Little brat Zackary.

823
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,700
Of course you
mustn't call him that.

824
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:53,067
You must just call him
"Your Majesty."

825
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,233
Guards: My majesty.

826
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:59,367
No. No, no, no.
Your Majesty.

827
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,800
-Guards: Your Majesty.
-Morgause: Right.

828
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,500
Guards:
Right, Your Majesty.

829
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:07,433
Now that really is sweet.

830
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,067
Morgause: You must just call me

831
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,500
the Lady Maeve.

832
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,633
Your Majesty, the Lady Maeve.

833
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,533
No, you idiots.

834
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,367
Listen carefully.

835
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,400
I am the Lady Maeve.

836
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:23,700
Morgause:
You must call me "My Lady".

837
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,233
Zackary is the King...

838
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:30,233
Morgause: At least until I can
think of a better use for him.

839
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:32,267
You must call him...

840
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,100
Your Majesty. Get it?

841
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,967
Guards:
Your Lady, My Majesty.

842
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:39,600
Reverse that.

843
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:42,667
-My Lady, Your Majesty.
-Right.

844
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,600
Now you are
to follow His Majesty,

845
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:48,500
King Zackary, and report back

846
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,367
to me everything that he does.

847
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,067
Guards:
Report everything back to you.

848
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:55,067
(metal clanging)

849
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:06,833
What are you doing here?

850
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:09,100
Oh, Maeve... you scared me.

851
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,767
What are you doing here?

852
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,100
And where is Gwynneth?

853
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:14,067
I just found all
this cool armor, man.

854
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:18,633
Those jousts were awesome.
Think I can compete one day?

855
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,200
Morgause: Honestly.
You'd think you were just

856
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:23,600
a child not a king.
Go to bed.

857
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:24,933
Pushy much?

858
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:29,067
I am not in the mood
for any of your...

859
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:30,800
Maeve, we're going
to be working together

860
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,400
for a little while, right?

861
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:35,367
If you'd just chill,
just a little bit,

862
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,267
things would go much
easier for both of us.

863
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,800
I need you to get your rest
Zackary...

864
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:45,067
Tomorrow
we are giving audience.

865
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,067
Really? Who to?

866
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:49,867
To whom.

867
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,800
Morgause:
To some of your subjects...

868
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:55,067
We have important business
to attend to.

869
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,233
The country can't just
sit around waiting for you

870
00:46:58,267 --> 00:46:59,467
to be crowned.

871
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,400
OK, I don't know anything
about--

872
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:02,633
Don't worry your little head,

873
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,067
I'll take care of things.

874
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,433
Goodnight, Zackary.

875
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,233
Tomorrow you get

876
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:09,400
to sit in the throne room.

877
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:12,100
Throne room, cool enough.

878
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,300
I don't understand
your constant desire

879
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,433
for it to be chilly

880
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,933
when you're always complaining
about the cold.

881
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:20,267
No, cool doesn't mean--

882
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,367
Never mind. Just go to bed.

883
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,167
No, no, no.
Remember your attitude.

884
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Good night, Zackary.

885
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:32,367
Merlin: Zackary. Zack.

886
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:36,800
Merlin: Wake up, my boy.

887
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,067
Zackary.

888
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,433
You talk. What gives?

889
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,267
Merlin: Of course I talk.
It's Merlin.

890
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,233
-Merlin?
-Now be quiet,

891
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,267
or you'll wake
that dreadful woman.

892
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,467
What are you doing here?

893
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,833
I spoke to Arthur again.

894
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,667
I even did a few tricks to
convince him, he's not biting.

895
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,233
Go to Ector's place
and talk to him today.

896
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:56,900
It won't work.
We already tried.

897
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:58,367
He won't listen to me.

898
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
Besides, just let him cool off.

899
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:03,533
I saw some jousts yesterday
and today I got to hold court.

900
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,100
How can you? How?

901
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,100
Do you think this is a game?

902
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,467
We have three days left.

903
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,633
If Arthur is wigging out
about the news,

904
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:13,667
I may as well look around.
The stuff here is wild.

905
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,233
Of all the...

906
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,300
Look, if you let me
hold court today,

907
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,067
I'll go see him this afternoon.

908
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,867
You think you can
bargain with me?

909
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,100
-You little pipsqueak
-Hey... by the way,

910
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:28,233
I think you were right.
Morgause has the Dark Book.

911
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:30,133
It's this ancient looking thing,

912
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,300
even for today,

913
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,367
Zack: and it glows red.

914
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,367
That's it. Did you get it?

915
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,800
Like things would be that easy.

916
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,867
No, she's got it
locked up somewhere.

917
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,267
The key's on her belt.

918
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,467
Merlin: Boy, listen to me.
I need you to listen.

919
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,067
Someone's coming,
hang on.

920
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,433
(Merlin mumbling)

921
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,867
What, in bed so late?

922
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,067
Gwynneth. Gwynneth,
where are you?

923
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,600
Gwynneth:
I'm sorry. What time is it?

924
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,333
Past sun up, you fool.

925
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:56,667
Now get the boy dressed

926
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,667
meet me in the throne
room in haste.

927
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,167
Relax, man.
Don't to freak out on her,

928
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,367
she didn't do anything.

929
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,567
And you are going
to be quiet today, boy.

930
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,433
We have important affairs
to attend to

931
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:10,133
and I don't need you
fouling them up.

932
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,633
You gonna make me?

933
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,500
You aren't making
things any easier

934
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:20,900
with that temper of yours.

935
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,900
Are you ready?

936
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,267
Straighten your coat.

937
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,067
Even with the fire in here,
it's always like the Arctic.

938
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,500
Stop whining.

939
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:44,600
Why can't I sit on the throne?

940
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,433
You're not crowned yet.

941
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,267
Then why are we giving audience?

942
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,600
Some things can't wait.

943
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:50,767
Enough with the questions.

944
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,100
If anyone asks anything
confer with me first,

945
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,400
-I will tell you what to say.
-Whatever.

946
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,267
And sit up straight,

947
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,867
you're supposed to be a king.

948
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,500
Whatever.

949
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,033
We may proceed.

950
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:12,000
I said I wanted to see the king.

951
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,833
Young Man: This is the king.

952
00:50:13,867 --> 00:50:16,433
They said he was young
but I never thought...

953
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:18,200
Zack:
What seems to be the problem?

954
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,467
This young whippersnapper--

955
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,833
Excuse me, um...

956
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,333
Your Majesty. If I may speak.

957
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:29,233
There he goes again,
always interrupting.

958
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:31,067
You go first.
And you, old man,

959
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,767
will get your turn after.

960
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Your Majesty,
I am your humble servant

961
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,233
the Duke of St. Ives

962
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,033
and I have recently
inherited lands.

963
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:40,267
Duke of Ives:
On surveying these lands,

964
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,833
I found this old man.

965
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:46,100
He claims that the
land belongs to him.

966
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:48,300
But can't seem to
offer any evidence

967
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:52,033
except his stubborn rantings.

968
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:53,533
Duke:
Since I have approached him

969
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,300
about leaving my land,

970
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,033
four of my cows
have gone missing,

971
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:01,400
and one of my pigs was left
slaughtered on my door step.

972
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,667
Uh-huh...

973
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:06,833
(Morgause whispering)

974
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:10,067
Zack: What?

975
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,400
You heard me,
now tell him.

976
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:16,867
But we don't... we haven't even
heard the old man yet.

977
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,100
Morgause: I don't care.

978
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:19,467
Cattle theft
is a hanging offense,

979
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,100
and the old man must die.

980
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:22,933
I don't know what kind
of world you grew up in,

981
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,200
but where I come from,

982
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:26,333
people are innocent
until proven guilty.

983
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,867
Zack: All right,
here's the deal.

984
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,067
Old man, you give
him back his cattle

985
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,500
and buy him a new pig.

986
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:34,733
And, you give him
half of your crop as rent.

987
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:35,700
Rent?

988
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:38,100
Zack: He stays on your land
for life

989
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:39,900
only if he gives you
half his crops.

990
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,933
That way that part of your land

991
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:44,200
will be upkept and maintained,

992
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:47,100
Zack: and you will get your
stuff back as a reward.

993
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,233
Zackary...

994
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:51,333
Zack: The King has spoken.

995
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:54,067
Zack: Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

996
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,267
Thank you.

997
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,833
Now you listen to me.

998
00:51:57,867 --> 00:51:59,367
(chanting)

999
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,067
I'm not listening,
not listening!

1000
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,100
(Zack singing tunelessly)

1001
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:07,733
You may approach.

1002
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,733
Your Majesty. I am King Bans,
this is my brother Bers.

1003
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,567
Oh, no, not more kings...

1004
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,567
We come to swear fealty
to you and your kingdom.

1005
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,467
Oh...

1006
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,433
We also come to warn you
that six kings

1007
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:25,133
to the north, they have
all banded armies together,

1008
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,233
King Bans:
and have vowed to conquer you.

1009
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:29,967
Well, uh...

1010
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:31,933
We need to know
your plan of action.

1011
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,067
Uh... when are they
going to attack?

1012
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,267
Bans: It is five days journey
from their country.

1013
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,067
Uh... W...

1014
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:45,900
I'll think about this tonight
and let you know tomorrow.

1015
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,467
I can't deal with this.

1016
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,233
Well, you won't have to.
I will.

1017
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:55,067
You can't deal with this either.

1018
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,433
Silence. Now,
that will be enough for today.

1019
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:01,900
If we go to war in four days,
maybe by that time I can...

1020
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:05,067
Go to your room.

1021
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,700
I don't want to see you
until supper.

1022
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:07,733
My pleasure.

1023
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,933
(mouse squeaking)

1024
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,200
Merlin.

1025
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,433
Where have you been?

1026
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:28,333
(Merlin clearing throat)

1027
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,100
Oh... Sorry.

1028
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:33,267
I thought you were having
such a good time being king.

1029
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,067
I can't...
I can't do this Merlin.

1030
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,933
We have to get Arthur
back in power.

1031
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:41,633
-There's going to be a war.
-Merlin: I know that.

1032
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,600
I mean, how can they possibly...

1033
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:49,067
How could they even think I...
How did Arthur handle this?

1034
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:50,700
Like a young
and overwhelmed boy,

1035
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:54,533
trying to do a king's job.
But Bans and Bers help.

1036
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:56,300
This is his first trial.

1037
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,800
Was his first trial.

1038
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,800
Come on,
we haven't a minute to spare.

1039
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,700
We've gotta talk to Arthur.

1040
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:02,933
I've got the key,

1041
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:04,967
but Morgause is in the
room with the book...

1042
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:06,500
Well done, my boy.

1043
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,133
Look,
we have no time here.

1044
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:10,333
Just do your zappy
thing and I'm outta here.

1045
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:12,067
Very well.
Oh, but one more thing.

1046
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:13,067
What?

1047
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:15,867
Don't say anything
to Arthur about Guinevere

1048
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,333
and Lancelot or Mordred.

1049
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:19,867
He'll find out about
those things in due time.

1050
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,267
Merlin:
And don't mention the war.

1051
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,667
Now...

1052
00:54:24,633 --> 00:54:25,633
(zapping)

1053
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,133
Carados:
I didn't hear you ride up.

1054
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:39,800
Now get out of my way.
I'm busy.

1055
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:41,900
Merlin: Go after him, boy.

1056
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:00,067
What's all this stuff?

1057
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:01,233
I'm practicing.

1058
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:03,867
Arthur: It looks like you could
use some practice yourself.

1059
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,533
Listen, man,
we gotta talk alright.

1060
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,067
Zack: There's going to be a...

1061
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,467
You've just got to be king.

1062
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,867
It's just not for me.

1063
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,333
Please, don't start that again.

1064
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,100
(galloping)

1065
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:17,867
(metal clanging)

1066
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:35,333
Uh, nice try.

1067
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,600
You broke my concentration...

1068
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:40,067
Whatever.
Look, like I said, man,

1069
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,767
we gotta have words.

1070
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,333
Zack: Arthur, man,
I'm not supposed to be here...

1071
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:46,367
I was brought back
in time with bad mojo

1072
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,800
by that freaky chick
and placed on the throne...

1073
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:04,233
Arthur: Did you see that?
That was great.

1074
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:05,500
Yeah...

1075
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,800
Arthur: Imagine what I could
do on a real horse...

1076
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:13,067
Yeah, but, we have to talk...

1077
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,167
Will you take a hint?

1078
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,467
Look, I know you're king,

1079
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,700
or whatever you are,

1080
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:20,133
but I've only got an hour
before now and chores.

1081
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:23,267
And I've a lot of exercises
to do before then.

1082
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,100
Don't you get it?

1083
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,100
It you'd just stop
with this chores stuff

1084
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,667
for a minute and listen to me,
Arthur...

1085
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,367
if you don't wake up
and fast

1086
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,667
and take your place
on the throne,

1087
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,833
I'm not get getting home.

1088
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:37,467
Where is home?

1089
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,533
America.

1090
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,767
Arthur: America,
what country is that in?

1091
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,300
It's a place you people
haven't discovered yet.

1092
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:47,367
Across the ocean.
Whatever...

1093
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,967
Anyway, I did not choose
to come here...

1094
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:51,133
I was brought here.

1095
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,733
I have a family, a brother
and parents who I...

1096
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,800
Who I miss.

1097
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,767
I mean, I really miss them.

1098
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,733
And I've got my own
path to follow

1099
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,733
I don't know
what that is right now,

1100
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:10,633
but I do know that this,

1101
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,733
this is totally messed.

1102
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:13,800
I can't help you...

1103
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,833
Come on Daisy, come on,
not now, come on.

1104
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:31,800
All right, all right, whoa.

1105
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:38,100
Arthur: It's all right, Daisy.
You can't help being so old.

1106
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:43,433
(Merlin mumbling
"gently please")

1107
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:48,067
What now?

1108
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:49,900
Why won't you listen?

1109
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,667
You are supposed to be a king,

1110
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,100
not some stupid
lamo chore-hopping,

1111
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:56,967
Zack: pretend-to-be knight
who talks to his stupid horse.

1112
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,167
Oh my, what is this?

1113
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,433
You want a piece of me?
Do you? Is that it?

1114
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,800
All right.

1115
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:13,067
let me just accommodate
your wishes there, Arthur.

1116
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,333
Let's see that you got.

1117
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,133
Whoa, all right, two hands.
Okay, this isn't fencing.

1118
00:58:30,267 --> 00:58:32,067
Let's boogie.

1119
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:35,867
(swords clattering, grunting)

1120
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:46,233
(grunting)

1121
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,333
(Arthur chuckling)

1122
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,067
You do talk oddly.
You really from the future?

1123
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,333
Zack: Yeah.

1124
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,267
Arthur: How far ahead?

1125
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,533
What year is it now?

1126
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:06,867
We are in the year
of our Lord, 486.

1127
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,433
So from about...
1,500 years into the future.

1128
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:13,767
What is it like then?

1129
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,867
You obviously still fight
with swords.

1130
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,067
This is just for play,
not for real, you know.

1131
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:21,267
Well, then there's no war.

1132
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,967
Oh, no, there's war.

1133
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,200
There will always
be plenty of war.

1134
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:27,633
Just a different kind
of weapons, you know.

1135
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,500
Is there war still in England?

1136
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,167
No.

1137
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,267
But that's mostly
because of you.

1138
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,067
What else?

1139
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:40,067
Well, there is communication
between all the world.

1140
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:42,067
People can talk to each
other from anywhere.

1141
00:59:42,067 --> 00:59:43,567
How is this possible?

1142
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:47,233
Computers.
Telecommunications.

1143
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:48,433
Telephones.

1144
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,800
Basically a different
kind of magic...

1145
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:56,167
Well then, how can there be
war with all of this new magic?

1146
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:00,100
I don't know, there just is.

1147
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:01,933
How can there be war
in your world,

1148
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:03,267
with all the magic?

1149
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,133
I see your point.

1150
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:07,967
I don't know man.

1151
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,833
It's screwy,
but it's home right?

1152
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:14,000
It's where I belong.
Like you belong on the throne.

1153
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:15,933
I don't know about being king.

1154
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:17,733
I want to be a knight.

1155
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,533
It you become king,

1156
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,233
when you become king,

1157
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,000
you will lead hundreds

1158
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,000
of knights into
glorious battles.

1159
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:27,033
You are single-handedly
responsible for

1160
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:29,667
ending conflict with
all the tribes in England.

1161
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,500
You're gonna be the
best king ever. I promise.

1162
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,733
What would I do?

1163
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:36,267
I don't know the first thing
about ruling a kingdom.

1164
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,200
You'll figure it out.
Merlin will be there to help.

1165
01:00:39,233 --> 01:00:40,533
The old man?

1166
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,233
The very with it old man.

1167
01:00:42,267 --> 01:00:44,167
He is a powerful wizard.

1168
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,133
How do I know
you're not under some spell?

1169
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,833
Arthur:
Or he's not trying to trick me

1170
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,333
or manipulate me like
that witch did you?

1171
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:52,600
He's a good magician

1172
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:55,367
and he'll be your best bud
and advisor.

1173
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,900
I can't take all this in,

1174
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,267
I have to do my exercises.

1175
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:04,400
We only have two days
until I have to be crowned

1176
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:07,067
I mean it'll be pretty scary
if you don't get it together.

1177
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,067
You're gonna
be a good king, Arthur.

1178
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,200
I'll think on it.

1179
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:14,700
Oh, can I ask a favor?

1180
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,067
Nice, Merlin, getting down.

1181
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,467
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1182
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,933
Stop that. Call me Zack.

1183
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:37,933
But you...

1184
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:39,567
Hey, that's an order.

1185
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:43,100
I'd best be getting back.
I have chores to do.

1186
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,733
Listen, please,
come back with me to the castle.

1187
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,400
Let's work things out,
all right?

1188
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:49,433
I need more time.

1189
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,300
Zack: We don't have more time.

1190
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,267
Merlin: Get off my back,
you ungrateful sack of potatoes!

1191
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,400
Alright, alright.

1192
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,500
You are going to be
the jewel of the coronation.

1193
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:10,400
Now, to work.

1194
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,867
The Spell of the Making
rears its beastly head.

1195
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,267
(chuckling)

1196
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,967
Really, Morgause,
you are too much!

1197
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:33,733
But not yet, not yet.

1198
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,633
I must learn more first.

1199
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,433
But once I am ready
to read that spell

1200
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:41,100
I can dispense with
the gathering of armies,

1201
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,267
I will have England
under my thumb

1202
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,433
and I can ditch the boy.

1203
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:52,233
Now...
The spell of Second Sight.

1204
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:56,133
Let's see
what goes on with Merlin.

1205
01:02:56,167 --> 01:03:00,733
Poor Merlin,
no Arthur to advise.

1206
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:08,700
(chanting)

1207
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:16,533
Zack: I will practice riding. 
 OK, I promise.

1208
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,700
Merlin: I have no intention 
 of letting you ride me again.

1209
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:21,633
My boy, it is back
to the castle for you

1210
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,833
'til Arthur
comes to his senses.

1211
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,933
Besides, I need you
to get that book.

1212
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:28,833
You have the key,
the rest should be easy.

1213
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,067
Zack: Is that book 
 really that dangerous?

1214
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:33,533
My boy,
if she can wreak such havoc

1215
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:35,633
with only a few
of its simpler spells,

1216
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,267
you don't want to know
what she can do

1217
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,367
if she ever figures out
the Spell of the Making.

1218
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,333
The spell of... What's that?

1219
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:44,633
A very dangerous spell
which would make her

1220
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,600
far more dangerous
to this country than

1221
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:49,567
merely a little junior witch
and she could do far worse

1222
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,833
Merlin: damage than merely 
 changing history.

1223
01:03:51,867 --> 01:03:52,800
Zack: How?

1224
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,433
Never mind,
just get that book.

1225
01:03:55,467 --> 01:03:57,400
We'll try again
with Arthur tomorrow.

1226
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,600
Alright, but how
about letting me ride you back?

1227
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,733
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

1228
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:04,567
(zapping)

1229
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,500
(groaning)

1230
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:08,067
Riding sure does hurt.

1231
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:10,933
Morgause: So does the truth.

1232
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:12,967
Morg... Maeve.

1233
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,600
No need for the charade
any longer, "little brother".

1234
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:20,067
I know what you know
and where you've been.

1235
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:25,200
The Dark Book is not without
its powers of second sight.

1236
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:28,300
You see, I was listening.

1237
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,600
Morgause: Key please.

1238
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,767
Zack: What key?

1239
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:38,133
(ominous music)

1240
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,200
You won't
get your hands on that book.

1241
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:43,633
Morgause: I'm not about to let
a simple, stupid boy
ruin my chances.

1242
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,100
You choose me
because you thought

1243
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:47,967
I wouldn't cause
as many problems as Arthur.

1244
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:51,400
So maybe it does
have a brain after all.

1245
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:52,867
Okay, but why me?

1246
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,833
Morgause: I have the power
to pull people out of time,

1247
01:04:55,867 --> 01:05:00,867
but they have to want
to come, just a little bit.

1248
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,267
And I guess I wanted to come
more than just a little bit.

1249
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,133
Why not use someone
from this time?

1250
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:10,333
Harder to track the lineage
of one who comes out of the air.

1251
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:12,833
Morgause: They have no choice
but to believe you are

1252
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,067
the long lost son
of Uther Pendragon.

1253
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:17,267
Yeah, but Merlin...

1254
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,067
I am dealing with one
problem at a time here.

1255
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:22,100
I already have a fool
on the throne,

1256
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:25,067
I'd say I am doing quite well,
wouldn't you?

1257
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:26,133
Aside from the fact that

1258
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,400
you took it upon yourself

1259
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:29,700
to tell my idiot
brother the truth.

1260
01:05:29,733 --> 01:05:31,533
You can't just
change the future.

1261
01:05:31,567 --> 01:05:33,067
Nothing good can come of it.

1262
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:35,467
You're starting to sound
like Merlin himself.

1263
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,800
Well, my boy,

1264
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:39,467
until I can think of something
better to do with you,

1265
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,067
you are now
under house arrest.

1266
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,267
House arrest,
now how you gonna do that?

1267
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:49,700
Well, I think I'll kill you
with a little kindness first,

1268
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:53,533
while I kill my other brother
a little more completely.

1269
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:56,400
Gwynneth: Your Majesty,

1270
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:59,067
Lady Maeve
told me you've taken ill.

1271
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:01,333
Oh, no, what are
you doing out of bed?

1272
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:04,533
Now let's get you to bed

1273
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:06,267
and give you a poultice.

1274
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,200
Then we'll bank the fires
and get it warm in here.

1275
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,400
Morgause: And now, to dispose

1276
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:13,767
of my other problem altogether.

1277
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,067
Zack: Gwynneth, stop it.
She's going to kill Arthur.

1278
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:18,967
Witch, who?
You are getting delirious.

1279
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:21,700
This will make you feel better.

1280
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:24,300
Zack: Merlin!!

1281
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:31,467
(Gwynneth snoring)

1282
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,933
Uh, hiya.

1283
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,367
Morgause:
Quickly to Sir Ector's castle.

1284
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,633
You will find the traitor
in the barn tonight,

1285
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:57,233
or so the Book tells me.

1286
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,667
Shackle him
as quietly as you can

1287
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,233
and report back to me.

1288
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:09,233
No. No, no no.
This can't happen.

1289
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:10,500
Merlin.

1290
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:16,567
Merlin. Merlin, I need you.

1291
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,067
(Merlin grunting)

1292
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:28,200
Merlin? Merlin? Is that you?

1293
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:29,267
(grunting)

1294
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:32,667
Dude, where have you been?

1295
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,433
Morgause just sent her drones
out to kill Arthur.

1296
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,533
Why?

1297
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:37,633
She knows I know and that

1298
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,733
you know I know
and Arthur knows...

1299
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:40,767
Oh no.

1300
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,433
Oh my goodness,
what was that?

1301
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,900
-What?
-Gwynneth: That flash of light.

1302
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:50,967
Oh, Gwynneth,
don't tell me you've got it too.

1303
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,267
No, of course not.

1304
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,533
Oh, Gwynneth,
you don't look so good...

1305
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:58,833
What, well,
I am feeling a little bit off.

1306
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:01,067
You know what you should do?
Go to bed,

1307
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,667
I did and I feel so much
better because of it.

1308
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,100
But Lady Maeve said
to keep an eye on you--

1309
01:08:06,133 --> 01:08:07,267
Don't worry about that,

1310
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,267
I'm going back to bed now,
you must do the same.

1311
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,800
-Gwynneth!
-Gwynneth: What?

1312
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:15,067
-Look at that!
-What?

1313
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:17,833
You're flushed.

1314
01:08:17,867 --> 01:08:21,967
Ooooh,
I am feeling a little bit dizzy.

1315
01:08:22,067 --> 01:08:24,533
Yeah, you know what you need?

1316
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,933
A lot of this, come,
you need to get to bed.

1317
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:28,967
-Let's go.
-Yes. Yes.

1318
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:34,200
A lot of this.
Generous portions. Good.

1319
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,533
(zapping)

1320
01:08:39,267 --> 01:08:40,700
Why did you bring him here?

1321
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:42,500
Gwynneth: Are you all right,
Your Majesty?

1322
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,967
-Beca--
-Gwynneth, fine. Good.

1323
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:47,733
Take us somewhere we can talk.

1324
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:54,367
(zapping)

1325
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,967
I don't like this...

1326
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:57,500
I said I'd think on it.

1327
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,767
I'm still thinking.

1328
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,500
Why did you bring us here?
She's sure to find him.

1329
01:09:01,533 --> 01:09:04,067
The best place to hide
is in plain sight...

1330
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,067
Why does this witch woman
want me dead?

1331
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,200
Put the bucket down
and be quiet,

1332
01:09:08,233 --> 01:09:09,867
both of you, I need to think.

1333
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:16,467
Arthur, this belongs to you.

1334
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,167
I didn't feel right with it.

1335
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,333
(mystical twinkling)

1336
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,433
Zack: Whoa...

1337
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,500
Of course...

1338
01:09:28,067 --> 01:09:29,067
Excalibur.

1339
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:30,800
Excalibur.

1340
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,867
So, you believe me now?

1341
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,367
Yeah. Wow. Huh.

1342
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,900
Zack Yeah. Huh. Wow.

1343
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:37,633
Let's go back to
the king's English...

1344
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,700
Merlin: Or it would be
the king's English, if...

1345
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:43,233
Merlin: Now, what to do?

1346
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,200
Zack: I say we take on
whatever's coming.

1347
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:47,133
Wait a minute, boy.

1348
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:51,600
Merlin: We need to fight
together in this battle.

1349
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,200
We've each got our strengths,

1350
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:55,600
but if you will permit
me a little intervention,

1351
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:57,867
I've got a little
extra help for you.

1352
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,100
(zapping)

1353
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:00,300
Beauty.

1354
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,700
(whooshing)

1355
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,200
Zack: Oh yeah, I'm invisible!

1356
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:22,067
Stop it fool,
or I'll turn you into a mouse

1357
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,000
and Arthur and I will take
on the enemy alone. Get it?

1358
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:26,233
-Zack: Got it.
-Merlin: Good.

1359
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:27,900
Merlin: Now, you got Excalibur.
As for me...

1360
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:31,867
Now, men,
let us to battle.

1361
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,700
Hidden in plain
sight my eye, Merlin.

1362
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:43,467
Do you think
my magic so primitive

1363
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,567
it cannot see danger
when it approaches?

1364
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,433
Primitive is exactly
the right word for it.

1365
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,467
Primitive and dangerous.

1366
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:52,933
(zapping)

1367
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:53,967
Where did they go?

1368
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,867
Zack: I don't know.
Uh-oh!

1369
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,900
Yeah...

1370
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,067
(zapping)

1371
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,800
You little trick.

1372
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,767
But I think you'll
find my powers

1373
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,933
have come a long way
in a very short time.

1374
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:24,833
(Morgause chanting)

1375
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,700
(chanting continues)

1376
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:35,700
Agile for such an old man.

1377
01:11:35,733 --> 01:11:37,867
Come on and fight me.

1378
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,400
Come on, out with the lightning,

1379
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,733
I can take it.

1380
01:11:41,767 --> 01:11:42,967
My dear, you have obviously

1381
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:45,367
missed the point
of all of your magic lessons.

1382
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,267
You think all of
this carries no price?

1383
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,833
Morgause:
Come on and fight me!

1384
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:53,367
Let's see who
is the real magician.

1385
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:00,767
(Merlin chanting)

1386
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:12,733
(Morgause chanting)

1387
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:17,067
(Morgause groaning)

1388
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:22,133
(swords clashing, grunting)

1389
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:24,533
Zack!

1390
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,700
Ah!

1391
01:12:37,067 --> 01:12:38,200
(grunting, groaning)

1392
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,233
Zack: Hey, guardy guards.
Over here. Yo, zombie freaks.

1393
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:05,167
All right, you get round one.

1394
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,833
But I am not finished yet.

1395
01:13:07,867 --> 01:13:09,500
No, you are far from finished.

1396
01:13:09,533 --> 01:13:10,867
There is much more havoc

1397
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,633
you must wreak in your lifetime.

1398
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:14,633
-Stop that.
-Stop what?

1399
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:16,067
That future stuff.

1400
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,533
Like you know it all.

1401
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,500
You thought
you knew about Arthur,

1402
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,167
Morgause:
and then look what happened.

1403
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
No, well. Just because you
managed to move things

1404
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:24,867
around a little bit
doesn't mean...

1405
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,333
Merlin: they won't come to
the same sorry end.

1406
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:30,967
Now, what's next,
my dear little witch?

1407
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:34,267
I am not a witch.
I am a magician!

1408
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,800
What have you got for me?

1409
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:42,900
(Morgause chanting)

1410
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:45,967
(Merlin laughing)

1411
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,833
Oops...

1412
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:51,767
(Morgause screaming)

1413
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,867
(Merlin laughing)

1414
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:57,167
(screaming)

1415
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:03,233
(gasping, grunting)

1416
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:07,833
(grunting, groaning)

1417
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:20,567
Zack: Oh, yeah,
the mark of Zack.

1418
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,400
(high-pitched grunting)

1419
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:31,067
(high-pitched grunting)

1420
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,800
(manic laughter)

1421
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,967
(terrified gasping)

1422
01:14:37,067 --> 01:14:42,333
(grunting)

1423
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:44,400
(yelling)

1424
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:50,233
(clattering)

1425
01:14:58,433 --> 01:15:00,333
(groaning)

1426
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:02,700
Zack: Could you watch
where you're going?

1427
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:04,933
What happened to the
guards who were after you?

1428
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:08,867
I took them out, no problemo.
And your guards?

1429
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,133
I had no problemos either.

1430
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:15,667
Good, stay where I can see you.

1431
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,933
It's difficult having
a comrade you can't see.

1432
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:20,067
It does have
it's advantages though, huh?

1433
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:21,200
(Merlin grunting)

1434
01:15:21,233 --> 01:15:23,533
That's Merlin. Let's go.
It doesn't sound good.

1435
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:28,767
(growling, cackling)

1436
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:31,967
Yaaaaa!

1437
01:15:32,067 --> 01:15:34,067
(groaning)

1438
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
All right.

1439
01:15:36,133 --> 01:15:39,433
(laughter, screaming)

1440
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:40,800
Arthur: Thank you.

1441
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,733
(grunting)

1442
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:55,700
Zack don't need no cloak.

1443
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:02,067
(yelling)

1444
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,433
Zack!

1445
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,933
Say hello to my little friend.

1446
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:15,733
Guard:
Whoa, aaah, gah!

1447
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,900
Zack: That's gotta hurt.

1448
01:16:18,933 --> 01:16:20,200
Good work.

1449
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:21,833
You didn't do too bad yourself.

1450
01:16:21,867 --> 01:16:25,233
-I said you had it in you.
-Yeah, let's get to Merlin.

1451
01:16:25,267 --> 01:16:27,667
Why don't you fight me?

1452
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,267
Because I need you alive,
you idiot girl.

1453
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,867
You have things to do.

1454
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,600
You bet I have things to do.

1455
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:38,733
You bet I do.
I have big things to do.

1456
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:41,900
You leave me
no choice, Merlin.

1457
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:46,233
You have given me no choice
but to forge on.

1458
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:49,433
Morgause, you don't know
what you are dealing with.

1459
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:51,067
(screeching)

1460
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:53,767
(Morgause chanting)

1461
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,567
Morgause,
it's too powerful for you,

1462
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,967
it will kill you.

1463
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:59,467
I think I've mastered
this book by now...

1464
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,400
Merlin: No one is the master
of that book,

1465
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,967
it can only master you.

1466
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:05,067
(chanting)

1467
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,400
Merlin: Morgause!

1468
01:17:06,433 --> 01:17:12,200
(Morgause chanting)

1469
01:17:15,867 --> 01:17:20,867
(chanting continues)

1470
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:26,900
(chanting intensifies)

1471
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:30,400
Yah!

1472
01:17:31,533 --> 01:17:34,200
Nooooo!

1473
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,600
(whooshing)

1474
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:40,633
Hey!

1475
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:44,067
(crashing)

1476
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,233
(Merlin moaning)

1477
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,833
Come on, my boy,
snap cut of it.

1478
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,067
Wake up, Arthur.

1479
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,067
Oh, no. What did I do.
Why did I take that sword?

1480
01:17:57,067 --> 01:18:00,233
Merlin: Arthur, Arthur,
it's time to wake up.

1481
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:01,967
It's not you, my boy,
you are not

1482
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:04,200
responsible for this,
any of it.

1483
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:07,200
Merlin: And the one who is
I think has learned her lesson.

1484
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:10,200
There are some powers that
are not to be toyed with.

1485
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:12,233
Oh, Arthur,
it's time to wake up.

1486
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:14,900
Come on, now,
you've got a kingdom to rule,

1487
01:18:14,933 --> 01:18:17,833
Merlin: battles to win, you've
got a lot ahead of you, my boy.

1488
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:19,067
Merlin: Wake up, Arthur!

1489
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,333
King Arthur.

1490
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:24,733
King Arthur.

1491
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:28,400
I really have to do this,
don't I?

1492
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,700
Well, first things first.

1493
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:34,333
Off with her head.

1494
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:36,533
No, that is not
how it works.

1495
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:40,867
She too
has a destiny to fulfil.

1496
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,167
In the meantime...

1497
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,400
Morgause: What are you going
to do with me?

1498
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,233
Well, I think it's time
you went back to Orkney.

1499
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:50,367
There's a lovely old gentleman
named King Lot

1500
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,267
that you really got to meet.

1501
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,600
You can't send me so far away...

1502
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:56,167
out to the country.

1503
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,500
I'll just die out
in the country.

1504
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:02,433
Eventually, yes,
but not for many years.

1505
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:04,233
Oh, anything but Orkney,

1506
01:19:04,267 --> 01:19:06,833
it's so dreary
and so cold there.

1507
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,967
I'll have nothing to do.

1508
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:11,967
Please let me stay
here in London.

1509
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:14,900
I'll be a loyal disciple
of my darling brother.

1510
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:19,167
I do love him after all.
We can make this work...

1511
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,633
(zapping)

1512
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,700
So she is my sister.

1513
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:29,200
Will she be more trouble?

1514
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,633
I can't promise that she won't.

1515
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:36,167
Merlin:
How's that for an answer?

1516
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,967
Go on, tell me
what will happen.

1517
01:19:38,067 --> 01:19:39,700
Isn't that what you're
supposed to do?

1518
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,600
In time, in time.

1519
01:19:42,633 --> 01:19:46,167
Excuse me, um,
can I go home now?

1520
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,433
Oh, dear.

1521
01:19:47,467 --> 01:19:50,367
That just sounds wonderful.

1522
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,133
What do you mean Merlin?

1523
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:56,433
Well, Zack, I'm afraid I've
got some bad news for you.

1524
01:19:56,467 --> 01:19:58,433
Merlin: I've been holding off
telling you because, well,

1525
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,500
frankly we had enough
to think about.

1526
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:02,233
Wait a minute.
You just sent Morgause

1527
01:20:02,267 --> 01:20:03,467
to Orkney
wherever that is

1528
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,733
with just a little wave
of the staff there...

1529
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,500
Zack: Are you trying
to tell me you ain't

1530
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:10,433
got no more juice in that
puppy to send me home?

1531
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:13,367
Time travel
is a tricky thing, Zackary.

1532
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,900
You see. It is not so
much as a sending matter,

1533
01:20:16,933 --> 01:20:21,867
as a drawing matter.
You see...

1534
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,867
Merlin: Magic has the power
to pluck someone

1535
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,067
out of another time,

1536
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,267
into our own.

1537
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,233
But no magic has the power

1538
01:20:31,267 --> 01:20:32,700
to send someone through time.

1539
01:20:32,733 --> 01:20:34,533
No, no, no... this is crazy.

1540
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,933
This won't do.
I can't live here.

1541
01:20:36,967 --> 01:20:38,533
You guys don't even
have proper heating for one,

1542
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,567
and the food, oh,
don't even get me started

1543
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,667
on you guys' personal hygiene,
I mean...

1544
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,167
Zack: Merlin...

1545
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:48,667
I miss my family.

1546
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,000
Alright, I hate to admit it,
but I do.

1547
01:20:52,033 --> 01:20:53,500
Zack:
You're the one always talking

1548
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:55,000
about a person's
place in history;

1549
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:57,300
well I have one,
and it is not here.

1550
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,600
It is at the turn
of the century...

1551
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:01,433
okay, the 21st century.

1552
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:05,067
I'm sorry Zackary,
there is nothing I can do.

1553
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:07,067
Gwynneth:
He's down here! Down here!

1554
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,800
Zack, Your Majesty,
are you all right?

1555
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:14,133
Yes. First of all, I am fine,
Gwynneth, thanks for asking.

1556
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,767
And, I am not the King.

1557
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,900
What?

1558
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,867
I was brought,

1559
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,833
I took the sword from the stone

1560
01:21:22,867 --> 01:21:24,333
due to the treachery
of Morgause,

1561
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:27,167
the witch who was here before.

1562
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,300
This is Arthur, he was the one

1563
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,067
who was supposed
to pull the sword

1564
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:33,333
from the stone and today,

1565
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:35,500
he showed us,
by his gallant fighting,

1566
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:39,067
wow, you know,
that Excalibur belongs to him.

1567
01:21:39,067 --> 01:21:40,733
Excalibur is broken!

1568
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:43,433
-Gwynneth: No.
-Man: The country has no king!

1569
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,100
Courtier:
Where is that thing?

1570
01:21:46,133 --> 01:21:47,267
Seize the imposters!

1571
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,233
Get him!

1572
01:21:49,267 --> 01:21:51,333
Courtier 3:
Where'd he go? Quickly!

1573
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:53,067
Perhaps I can
be a knight after all.

1574
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:54,967
No, did you see that mob?

1575
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,067
You can't show your face
at that castle again

1576
01:21:57,067 --> 01:21:58,800
if you value your neck.

1577
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:01,067
Arthur:
I can go abroad on quests.

1578
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:04,967
I can disguise myself and
do mysterious acts of chivalry.

1579
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:06,767
Merlin: It's not that easy.

1580
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,233
Oh, I wish I'd never
allowed you to interfere.

1581
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:11,567
Zack: Cheer up, Merlin,

1582
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,867
at least tomorrow you
won't remember all this,

1583
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:16,133
huh...
not without trying of course.

1584
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:19,433
Well now, that's one way
of looking at things, isn't it?

1585
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:22,067
Yes, well,
the future of England is foiled,

1586
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:23,433
but who cares?

1587
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:26,167
Merlin: We've got
an adventurous future knight

1588
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,767
and a boy who is more

1589
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,400
than a millennium ahead
of his time.

1590
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:31,533
Merlin...

1591
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:33,200
Merlin:
There must be a ton of things

1592
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:34,567
people haven't even thought of

1593
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,667
that you could take credit
for inventing.

1594
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,800
Hey, Merlin...

1595
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,333
The long bow...
now, that's useful isn't it?

1596
01:22:40,367 --> 01:22:42,900
Not to mention
the steam engine--

1597
01:22:42,933 --> 01:22:44,233
Merlin!

1598
01:22:44,267 --> 01:22:45,333
Merlin: Yes, my boy?

1599
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:47,200
Okay,
just hear me out a minute.

1600
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:48,467
Zack: I have an idea.

1601
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,633
Now, you live
your life backwards, right?

1602
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:54,133
Much to my chagrin,
I do indeed.

1603
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:57,733
And then your past
is our future.

1604
01:22:57,767 --> 01:22:58,767
Yes.

1605
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,700
Zack:
Then your future is our past.

1606
01:23:00,733 --> 01:23:03,200
Yes. We've discussed this.

1607
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:07,433
And if you can only draw people
back through time, then--

1608
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:10,067
Why don't I go back
to my next week,

1609
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:11,933
and draw Arthur back?

1610
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,467
What are you two talking about?

1611
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,633
Well, you see, Merlin
lives his life backwards...

1612
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:18,967
Yes, I got that.

1613
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:21,733
So all he's got to do
is bring you back a day

1614
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:23,933
before Morgause brings me
back through time

1615
01:23:23,967 --> 01:23:27,467
and you're pulling the
sword from the stone, brother.

1616
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,767
Merlin:
And once you're crowned,

1617
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,200
Morgause will have no reason
to mess things up.

1618
01:23:32,233 --> 01:23:34,500
Well, at least not yet.

1619
01:23:34,533 --> 01:23:36,300
Zack, you're a genius!

1620
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:39,067
Well, why don't you just
wait until next week,

1621
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,267
Arthur: and then go back
and tell my other self

1622
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,700
to pull the sword
from the stone?

1623
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:43,800
(Merlin yells)

1624
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:46,067
It took days
to convince you this time,

1625
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,533
I am not going
through that again.

1626
01:23:48,567 --> 01:23:51,600
Besides, I need you,
the new Arthur,

1627
01:23:51,633 --> 01:23:54,267
who fought so valiantly.

1628
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,100
And I was just getting used

1629
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:58,100
to the idea of my quests,
that's all.

1630
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,633
Don't worry, my boy,
Your Majesty.

1631
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:05,133
You'll have different sorts
of quests.

1632
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:06,933
Merlin:
Now, it's almost midnight.

1633
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:08,867
So, goodbye, Zack.

1634
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,600
What do you mean?

1635
01:24:11,633 --> 01:24:13,667
Well, if Morgause
never brings you back,

1636
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,667
you're not going
to remember any of this

1637
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,700
Merlin: because
it won't have happened.

1638
01:24:17,733 --> 01:24:20,667
No, I... I guess not.

1639
01:24:25,233 --> 01:24:26,267
(Merlin groaning)

1640
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,967
What's the meaning
of all that?

1641
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:29,100
It's a hug.

1642
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:32,333
They'll be popular once
you people figure out hygiene.

1643
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:35,533
Friends hug each other.
You know, to show affection.

1644
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:41,533
Well, goodbye,
both of you. Thank you.

1645
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,367
This is really been
the most interesting thing

1646
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,300
that's happened in my life.

1647
01:24:47,067 --> 01:24:48,867
Or has never happened to me.

1648
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,867
I just wish I could remember it.

1649
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:54,300
But at least now I know
where I really belong.

1650
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,067
Well, goodbye.

1651
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,467
(clock chiming)

1652
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,833
Midnight. The changing.

1653
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,200
(mystical music crescendo)

1654
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:29,333
Jeffy:
Zack! Where did you go?

1655
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:32,267
Over here!

1656
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:36,233
Zack, don't be mad at me.

1657
01:25:36,267 --> 01:25:39,800
I was just trying to make you
feel better about moving.

1658
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,833
You know...

1659
01:25:45,067 --> 01:25:48,833
I don't even know
what I was so upset about.

1660
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:52,500
I don't know. I guess...

1661
01:25:52,533 --> 01:25:53,667
Well...

1662
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:57,333
Let's go home.

1663
01:25:57,367 --> 01:25:59,267
Okay, whatever.

1664
01:26:00,967 --> 01:26:04,200
Jeffy: You know, you teenagers
sure are a moody bunch.

1665
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:13,167
(door creaking)

1666
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,267
The story of the boy
from the future

1667
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,200
and how Arthur really earned
the throne of England.

1668
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,667
Smart boy, that.

1669
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,200
Why didn't you think of
it yourself, you old bat?

1670
01:26:55,233 --> 01:26:56,900
(dog barking, howling)

1671
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:04,167
(chanting)

1672
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:09,833
(zapping)

1673
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:10,967
You ready?

1674
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:12,500
As ready as I'll ever be...

1675
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:33,100
(triumphant music)
