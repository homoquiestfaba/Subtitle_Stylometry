we spoke on the phone last
week about your local legend.

179
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,409
Oh.

180
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,910
Yeah.

181
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,046
Shit.

182
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,717
[ agnes and beck chatting
in the background ]

183
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,954
my name is beck,
and this is my brother, jiminey.

184
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,723
Agnes: Like the cricket?
[ laughs ]

185
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,426
yeah, like the cricket,
yeah.

186
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,062
Every few months,
someone comes this way

187
00:09:56,163 --> 00:10:00,600
wanting to know all that hogwash
about cannibals, or sinkers,

188
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,169
livin' in the sinkholes.

189
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,804
Well, I wanna use the myth as
the basis for my graphic novel.

190
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,405
Ooh.

191
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,906
Agnes?

192
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,275
Reload.

193
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,744
Excuse me.
I'll be with you in a sec.

194
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,080
Hey, deary.

195
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,382
Hi.

196
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,549
Your bra's showing.

197
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,784
[ mockingly ]
for an extra dollar,

198
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,785
you can get whatever you want
put on a stick.

199
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,087
That includes 8 chicken
tenders.

200
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,088
And a tetanus shot.

201
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:22,855
A tetanus shot.

202
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,924
So how long's this
gonna take?

203
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,459
Just hear what she
has to say.

204
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,128
Besides, I wanna find out about
who fucking broke my windshield.

205
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,964
Hey, I'm thinking this might be more of
a bag a chips and a coke kinda place.

206
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,033
Well, have you decided on
anything yet?

207
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,537
Actually, just thinking about
maybe a couple of bags of doritos.

208
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,138
And some cokes.

209
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:39,872
That's it?

210
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,073
Yeah, that'll be fine, yeah.

211
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,009
I'm sorry we can't be of more
help to you.

212
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,745
You know, we picked up this
place back in '94.

213
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,681
It's been fairly quiet around
here since then.

214
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,251
Except for those
wrestler kids.

215
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,185
Remember that, stu?

216
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:52,985
Uh-huh.

217
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,654
What happened to the
wrestler kids?

218
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,724
Oh, four wrestlers
from puckettville

219
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,126
came through here
snooping around.

220
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,094
Snooping around?

221
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,463
Disappeared.

222
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:08,268
Townsfolk actually claimin' they
were eaten by feral children.

223
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,238
Even the fbi got involved.

224
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,373
Never found a trace.

225
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,377
You know, you can get swallowed
up by the ground out there.

226
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,945
That part of the legend
is true.

227
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,380
Hmm.

228
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,450
You know, I tried telling you on
the phone not to come out this way.

229
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,151
There was no reason
for it.

230
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,888
If I were you, I'd drive back
before you become part of the story.

231
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,758
Well, let's hope
that doesn't happen.

232
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,062
Did you get everything
you needed? Can we go?

233
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,163
Um, actually,

234
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,198
do you know if there's
any kids left in town

235
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,867
because somebody
threw a rock at my windshield,

236
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,569
and I'd really like
to talk to his parents.

237
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,537
This here is a ghost town,
deary.

238
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,006
Stu and I live in a
trailer out back.

239
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,909
As for old ezrin here,
well, he's the site manager,

240
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,345
or the town mayor,
as we like to call it.

241
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,080
Ain't that right, ezrin?

242
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,286
Uh, sir, is there information you
can give us about these sinkers?

243
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,089
If you are the town mayor
or manager or whatever,

244
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,824
I mean, you must know something,
right?

245
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,593
You go take a drive through
town, see for yourself.

246
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,160
I don't think that's
a good idea.

247
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,663
Yeah, I don't know.
Beck, it sounds kinda dangerous.

248
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,632
Stay on the asphalt,
you'll be okay.

249
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,303
Don't go in any houses, and stay
the hell away from that high school.

250
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,472
Okay.

251
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,640
Um...

252
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,043
Well, thank you so much
for your hospitality.

253
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:24,644
Sure.

254
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,612
How much do I
owe you?

255
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,613
2.50.

256
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,515
2.50? Okay, well,
here's 3.

257
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,416
There you go.

258
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,317
Thank you so much.

259
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:30,783
Thank you.

260
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,551
Appreciate it.

261
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:32,852
No, thank you.

262
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,554
Let's go.

263
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,221
Bye.

264
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,489
Bye.

265
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,390
Bye.

266
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,091
Buh-bye.

267
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,127
You don't seriously wanna go
driving around out here, do you?

268
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,029
Actually, I was kinda hoping
that you would drive.

269
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:43,596
Oh.

270
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,997
Thank you.

271
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,471
Can you deal with this? Thank you, buddy.
You be careful with that thing.

272
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,105
Okay...

273
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,009
[ thud ]

274
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,177
[ loud smash
and glass shattering ]

275
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,817
would you be careful?

276
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,986
Help me with this, huh?

277
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,725
Can we please get back
to civilization?

278
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,626
You can't tell me
you don't wanna

279
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,395
go see a real urban legend.

280
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,429
That's an oxymoron.

281
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,730
Yes, it is.

282
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,899
I'll leave that there,
okay.

283
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,034
Can I get in the trunk, babe.

284
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,580
Oh, get me.

285
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,681
Move.

286
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,582
Get out of the fucking shot.

287
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,283
Let him take his pictures.

288
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,132
Look, I know,

289
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,703
I know things have been
a little difficult lately.

290
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,471
Right?

291
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,972
Yeah.

292
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,908
There's something out there
for me.

293
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,611
I know this, okay?
I just feel this.

294
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,581
Well, you know you did write your entire
infinity series in our one-bedroom apartment

295
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,619
and you didn't have to go to mars to have
some mind-bending personal experience.

296
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,555
Honey, if I could've go to mars,
we would've gone to mars.

297
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,089
Right, but you still wrote it.

298
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,492
Come on, dudes!
Let's roll.

299
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,928
We need the money.

300
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,363
We do.

301
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,832
Besides, you can't tell me you're
not the least bit interested in this.

302
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,768
I am, but it's just not...

303
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,202
Really the right time.

304
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,839
Okay, look, we'll drive slow.
Okay?

305
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,973
Take some photos,

306
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,241
and then we're gonna go
to miami.

307
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,477
And we're gonna have an awesome
time in miami.

308
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,413
I'm gonna go to my presentation, and I'm
gonna present this stuff to the publishers,

309
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,682
and I'm gonna be able to write a
graphic novel,

310
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,916
maybe sell a movie.

311
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,252
Who knows? We can get a house.

312
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,220
We can even get married.

313
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,890
Did you just bribe me
with marriage?

314
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,525
It's only a bribe
if you accept it, so...

315
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,293
And I can't accept it unless
you sell the movie rights

316
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,229
to a comic book you haven't
written yet?

317
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,231
Just give me an hour.

318
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,667
Can we do it in like
a half hour?

319
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,669
I'm still really hungry.

320
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,571
Y'all can bang later.

321
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,840
Fine, one hour, and we're not
getting out of the car.

322
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,076
Will you get
in the back?

323
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,579
Come on.

324
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,717
I hate this car so much.

325
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,985
Oh, stop complaining.

326
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,187
Oh, my god, here we go.

327
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,355
[ car starts,
glass shards move ]

328
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,191
jesus.

329
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,127
Sorry.

330
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,562
We're gonna get a lot
of bugs in our teeth.

331
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,363
Yeah, we are.

332
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,000
Beck: Freedom!

333
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,502
Jiminey: Freedom!

334
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,706
The brights don't
even work.

335
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,509
I told jiminey to fix that.
He's just been slacking.

336
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,943
Big surprise.

337
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,514
Jiminey: Hey, hey, you could make
a killing as a painter out here.

338
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,549
Candice: I've never been
anywhere like this before.

339
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,217
Beck: I don't think anybody's ever
been anywhere like this before.

340
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,852
Seems like such a waste,
you know?

341
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,887
Like, why don't you, I don't know,
put homeless people out here,

342
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,155
like sex offenders and stuff?

343
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,091
Well, I mean, sinkholes and
methane poisoning

344
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,459
probably have something to do
with it.

345
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,762
I wonder how far this place
goes. What do you think?

346
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,164
This town's like, only 1200
people used to live here,

347
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,699
so I don't think it's that big.

348
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,267
Candice: It seems so tiny.

349
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,836
Hey, I gotta pee.
Can we pull over?

350
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,803
Come on, man,
not now.

351
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,071
Now?

352
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,372
What do you mean, not now?
