00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,930
I haven't been
forgiven, Nelson.

187
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,030
God hasn't forgiven me
and I haven't forgiven myself.

188
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,670
<i>I tried to confess,</i>

189
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,870
<i>but Father Tomás
gave me a penance</i>

190
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,010
<i>that I've never been able
to go through with.</i>

191
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,950
<i>He told me to confess
the facts to the bishop.</i>

192
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,720
It's not the
best decision, Peter.

193
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,490
I haven't found peace.

194
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,190
These mountains,
Nelson.

195
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,860
The church.

196
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,230
The children.

197
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,800
The orphanage.

198
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,410
This is where
I found my true home.

199
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,980
And you'll lose it.

200
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,550
You'll be ex-communicated,

201
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,380
and you won't be able
to help our people anymore.

202
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,890
There's nothing I can do
to help them now.

203
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,570
[roars]

204
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,950
[Balducci]
Welcome, Father Peter.

205
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,990
It's not every day
you get a visit from a saint.

206
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,530
Monsignor Balducci,
I am not a saint.

207
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,800
A long time ago

208
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,170
I committed a sin, and...

209
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,640
I've never had the courage
to confess it to you.

210
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,340
Come on, Peter.

211
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,810
Please.

212
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,280
You have been helping
our people for 18 years.

213
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,420
People here love you.

214
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,950
And even in the Vatican,

215
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,520
there is talk about
the miracle you performed

216
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,920
18 years ago.

217
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,460
Are you serious, Monsignor?

218
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,120
But of course.

219
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,630
The Vatican has not
been blind to your work.

220
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,200
Maybe you are not
a saint for that, Peter,

221
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,740
but only someone
who carries God inside

222
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,900
could do something
like this.

223
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,740
And I also know
everything you've done

224
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,010
to ask for humanitarian aid.

225
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,120
But your prayers
have been heard.

226
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,330
This is a lot of money.

227
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,500
This Easter will bring
a miracle.

228
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,600
You are destined
to do great things, Peter.

229
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,270
And from Rome,

230
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,070
you will be able
to help children

231
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,540
all over the world.

232
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,110
- [man, speaks in Spanish] The medicine is here, family!
- And the medical equipment!

233
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,390

[Peter]
<i>I confess to Almighty God.</i>

239
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,030
And to you,
my brothers and sisters.

240
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,200
I have greatly sinned

241
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,870
in my thoughts
and in my words,

242
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
in what I have done,

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,240
in what I have failed to do.

244
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,710
Through my fault.
Through my fault.

245
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,240
Through my fault.
Through my most grievous fault!

246
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,180
[sighs]

247
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,320

You okay?

Blood of Christ,
protect me.

261

Blood of Christ.
Blood of Christ.

262

- Blood of Christ.

- [Uribe speaks Spanish] Father Peter...

270
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,260
- Who's calling?
- It's Uribe.

271
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm the warden
at the Sagrado Corazón prison.

272
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,510
How can I help you?

273
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,060
- We have a case with an inmate...
- Is she sick?

274
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,310
I wouldn't call it that.

275
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,310
You want me to send
my doctor over?

276
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,820
She doesn't need a doctor.

277
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,570
She needs a priest.

278
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,620
<i>She asked for you personally,
she's running out of time.</i>

279
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,910
Good morning, father.

280
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,590
Morning.

285
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,650
She hasn't eaten
in over two weeks.

286
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,750
I don't know how
she's still alive.

[door buzzes open]

288
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,030
- What are the charges against...?
- Esperanza killed a man.

289
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,990
They found him bled to death,
hanging from a tree,

290
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,200
his head completely backwards.

291
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,410
I don't feel comfortable
with this,

292
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,540
trust me, we tried everything
before calling you.

293
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,330
Shall we?

294
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,720
Keep your distance, she's
extremely strong and aggressive.

Hello, Esperanza.

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,790
[in demonic voice]
The Easter will bring a miracle.

302
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,730
How?

Resurrection.

304
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
We're five.

305
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,570
Who?

306
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,470
The children.

307
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,610
What's the matter
with the children?

308
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,390
[in normal voice] It feels like
a punishment from the Lord.

309
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,430
Who are you?

310
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,730
We already know each other,
Father.

311
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh, yeah.

312
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,840
Very well.

[guard speaks Spanish]
Stay back!

314

326
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,270
[speaks Spanish] A long time ago
I performed my first exorcism.

327
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,190
I swore it would be the last.

328
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,320
Do it for the girl's mother.

329
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,240
She's desperate, poor thing.

330
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,210
Do it for me.

331
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,220
Do it for your daughter.

332
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,930
She asked for you
to come.

333
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,530
And she didn't even
know you existed.

334
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,510
I heard you spent the last
several years saving lives.

335
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,820
I couldn't live in this town
with those memories.

336
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,360
A few weeks later,
I realized what you did to me.

337
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,860
But who was going
to believe me?

338
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,560
Who would see
the downside?

339
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,400
It wasn't me, Magali.

340
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,970
I swear to God,
I was possessed.

341
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,900
Look at her.

342
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,040
This is her true face.

343
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,450
The demon has never left.

344
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,250
He's been possessing
my girl over and over.

345
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,820
Save her.

346
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,620
If you really want
to redeem yourself,

347
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
expel that demon
out of her body.

[Nelson]
Five children, Peter.

371
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,810
We've made every kind of test.

372
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,380
There are no signs
of affected organs

373
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,020
or of a virus.

374
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,620
It doesn't make any sense.

375
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,360
[door closes]

376
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,550
[whispers in Spanish] God will welcome him
into His eternal light.

377
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,880
God doesn't exist.

378
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,100
Saints don't exist.

379
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,860
[Peter and children

380
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,610
In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

381
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,870
Amen.

382
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,250

- Good night, father.

- [speaks Spanish] Merry Christmas, children.
- Merry Christmas, Sister Magali.

387
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,300
Why does Baby Jesus forget
about orphan children?

388
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,260
You really think so, Camila?

389
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,100
Did you behave?

390
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,770
Well, I don't think
he's forgotten about you.

391
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,730
Yes, I saw him myself,
and guess what?

392
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,150
He left something for you
under your bed.

393
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,620
[all scream
and chatter excitedly]

394
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,630
Thank you.

396
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,310
Sister Magali?

397
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,440
Camila.

[demonic snarling
over recording]

402
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm afraid there
could be a tragedy

403
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,790
if Esperanza's transfer
to a juvenile facility...

404
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,330
I mean, thank God because
of the ineptitude and red tape,

405
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,230
they haven't
transferred her yet.

406
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
You have all my support,
Father Peter.

407
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,440
The Vatican
needs to approve...

408
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,770
Just do it.

409
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,040
We won't let
our own bureaucracy

410
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,910
do away with the life
of this innocent girl.

411
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,940
I've earned
the Vatican's trust,

412
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,550
and they'll approve
on your exorcism.

413
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,120
If you'll allow me,

414
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,590
I'd like someone
to join me this time.

415
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,520
You have someone in mind?

416
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,410
Father Michael.
You made it.

417
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,540
If I can make it to hell,
I can make it to Mexico.

418
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,140
Which, according
to the <i>London Times,</i>

419
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,250
is about the same.

420
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,050
[both laugh]

421

[Peter]
Well, Magali could have died.

424
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,590
[Michael]
You too.

425
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,560
Why didn't you want to do
this exorcism alone?

426
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,470
You're the greatest
exorcist in the world.

427
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,730
[chuckles]

428
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,440
And you faced Balban
and defeated it.

429
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,100
So did you.

430
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,150
I...

431
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,220
I didn't defeat it,
Michael.

432
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,750
What are you talking about?

433
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,720
Balban left Magali,

434
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,360
but then he came into me.

435
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,130
And then?

436
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,730
He just left.

437
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,500
Impossible.

438
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,070
Balban wouldn't have left
without taking your soul.

439
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,610
The only explanation is,
you expelled it.

440
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,380
You carry God
inside you, my boy.

441
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,630
No!

Oh, God. She's fine.

possessed by the devil.

482
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,430
He comes for me
every night.

483
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,330
Strangles me, and...

484
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,900
I can't even move.

485
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,400
He wants you.

but he was defeated.

495
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,250
Balban is a demon
with a noble lineage

496

with legions of henchmen
under his command.

497

If he's calling you,

498
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,360
he's not doing it
without a purpose.

499
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,660

Don't fall for her tricks.

552
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,290
So...

553
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,190
you're from "down there."

554
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,900
Prove it.

555
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,400
Come on, prove it.

556
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,340
[chuckles]

557
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,210
Well, gentlemen,
we have no demon.

558
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,880
No possession.

559
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,950
Let's go get a drink.

560
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,080
Someone must have a mescal
in this shitty prison.

561
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,880
- [guards speaks Spanish] Open up!
- [pounding on door] What's wrong?

562
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,490
[faint wheezing]

563
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,960
Simple telekinesis.

564
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,130
I've seen that in village...

565
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,770
[gurgles and gulps]

566
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,400
[Peter]
Father, are you okay?

567
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:31,310
Even if you were a demon...

568
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,610
you'd be the lowliest kind.

569
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:36,080
So simple,

570
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,720
so predictable,

571
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,390
that I would leave you to rot
with your cheap tricks.

572
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,720
[Michael gasps]

573
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,790
[chuckles]

574
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,400
We have a pact,
Father Michael.

575
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,930
[giggles]

576
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,770
In an hour, we will be
raping you down here.

Please, save me!</i>

<i>If my nephew dies,
it will be your fault!</i>

579
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,750
No!

580
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,350
- [distant shrieking]
- [speaks Spanish] The inmates...

581
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,260
[Peter] God, creator
and defender of humankind,

582
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,660
turn your eyes to this servant,
Esperanza Valasquez,

583
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,407
whom you have
redeemed...

584
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,910
<i>A tree is known
by its fruit.</i>

585
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,800
- [voices shrieking]
- [loud pounding and rumbling]

586
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,070
...to make her strong
for the fight,

587
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,240
and to defend her
with this powerful protection.

588
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,170
[roars]

589
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,250

590
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,250
[demonic shrieking]

591
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,690
[inaudible over screaming]

592
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,490
...with his blood...

593
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,460
[Michael]
He kept in captivity...

594
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,330
the devil!

595
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,970
[snarls]

596
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,010
[screams]

597
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,310
Hallowed by thy name,

598
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,840
thy kingdom come,

599
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,280
they will be done...

600
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,980
[snarls and yells]

601
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,260
[roars]

602
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,260
- Hyah!
- [screams]

603
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,230
[gasps]

604
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,040
[Nelson]
Are you okay?

605
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,280
[Michael]
Killed it.

606
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,220
[speaks Spanish] Here you can do
whatever you want,

607
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,680
we don't use this place
anymore.

608
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,070
We need everyone
to leave.

609
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:13,410
The prison must be empty
except for Esperanza and us.

610
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,110
Your mother, just in case!

611
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,200
- How many inmates are here?
- Thirteen.

612
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,780
And four in maximum security,

613
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,370
plus the possessed one.

614
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,870
Mr Uribe,

615
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,830
we need to get them
out of here.

616
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,250
- Everyone must leave.
- No, sir, that's impossible.

617
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,460
You saw it yourself,

618
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,050
it's dangerous for them,
and for us.

619
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,220
I don't know how things work
in your country,

620
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,720
but it's different here,
and I don't want any trouble!

621
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,770
The inmates stay put,
and so does my guard.

622
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,450
I can put them
to sleep.

623
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:03,520
[keys jangle]

624
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,100
[Peter] Our prayers...

625
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,300
they didn't hurt it.

626
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,410
Balban is the demon
of deceit.

627
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,180
You cannot believe anything
that comes from it.

628
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,040
Not even what it
tells you about me.

629
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,180
<i>It will always play
with our biggest fears.</i>

630
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,550
<i>And even as it agonizes,</i>

631
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,190
it will make us believe
it is still strong.

632
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:39,290
It is the best weapon
to destroy our faith.

633
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,870
<i>And, above all things,</i>

634
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,970
<i>never make a deal with it.</i>

635
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,540
If you do, he will always win.

636
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:56,580
[mumbling prayer]

637
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,940
[steam hisses]

638
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,000
- [cell door slams]
- [lock clicks]

639
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,240
[Michael]
<i>Demons reject holy water.</i>

640
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,440
This will make it float
around the room.

641
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,140
making it impossible
for Balban to jump

642
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,110
from one body
to the next.

643
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,220
I bet it's new.

644
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,380
Doesn't have the Vatican
seal of approval.

645
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:44,760
Peter, the conventional ritual
will not work against Balban.

646
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,760
For centuries,
the Church has used

647
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,760
the same ritual
in exorcisms.

648
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,630
But the devil's
not a fool.

649
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,070
He's learned.

650
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,570
He won't fall twice
for the same trick.

651
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,300
That's human.

652
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,510
What has the Vatican done?

653
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,010
[chuckles]

654
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,710
Perfect the ritual?

655
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,350
Plan a strategy through time?

656
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:08,810
No.

657
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,020
They send us into battle,

658
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,720
but they leave us alone.

659
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,290
Sometimes, I think the devil's
in the Vatican's own ranks.

660
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:19,160
- Michael, that...
- Shh!

661
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,230
The consequence of this
is the auteur exorcism.

662
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:26,430
Each priest performs
the exorcism

663
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,700
as he wants.

664
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,100
The problem is,
many faithless priests hesitate.

665
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,570
And that makes
the demon stronger.

666
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,440
Michael, I...

667
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,410
use that ritual.

668
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:43,580
And only God and the devil
know why you're not dead.

669
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,250
But without a ritual...

670
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,420
how will I do it?

671
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,190
By not believing
God is with you...

672
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,070
but by believing
you are God.

673
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,010
[Magali]
She wants to be an astronaut.

674
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,840
Or a film director.

675
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,950
She didn't pick
easy ones.

676
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,710
[chuckles]

677
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,280
She's obsessive.

678
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,280
When she wants something,
she doesn't give up.

679
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,790
She... She goes on and on,

680
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,360
and you want to kill her.

681
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,760
[laughs]

682
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,690
But at the end,
she always gets what she wants.

683
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,330
I've never met her
and my heart is already hers.

684
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,110
Magali, I'm sorry.

685
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,440
Forgive me.

686
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,280
- I was hard on you.
- No.

687
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,780
I let it in, Magali.

688
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,150
I fell for its temptation.

689
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,620
I had you in my arms,
and kissed you, and...

690
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,330
Shh.

691
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:03,900
[sighs]

692
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,900
I thank God it happened.

693
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,440
If not, I wouldn't have her.

694
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,640
My gift.

695
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,680
My miracle.

696
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,660
My Esperanza (hope).

697
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:24,650
For many years...

698
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,890
I couldn't accept that...

699
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,190
very deep down...

700
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,690
I was falling in love with you
without realizing.

701
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,270
I'm sorry.

702
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,840
[speaks Spanish]
Every door is secured.

703
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,760
- We'll be here in the morning.
- Alright.

704
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,260
God bless you, father.

705
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:36,220
Father...

706
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,690
save her.

707
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,330
I swear to God.

spoke to God last night.

May God be with you.

715

[Michael]
And with your spirit.

716
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,770
- He wants to kill my children.
- Silence.

717
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:40,110
I told you, you can't believe
anything from it.

718
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,840
It's just trying
to scare you.

734
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,760
You're going to be okay.

735
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,700
You're going
to be all right.

Dear merciful God,

743

the prayer
of the Blessed Virgin Mary!

[metal clanks]

746
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,780
Dying on the cross.

747
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,050
Just the head
of ancient serpents.

748
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,630
I declare you anathema,
Satan.

749
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,160
Enemy of human salvation.

750
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,560

751
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,630
[Michael] And entrusted

752

[all roaring]

754
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,080
St. Michael.

Archangel.

756
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,760
Prince of heaven...

757
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,030
[sizzling]

758
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:14,110
Fair trial sentenced your pride
and your envy...

759
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,740
Go back to hell!

760
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,450
- Go back to hell!
- [growls]

761
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,350

- Yes!

769
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,550
Yes! Run!

You okay?

775
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,370
What...?

776
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,840
You lied to me!

777
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,040
What are you talking about?

778
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,880
Your prayer,
it didn't work.

779
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,210
What sin are you
carrying with you?

780
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,510
Speak!

781
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:04,520
[panting]

782

Esperanza.

783
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,390
Eighteen years ago...

784
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:13,120
She's your daughter.

785
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:15,230
God, Peter,
what have you done?

786
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:18,130
It wasn't me. I was possessed.
It was Balban.

787
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,370
- Your sin let him in!
- It wasn't me!

788
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:24,400
I told you,
you weren't ready.

789
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,940
- What did you want me to do?
- What about confessing?

790
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,640
God would have
forgiven you!

791
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,940
I did. I confessed.

792
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,010
But I couldn't fulfill
my penance.

793
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,980
Now you'll never be able
to defeat Balban

794
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,520
or save the children
or your daughter!

795
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,780
You can do it.

796
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,420
You can exorcise them.

797
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,120
You defeated Balban once.

798
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,020
[laughs]

799
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,160
Peter, Balban didn't lie.

800
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,790
In order to save
the possessed child,

801
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,360
I had to make a deal with him.

802
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,530
I sold my soul to him

803
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:55,200
and lost all power over him.

804
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:57,070
[loud crashing]

805
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,270
They're waiting for me,
Peter.

806
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,970
When I die...

807
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:06,650
I'm going to burn in...

808
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,390
- [loud crashing continuous]
- [objects clattering]

809
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,330
- Stand up.
- No, no, no.

810
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,730
Stand.

811
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,700
I'm sorry.

812
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,700
Stand up! Stand up!

813
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,370
[loud crashing
and banging continuous]

814
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,480
Peter...

815
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,880
Balban will tempt you
by using your biggest weakness.

816
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,850
But you already know
the only rule.

817
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,320
Don't make a deal with him.

818
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,590
[whimpers]

819
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,830
There is no place for God
and the devil

820
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:54,690
in the same body.

821
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,330
Always remember that.

822
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,000
Let me go.

823
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,730
No, no, no, no.

824
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,070
[loud crash]

825
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,510

[sobbing softly]

831
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:08,570
I'm Father Peter.

832
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,400
Peter Williams.

833
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:18,210
Eighteen years ago,
while I performed an exorcism...

834
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,350
on Magali Valasquez, I...

835
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,320
was tempted by Balban.

836
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:30,190
And I was...

837
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:33,560
dominated by own feelings,
and...

838
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:38,000
my forbidden desires for her.

839
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,800
So...

840
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:45,100
I broke my vows with God...

841
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,910
and Balban
took advantage of this

842
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,110
to possess me

843
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,380
and sexually abuse her.

844
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,750
The fruit of this sin

845
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,620
is that her...

846
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,420
daughter, Esperanza...

847
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,700
my daughter.

848
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,340
<i>I destroyed the videotape
that proves my crime,</i>

849
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,470

850
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:22,740

to be served on Earth,</i>

God doesn't exist.

858
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,340
Save her.

Under the Almighty's authority,

865
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,510
I command you to leave
these daughters of God.

866

- God is inside.

It is God who commands you.

The Holy Spirit commands you.

Okay, okay, okay.
I'll do it.

[demonic laughter]

969
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,630
If you expel me,

they all come with me
to hell.

971
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,900
No!

972

Decide now.

And you'll save
my daughter too?

991
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,020
I will free Esperanza
and all the children.

992
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,190
Deal.

112 sick children,

1014
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,860
by just placing his hands
on top of them.

1015
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:04,860
Are we in the presence
of a living saint?

for defeating the man

1033

who would have become
a living saint.

1034
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,510

1035
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:59,080
to save his daughter
and the children.

1036
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,510
