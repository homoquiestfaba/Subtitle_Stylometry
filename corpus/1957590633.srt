1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,051
- Oh.

2
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,525
(horns honking)

3
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,094
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:28,928
Come on.

5
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,369
(tires screeching)

6
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,303
(horn blaring)

7
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,906
Fuck you, you complete moron!

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,020
- [Office Worker] Can
you hold the door please?

9
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:56,723
- Awe.

10
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,724
- What are you looking at?

11
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,825
- Uh, nothing.

12
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,293
- It's beautiful.

13
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,162
- Just an anniversary
card my wife gave me.

14
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:02,929
- Oh.

15
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,330
- If you live to be a hundred,

16
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,167
I want to live to be a
hundred minus one day

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,303
so I never have to
live without you.

18
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,305
- Do you and your wife
share a birthdate?

19
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,407
- I'm two and a half
years older than she is.

20
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,876
- If you die when you're
100 and your wife dies a day

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,313
before she turns 100, that's
30 months after your death.

22
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,581
If she doesn't want
to live without you,

23
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,316
the card should say
that she wants to live

24
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,287
to roughly 97 and six months
old, if you die at 100.

25
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,231
- [Caroline] Morning.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,233
- [Office Worker] Thank you.

27
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,634
- Oh, hey, Justin.

28
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:43,770
Hi.

29
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:44,571
- [Office Worker] Hi.

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,106
- Hey.

31
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,307
Hi, how are you?

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,441
- [Office Worker] Okay.

33
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,976
- Morning.

34
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,978
- So it's still considered
sexual harassment,

35
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,747
even if I say just
kidding afterwards?

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,716
- Yes, George, it is.

37
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,517
Mint?

38
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,694
- How did it go
with our new client?

39
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,897
- Barry, would it be
possible for me to take on

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,899
different types of clients?

41
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,135
- Sexual harassment is
our bread and butter.

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,670
- I have lots of ideas
for methods to help people

43
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,506
in more profound ways.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,976
- People don't want to be
helped in profound ways.

45
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,312
They just want to sign a
document and not get sued.

46
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,649
If we get any sort
of special projects,

47
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,520
you will be my first call.

48
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,160
- Last night's relative
abundance was still 23%.

49
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:41,961
- Shit.

50
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:43,930
Charts.

51
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,205
This is the most stubborn
bacterium I've ever seen.

52
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,306
It won't die.

53
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,678
We need a larger sample size.

54
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,513
- I hear that Pearson's
announcing the Adler grant

55
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,749
at the faculty meeting.

56
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,450
- Morning, Dr Stern.
- Congratulations, Dr Stern!

57
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,286
- Thank you.
-Congratulations.

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,521
- Speaking of things
that won't die.

59
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,057
- Her leukemia vaccine just got
approved for clinical trial.

60
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,359
- Thank you everyone.

61
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,095
But the real victors
are the children.

62
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,597
I do it all for the children.

63
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,533
- Cancer researchers
are the worst.

64
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,367
What do you want, Laura?

65
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,702
- Just saying hi.

66
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,371
I haven't seen anyone
since my book tour.

67
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,541
How are things going with
your new, uh, hand sanitizer?

68
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,277
- Sanitizer is only one
potential application

69
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,913
of my research, which
is going swimmingly.

70
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,317
- If you need any extra
supplies, just visit my new lab.

71
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,954
They keep giving me
stuff I don't even need.

72
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,490
Bye guys!

73
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,592
- [Lab Workers] Have a good day!

74
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,527
- Bye!
- Congratulations!

75
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,034
- Alright, I am happy to report
that one of our own has won

76
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,638
the Margaret Adler Grant
for Women in Science.

77
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,475
Her work has made this
department very proud.

78
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,310
Congratulations, Laura!

79
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,478
(group clapping)

80
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,146
Your leukemia
vaccine has brought

81
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,515
a lot of media attention
to the University.

82
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,551
- Well, I do it all
for the children.

83
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,487
- Well, we'll hold a press
conference about this tomorrow.

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,423
Keep up the great
work, everyone.

85
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,360
- I'm sure you'll
get the next one.

86
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,265
It's just honest competition
between colleagues.

87
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,699
It's not personal.

88
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,571
- The only reason you won is
because you spend more time

89
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,774
posing for photo ops
than in a laboratory.

90
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,809
- I need to be an
advocate for the work.

91
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,279
I speak for those
who have no voice.

92
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,848
- Hearing you speak makes
me want to hurl myself

93
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,683
in front of a moving vehicle.

94
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,285
I don't respect you as
a scientist or human.

95
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,654
You're a complete fraud.

96
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,757
You probably stole your vaccine
idea from some grad student,

97
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,494
and I am pretty sure
those children hate you.

98
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,733
I need to speak for
those who have no voice.

99
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,741
(quirky music)

100
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,685
- [Actor] What is the hoopla?

101
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,920
Isn't this like your
primary military specialty--

102
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,488
- [Moviegoer] That guy's fat.

103
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,290
- [Moviegoer] And gay.

104
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:26,959
- Shh!

105
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,597
- [Moviegoer] No,
mommy shushed us.

106
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,765
What do we do?

107
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,968
- [Moviegoer] Let's
go cry about it.

108
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,704
- Were you born this
way or did you suffer

109
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,706
some sort of major
trauma to the head?

110
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,473
- [Moviegoer] Hey!

111
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,808
- [Moviegoer] Shh!

112
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,209
- [Moviegoer] Keep it down!

113
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,144
- I pity everyone
you've ever met.

114
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,345
- [Moviegoer] Quiet!

115
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,214
- [Usher] Ma'am, I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

116
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,816
You can't keep
harassing our customers.

117
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,818
This is the third
time this month.

118
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,986
- Maybe you shouldn't
allow total sub-humans

119
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,722
into your theater.

120
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,491
- [Usher] Ma'am, please.

121
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,659
- Okay, fine.

122
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,828
I'll go.

123
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,895
- [Moviegoer] Outta here!

124
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,832
(crowd clapping)

125
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,873
(door slamming shut)

126
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,779
(playful music)

127
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,931
- I think we have pretty good
chemistry between you and I.

128
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,733
- Between you and me.

129
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,734
- [Jake] Hmm?

130
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,070
- You said between you and I.

131
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,374
It's the object
of a preposition.

132
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,910
You wouldn't say she comes to I.

133
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,211
It's she comes to me.

134
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,045
- Yeah.

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,881
Okay.

136
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,051
Nobody is coming tonight.

137
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,324
- What so I'm just
supposed to be wrong?

138
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,351
What's going on?

139
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,822
- Laura Stern killed
herself last night.

140
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,593
- So they're giving
me the Adler Grant?

141
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,694
- Dr Wolfe...

142
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,699
- They're not giving
me the Adler Grant?

143
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,167
What?

144
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,102
People think it's my fault?

145
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,305
- How could you speak
to her like that?

146
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,508
We women in science are
supposed to support one another.

147
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,943
- You didn't even like her.

148
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,478
- At least I didn't kill her.

149
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,884
(door slamming shut)

150
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,221
- Did you or did you
not tell Dr Stern

151
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,458
that she was a complete
fraud hated by children?

152
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,894
And did you mention something
about throwing oneself

153
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,529
in front of a moving vehicle?

154
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,698
- Is that how she did it?

155
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,100
I was just saying what
everyone else was thinking.

156
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,870
- Serena, you're a
gifted microbiologist.

157
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,606
Nobody kills pathogenic
antibiotic-resistant bacteria

158
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,541
like you, but you have
become a liability.

159
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,408
- Don.

160
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,610
- I've got the
University to hold off

161
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,811
on doing anything with you yet.

162
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,612
- Thanks.

163
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,146
- On one condition.

164
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,416
You are to undergo intensive
sensitivity training,

165
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,384
starting immediately.

166
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,652
- Sensitivity what?

167
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,088
- You'll meet with
a sensitivity coach

168
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:46,092
and she will decide the
proper course of action.

169
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,262
(quirky music)

170
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,170
- Fuck me.

171
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,673
- You must be Dr Wolfe.

172
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,842
I'm Caroline Sanders.

173
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,111
I'm so sorry for your loss.

174
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,346
- Why are you touching me?

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,983
- The woman who passed away,
Dr Stern, was your colleague.

176
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,018
- Oh, right.

177
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,255
- This is a safe space.

178
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,490
You can cry if you'd like.

179
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,457
- I do not cry.

180
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,292
Ever.

181
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,763
- Why don't we have a seat?

182
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,199
- I have a lot of
work to do so--

183
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,534
- Serena.

184
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,336
May I call you, Serena?

185
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,406
From what I've been told, you
do have a lot of work to do.

186
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,107
On yourself.

187
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,443
So, why don't you
sit and tell me

188
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,912
a little bit about your job.

189
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,616
- I am the principal
investigator of my lab.

190
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,286
I specialize in the
Bacillus genus of bacteria.

191
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,388
There is a new species
of Bacillus I discovered

192
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,058
that's resistant to
antibacterial agents.

193
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,928
- Antibacterial agents
like hand sanitizer?

194
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,231
- Hand sanitizer is
one form it could take.

195
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,235
I study the bacterium itself,
its behavior, where it's from,

196
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,406
its pathogenic properties,
and yes, how to kill it.

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,141
- And how would you
describe your relationship

198
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,377
with the people in your lab?

199
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,746
- I would describe it as fine.

200
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,247
- We're naming him Hunter.

201
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,316
- The miracle of life.

202
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,255
- Why am I looking at
your wife's uterus?

203
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,590
- Would you like to
have lunch together?

204
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,425
My mom visited and
I have leftovers.

205
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,460
- Eww.

206
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,364
What is this, a church
potluck in Dayton, Ohio?

207
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,799
(Joan crying)

208
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,536
- Her adopted
mother passed away.

209
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,371
- Cancer.

210
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,376
- At least you don't
have her genes.

211
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,212
Not that you know whose
genes you do have.

212
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,848
Those were taken out of context.

213
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,385
- Can you admit
you have a problem?

214
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,287
- I have a strong personality,
I don't think it's a problem.

215
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,323
It's inconvenient, maybe.

216
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,624
- That's all?

217
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,092
- Science isn't
about personalities.

218
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,527
It's about ideas.

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,729
It's about constant,
vigilant work

220
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,865
to turn those ideas into facts.

221
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,534
I consistently have good ideas.

222
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,538
That's how I got to be where
I am today, not by being nice.

223
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,276
So what do you have, an MSW?

224
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,413
- I have a dual
doctorate in Sociology

225
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,448
and Behavioral Psychology.

226
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,418
You're not the only scientist
in the room, Dr Wolfe.

227
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,220
- Well, you're in
the soft sciences.

228
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,789
So, what's the protocol?

229
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,825
Do I need to read a
pamphlet and sign something?

230
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,093
Take a test?

231
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,628
- If you want to
keep your job here,

232
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,964
the administration will,
I suspect, need to see

233
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,334
a real transformation
from within.

234
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,470
- So I have to hug someone?

235
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,574
- The only one who can sign off

236
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,476
on whether your
sensitivity training

237
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,511
has been a success is I.

238
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,180
- Nice grammar.

239
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,514
- Thank you, Serena.

240
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,150
Now, I have a number of
criteria I'll use to determine

241
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,920
whether you have made a
genuine transformation.

242
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,288
I'm going to shadow you closely.

243
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,322
- Shadow me?

244
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,327
- Why don't you show
me around your lab?

245
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,196
- Put these on.

246
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,030
- What?

247
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,534
- Remember this is my lab.

248
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,303
You're a guest here.

249
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,772
- You won't even know I'm here.

250
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,345
- Okay, so over here we
have isolated samples

251
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,547
of Bacillus Virilis, the
species I'm studying,

252
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,882
in different dilutions.

253
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,052
- Hi, would anyone like a mint?

254
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,853
- Thank you.

255
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,688
- I'm Caroline.

257
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,889
Nice to meet you.

258
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,524
I'm Caroline.

259
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,593
You'll be seeing a
lot of me around here.

260
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,961
Anybody else?

261
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:46,232
- And over here, we have samples
taken from human subjects,

262
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,201
to study the relative
abundance of Bacillus Virilis

263
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,270
among more commonly
found bacteria.

264
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:55,407
- So this new hard-to-kill
bacteria is found on humans?

265
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,176
- It's not dangerous
in the concentrations

266
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,145
that we find it in, but
if it continues to grow,

267
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,046
it could be a problem.

268
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,114
- Would you like
the latest results?

269
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,083
- Hi, I'm Caroline.

270
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,884
Mint?
- There's no eating

271
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,818
in the lab.

272
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,821
- What do you do here?

273
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,556
- I'm Dr Wolfe's grad student.

274
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,827
- Oh, so how long have you
been mentored by Dr Wolfe?

275
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,562
- Ellen, results?

276
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,030
- 21.5% relative abundance.

277
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:18,864
- Shit.

278
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,236
Increase the triclocarbon
by two percent.

279
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,305
- Ellen, how does
it make you feel

280
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,474
when Dr Wolfe is short with you?

281
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,843
- How does it what?

282
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,777
- Swab her.

283
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,816
- What's happening?

284
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,719
- I'm including you in my study.

285
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,088
- I'm sensing some hostility.

286
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,024
I know that I may seem
like an intrusion,

287
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,259
but I am here to help you.

288
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,762
- What's going on?

289
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,865
- Some sort of extreme
behavior modification therapy.

290
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,967
- And we get to watch?

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,003
(soft guitar music)

292
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,243
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,781
- Wow, interesting day.
- Mommy!

294
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,351
- Okay, Mommy has a project.

295
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,086
So let's go make
dinner while she works.

296
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,088
- [Maggie] What's going on?

297
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,758
- I met a woman who
really needs my help.

298
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,795
(soft guitar music)

299
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,836
- [Serena] She started it!

300
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,010
(knocking on door)

301
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:47,353
(knocking on door)

302
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,187
- Uh!

303
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,389
- Morning!

304
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,724
Coffee?

305
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,791
- Did someone else die?

306
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,393
- Nice PJs.

307
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,461
- Did I die?

308
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,495
Is this hell?

309
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,730
- Lovely home.

310
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,033
I wanted to get our day
off to a good start.

311
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,901
- How did you get
into my building?

312
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,604
- I buzzed and buzzed,
but you didn't answer.

313
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,872
Carl let me in.

314
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,840
- Who the hell is Carl?

315
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,008
- Your building manager.

316
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,609
He is a sweet guy.

317
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,444
- I don't understand
why you're in my home.

318
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,846
Is this legal?

319
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,347
- When I mentioned that
I would be shadowing you,

320
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,716
I didn't just mean at work.

321
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,586
(phone ringing)

322
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,887
- [Operator] 911, what
is your emergency?

323
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,622
- Yes, I'd like to
report an intruder.

324
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,090
Her name is...

325
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,992
What's your name again?

326
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,263
Caroline Sanders, PhD.

327
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,065
She's in the soft
sciences, though.

328
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,166
- [Operator] You
know the intruder?

329
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,834
- May I?

330
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,902
Hi!

331
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,637
I promise to help her
become the kind of person

332
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,439
who respects your time.

333
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,107
Thank you so much for
your brave service

334
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,677
to the people of Los Angeles.

335
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,682
Why don't you get ready and
we'll drive to work together?

336
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,450
Thank you for showing
me your apartment

337
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,085
and giving me a ride.

338
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,688
- You showed up unannounced
and insisted I drive you.

339
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,022
- When a colleague
says thank you,

340
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,992
a simple, you're
welcome, goes a long way.

341
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,627
- I called the police on you.

342
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,797
That's the definition
of not welcome.

343
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,166
- You're very concerned
with being right.

344
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,967
- Is that a bad overall
goal? (phone ringing)

345
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,369
- It makes it difficult to form

346
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,204
deeper relationships
with people.

347
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,539
- [Don] Serena?

348
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,042
- Don, I woke up with a
malignant parasitic cyst

349
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,011
called a sensitivity coach.

350
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,346
- Hi, Dr Pierson.

351
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,914
- You know how close I
am to a breakthrough.

352
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,582
How am I supposed to
get any work done?

353
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,417
This has thrown me
completely off-kilter.

354
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,187
- [Don] Serena, if you
want to keep your job,

355
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,755
you have to complete
this training.

356
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,191
- Can they really blame
me for Laura's death?

357
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,992
Maybe she had a
chemical imbalance?

358
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,227
Was she on medication?

359
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,029
(phone clicking)

360
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,831
Don?

361
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,599
- You have a lovely apartment.

362
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:44,036
I noticed you don't have any
photos of family and friends.

363
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,805
- Why are people so
obsessed with photos?

364
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,108
Don't they know what
their children look like?

365
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,411
- This is my partner Sarah
and my daughter Maggie.

366
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,181
Photos help me keep
my loved ones with me.

367
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,750
- I was married once.

368
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,418
In college.

369
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,820
It ended after a year.

370
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,955
- I'm sorry you
went through that.

371
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,822
(tires screeching)

372
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,857
- What the hell?

373
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,925
Did your mother drop you?

374
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,193
- Just kidding!

375
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,162
We're sure you had a perfectly
good reason to do that.

376
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,333
We're going to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

377
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,705
(quirky music)

378
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,312
- People are transferring
to different labs.

379
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,982
They say they don't want
to work for you anymore.

380
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,316
Hey, that's mine!

381
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,455
- [Caroline] That's
a lot to take in.

382
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,390
How's that make you feel?

383
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,191
- Fine.

384
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,226
(drill buzzing)

385
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,062
I have wanted to work
on a project like this

386
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,196
my entire career.

387
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,231
It was not easy
to get my own lab.

388
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,801
(tape snapping)

389
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,069
People belittle my research.

390
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,171
They say I'm making
hand sanitizer,

391
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,174
but antibiotic
resistance is dangerous.

392
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,110
I may not be curing cancer,
but I am helping people.

393
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,078
(drill buzzing) Hey!

394
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,279
Could you just...

395
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,448
Do you have to do
that right now?

396
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,916
- Just doing my job.

397
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,252
- Thank you for taking
such pride in your work.

398
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,554
- You're welcome.

399
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,325
- Serena, you study bacteria.

400
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,327
I study human behavior.

401
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,598
How do you determine how to
kill drug-resistant bacteria?

402
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,134
- Perpetual
observation, hypothesis,

403
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,169
and then methodical testing
until I get a favorable result.

404
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,172
- And I'm going to observe
you in your environment,

405
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,075
generate a hypothesis as to
why you are the way you are,

406
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,845
though I have a few
ideas, and work with you

407
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,347
to mitigate your behavior
and neutralize your effect

408
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,351
on the environment until
I get a favorable result.

409
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,355
- Did you just liken me
to a pathogenic bacterium?

410
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,324
Oh, now you're done.

411
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,459
Thank you, thank you so much.

412
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,428
- You're welcome.

413
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,030
- What was so fucking important?

414
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,506
How quickly can you even
get one of these made?

415
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,007
- It's beautifully done.

416
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,774
- Got it.

417
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,018
- Can you succeed in your
research without a staff?

418
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,623
- Okay, so that's definitely
university property.

419
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,367
Okay.

420
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,201
People!

421
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,971
I know I can be a bit abrasive.

422
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,943
And I'm sorry for
the way I've behaved.

423
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:43,615
I'm receiving help and
learning to be more sensitive.

424
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,953
Please stay.

425
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:48,787
I...

426
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,957
I believe in the
work that we're doing

427
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,792
and I know you do too.

428
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,811
What now?

429
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,247
- We get to work.

430
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,418
Welcome to our safe space.

431
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,458
Let's start with the basics.

432
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,827
When someone gives you a lab
result that you don't like,

433
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,564
try saying thank you
instead of swearing at them.

434
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,568
- So you want me to
thank someone for
giving me shitty news?

435
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,570
- It's acknowledging
the effort it took

436
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,706
to give you that news.

437
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,376
- Hey, Caroline, your
kitten has feline AIDS.

438
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,746
- I don't have a kitten, but
thank you for that information.

439
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,848
Let's do a quick role-play.

440
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,883
I'll be a colleague you
find really annoying.

441
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,552
- Tough to imagine.

442
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,588
- Dr Wolfe, is it okay if I
leave work early tomorrow?

443
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,590
My boyfriend's taking
me out and I'd rather go

444
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,261
on a date with my boyfriend
than make hand sanitizer.

445
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,430
Now, you respond in
a respectful way.

446
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,001
- I'm not responding to that.

447
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,302
- I feel--

448
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,771
- Why can't I just say
what I want to say?

449
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,673
- If you begin by using, I feel,

450
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,642
the person's less
likely to be offended.

451
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,977
You're simply stating
how you personally feel.

452
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,713
- Okay, I feel that's retarded.

453
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,651
- Many people find
that word offensive.

454
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,619
- But it's what I feel.

455
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,988
- Get it all out.

456
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,263
That's okay.

457
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,297
I have more.

458
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,205
Let's talk about your parents.

459
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,808
- Should I lie on a couch
and recover a memory

460
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,210
of being fondled by my uncle?

461
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,812
- Were you?

462
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:54,846
That's a joke.

463
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,281
Unless you were.

464
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,385
I'm trying to figure out why
your defenses are so high.

465
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,853
- My defenses?

466
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,057
- Your quick temper,
condescension, your need to say

467
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,092
every insult that
pops into your brain.

468
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,894
- Not every insult.

469
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,930
- These are your
defense mechanisms.

470
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,201
What are you protecting
yourself from?

471
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,038
Let's discuss your triggers.

472
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,075
What gets you really annoyed?

473
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,710
What do you hate?

474
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,645
- I get to talk
about what I hate?

475
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,779
- Of course.

476
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,614
- And I can say whatever I want?

477
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,449
- Please.

478
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,684
- Okay.

479
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,688
I hate being wrong.

480
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,760
I hate it when I'm right
but people think I'm wrong.

481
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,462
I hate when a person is
wrong but they insist,

482
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,498
despite all available
evidence, that they're right.

483
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,934
I hate that it's considered
rude to correct people.

484
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,969
They should just say thank you.

485
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,171
I hate when people get
recognition they don't deserve.

486
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,806
I detest small talk.

487
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,108
I don't want to talk
about the weather.

488
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,709
I don't want to
talk about traffic.

489
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,278
If you think you have some
special, magical route

490
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,980
to get to work, I don't
want to hear about it.

491
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,715
It's probably not that good.

492
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,885
I hate when people inflict
their personal problems onto me.

493
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,122
I hate when people bring their
children or pets into work

494
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,190
or force you to look
at vacation photos.

495
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,460
I also hate when women
put on that voice

496
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:19,698
when they speak to or
about children or animals.

497
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,634
I don't want to hear about
your hobbies, marriages,

498
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,003
where you bought a particular
item, whether it was on sale.

499
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,539
I hate when people
listen to music so loudly

500
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,708
that you can hear it
through their headphones.

501
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,977
I hate when people make up
abbreviations for things

502
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,012
and use them in regular speech.

503
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,081
I hate emoticons; I never
understand what they mean.

504
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,049
I hate overzealous huggers.

505
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,451
I hate the word bro.

506
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,020
I hate the overuse
of exclamation marks.

507
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,223
I hate when I'm parallel
parking and the car behind me

508
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,860
honks like they have no idea
why I'm not driving forward

509
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:53,098
as though they've never
parked in their entire life.

510
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,401
I hate the color purple,
not the book or the movie,

511
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,903
just the actual color.

512
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,105
I hate proposal videos.

513
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,673
I hate flash mobs.

514
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,075
I hate the phrase baby bump.

515
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,577
I hate that's what
she said jokes.

516
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,113
I hate when men use erection
metaphors to describe

517
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,315
something that they
really like, for example,

518
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,919
I have a total hard on
for this deep-dish pizza.

519
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,487
I hate deep-dish pizza.

520
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,823
I also hate mini cupcakes.

521
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,325
I hate when people speak
in random foreign accents

522
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,860
like it's inherently funny.

523
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,030
Sounding vaguely
British isn't funny.

524
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,602
- Thank you, Serena.

525
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,137
That was a good start.

526
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,971
- I could keep going.

527
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:33,972
- No, no.

528
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,407
That was plenty.

529
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,014
Today wasn't so bad was it?

530
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:43,849
- Yes?

531
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,319
- [Ethan] Serena, it's Ethan.

532
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,720
- Oh.

533
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,021
Hey.

534
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,089
- Who's this?

535
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,424
- None of your business.

536
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,658
- [Ethan] Am I on speaker?

537
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,826
- I'm driving.

538
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,094
- [Ethan] Is someone
else with you?

539
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,028
- Hello!

540
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,698
I'm Caroline, who's this?

541
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,433
- [Ethan] Ethan,
Serena's brother.

542
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,567
- Sorry to interrupt.

543
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,936
- Can I call you back later?

544
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,871
- [Ethan] Sure.

545
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,405
- Great thanks, bye.
- I need to talk to you.

546
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,206
- You have a brother?

547
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,208
- Half-brother.

548
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:14,079
- Hmm, he sounded
like a teen in crisis.

549
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,947
How old were you
when he was born?

550
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,748
- 17.

551
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,283
I barely know him.

552
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,285
- Your parents are divorced?

553
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:24,155
- My father left and
then my mother met Glenn.

554
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,325
- That must have
been hard for you.

555
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,495
Where do you go to
unwind after work?

556
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,133
- [Actor] Oh, when
did you get it?

557
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,302
Okay.

558
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,137
So?

559
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,538
- [Moviegoer] You tell him.

560
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,373
- Shh.

561
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,142
- [Moviegoer] She's
too pretty for him.

562
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,443
- [Moviegoer] Mm-hm.

563
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,878
- As much as I love your
brilliant commentary,

564
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,446
do you think you could
keep it to yourself?

565
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,481
- Serena.

566
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,382
- It's fine.

567
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,884
This happens all the time.

568
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,452
- [Moviegoer] I'm just
trying to watch the movie.

569
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,656
- Could you watch it
with your mouth closed?

570
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,090
- [Usher] Ma'am.

571
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,793
- What's happening?

572
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,028
- We have to go now.

573
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:03,962
- What?

574
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,797
- We're being kicked out.

575
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,598
Come on.

576
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,239
- Why did you engage with her?

577
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,840
- She started it.

578
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,242
She shouldn't have been talking.

579
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,545
- Yes, but you
always have a choice.

580
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,247
Would you rather
be right or not get

581
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,215
kicked out of the theater?

582
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,453
I mean, when was the last time
you saw the end of a movie?

583
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,425
(buzzer buzzing)

584
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:37,095
Happy second week of
sensitivity training!

585
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,836
Don't do that!

586
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,339
Come on, open it.

587
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,247
Do you like him?

588
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,450
- I don't understand
what's happening.

589
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,018
- [Caroline] Caring
for another creature

590
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,820
is part of your training.

591
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,355
Haven't you ever had a pet?

592
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,489
- This isn't a pet.

593
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,326
This is a cesspool for
pathogenic bacteria.

594
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,961
- But isn't he cute?

595
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,301
- [Serena] Most small
turtles are illegal.

596
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,936
They're smuggled in
from other countries

597
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,373
and they destroy the ecosystems
of our ponds and rivers.

598
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,308
- This isn't the
illegal kind of turtle.

599
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,478
He's the adorable
pet kind of turtle.

600
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,682
- It probably has Salmonella.

601
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,051
- You like bacteria.

602
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,554
It'll give you two
something to talk about.

603
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,523
- [Serena] I really have
to care for this thing?

604
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,326
- You have to give him a
name, give him a nice home.

605
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,195
Think about him when
you're not around.

606
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,264
It's all part of being a person.

607
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,067
- First, I'm going to
test him for Salmonella.

608
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,304
- Okay, remember what we've
practiced about taking a breath

609
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,374
if you don't like what you hear.

610
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,442
And.

611
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,414
Here's your new stress ball.

612
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,882
It's a molecule.

613
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:05,884
Squeeze it!

614
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,760
- Morning, Ellen.

615
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,064
- Good morning, Dr Wolfe.

616
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,866
- How was your
evening last night?

617
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,503
- It was good, actually, I--

618
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,604
- Wonderful.

619
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,473
Do you have the results
from last night's tests?

620
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,607
- Yeah, it was 26%.

621
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,508
- Shit.

622
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,510
A three percent increase?

623
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,683
I mean, okay, thank you
for that information.

624
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,655
- Dr Wolfe, could you
take a look at this?

625
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,260
- Interesting.

626
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,297
Thanks for pointing this out.

627
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,232
- Dr Wolfe, I had an idea
I wanted to show you.

628
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,166
What if we--

629
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,067
- No, that wouldn't work.

630
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,570
Here, test this for Salmonella.

631
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:00,839
- Oh.

632
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,712
- I think it's safe to say
that didn't go very well.

633
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,481
- The virilis count should
be decreasing by now.

634
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,082
I don't know what I'm missing.

635
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:15,019
- We need to discuss how you
just spoke to Ellen out there.

636
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,523
- I'm sorry I didn't play
nice at your tea party,

637
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,560
but I'm trying to prevent
a public health crisis.

638
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,063
This is science,
not little league.

639
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,700
- Positive reinforcement
encourages productivity.

640
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,568
- Are you even a real person

641
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,004
or are you a schizophrenic
hallucination?

642
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,106
Should I be on medication?

643
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,007
- Probably.

644
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,212
(playful music)

645
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,525
- Thanks for letting
me drive today.

646
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,227
(toy squeaking)

647
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,562
- [Maggie] Hello!

648
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,796
- [Caroline] Maggie,
what did I tell you

649
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,264
about throwing your toys?

650
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,400
- Why is there a small
child in the vehicle?

651
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,570
- Serena, this is my
little monster, Maggie.

652
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,405
Maggie, this is Serena.

653
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,439
We work together.

654
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,774
- Not exactly.

655
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,977
- Do you do sex
people her past meat?

656
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,314
- That's how she says
sexual harassment.

657
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,748
- Does she have a
learning disability?

658
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,884
- No, she's just five.

659
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,552
- I'm almost six!

660
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,121
And I'm going to have the
biggest birthday party ever!

661
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,423
- Sarah had an early meeting

662
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,959
so I'm driving Maggie
to school today.

663
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,362
- It's not going to be
a long drive, is it?

664
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,997
- This could be an
opportunity for you

665
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,299
to work on your hostility
toward children.

666
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,934
- You don't like kids?

667
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,436
- Not especially.

668
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,303
- Me neither.

669
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,005
They're mean and stupid.

670
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,640
- Don't say that, honey.

671
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,875
Maggie's having some
trouble at school.

672
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,677
Some of the kids
are picking on her.

673
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,679
- You should just tell
them all to go to hell.

674
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,014
- Uh, no, honey.

675
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,416
You should be the bigger
person like we talked about.

676
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,185
They'll follow your lead.

677
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,886
- She should stand
up for herself.

678
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,722
- [Caroline] She should
turn the other cheek.

679
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,257
- Why are they picking on you?

680
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,192
Is it because your
mothers are lesbians?

681
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:34,993
- No.

682
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,561
It's because I'm purple.

683
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,996
- What do you mean
you're purple?

684
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,330
You mean you like purple?

685
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,832
- I love purple.

686
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,033
Purple is me.

687
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,568
- Purple is I.

688
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,535
- You're not purple.

689
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,570
You're gray.

690
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,007
- She's going through an
identity assertion phase.

691
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,409
She identifies with
the color purple.

692
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,779
Not the novel, the actual color.

693
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:59,050
- The other kids say that
purple is dumb, so I'm dumb.

694
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,885
- Purple is dumb.

695
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,292
- Here we are.

696
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,593
Say bye to Serena.

697
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,061
- Bye to Serena.

698
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,967
- The next time someone
says something mean to you,

699
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,902
just tell them this.

700
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,938
(Serena whispering)

701
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,811
- [Caroline] Great,
we'll see you there.

702
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,213
- [Maggie] Bye!

703
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,128
- Ethan.

704
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,496
Hi.

705
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,666
What was it you
wanted to talk about?

706
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,835
You're here?

707
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,841
(upbeat music)

708
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,977
- I'm excited to
meet your brother.

709
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,979
- Half-brother.

710
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,415
(upbeat music)

711
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,391
- Serena!

712
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,237
- You look different.

713
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,139
- I'm Goth now.

714
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,575
- Hi, I'm Caroline.

715
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,377
We spoke on the
phone the other day.

716
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,011
- Nice to meet you.

717
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,113
How long have you
guys been friends?

718
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,047
- We're not.

719
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,348
We work together.

720
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,084
- Cool.

721
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,119
Are you a scientist, too?

722
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,053
- Yes.

723
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,422
As a matter of fact, I am.

724
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,158
So, Ethan, what
brings you to LA?

725
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,627
- Things aren't going so
well back home in Riverside.

726
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,628
- Where are you staying?

727
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,930
- Crashing at my
friend Damian's.

728
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:57,168
He's got five other roommates
so I'm sleeping in the tub.

729
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,170
- Is Damian in school?

730
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,006
- No, he dropped out
to follow his passion.

731
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,874
- And that is?

732
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,808
- Body art.

733
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,211
- Is that a type of dance?

734
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,882
- He lets me stay
with him if I let him

735
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,917
practice his designs on me.

736
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,419
He's a tattoo genius.

737
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,754
- The genius spelled
despair incorrectly.

738
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,323
- Yeah, that's why
he needs to practice.

739
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,160
- Can't he practice
with a dictionary and
not on your flesh?

740
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,127
- I don't mind the spelling.

741
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,028
It's sort of ironic.

742
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,229
- It's sort of retarded.

743
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,297
- Serena.

744
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,433
- Sorry.

745
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,701
I feel that it's retarded.

746
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,841
So what did you
want to talk about?

747
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,176
- Mom and dad kicked me out.

748
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,444
- Why?

749
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,778
- The same reason
they kicked you out.

750
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,213
- That was different.

751
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,749
- I turned 18 last
week and they told me

752
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,584
I could take care of myself.

753
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,485
- Oh right.

754
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,192
Happy birthday.

755
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,627
- Listen, can I stay with you?

756
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,396
Damian's place is
getting pretty cramped.

757
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,364
- No, that would not work.

758
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,266
- Just for a little while
so I save up some money.

759
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,436
- Believe me, you're better
off at your friend Denny's.

760
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,270
- Damian.

761
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,609
- This should help you out.

762
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,445
Take care.

763
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,281
And get some blood work done,

764
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,351
you've probably been
exposed to hepatitis.

765
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,185
- Thanks.

766
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,624
- Don't you think he should
be with family right now?

767
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,695
- I hardly know him, and I have
the turtle to take care of.

768
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,463
- There must be something
you feel comfortable

769
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,698
doing to help.

770
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,003
- Mm-mm.

771
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,173
Everyone, meet our
new intern, Ethan.

772
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,346
We've been short-staffed
since Laura killed herself

773
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,348
and everyone quit.

774
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,417
And we could use an
extra set of hands.

775
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,154
- He doesn't look
very science-y.

776
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,724
- Joan, please show Ethan
around and find him something

777
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,360
to do that he can't
possibly mess up.

778
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,162
- I'll show you a supply closet.

779
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,400
- Look at you,
being a big sister.

780
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,401
- Half-sister.

781
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,969
- If this works out,
maybe you can invite him

782
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,404
to come stay with you.

783
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,439
- Maybe we can all hold hands

784
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,242
and watch the sun set together.

785
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,414
- I know you're being sarcastic,
but that sounds lovely.

786
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,483
- Fleming's Salmonella
test came back negative.

787
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,984
- You named the turtle Fleming?

788
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,486
That is so cute.

789
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,589
- Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin.

790
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,191
- It's a distinguished name.

791
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,792
- Did you get a
chance to look at my--

792
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,261
- There were errors
in your report.

793
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,062
- Really?

794
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:38,963
I checked all--

795
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,299
- [Serena] I made revisions.

796
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,138
- Serena, don't you think
you were harsh with Ellen?

797
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,440
- I treated her
like a professional.

798
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,209
- That report must have
been 40 pages long.

799
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,209
That's a lot of work.

800
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,811
- Yes, it is.

801
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,713
- Where are you going?

802
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,981
- To the bathroom.

803
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,683
Would you like to come
with and supervise

804
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,618
how I treat the toilet?

805
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,892
(door clicking open)

806
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,728
(Ellen sniffling)

807
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,608
(water gushing)

808
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,614
- It's nothing.

809
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:04,782
- Good job.

810
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,727
- [Caroline] It doesn't
have to be perfect.

811
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,195
- They better not
touch anything.

812
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,064
- Just remember why
you're doing this.

813
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,732
- Because you made me.

814
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,068
- Because it's important
to let people in.

815
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,703
Take an interest
in your colleagues

816
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,172
and let them know
they're appreciated.

817
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,573
- Uh-huh.

818
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,841
(buzzer buzzing)

819
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,677
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

820
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,844
I want to watch.

821
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,379
Hide the iPad by the table.

822
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,414
- Seriously?

823
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,015
- Put your Bluetooth in.

824
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,684
I can help you during dinner.

825
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,018
- Okay, Cyrano.

826
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,889
(buzzer buzzing)

827
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,223
- Hi!

828
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,426
- Welcome, Joan.

829
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,560
- [Caroline] Invite her in.

830
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,429
- Please, come in.

831
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,831
Uh, actually, I don't allow...

832
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,735
Would you mind taking
off your shoes?

833
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,769
- I wiped them.

834
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,670
- It's just--

835
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,638
- [Caroline] Just let it go.

836
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,840
It is too late to call 911.

837
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,941
- Would you like a drink?

838
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,775
- Sure!

839
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,315
- [Caroline] Try
to bond with her.

840
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:15,152
- So, we're just a couple
of women scientists.

841
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:17,855
- Yep.

842
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,958
- [Caroline] Keep it going.

843
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,828
- In such a
male-dominated field.

844
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,662
- Yes.

845
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,801
- Make it more personal.

846
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,403
- When do you menstruate?

847
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,372
Maybe our cycles have
synced due to all the time

848
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,673
we spend together in the lab.

849
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,007
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

850
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,611
Sorry.

851
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,950
(buzzer buzzing)

852
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,219
- [Caroline] Talk!

853
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,423
Serena!

854
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,126
- Why don't you each tell
me about your hobbies?

855
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,961
- [Caroline] Good.

856
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,963
- Sandra and I like to
leave Hunter with a sitter

857
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,098
and go antiquing
in Palm Springs.

858
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,734
- [Caroline] Nod and smile.

859
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,203
- What about you, Joan?

860
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,639
- I've become prolific
in slam poetry

861
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,475
since discovering I was adopted.

862
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,877
- [Caroline] Are you nodding?

863
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,379
- I recently joined the
Quidditch team on campus.

864
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:16,280
- Wow!

865
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,481
- [Dr Hamilton] That's great.

866
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,983
- Quidditch?

867
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,585
- The game from Harry Potter.

868
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,258
- [Caroline] I can't
believe they have that.

869
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,894
- Thank you for coming.

870
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,795
- Thanks for having us.

871
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,063
- We should to this again, soon.

872
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,765
- Good night!

873
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,100
- [Caroline] Great job!

874
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,768
- Please just tell me
I don't have to attend

875
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:38,936
a Quidditch match.

876
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,638
- Baby steps.

877
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,072
I'm really proud of you!

878
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,340
- [Serena] Uh!

879
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,141
- Night!

880
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,676
- [Serena] Mm-hm.

881
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,880
- [Sarah] Did you just coach
her through an entire dinner?

882
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,782
- She says the funniest things.

883
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,484
I mean not a lot of
people could get away

884
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,486
with the stuff she says.

885
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,154
- She can't get away with it.

886
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,156
That's why they
assigned you to her.

887
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,260
And why you're spending
so much time with her.

888
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,531
- I don't know how to explain
it, but I really need this.

889
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,867
(toys crashing)

890
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,901
- [Maggie] Mommy!

891
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,770
- [Sarah] I'll go.

892
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,138
Coming sweetie!

893
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,611
- Dr Wolfe, the last
formula we tried worked.

894
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,747
- It killed 97.3% of the
virilis in the isolated sample.

895
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,549
We're running it
again to make sure.

896
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,218
- Shit, it worked!

897
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,421
- Oh.

898
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:34,024
- Let's double and triple
check these results.

899
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,159
- [Dr Hamilton]
That was strange.

900
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,427
- [Joan] I don't
know, I liked it.

901
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,761
- [Ellen] Me too.

902
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,271
- Congratulations.

903
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,673
- Thanks.

904
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,613
- To teamwork.

905
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,281
- We just drank.

906
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,017
- Can you admit that improved
morale may have contributed

907
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,652
to today's victory?

908
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,288
Come on, I really
like cheersing.

909
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,491
- Alright, I admit it.

910
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,162
- To sensitivity!

911
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,032
- Now, you're pushing it.

912
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,968
To Fleming, the
turtle and the man.

913
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,342
How's Maggie?

914
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,011
- She's tougher than I was.

915
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,146
- You were teased in school too?

916
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,414
- Who wasn't?

917
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,418
- Did they pick on you
because you're a lesbian?

918
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,553
- I was fat.

919
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,226
My mom told me to kill
them with kindness

920
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,296
so no matter what they said
to me, I was nice back,

921
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,964
and that took all the
fun out of teasing me

922
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,399
so they left me alone.

923
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,201
By high school, I
was class secretary

924
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,305
and head of the
homecoming committee.

925
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,275
- Didn't you ever just
want to tell them off?

926
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,513
- Why give them the
satisfaction of seeing me upset?

927
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,282
I know you don't like
talking about it,

928
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,318
but your parents, Ethan?

929
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,428
- My mother is retarded
and my stepfather

930
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,429
is a giant asshole.

931
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,263
- Right.

932
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,435
So, your stepfather...

933
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,070
- Glenn.

934
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:30,307
When my father left, my
mother was destroyed.

935
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,142
Then she met Glenn.

936
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,313
Doesn't that name
sound like someone

937
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,716
you just want to
punch in the face?

938
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,284
- What about John Glenn?

939
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,486
- It's different as a last name.

940
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,189
Glenns would eat vomit and
tell you that they liked it

941
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,658
if you told them it was
a delicacy that required

942
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,927
a refined palate to appreciate.

943
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,163
Glenns walk around in their
boxers and wink at you

944
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:57,201
if you walk in on him
and your mom having sex.

945
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,269
- That's very specific.

946
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,039
- After Ethan was
born and I turned 18,

947
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,375
they said I could
take care of myself.

948
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,543
I put myself through college.

949
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,544
I didn't visit.

950
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,113
I wasn't welcome.

951
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,750
I barely recognized Ethan.

952
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,353
- Now, poor Ethan is going
through the same thing.

953
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,955
- I don't understand it.

954
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,258
I was like this remnant of
my mother's shitty marriage,

955
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,461
but I can't believe that Glenn
would kick out his own son.

956
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,132
- Your mother kicked
out her own daughter.

957
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,968
Didn't you say you
got married young?

958
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,903
- My biology professor.

959
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,607
I was his favorite student.

960
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,309
- And then what?

961
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,613
- He found another
favorite student.

962
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,115
- So you felt abandoned
by your parents

963
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,318
and the person you turned to
for comfort abandoned you too?

964
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,021
- Well, it taught me
to rely on myself.

965
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,292
- I can see why it's hard
for you to trust people.

966
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,029
- I never thought
of it that way.

967
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,499
Did you just therapy me?

968
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,767
Sneaky.

969
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,135
- You liked it.

970
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,775
This is getting gloomy.

971
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,444
What do you normally
do to celebrate

972
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,646
a major scientific breakthrough?

973
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,047
- Oh, I'm usually just annoyed

974
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,216
that I didn't figure
it out sooner.

975
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,853
- I'm not going to
acknowledge you said that.

976
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,323
(Caroline laughs)

977
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,124
Whiskey.

978
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,096
I have a surprise for you.

979
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,897
You're going to love it.

980
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,232
- Okay.

981
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,600
- This is going to be fun.

982
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,701
Okay.

983
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,536
You know how you never get
to see the end of movies

984
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,371
because of your anger
management problem?

985
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,475
- I'd say it's because of the
completely intolerable nature

986
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,143
of the average moviegoer.

987
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,411
- Right.

988
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,146
So I was thinking,
how many great movies

989
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,749
have you never
seen the ending to?

990
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,986
We are going to watch movies
all the way through to the end!

991
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,657
Where is your TV?

992
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,127
- I don't have a TV.

993
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,796
(soft music)

994
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,732
She had the heart of the
ocean the entire time.

995
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,835
And then she just
threw it back in.

996
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,737
The explorer's search
was completely in vain

997
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,105
and I'm pretty sure if
they'd tried harder,

998
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,574
they both could have fit on
that piece of drift wood.

999
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,144
(soft music)

1000
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,781
They had such a
beautiful friendship.

1001
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,618
I can't believe they
chose to die like that.

1002
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,620
- They ran out of options.

1003
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,322
They didn't want to go to jail.

1004
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,626
- They finally found their
freedom and would rather die

1005
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,195
than let anyone take it away.

1006
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,931
- That's deep.

1007
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,733
(suspenseful music) Ah!

1008
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,769
(Caroline laughing)

1009
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,374
Selfie!

1010
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,543
- That's not a word.

1011
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,044
(energetic music)

1012
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,379
Oh my God.

1013
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,947
Is this fight club?

1014
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,215
Are you really me?

1015
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,950
- I'm not you.

1016
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,252
- You can't be me!

1017
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,556
- You're a really
belligerent drunk.

1018
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,623
- Ahhh!

1019
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,025
Fight Club!

1020
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,761
(upbeat music)

1021
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,964
- Staring contest.

1022
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,803
- You have pretty eyes.

1023
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,868
Did you know that
Bruce Willis is dead

1024
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,037
the entire time in
The Sixth Sense?

1025
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,539
- Yeah.

1026
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,974
- What an amazing twist.

1027
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:00,077
I never would've known if
Caroline hadn't shown me.

1028
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,245
(laughing)

1029
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:02,980
- What is it?

1030
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,014
- Huh?

1031
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,948
Oh nothing.

1032
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,517
(laughing)

1033
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,852
- Come on, what?

1034
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,054
- Just something Caroline said.

1035
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,589
(laughing)

1036
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,590
- We've done repeat tests

1037
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:14,892
and we've still been
getting good results.

1038
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,059
- That's great.

1039
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:16,894
Thanks.

1040
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,963
- There are a couple
of human samples

1041
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,967
that are still not responding
as quickly to the new formula.

1042
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,469
- Dr Wolfe?

1043
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,805
- It's probably
just a sensor error.

1044
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,740
Let's keep an eye on it.

1045
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:30,908
Thanks for letting me know.

1046
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:33,477
- Are you all right?

1047
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,678
- Huh?

1048
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,113
- Nevermind.

1049
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:36,947
Thanks.

1050
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

1051
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,352
- Oh, knock, knock.

1052
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,489
- Have you guys noticed
anything weird about Dr Wolfe?

1053
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,992
- The first rule
of Fight Club is?

1054
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,028
- It's almost like she's...

1055
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,763
- Happy.

1056
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:53,563
- Oh!

1057
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:55,932
Oh!

1058
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,000
- Ahh!

1059
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,036
- Maybe she had a tiny stroke.

1060
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,071
- [Caroline] Oh, ho, ho!

1061
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,342
- [Serena] Don!

1062
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,943
- Serena, I don't have time
to hear your protestations

1063
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,345
about sensitivity training.

1064
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,881
- Oh, I'm not here to
complain about that.

1065
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:11,581
- Oh.

1066
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,816
- We've gotten a lot of momentum

1067
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,051
from our recent breakthrough,
but we could use

1068
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,352
some more resources.

1069
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,521
I've written a proposal.

1070
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,323
I know the department

for my research.

1073
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,193
I think we're really close.

1074
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,929
We just need some funding.

1075
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,597
- I'll look this over.

1076
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,334
Let me see if there's
any discretionary
funds I can get you.

1077
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,602
- Thanks for your
support, Donald.

1078

You're in control.

1150
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,671

1151
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,275
- We're sorry!

1152
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,311
What happened in there?

1153
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,679
I thought we had
it under control.

1154
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,647
- I'm sorry.

1155
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,449
He just got to me.

1156
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,917
- We have been
making good progress,

1157
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,520
but your temper and road rage
are still big hurdles for you.

1158
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:18,655
- I'm doing a lot better.

1159
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,723
I'm sorry.

1160
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,995
- I can't pass you until
you can control this.

1161
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,199
- Is that what this
is about for you?

1162
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,233
- I'm sorry?

1163
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,303
- You're right.

1164
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,738
I'll work on it.

1165
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,809
Do you want to go and
get a drink or something?

1166
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,311
On me.

1167
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,614
You know, I got us
kicked out and all.

1168
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,516
- It's getting a little late.

1169
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,952
I should get home before
Maggie goes to sleep.

1170
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,587
- Sure, of course.

1171
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,356
- I'll pick you up at 8:30?

1172
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,691
- Sounds good.

1173
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,159
- Great.

1174
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,093
Good night.

1175
00:54:58,995 --> 00:54:59,763
- Night!

1176
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,266
Fuck.

1177
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,340
- Are you sure one of the other
coaches couldn't handle it?

1178
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,242
I think Amanda.

1179
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,343
All right.

1180
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,911
I'll be right in.

1181
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,381
- What is it?

1182
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,417
- Some executive just
called his assistant a fag

1183
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,751
in front of the entire company.

1184
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,386
So they want me to go in and run

1185
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,956
an emergency sensitivity
session all morning.

1186
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,792
- And you don't want to?

1187
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,959
- I hate sexual harassment.

1188
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,594
These guys don't want to change.

1189
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,797
They just want to hire me
so they don't get sued.

1190
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,798
- Tell Barry that.

1191
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,099
- I tried.

1192
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,767
And I'm already late
to pick up Serena

1193
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,836
and now I have to cancel on her.

1194
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,939
- Well, I'm sure
she'll understand.

1195
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,275
- She has abandonment issues.

1196
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,883
(playful music)

1197
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,943
(phone beeping)

1198
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:31,221
(energetic drumming)

1199
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,503
- You okay?

1200
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,172
- Pretty sure I've contracted
Salmonella poisoning.

1201
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,774
Whatever.

1202
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,275
- Where's Caroline?

1203
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,212
- Caroline isn't here yet?

1204
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,680
She was supposed to
help me with a letter

1205
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,716
I'm writing to my birth mother.

1206
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,117
- She gives you advice?

1207
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,787
- Yeah, she's just the greatest.

1208
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,056
- Hamilton, does Caroline help
you with personal matters?

1209
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,358
- Does she ever.

1210
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,026
Thanks to her, my wife
and I are listening

1211
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,162
to each other for the first
time since Hunter was born.

1212
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,898
It's like a whole new marriage.

1213
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,036
(dramatic drumming)

1214
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,281
- Miss me?

1215
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,517
- Apparently
everybody missed you.

1216
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,553
- Is everything okay?

1217
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,889
- Dr Wolfe, could
you come here please?

1218
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,429
Our formula isn't working
on two of the samples.

1219
00:57:46,462 --> 00:57:48,865
- But whose samples are these?

1220
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,567
- One is the culture I
took from Dr Hamilton

1221
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,102
and the other is from Caroline.

1222
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,137
- That's my bacteria?

1223
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,972
- What's different
about these samples?

1224
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,875
- I believe we've isolated a
new strain of Bacillus virilis.

1225
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,444
This strain, which is only
present in these two samples,

1226
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:04,714
is even more
antibiotic-resistant
than the original.

1227
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,082
Our formula doesn't kill it.

1228
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,184
In fact, its population
is multiplying rapidly.

1229
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,586
- Shit, shit.

1230
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,486
Shit!

1231
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,688
- Serena, don't get discouraged.

1232
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:12,989
- Really?

1233
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,424
First, I have to be
nice all the time

1234
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,160
and then I can't be upset that
my project is totally fucked?

1235
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,963
- I'm just saying that
you'll figure it out.

1236
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,798
- How do you know that?

1237
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,167
Does your sociology degree
give you that information?

1238
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,203
Or is it just your naively
optimistic attitude?

1239
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:27,837
- Serena.

1240
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,038
- What?

1241
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,974
You want me to calm down, take
a deep breath, be patient?

1242
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,842
I've tried all of that.

1243
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,811
I've jumped through
hoops for you.

1244
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,045
None of it worked.

1245
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,615
You clearly have no
idea what you're doing.

1246
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:42,185
You're just a sad, insecure
woman who's compulsively nice

1247
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:45,021
to everyone because
no one ever liked you

1248
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,856
when you were younger.

1249
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,703
(soft music)

1250
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,256
(crying)

1251
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:23,259
(phone ringing)

1252
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,794
- Hey!

1253
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,563
No, not much, just
watching a movie.

1254
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,932
No, I can talk.

1255
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,468
(somber music)

1256
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,389
- [Serena] Did
Caroline come in today?

1257
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,493
- [Ellen] Can I speak with you?

1258
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,328
- Yeah.

1259
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,198
- I've gotten an
offer at another lab.

1260
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,401
I feel like I'm not
really growing here.

1261
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,739
Do you think I should take it?

1262
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,008
If you need me, I'll stay.

1263
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,511
- You should take it.

1264
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,346
- Oh okay.

1265
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,650
Well, I'll stay on until
you find a replacement.

1266
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:24,387
- If you want to start at
the other lab, you should.

1267
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,388
We'll be fine.

1268
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,737
- We have meetings
we have to get to

1269
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,638
so if we just sign the thingy?

1270
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,209
- I'm not sure I understand
what thingy you're referring to.

1271
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,644
- Oh right, well,
last month I pinched

1272
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,213
a receptionist on the
ass and my boss made me

1273
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,148
go to this lady and I
signed a piece of paper

1274
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,616
and I could go back to work.

1275
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:55,151
- Yeah, I had to
sign the same thing

1276
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,686
after I asked a junior associate

1277
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,488
if she was wearing a bra or not.

1278
01:00:58,521 --> 01:00:59,622
Turned out she was.

1279
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,457
- What was the name of the
lady who we used to go to?

1280
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,859
She was hot.

1281
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,495
- So you're saying that you
already signed a document

1282
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,765
apologizing and promising
not to behave this way again?

1283
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:09,832
- Yes, can we go?

1284
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,467
- But you have done it again

1285
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,004
and you're probably
aren't sorry.

1286
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,473
- We could sign another one.

1287
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,511
- Let's discuss the
way we treat people.

1288
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,647
Would any of you
gentlemen like a mint?

1289
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,683
No, you know what?

1290
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:28,985
You don't get a mint!

1291
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,653
You don't deserve a mint!

1292
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:32,789
You're not very good people,
and nothing I can say or do

1293
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,457
is going to make
you good people.

1294
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,627
I did not get two PhDs to
sit around with men like you

1295
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,662
and talk about why you
probably shouldn't touch

1296
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:43,900
a female colleague's
behind or use ethnic slurs.

1297
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,368
- So, do we not have to sign--

1298
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,069
- Get out!

1299
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,186
- Hi, Serena.

1300
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:03,986
- Hey.

1301
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:09,225
I guess I failed
sensitivity training.

1302
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,662
What happens now?

1303
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:14,764
- I had to alert
the administration

1304
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,466
that you didn't
complete your training.

1305
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,301
And, now, it's up to them.

1306
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:22,405
I imagine there will be
a hearing of some kind.

1307
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,273
I think they'll be fair.

1308
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,975
Don't worry yet.

1309
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,977
- Whatever happens, happens.

1310
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,479
- So how's your research going?

1311
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,148
I heard you hit a snag
with that new strain.

1312
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,584
- What does it matter if I
never stop this bacteria?

1313
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,453
We're all going to die anyway.

1314
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,722
- Excuse me, I'm looking for--

1315
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:41,324
- The biology
classroom is around

1316
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,692
the corner and to the right.

1317
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:43,793
- Thank you.

1318
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,328
- You're welcome.

1319
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,698
- Buck up, Serena.

1320
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,234
I think you'll figure this out.

1321
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,671
- [Maggie] Can I have
a lion at my birthday?

1322
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,473
- [Sarah] No.

1323
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,475
- [Maggie] What
about a killer whale?

1324
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,243
- [Sarah] No.

1325
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,844
- Please, Mommy?

1326
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:02,812
- No.

1327
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,080
- What about other Mommy?

1328
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,882
She always says yes!

1329
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,651
- [Sarah] What is it?

1330
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,086
- Am I too nice?

1331
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,126
- [Sarah] Sweetie, come here.

1332
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:19,962
It's okay.

1333
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,873
- I put today's
charts on your desk.

1334
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:31,707
- Thanks.

1335
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,480
- I guess that's it unless
there's anything else you need.

1336
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,648
- No, thanks.

1337
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:40,750
Best of luck.

1338
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,957
- I don't mean to
meddle but I think

1339
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,560
Ethan has been sleeping in here.

1340
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,570
Just thought you should know.

1341
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:09,712
- Did mom and dad
ever do this thing

1342
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:12,848
where they would just send
you to your room for hours?

1343
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:16,285
- Yeah, they sort of
made a game out of it.

1344
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,821
- Yeah like, they'd give
you rewards for how long

1345
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:21,624
you could stay up there
without asking for anything.

1346
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,860
- I think that's how I
got my first microscope.

1347
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,196
- I started to think that I
liked being alone all the time.

1348
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:31,167
But then I just realized that's
how they wanted me to be.

1349
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,968
You know?

1350
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:38,274
(quirky music)

1351
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:09,939
- Nancy, it's for you!

1352
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:16,312
- Hi, mom.

1353
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,752
- It's been a while.

1354
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,120
How are you?

1355
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,187
- How am I?

1356
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,956
- We just got back
from Joshua Tree.

1357
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,190
Do you want to
see some pictures?

1358
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,059
- [Glenn] Take a look at
the bracelet I got your mom.

1359
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,694
- Aww, isn't it nice?

1360
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,163
Do you want to come in?

1361
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,498
- We have plans, babe.

1362
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,166
- Oh, Glenn.

1363
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,669
Would you just go back inside
so I can catch up with Serena?

1364
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,003
Just for a second?

1365
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,143
- Aren't you
worried about Ethan?

1366
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,044
- No.

1367
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,979
He's an adult now.

1368
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,247
- He's a kid.

1369
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,081
So was I.

1370
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,585
Why did you send us away?

1371
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,854
- It's nothing personal.

1372
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,658
Glenn and I just want
to be alone together.

1373
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:06,796
Don't you have someone that
means the world to you?

1374
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,168
Honey, you were
always so emotional.

1375
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,502
- I was not.

1376
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,837
I never cried.

1377
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,339
- Well, you used
to cry all the time

1378
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,707
about every little thing.

1379
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,241
- That is completely untrue.

1380
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,345
- Remember when
your goldfish died?

1381
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,180
- Maybe you shouldn't
have given me a pet

1382
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,248
with such a short
life expectancy!

1383
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,950
- You shouldn't have
got so attached.

1384
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:32,188
- Thanks to you I can never
get attached to anything!

1385
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,158
- What's going on out here?

1386
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,326
- She's just fine, dear.

1387
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,794
- I am not fine!

1388
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,999
I am completely fucked
up, thanks to you people.

1389
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,108
This turtle is dead
because of you.

1390
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,778
Do you know the average
lifespan of a box turtle?

1391
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,179
Do you?

1392
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,514
- We don't, dear.

1393
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,682
- 50 years.

1394
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,317
50 fucking years.

1395
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,319
I can't even keep
a turtle alive.

1396
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,287
It's not even mammalian!

1397
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,223
I have zero friends.

1398
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,557
My life is empty.

1399
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,160
I don't even know
how to like someone.

1400
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,862
- Well, what's this
got to do with us?

1401
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,897
We are very loving people.

1402
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,700
- You treated me like shit
and then you abandoned me

1403
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,335
and now you're doing
the same thing to Ethan.

1404
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,204
- How is Ethan any
of your business?

1405
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,239
- He's my brother.

1406
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,075
- Well, he's like
a half-brother.

1407
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:29,979
- Honey, Glenn and I are
just better as a pair.

1408
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,116
We're like the two musketeers.

1409
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,419
- The two musketeers
is not a thing.

1410
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:37,853
They're called the
three musketeers.

1411
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,355
They're a group of three people.

1412
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,458
That's not even applicable
to this situation.

1413
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:45,261
- Well, that's just who we are.

1414
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,832
(dramatic drumming)

1415
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,243
- This is a nice apartment.

1416
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,311
- Thanks.

1417
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,381
Could you...

1418
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,452
Nevermind.

1419
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,823
- This is great, thanks.

1420
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:21,530
- Ethan?

1421
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:35,344
Do you think it's
my fault Laura died?

1422
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:42,318
How do you even apologize
for something like that?

1423
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,919
- I guess you don't.

1424
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,626
- I made you these.

1425
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,367
- [Dr Hamilton] A small
improvement, at least.

1426
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,704
- This is a great idea
for a new formula.

1427
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:02,538
Good work.

1428
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,242
- It was Ellen's idea.

1429
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,512
- She never told me.

1430
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:11,580
- You wouldn't listen.

1431
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,118
(upbeat music)

1432
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,027
(players yelling)

1433
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,541
(whistle blowing)

1434
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:43,946
- Dr Wolfe.

1435
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,382
- You looked pretty
good out there.

1436
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,650
- Really?

1437
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,486
- Well, actually, it
all seemed quite strange

1438
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,655
and I couldn't comprehend
what was happening.

1439
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,491
- Is there something in my
report I should clarify?

1440
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,525
Did I forget--

1441
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,662
- No, no, your work
is perfect, as usual.

1442
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,363
I...

1443
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,066
I remember that you
mentioned that you played

1444
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:08,103
and I found out where
your practices took place.

1445
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,442
I came to ask if you'd consider
coming back to the lab.

1446
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,712
I promise things
will be different.

1447
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,180
I'll listen better.

1448
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,550
I really want you to
contribute on a deeper level.

1449
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:22,718
- Did my new formula work?

1450
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:23,552
- No.

1451
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,389
But it was an
improvement on the last.

1452
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:28,924
We're really close.

1453
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,159
Thanks to you.

1454
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,463
- I want a promotion
and a raise.

1455
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,867
- Okay.

1456
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,436
So you'll come back?

1457
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,236
- Yeah.

1458
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,071
Yes.

1459
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,639
- You'll come back now?

1460
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,740
- Yeah.

1461
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,310
- So, what position do you play?

1462
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,545
- I'm a beater.

1463
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,879
- That sounds intense.

1464
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,615
- I was having trouble
being aggressive enough,

1465
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,516
but Caroline helped me.

1466
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,820
I'm sure she misses you.

1467
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,655
- She doesn't really
care about me.

1468
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,457
She was paid to
spend time with me.

1469
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,825
It was her job.

1470
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:06,695
- Do you go to the lab every
day just because it's your job?

1471
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,699
(energetic music)

1472
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:11,967
- Come on.

1473
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,537
I respect you but I
have somewhere to be!

1474
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:18,741
Thank you.

1475
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,424
Hi.

1476
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,258
I'm...

1477
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,661
Caroline's my...

1478
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,930
- Serena, you came
for my birthday!

1479
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,699
When can we open presents?

1480
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,000
- Soon.

1481
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,903
- [Maggie] You said
that an hour ago!

1482
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:51,106
Come on, let's go
shake all the boxes.

1483
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,841
- So you're Serena.

1484
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,343
- This is clearly a bad time.

1485
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:55,110
- Come on in.

1486
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,812
The more the merrier.

1487
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:03,652
- Lovely home.

1488
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,622
- Caroline went upstairs
a little while ago.

1489
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,890
I gotta keep my
eye on these guys.

1490
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,591
Feel free to go up
and look for her.

1491
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,994
- I don't want to impose.

1492
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,929
- You'd actually be
doing me a big favor

1493
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,031
if you went up and got her.

1494
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,009
- [Toy] Oink, oink, oink.

1495
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,050
- Caroline?

1496
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:39,388
Caroline?

1497
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,397
Caroline?

1498
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,433
(suspenseful music)

1499
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:57,840
Caroline, I'm so sorry.

1500
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:58,774
- Ahh, ahh!

1501
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,711
- I...

1502
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,213
I thought you had
killed yourself

1503
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,082
because of the horrible
things that I said to you.

1504
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,552
- Nothing you say could ever
make me want to kill myself.

1505
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,055
- I sort of have a track
record in that department.

1506
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:17,059
I saw the empty pill bottle
and you looked unconscious.

1507
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,927
- I took my last aspirin.

1508
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,300
Can I tell you a secret?

1509
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,568
- Uh-huh.

1510
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,703
- I'm hiding.

1511
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,006
I hate children's
birthday parties.

1512
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,842
- But you love children.

1513
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,177
- I love Maggie.

1514
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,080
I don't necessarily
love other people's kids

1515
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:42,050
and in large quantities in the
proximity of sugary treats.

1516
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,755
- I came to tell
you how sorry I am.

1517
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:49,358
I was completely out of line.

1518
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:53,595
- Thank you and you were,
but there was some truth

1519
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,864
in what you said.

1520
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:59,134
- No, I was just taking my
frustrations out on you.

1521
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:02,938
- I care too much
about being liked.

1522
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,274
It's something I'm working on.

1523
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:11,146
- Well, if you ever need
asshole training, I'm available.

1524
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,886
(children chattering)

1525
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,061
- [Woman] Look at
you, you're filthy.

1526
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,898
Hold still.

1527
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,301
(boy sobbing)

1528
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,071
(dramatic music)

1529
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,609
- It's the children.

1530
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,881
It's the children!

1531
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,216
- What?

1532
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,084
- You and Dr Hamilton
both have young children.

1533
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,086
Children must be the carriers

1534
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,888
of the resistant
strain of virilis.

1535
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:57,125
That's why your samples
didn't respond to the formula.

1536
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,696
Have any of these
children seemed ill?

1537
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,698
- I've been vomited on
like three times already,

1538
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,199
but that's not
necessarily abnormal

1539
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,667
for a kids' birthday party.

1540
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,302
- Did you keep any samples?

1541
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,136
- No.

1542
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,877
- I'll have to swab them all.

1543
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,013
It's fun, right?

1544
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:18,847
Next!

1545
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,383
Thank you.

1546
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,085
- Just a little science project!

1547
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,052
Are they in danger?

1548
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,420
- Not anymore.

1549
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,856
Do you want to come back
to the lab with me after?

1550
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,759
I'm sorry, that was dumb, it's
your kid's birthday party.

1551
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,028
- You're the poster
child for birth control.

1552
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,964
And your IQ matches
your shoe size!

1553
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,233
- Did you?

1554
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,572
(horns blaring)

1555
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,211
- Come on, jerks, we
have lab results to get!

1556
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,348
- It's the children.

1557
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,051
The children were
the key all along!

1558
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,503
- Guys, I'll be back.

1559
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,806
Apparently Laura Stern's
research was a fraud.

1560
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,242
She'd been embezzling
grant money for five years.

1561
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,777
She was about to be audited.

1562
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,446
That's why she killed herself.

1563
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,287
- Gather everyone.

1564
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,456
I have an announcement.

1565
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,293
Before I start, why
is this skeleton here?

1566
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,295
- I ordered it.

1567
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,430
- What for?

1568
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,733
- Skeletons are cool.

1569
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:45,934
- Okay.

1570
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:49,471
So these cultures were
taken from children, age?

1571
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,238
- Six.

1572
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,573
- Six.

1573
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:54,376
And Hamilton, how old is
that former fetus of yours?

1574
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,177
- Hunter?

1575
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,545
He's three.

1576
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,848
- So if my hunch is correct,
the carriers of the strain

1577
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,883
are at least six and under.

1578
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,385
Parents can get it
from their children.

1579
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:05,754
It's pathogenic
and drug resistant.

1580
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:09,291
Yet adults don't seem
to be getting sick.

1581
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,060
Yes, Ellen?

1582
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,030
- No, it's probably dumb.

1583
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:15,931
- Speak up.

1584
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,135
- Maybe adults have a natural
antibody to this strain

1585
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:24,239
that we can use to figure
out how to kill it?

1586
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,742
- That's a great thought.

1587
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,478
I want a full genetic
sequencing of every bacterium

1588
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,780
and a close comparison
of the adult samples

1589
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,148
to the children's.

1590
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,983
If we get to the bottom
of this, we can figure out

1591
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,419
how to eradicate it for good.

1592
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:41,623
Ellen.

1593
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,592
Good work.

1594
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:50,999
- Serena, I hear you've
made another breakthrough.

1595
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:54,369
- Well, it's all
for the children.

1596
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,871
- And Caroline, in light
of what we've just learned

1597
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:58,607
about Laura, the university
has decided that Serena

1598
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,476
no longer needs
sensitivity training.

1599
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,048
- Yes, I do.

1600
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,983
- That's definitely
true, but the university

1601
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,086
will no longer
require or pay for it.

1602
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,926
- Well, it looks like
my work here is done.

1603
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,928
- [Ellen] Dr Wolfe, would you
like to take a look at this?

1604
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,596
- Call me after work tonight.

1605
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,700
We'll go see a
movie or something.

1606
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,235
You're doing great on your own.

1607
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,737
- [Ellen] Dr Wolfe!

1608
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,641
- I'll see you soon.

1609
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,557
- [Ellen] Its defenses
are breaking down.

1610
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,791
Do you see it?

1611
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:55,464
- Thanks.

1612
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:56,598
I...

1613
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,333
I'll be right back.

1614
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:01,870
Caroline.

1615
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,308
(upbeat music)

1616
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:10,545
Caroline.

1617
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,749
You left before I
could thank you.

1618
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,418
- You don't need to--

1619
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,788
- Thank you for making me
a little more of a person.

1620
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,625
- My pleasure.

1621
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:28,396
- I don't know
how to say this...

1622
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,534
I think I have feelings for you.

1623
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,706
I have for a while now.

1624
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:38,673
- Feelings?

1625
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,043
Are you attracted to me?

1626
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,512
- Possibly.

1627
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,714
I've done some interesting
Google searches.

1628
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:49,117
- Serena, can you
describe these feelings?

1629
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,888
- I get excited when
I'm about to see you

1630
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,823
and sad when I don't.

1631
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:59,928
When you squeeze my hand
or touch my shoulder,

1632
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,163
it feels good.

1633
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,399
It makes me feel a
little less angry

1634
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:07,435
about whatever it is
that I'm angry about.

1635
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,071
When something
important happens,

1636
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,041
I want to tell you about it.

1637
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:16,444
I imagine what you'd say or do.

1638
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,246
I miss you when I don't see you

1639
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,715
and my day always
gets better when I do.

1640
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:23,218
- I feel the same way about you.

1641
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:24,019
- You do?

1642
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:29,891
- That's what it feels
like to have a friend.

1643
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:30,692
- Oh.

1644
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,435
So we're friends?

1645
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,037
- Very good friends.

1646
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,809
- So what do we do now?

1647
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,377
- I think we hug.

1648
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,180
- Oh.

1649
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:57,319
(gentle music)

1650
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,203
- Where do turtles
go when they die?

1651
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:16,905
- Nobody knows.

1652
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,673
- Are we going to die?

1653
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,474
- Yes.

1654
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:23,612
- Not for a very
long time, honey.

1655
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,780
- I'm going to try
not to think about it.

1656
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:27,849
- You know, that's
what most of us do.

1657
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,018
- Maggie, what do you
say we go play out front?

1658
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,753
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1659
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,023
- I'm sorry I inadvertently
made your child

1660
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,626
aware of her own mortality.

1661
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,960
- She'll be okay.

1662
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,575
(upbeat music)

1663
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,752
(dramatic music)

1664
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:08,890
- [Moviegoer] What's he doing?

1665
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:12,160
Doesn't he know she's
waiting for him?

1666
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,965
- [Moviegoer] He's not going
in the basement, is he?

1667
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,400
He's going in the basement!

1668
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,668
- I got this.

1669
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,671
Excuse me, we're trying
to watch this movie.

1670
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:24,940
Could you shut the hell up!

1671
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,174
Thanks.

1672
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:27,575
