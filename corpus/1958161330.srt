1
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,857
Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs,
I think I have someone here

2
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,726
you might like to meet.

3
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,728
Well, lookie here, Alice.

4
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,898
Oh, you must be Becky!

5
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,833
Nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs.

6
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,369
Oh, please call us
Ted and Alice.

7
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,138
And this is Diego, right?

8
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,841
That's right.

9
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,343
Welcome home, honey.

10
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,745
Welcome home.

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,749
<i>I know what</i>
<i>you're thinking.</i>

12
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,684
<i>"Who the fuck is this girl?</i>

13
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,252
<i>That is not the Becky</i>
<i>I remember."</i>

14
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,824
<i>But I had to play the part</i>
<i>for my new foster parents.</i>

15
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,158
<i>Yeah, these two wackjobs.</i>

16
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,799
You know,
when Alice and I decided

17
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,367
we were gonna be foster parents,

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,369
we knew we had to move
to a community

19
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,806
with the best of the best
in Christ-filled education

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,910
and around here they're all
blue ribbon school districts.

21
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,781
Top tier, top of their class,
and top notch.

22
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,349
Well, I'm not sure what all
is planned for tomorrow

23
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,786
but I would love
to get enrolled ASAP.

24
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,388
Absolutely.
I planned on taking you there

25
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,757
first thing in the morning.

26
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,824
Wonderful.

27
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,593
Oh, oh, and don't forget about
the new principal.

28
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,260
- Mr. Serio.
- Good guy.

29
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,729
We've gone to the same church
now for what?

30
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:42,764
Six years!

31
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,599
And he has a daughter
that's your age, Sarah.

32
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,399
She's adorable.

33
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,601
She'll probably
be in your class.

34
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,835
She is in a wheelchair

35
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,203
but you'll still like her
anyway.

36
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:50,872
Well, will I get
to spend time

37
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:51,939
with her in church as well?

38
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:54,809
Perhaps there's like
a youth group of some sort.

39
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,711
- Oh, Becky.
- Wow.

40
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,813
I can't tell you
how happy it makes me

41
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,414
to hear you say that.

42
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,916
Well, shall we?

43
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,819
Yes, um, it's just...

44
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,954
would you mind
if we said grace first?

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,959
-Can you believe it?
-She's perfect.

46
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,533
And just remember,
if you need anything at all,

47
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,702
Ted and I are just
in the next room.

48
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,538
My guardian angels.

49
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,547
Goodnight, sweetheart.

50
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,381
Goodnight, Mom.

51
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,019
Ted!
Teddy!

52
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,766
Diego, come.

53
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,511
<i>It's been two years</i>
<i>since four Neo-Nazis</i>

54
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,681
<i>invaded my family's lake house</i>
<i>and murdered my father.</i>

55
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,783
<i>They were looking</i>
<i>for some stupid fucking key</i>

56
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,484
<i>that they had hidden</i>
<i>below the house.</i>

57
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,720
<i>Yeah.</i>

58
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,723
<i>That stupid fucking key.</i>

59
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,792
<i>But then, this happened.</i>

60
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,567
<i>Bummer about me</i>
<i>ruining their plans.</i>

61
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,671
<i>I'm sixteen now.</i>

62
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:13,174
<i>I've run away from</i>
<i>three foster homes.</i>

63
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,978
<i>I've manipulated,</i>
<i>conned, burglarized,</i>

64
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,913
<i>anything to keep me</i>
<i>off the grid</i>

65
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,615
<i>and out of the system.</i>

66
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,084
<i>If you ask me,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>

67
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,687
<i>I think I'm doing just fine.</i>

68
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:01,454
<i>Oh yeah, I fall into</i>
<i>my own hole traps sometimes.</i>

69
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,456
<i>Nobody's perfect.</i>

70
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,608
Eat.

71
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,777
Thank you, darlin'.

72
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,211
<i>This is Elena Cahn.</i>

73
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,847
<i>I've lived with her</i>
<i>for the past year.</i>

74
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,115
<i>I don't know much about her</i>

75
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,951
<i>other than the following:</i>

76
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,254
<i>She's old,</i>
<i>she hates almost everyone,</i>

77
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,556
<i>and she picks up hitchhikers.</i>

78
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,991
<i>It's how we met.</i>

79
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,627
I fell into one
of my hole traps again today.

80
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,562
I saw that.

81
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,531
I had just woken up,

82
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,533
looked out my window

83
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,269
just in time to see you vanish.

84
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,972
I quite enjoyed the show.

85
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,711
You sleep?

86
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,681
No.

87
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,719
<i>It's the same every night.</i>

88
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,868
What about you?

89
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,804
Like a baby.

90
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,908
Well?

91
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,277
I always start.

92
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,813
So what's
different about today?

93
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,018
I am grateful for food.

94
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,923
I am grateful
for a hot cup of coffee.

95
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,960
How come I can't say food
but you can say coffee?

96
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,030
Food is a human necessity.

97
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:52,166
Coffee is a delicacy.

98
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,738
I am grateful that
I get paid today.

99
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:58,639
Hmm.

100
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,145
I am grateful
for the novel I'm reading.

101
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:06,180
What's it called?

102
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,649
True Grit.

103
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,618
I think you'd like it.

104
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,089
I am grateful for Diego.

105
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,558
Hm. He's a good boy.

106
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,927
One more.

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,629
Wow me.

108
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,634
I am grateful...for...

109
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,569
Another day.

110
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,771
...another day.

111
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,173
You know, there should
really be a rule against you

112
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,208
always saying that
as your number three.

113
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,776
You only have to think
of two things

114
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,378
if it's always
your number three.

115
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,914
I get to change the rules.

116
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,115
I'm old.

117
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,859
Founding Fathers Breakfast
with a side of toast.

118
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,894
Thanks, sweetheart.

119
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,865
Do you see my name tag?

120
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,134
-I'm sorry?
-My name tag.

121
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,103
Does it say "Sweetheart"?

122
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,671
No.

123
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,673
What does it say?

124
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,941
Becky.

125
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,910
Yeah, 'cause that's my name.

126
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,680
Okay, Jesus.

127
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,616
Oh, sweetheart--Becky...

128
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,252
I asked for buttered toast.

129
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,187
There's butter on the plate.

130
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,724
Yeah, but...I like the butter
to be melted into the toast

131
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,827
the minute it pops
out of the toaster.

132
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,279
<i>I didn't actually do it.</i>

133
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,947
Hello?

134
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:50,684
<i>But I really, really wanted to.</i>

135
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,364
Shit.

136
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,123
<i>A Jasper Hills man</i>
<i>is now facing</i>

137
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,858
<i>first degree murder charges.</i>

138
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:37,231
K-I-L-L-E-R.

139
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:42,069
Double E, Double Word,
twenty-two.

140
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:47,241
You can tell a lot
about a person,

141
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,777
playing a game like this.

142
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,014
How so?

143
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,784
By the words they're able
to find within their letters.

144
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,356
My brother made every effort

145
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,092
to play the most ostentatious
of words.

146
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,429
He was a real
self-righteous jackass.

147
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,465
Two Triple Letters,
ten points.

148
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,136
I didn't know
you had a brother.

149
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,506
Four brothers,
all older.

150
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,341
Do you still talk to them?

151
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,178
Only one is still alive.

152
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,015
The jackass.

153
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,820
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,255
You didn't kill 'em.

155
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,889
Besides, I've learned that

156
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,925
for every person
you lose along the way,

157
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,227
you gain another.

158
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,348
Anew.

159
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,385
Ten.

160
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:11,992
Why have you never asked me
where I came from?

161
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,161
Why have you never told me?

162
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,896
Weren't you curious?

163
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,865
A kid with no parents
showed up

164
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,800
wanting to rent a room.

165
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,369
You pay your way.

166
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,972
You help out around the house.

167
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,575
And I'd hardly consider
you a child.

168
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,311
You are eighteen, right?

169
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,985
My mother died
when I was nine.

170
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,853
My father was a drunk.

171
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,156
I left home when I was fifteen.

172
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,292
We all come from somewhere.

173
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,462
And we all do
what we have to...

174
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,335
...in order to survive.

175
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,606
How much does that add up to?

176
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,076
<i>Fifteen.</i>

177
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,177
Ten.

178
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,520
Nice try.

179
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:14,455
<i>We go now to</i>
<i>a developing story.</i>

180
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,323
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>the Noble Men</i>

181
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,325
<i>and they may be coming</i>
<i>here to Fillmore.</i>

182
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,460
<i>Authorities are aware</i>

183
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:20,994
<i>of the risk of violence</i>
<i>at this week's--</i>

184
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,963
The world has gone mad.

185
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:23,997
<i>...increasing</i>
<i>the security detail</i>

186
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,133
<i>for Senator Anne Hernandez.</i>

187
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,901
<i>They say they've been tracking</i>
<i>the Noble Men</i>

188
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,137
<i>on various online platforms</i>
<i>for months now.</i>

189
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,438
<i>They have seen a rise</i>
<i>in activity</i>

190
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,307
<i>and they've noticed</i>
<i>a pattern of their appearances</i>

191
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,709
<i>within smaller communities.</i>

192
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,044
<i>Whether or not the Noble Men</i>
<i>decide to make an appearance</i>

193
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,912
<i>at the town hall</i>
<i>in Fillmore on Wednesday</i>

194
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,447
<i>and what that appearance</i>
<i>may look like</i>

195
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,050
<i>only time will tell.</i>

196
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,113
So are you gonna seat us
or you just gonna stand there?

197
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,115
Yeah, wait, real quick,
I got a question.

198
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,085
Um, did your mom
actually name you that?

199
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,987
'Cause Becky is a stripper name

200
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,524
and any chick that gives
her daughter a stripper name

201
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,191
is a catch.

202
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,727
What is it with you and moms?

203
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,395
-I got a thing for moms.
-No, what he's saying is

204
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,531
he'd love to fuck your mom.

205
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:33,000
That is correct, yes,
I would love to fuck your mom.

206
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,103
Right this way.

207
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:37,739
Not a fan.

208
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,573
Come on.

209
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,209
I'm just saying
it's weird.

210
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,143
Okay, I have a bad feeling.

211
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,312
I just want to make sure
it's just a rally.

212
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,449
Sean, can you
do me a favor?

213
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,652
Just reach into your panties

214
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:53,755
and pull the blood-soaked tampon
from your twat.

215
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,757
Would you
shut the fuck up, dude?

216
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,458
Can you?

217
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,493
Look, Darryl will tell us
what we need to know

218
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,061
when we need to know it.

219
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,030
Darryl is a username
on a message board.

220
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,331
You've never met him,
none of us have.

221
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,633
He's an ex-Navy SEAL.

222
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,468
He's one of the fucking
Founding Fathers, bro.

223
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:08,736
How do you know he's not
an undercover cop?

224
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,737
Oh, my God.

225
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,472
Seriously, those guys
are on the message board

226
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:13,006
all the time, right?

227
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,475
Seriously, pull it out.

228
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,777
You're gonna get
Toxic Shock Syndrome.

229
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:19,246
That's a real killer,
you know that, right?

230
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,281
Look, guys,
I hate Senator Hernandez

231
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,784
as much as you guys do, okay?

232
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,552
I hate her.

233
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:26,521
But if shit goes south tomorrow,

234
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:28,590
I ain't going to prison
like those jackasses last year.

235
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,391
Is it weird, hating bitches
as much as you do

236
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,026
but also being one?

237
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,162
He's not wrong.

238
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,297
Hey! Hello? Yeah.

239
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,166
Could we get some coffee
over here, today?

240
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,668
Coming right up.

241
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,504
Why does everything
have to be like that with you?

242
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,539
You could just say like,
"Excuse me."

243
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,074
<i>I fantasize a lot</i>
<i>about the things I'd like to do</i>

244
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,209
<i>to the people who piss me off.</i>

245
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,678
<i>I've always had</i>
<i>an active imagination</i>

246
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,680
<i>but it's really gone</i>
<i>into overdrive</i>

247
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:55,315
<i>these last couple of years.</i>

248
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,819
All right, finally.

249
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,319
Thank you.

250
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,189
Wonderful presentation.

251
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,791
-You are doing great.
-Thank you.

252
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:06,694
<i>But this one</i>
<i>wasn't a fantasy.</i>

253
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,530
Oh, shit!

254
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,565
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

255
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:13,635
-Are you fucking stupid?
-I am so sorry.

256
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:16,103
You stupid fucking bitch!

257
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,171
-Let me go get you a towel.
-Yeah, you fucking do that.

258
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,207
Get the fuck outta here.

259
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,142
Burned the shit outta
my goddamn crotch.

260
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,110
It's okay, it's okay.

261
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,546
Get the fuck aw--

262
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,747
-You want us to fan you?
-No, no, stop.

263
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,414
Would you two
shut the fuck up?

264
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,215
Shut up!

265
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,565
She did that shit on purpose.

266
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,166
Who cares, dude?
She's just a little girl.

267
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,468
I'm surprised she didn't
toss it in your face.

268
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,673
Oh, what?

269
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:55,309
Well, kill her if you want to,
I don't give a shit.

270
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,811
Go.

271
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,513
Yeah.

272
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,894
Bitches like you need
to be taught a fuckin' lesson!

273
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,596
Shut up!

274
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:26,233
Hey, that's a real
good-lookin' pup.

275
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,704
Diego, attack!

276
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,307
Diego!

277
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,850
Good girl.

278
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:48,455
Hi, Becky.

279
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,561
You can sit down.

280
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,630
I think she broke my nose.

281
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,731
You little cunt.

282
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,666
You broke my fuckin' nose!

283
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:01,468
What happened?

284
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,437
Apparently she broke
Anthony's nose.

285
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,240
What the fuck happened to we're
just ding-dong ditching her?

286
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,309
Yeah, we went with
Plan B instead.

287
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,778
Oh, this is so bad.

288
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,380
- This is so, so--
- Shut the fuck up.

289
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,650
Now when I'm done with you,
you little shit,

290
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:18,251
you're gonna wish your ass
was already dead.

291
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,420
Hey!

292
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:23,791
Put the gun down.

293
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,292
Oh, fuck.

294
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,627
Becky, don't move.

295
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,895
Yeah, Becky, don't fuckin' move.

296
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:28,996
Don't you speak to her.

297
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,598
Hey, lady, listen to me.

298
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,800
-Put the gun down.
-Put the gun down, dude.

299
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,468
What do you want me to do, man?

300
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,303
Put the gun down, man.
Put the fucking gun down!

301
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,438
-Do it!
-I'm puttin' down the gun.

302
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,285
Okay. It's down.

303
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,355
Good.
Now get the fuck outta my house.

304
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,860
Elena!

305
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,389
Diego?

306
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,896
Diego?

307
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,865
Diego!

308
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,761
DJ.

309
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:47,962
Yeah.

310
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,599
All right.

311
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,068
I want the both of you
to listen up.

312
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,737
No one speaks a word of this.

313
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,806
-You hear me?
-Of course, bro.

314
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,974
Hey.

315
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,810
Do you hear me?

316
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,178
She's gonna go
to the cops.

317
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,013
Who the fuck cares?

318
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,581
I care.

319
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:08,783
You fuckin' killed her, man.

320
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:10,151
You shot her
in the fuckin' face.

321
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,119
If we get caught for this,
my life is over

322
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,554
and I didn't even
fuckin' do anything.

323
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:15,056
I didn't do any--

324
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,526
You fuckin' listen to me,
you stupid, weak bitch.

325
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,195
If I ever hear you say any of
that shit out loud ever again,

326
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,697
I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

327
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,532
You got that?

328
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:27,668
She is a stupid-ass
little fuckin' twat.

329
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:30,871
You keep
your fuckin' mouth shut.

330
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:33,941
And we are outta here after
that fuckin' rally tomorrow.

331
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,676
You understand?

332
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,247
We're gonna be just fine.

333
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:42,850
You better calm
the fuck down.

334
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:48,222
He better keep the fuck cool.

335
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,159
Not a word.

336
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,862
How do you think he's gonna feel

337
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:57,965
when he sees bullets
start flying tomorrow?

338
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:00,968
'Cause I have a feeling
he ain't gonna be too chill.

339
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,503
Hm?

340
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,639
I mean, you invited him.

341
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,908
That's all I'm saying.

342
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:26,921
<i>Everyone I've ever loved</i>
<i>has been taken from me.</i>

343
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,690
<i>Cancer took my mom.</i>

344
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:32,693
<i>Neo-Nazis killed my dad.</i>

345
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:36,030
<i>And now, Elena's gone.</i>

346
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,066
I'm grateful for the home
that you gave me.

347
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,137
<i>The way I saw it,</i>
<i>I had two orders of business.</i>

348
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,273
I'm grateful for the time
that I spent with you.

349
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:49,877
<i>I was gonna find my dog.</i>

350
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,113
And I'm grateful
for another day.

351
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:54,381
<i>And I was gonna kill</i>
<i>the motherfuckers</i>

352
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:55,883
<i>who killed Elena.</i>

353
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:17,364
<i>Back at the diner</i> ,

354
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,433
<i>the guys had mentioned</i>
<i>someone named Darryl.</i>

355
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,569
<i>Finding him wasn't difficult.</i>

356
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:22,336
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>there were only two Darryls</i>

357
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,104
<i>in this shit town.</i>

358
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:27,208
<i>I started at 2048 Denning Road.</i>

359
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,276
<i>This was Darryl #1.</i>

360
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:44,391
Well, hello there, darlin'.

361
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:48,262
I'm looking for Darryl.

362
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:49,797
That would be me.

363
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,766
-Your name is Darryl?
-That's right.

364
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,776
I don't think you're
supposed to be doing that.

365
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:06,080
Well, I won't tell
if you don't.

366
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:11,852
<i>Darryl #2 lived</i>
<i>at 4739 Colony Road.</i>

367
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:16,123
<i>Something told me</i>
<i>that this was the Darryl</i>

368
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,392
<i>I was looking for.</i>

369
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,347
Dear heavenly Father.

370
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,349
We come to You with thanks

371
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:45,886
for this meal that
You put before us this evening.

372
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,956
May it bless our bodies.

373
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:54,295
Lord, we ask that You provide us
with ample rest tonight.

374
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,598
Call us to serve You, Lord,

375
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:59,534
and we don't take
that calling lightly.

376
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:04,071
Lord, we ask You
to watch over us tomorrow

377
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,472
along with the other Noble Men

378
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,075
as we carry out that work
that You've called us

379
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,411
to the front lines to do

380
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:14,081
as we try to rid the world
of this filth

381
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,150
that has been thrust
upon our great nation

382
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:20,220
by the evils of Satan,
his followers,

383
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:23,123
and those on the other side.

384
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,461
In Your name, God Almighty,
we pray.

385
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:30,598
Amen.

386
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:32,366
-Amen.
-Amen.

387
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,602
Dig in, boys.

388
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:36,036
I can't remember
the last time I had

389
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,938
a nice home-cooked meal
like this, guys.

390
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:39,340
Seriously. Looks delicious.

391
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,575
Thank you, sir.

392
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:44,044
Well, you can, uh,
thank Twig here.

393
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:45,479
He's the cook.

394
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,182
Yup.

395
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,483
Probably the one good thing

396
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:51,586
my mama taught
me and my brother.

397
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,120
Save for that,

398
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,089
she's a useless femoid
like the rest of 'em.

399
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:56,457
What the fuck is a femoid?

400
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,025
You don't know
what a femoid is?

401
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,426
Yeah, man, you don't know
what a femoid is?

402
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,595
Oh, right,
like you do?

403
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:01,929
It's like those things
from Austin Powers

404
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:02,996
with the gun titties.

405
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,465
No, that's a Fembot.

406
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:06,433
-It's the same difference.
-No it ain't.

407
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,168
All right, Jesus.

408
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,436
Fuck me.

409
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,406
Darryl, where'd you find
these peckerwoods anyway?

410
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:15,476
I didn't. She did.

411
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,910
Oh.

412
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:17,779
And who's "she"?

413
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:20,047
Seriously,
what the fuck is a femoid?

414
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,649
A femoid is
a cross-pollenization

415
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,317
of the word "female"
and "android,"

416
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,586
and it's the perfect way
to describe

417
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,588
nearly every woman
on God's green earth.

418
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:29,022
Bunch of gynocentric
evil lowlife bitches

419
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,225
hell-bent on destroying
any lesser man

420
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:34,261
that doesn't fulfill
their twisted sexual fantasies

421
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:36,930
or their financial fallacies.

422
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,107
Damn, son!

423
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:49,209
Let me be your Padawan, man!

424
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,612
That shit is
what I'm talking about.

425
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,312
Legit!

426
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,214
You're not hungry there, Sean?

427
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,050
What?

428
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,352
Your food.

429
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,187
You haven't touched it.

430
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,589
Is something wrong?

431
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,290
No, no, no,
my boy's fine.

432
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,259
He's just tired
from the long drive up here.

433
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,427
But he'll snap the fuck
out of it.

434
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,261
Right, Sean?

435
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,496
We don't wanna be rude
to our host.

436
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:12,600
Yeah.

437
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,569
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

438
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:18,338
Why don't you take your hat off
at the dinner table, yeah?

439
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:22,242
Sorry, sir.

440
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,412
You boys can take it easy
on the "sir" stuff.

441
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:28,482
I'm just a Noble Man,
same as you.

442
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,221
It's all right, buddy.

443
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,199
Why does he have
to stay in this thing?

444
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:48,402
Oh yeah, he just hasn't been
feeling like himself lately.

445
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:49,604
Got in a fight
with another dog

446
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,205
who fucked him up pretty good.

447
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,575
I just don't want him
to get all worked up.

448
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:56,578
Yeah. Or eat us.

449
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,379
It's good you're
taking care of him.

450
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:01,081
Hey, maybe we can
get one of our flags

451
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,349
with his face on it

452
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:04,485
and it could say,
"Noble Dog."

453
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,187
No, wait, even better:
"Noble Mutt."

454
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,191
Hey, you hear that, boy?

455
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,694
You're Noble Mutt.

456
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:17,030
Yeah, that's one lucky dog
to have found us.

457
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,335
Excuse me.

458
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:32,747
Motion sickness
from the ride.

459
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,302
You feelin' okay, kid?

460
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,743
Yeah, good, I just
had to take a piss.

461
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,380
Come with me.

462
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:15,883
Yeah, okay.

463
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:22,624
It's just up here
on your left.

464
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,131
Go in there.

465
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,368
You'll have to excuse the mess.

466
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:35,335
As you can imagine,

467
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,204
things have been
a little hectic around here.

468
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:39,406
Go on, have a seat.

469
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:46,213
So...when did you decide
to become a Noble Man?

470
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:49,684
Um, few months back now?

471
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,418
I mean, I've always
believed in the cause,

472
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,186
I just didn't go
to my first rally

473
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,656
until a few months ago.

474
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:55,957
Wow.

475
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,227
I would kill to experience
my first rally again.

476
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,462
Anthony says
that's where you three met.

477
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,900
Yeah. There was a march
back in our hometown.

478
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:09,202
They, uh pepper-sprayed
the shit out of us.

479
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:11,506
Well, it's good that
you were there to represent.

480
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,541
It's important that
we show them our numbers.

481
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:15,375
Have our voices heard,
you know?

482
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,611
Yeah, for sure.

483
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:21,281
You wanna see
something cool?

484
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:24,384
Uh, yep, okay.

485
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,259
Thumb drive.

486
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,428
Not just any thumb drive.

487
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,630
It's the only one of its kind

488
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:39,199
entrusted by our founder
to yours truly.

489
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,704
This is an air-gapped computer,

490
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:43,838
our little way
to tell Uncle Sam

491
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,406
to stay the fuck
out of our business.

492
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,546
The 12 Disciples?

493
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:54,782
Whoa.

494
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:57,685
-Is that...
-It's impressive, isn't it?

495
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,923
I didn't realize
how many of us there were.

496
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:04,592
A lot more than twelve.

497
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,860
Yeah.

498
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:13,333
Did you know
that I served overseas?

499
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:15,937
Uh, yeah.

500
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,041
DJ'd mentioned something
about you being an ex-SEAL.

501
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,543
Army Ranger,
staff sergeant.

502
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,344
Did three
tours in Iraq.

503
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:26,581
- Wow.
- Yeah.

504
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:29,316
Me and my men, we, uh...

505
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:30,518
we were in charge
of hunting down

506
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,588
some of the real bad guys
over there.

507
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:37,625
Well, um...
thank you for your service.

508
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:43,296
You know, there was
this one night over there.

509
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,800
My squad and I were
in this town

510
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,570
and we were looking for this
real piece-of-shit towelhead.

511
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,506
This fuckin' guy had
killed, like, fifteen of us

512
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,641
at this point in the war.

513
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:55,375
We get to his house.

514
00:37:55,408 --> 00:38:00,313
He's not there, but, uh,
his wife was.

515
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:03,350
So, I put one of my men
out on lookout.

516
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,986
This sweet kid...

517
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,721
We called him Tootsie

518
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,089
because he was always
having his family ship out

519
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:10,725
those canisters
of Tootsie Rolls, right?

520
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,596
Anyways, I'm, uh,
takin' my time with the wife

521
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,064
and all of a sudden,
shots ring out.

522
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,634
Within seconds,
all hell breaks loose.

523
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,702
Bullets are just flying
in every direction.

524
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,370
Tootsie bursts inside.

525
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:25,039
He's bleeding
all over the place.

526
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,642
Shot once in the shoulder,
twice in the legs.

527
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,410
Shots weren't fatal
but he could hardly walk.

528
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,946
Eventually, you know,
the three of us,

529
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,615
we take cover
in this empty house.

530
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:36,684
Now, we don't have a radio.

531
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,085
I tell them, I said,

532
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,522
"You know, our guys are
gonna come look for us."

533
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:46,894
But Tootsie, he, uh...
couldn't keep quiet.

534
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,830
He's just screaming in pain.

535
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:52,667
Lopez and I--
that's the other guy--

536
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,604
we just kept telling him,
"Shut the fuck up," you know?

537
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,506
"They're gonna hear you
and they'll find us,"

538
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:02,944
but he just
wouldn't stay calm, so...

539
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,748
I took my hands

540
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,619
and I put them over his face

541
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:14,722
and I started to squeeze.

542
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,391
I couldn't stop.

543
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:23,898
Softer at first, and then,
I started to squeeze harder

544
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:27,467
and harder, until...

545
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:40,781
Of course, you know,
Lopez never told a soul.

546
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:45,452
He knew that what I did was
the best thing for the squad.

547
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:47,088
You see, that's the thing
about being part of something

548
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,723
bigger than yourself.

549
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:50,691
It's a team effort,

550
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:53,694
and each individual on that team
has to do their part

551
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:56,063
or they take the others down
with 'em.

552
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:01,468
One weak link
and the entire team fails.

553
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,843
You're not a weak link,
are you?

554
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,613
No, sir.

555
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,482
You sure about that?

556
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,752
Y-yes, sir.

557
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:22,123
And what did I say
about you boys calling me "sir"?

558
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,457
Sorry.

559
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:33,167
I am proud to be in
the brotherhood with you, buddy.

560
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:38,005
Yeah, for sure.

561
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,610
I'm just gonna...

562
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:46,514
Hey, Sean,
one more thing.

563
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,915
Yeah?

564
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,817
What happened to you guys
last night?

565
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,986
I was expecting you
around midnight.

566
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,988
Everything go okay
on the drive?

567
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,691
Yeah, we, uh,
just had a flat tire,

568
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,160
decided to kill some time
at a diner.

569
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,798
Yeah, I figured it was
something like that.

570
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:06,567
Go on, go on.

571
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,969
Enjoy yourself.

572
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,907
Darryl!

573
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:48,776
What the hell you doin'
in there?

574
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,112
Yeah, I'm comin'.

575
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,672
<i>It was right</i>
<i>then and there,</i>

576
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,307
<i>scrolling through</i>
<i>that never-ending list</i>

577
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:22,343
<i>of pencil-dick motherfuckers,</i>

578
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,912
<i>that I realized</i>
<i>Elena was right.</i>

579
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,048
<i>The world had gone mad.</i>

580
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,350
<i>And maybe</i>
<i>I couldn't save the world</i>

581
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:32,119
<i>but I could kill</i>
<i>some of those shit stains</i>

582
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:35,322
<i>and I could have a whole</i>
<i>hell of a lot of fun doin' it.</i>

583
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,993
To saving our country

584
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,161
and to stopping the treason

585
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,964
one vengeful mission
at a time.

586
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,799
To freedom.

587
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,367
-Freedom.
-Freedom.

588
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:58,439
Thought she wasn't comin'
till tonight.

589
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,708
Who the hell is "she"?

590
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,829
Who is it?

591
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:58,432
Well, apparently,

592
00:44:58,465 --> 00:44:59,934
it's Becky.

593
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,340
Went to answer the door
but there was nobody there.

594
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,008
Just this.

595
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:09,977
Shit.

596
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,145
How the fuck
did she find us?

597
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,480
I'm sorry.

598
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:15,316
You three know
something about this?

599
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,785
No. Nothing.

600
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,019
One of you care to tell me

601
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:20,321
what the fuck it is
you're not tellin' me?

602
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:22,323
-Just tell him, you guys.
-You shut the fuck up.

603
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:23,791
I think it would be wise

604
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:25,259
if you listened
to your friend here.

605
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,994
Yeah, what the fuck's
goin' on, gents?

606
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:28,429
-All right...
-DJ.

607
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:30,130
All right, fine--no, no,
it's cool, it's cool man.

608
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:32,066
They're cool, we're gonna just
tell him about the dog, yeah?

609
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,134
- What about the dog?
- We took him, that's it.

610
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,070
- You took him.
- Yep. Not a big deal.

611
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:37,371
-Yeah, but that's not it.
-All right.

612
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:39,039
-Shut the fuck up.
-Shut the fuck up!

613
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,508
All right, all right, fine.

614
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,544
We took him from some
stupid-ass little girl.

615
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,779
That's what Dickless here
wants you to know, okay?

616
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:49,483
What?

617
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:50,484
She was fucking with us
at the diner

618
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:53,153
so we followed her
and stole her fuckin' dog.

619
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:55,055
Big deal.

620
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,156
Is that what you wanted?

621
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,391
You happy now?

622
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:01,428
Is there any chance that,
that little girl's

623
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,997
name is Becky?

624
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:10,971
<i>There</i>
<i>once was a little girl</i>

625
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:12,973
<i>who had a little curl</i>

626
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:16,544
<i>right in the middle</i>
<i>of her forehead.</i>

627
00:46:16,578 --> 00:46:21,415
<i>When she was good,</i>
<i>she was very, very good,</i>

628
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:25,886
<i>and when she was bad,</i>
<i>she was horrid.</i>

629
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:34,461
I don't know about you guys,

630
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,264
but that was fucking hilarious,
right?

631
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:39,400
Yo, that girl's got some balls,
right?

632
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,068
She's messing with us.

633
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,504
Tryin' to make us feel inferior.

634
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:44,004
Oh my God,
you know what, dude?

635
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:45,472
You need to calm the fuck down.

636
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:46,974
I think we'll survive
a scary nursery rhyme.

637
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,342
Yeah, this is exactly
what she wants,

638
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,276
to make us turn against
each other.

639
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,612
What the hell's the matter
with you guys?

640
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:51,780
Come on, she's like,
what, twelve?

641
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:54,415
Yeah, the girl definitely
still shops at Hot Topic.

642
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,016
No, she's a classic Becky.

643
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,451
-A classic what?
-A Becky.

644
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,186
Yeah, we've established
that's her name.

645
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:00,555
No--a Becky.

646
00:47:00,588 --> 00:47:01,589
Let me guess.

647
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:03,290
A dyed-hair, loose-clothes,

648
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:05,459
at best a 5
on the hotness scale.

649
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,394
Oh, for fuck's-- yeah,
we get it, man, you 4chan.

650
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:08,862
-Shut the hell up.
-No, no, no,

651
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:09,731
you shut the hell up.

652
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,131
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

653
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,499
- Fuck you!
- Would one of you please

654
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:14,168
just go find the girl

655
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,137
and give her back
her fuckin' dog?!

656
00:47:23,545 --> 00:47:25,179
Yeah, no, no--no problem.

657
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,014
I'll do it.

658
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:29,049
Yeah, I-I'll go.

659
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:35,189
Aren't you forgetting something?

660
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,924
What am I forgetting?

661
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:39,661
The dog.

662
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:41,529
All right, look, man.

663
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:42,996
When we took the dog from her,

664
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,431
she saw our faces, okay?

665
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:46,166
Now, if I just go
give him back to her,

666
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,402
she's gonna haul ass
straight for the cops.

667
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:50,037
That's not really my problem.

668
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,438
No, it sure as shit
is your problem

669
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:53,941
if you want us
at that town hall tomorrow.

670
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:56,910
Look.

671
00:47:56,944 --> 00:48:00,047
She's just a stupid kid
playing a game of hide-and-seek.

672
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,015
All I'm gonna do is
just go and find her,

673
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,017
get her to calm the fuck down,

674
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:08,088
then I'll give her
her fuckin' dog back.

675
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:09,323
Okay?

676
00:48:25,507 --> 00:48:27,174
Hey, Becky!

677
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,478
You want your dog back?

678
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,313
Huh?

679
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,618
You come and talk to me.

680
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,621
You come and talk to me!

681
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:47,327
Hey.

682
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,496
Would you stop?

683
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:52,499
Look, I'm gonna give you
your stupid dog back.

684
00:48:52,534 --> 00:48:54,234
All right, goddammit, stop,
or I'm gonna shoot you

685
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,336
right in the fucking head.

686
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,974
Thank you.

687
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,043
You know, you put me
in a pretty tricky situation.

688
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,012
Oh yeah, what's that?

689
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:08,048
Well, I'd shoot you, but, well,
then they'd hear the gunshots

690
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,585
and start asking
a lot of dumbass questions.

691
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:13,688
Hm. That would be
real annoying.

692
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:17,024
You're right, it would be.

693
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:20,628
So it looks like
I'm just gonna have to find

694
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:23,230
a better way to kill you.

695
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,739
The fuck?!

696
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,608
Your friend probably shouldn't
leave keys in his tractor.

697
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:35,309
What the fuck?

698
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:37,110
You better get me
the fuck out of here.

699
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:38,713
-You killed my friend.
-Yeah,

700
00:49:38,746 --> 00:49:40,180
and I'm gonna kill you too

701
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:41,516
if you don't get me
the fuck out of here!

702
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,551
Then, you took my dog.

703
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:45,219
Your dog is fine!

704
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:47,722
That's what I've been trying
to tell you!

705
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:53,360
Okay.

706
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:55,763
I'd shoot you
but they'd hear the gunshot.

707
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:58,533
And to be honest, you know,
guns kinda bore me.

708
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:04,071
I guess I'll just have to find
a better way to kill you.

709
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:54,589
Yeah!

710
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:56,123
That's a Noble song.

711
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:57,457
Whoo!

712
00:50:57,491 --> 00:50:59,293
That would blow up on Parler.

713
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:03,665
Christ, man, now what?

714
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,111
Don't open the door!

715
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:19,614
What the fuck?

716
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:22,182
Please don't open
the door, please!

717
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:23,417
Please!

718
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,453
No! No!

719
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:29,423
Darryl,
don't open the fucking door!

720
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:47,441
Darryl!

721
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:49,376
What the hell was that?

722
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:53,146
Did his head just explode?

723
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,282
Mother of God.

724
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:06,894
Darryl, what are we doin', man?

725
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:08,295
Should we go to the cops?

726
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:09,463
Oh, I don't know, Twig.

727
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:11,164
I got a headless corpse
on my doorstep

728
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,533
and enough weaponry in my barn

729
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:14,702
to start an insurrection
at town hall tomorrow,

730
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,303
so perhaps bringing the cops
onto the property

731
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:17,772
isn't the best course of action.

732
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:20,575
What do you think,
you fucking idiot?

733
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:22,510
Yeah, probably right.

734
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,246
You two.

735
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:27,548
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Fuck!

736
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:28,516
Talk.

737
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:30,618
-Okay, we killed the lady.
-No, no, hey, no.

738
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,487
We did not kill anyone.
Anthony did.

739
00:52:33,521 --> 00:52:35,188
-Who was she?
-She was just some old lady.

740
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:36,223
Who was she?

741
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,091
I don't know.
We don't know.

742
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,258
No, no, no,
he's telling the truth.

743
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,527
Look, Anthony wanted
to follow the girl home

744
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,896
from the diner and he said that
he was just gonna scare her.

745
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,463
But then some old lady
came out with a gun

746
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,666
and so, he fuckin' shot her.

747
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,366
And then we took her dog.

748
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,603
Dude, dude, dude,
that's it, dude,

749
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:49,570
I swear to God, man.

750
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:51,572
I'm supposed to believe
that a little girl

751
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:52,840
is doing all of this
on her own.

752
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,274
Yeah, I don't fuckin' know, man,

753
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:55,743
but we're telling you
everything.

754
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:58,846
You should've given her
her fuckin' dog back.

755
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,750
Wait a minute, did...

756
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,554
did you just say
"insurrection"?

757
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:07,822
What?

758
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,695
You just said that we have
enough weaponry in that barn

759
00:53:13,728 --> 00:53:15,897
for an insurrection.

760
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:19,801
I knew that
there was something

761
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:22,870
you two assholes
weren't telling me.

762
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,572
Are you fucking
kidding me, bro?

763
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,007
You said that
this was just a rally.

764
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,608
No one cares about that.

765
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:30,243
You guys have been lying to me
this entire fucking time.

766
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:32,680
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

767
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,585
Fuck this...

768
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:40,353
Fuck this.

769
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,488
I'm out.

770
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,991
No, hey--hey, Sean, listen.

771
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:48,295
That little psychopath just
blew Anthony's head sky high.

772
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:49,864
She'll kill you.

773
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:52,600
I'm gonna take my chances.

774
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:53,868
Sean.

775
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,770
Sean!

776
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:58,740
Hey. Wait, wait.

777
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:02,910
Stay. Stay the night.

778
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,581
We'll get through this,
together.

779
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:09,282
And you can help us
with our calling tomorrow,

780
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,284
for the brotherhood.

781
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:15,489
Fuck the brotherhood.

782
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:17,925
And fuck you,
you psycho motherf--

783
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,798
Jesus fuck!

784
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:30,571
I asked Anthony
to bring me Noble Men.

785
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:39,346
Now, this is not a Noble Man.

786
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,760
What about you?

787
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,098
Are you a Noble Man?

788
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,601
Do you honestly think
I would say no to that question

789
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,469
right now?

790
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:04,404
Answer the question.

791
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:05,573
Yes.

792
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:09,376
I'm a fucking Noble Man.

793
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:12,479
Good.

794
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:14,682
Move the body.

795
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,265
<i>You may want</i>
<i>to invest in one of those</i>

796
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:33,734
<i>power washers for the</i>
<i>front of your house.</i>

797
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:35,536
Are you having fun?

798
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,139
Wicked fun. You?

799
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,107
<i>I think that</i>
<i>I'm beginning to like you.</i>

800
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:42,543
Too bad the feeling
isn't mutual.

801
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:47,615
I'm told that my houseguests
upset you last night.

802
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,817
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

803
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:51,451
What is she saying?

804
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:52,854
Yeah, what's she saying?

805
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:54,421
I wanted to keep things cordial,

806
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:57,124
give you your dog back, but...

807
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,560
<i>you seem to have other plans.</i>

808
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:04,031
I would, uh, love
to play with you,

809
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:07,902
<i>really would,</i>
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

810
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,437
I have more pressing business
to attend to.

811
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,906
<i>It's not a bad plan,</i>

812
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:14,542
you know, the one you have to
attack town hall tomorrow.

813
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,946
What the hell's goin' on,
Darryl?

814
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:22,149
You're fuckin' with
the wrong guy, little girl.

815
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:26,120
I have photo evidence
from your little command center.

816
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:27,521
We should really talk

817
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:30,791
<i>about that creepy Senator</i>
<i>Hernandez mannequin, BT-dubs.</i>

818
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:32,459
<i>Did you buy that wig,</i>

819
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:36,097
<i>or is it something you enjoy</i>
<i>in your downtime?</i>

820
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,467
Maybe I should just put a bullet
in your dog's skull right now.

821
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,602
Do it and I'll send
all the photos

822
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:44,672
to the sheriff's office
the second I hear a gunshot.

823
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:48,441
<i>Every single one</i>
<i>of you fake patriotic fuckers</i>

824
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:49,911
<i>will go down.</i>

825
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:52,813
Yo, could you just tell me
if she's coming for me

826
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:55,016
since technically I'm the one
who fucked up her dog?

827
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:57,952
Fuck it, I'm gonna end this.

828
00:56:57,985 --> 00:57:01,188
Gotta admit, you got me
between a rock and a hard place.

829
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:03,658
Oh, good, then I'm doing
something right.

830
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,893
<i>You know what, fuck your dog.</i>

831
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:08,229
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

832
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:10,865
You could,
but then you'd never find

833
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,600
where I hid your thumb drive,

834
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:14,735
<i>and I bet a lot of people</i>
<i>would love to see</i>

835
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,469
<i>that list of douchebags.</i>

836
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,846
You're fuckin' dead.

837
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,049
Cool, just one more thing
real quick,

838
00:57:28,082 --> 00:57:30,483
your friend on the dock
could use a hand.

839
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:41,228
She's got a crossbow!

840
00:57:41,262 --> 00:57:42,763
She's got a fucking crossbow!

841
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:44,198
Get it out, Darryl, get it out!

842
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,200
Calm down!
All right, hold still.

843
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:47,601
Wait, what are
you gonna do?

844
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:48,970
What are you gonna do?!

845
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,072
Ah, fuck!

846
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:01,515
Wait, what are
you doing?

847
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:03,217
Twig, she has the USB!

848
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,023
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

849
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:33,647
Eat shit, you little bitch.

850
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:43,791
-She dead yet?
-She has the list.

851
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:45,860
-What list?
-The fucking list!

852
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:47,695
You can say that as many times
as you want, man,

853
00:58:47,728 --> 00:58:50,164
I'll still have no fucking idea
what you're talking about!

854
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,866
No, no, no, hey,
no, stop, please.

855
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:53,667
You're gonna stop him
from killing that girl,

856
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:55,669
and then you're gonna bring
her back to me alive,

857
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:57,304
and if you don't,
you will fucking wish

858
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:59,140
she was the one
who was slaughtering you!

859
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:00,574
-You get me?
-I get you.

860
00:59:00,608 --> 00:59:02,743
-You fucking get me?!
-I fucking get you!

861
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:03,944
Go!

862
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:07,648
Fuck this shit!

863
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:17,892
Motherfucker.

864
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:25,633
Hey!

865
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:30,571
Stop!

866
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:45,719
Looks like
someone's trapped, huh?

867
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:51,792
You're not gettin' out of this
barn alive, I'll tell you that.

868
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,131
Oh, fuck me.

869
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:37,138
No!

870
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,740
No!

871
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:44,111
No!

872
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:50,017
<i>I wish, but I couldn't</i>
<i>find the keys to that one.</i>

873
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,186
<i>Still, I managed.</i>

874
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,143
,
I have a kid!

875
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:18,112
I have a kid!

876
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,381
A baby boy,

877
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:22,750
and a wife.

878
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,386
I'm so sorry.

879
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,288
I'm sorry.

880
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:30,724
I act like I'm a tough guy,
but I'm not.

881
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:33,360
I act like I hate women,
but I don't.

882
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:35,095
I really don't.

883
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,867
I swear, if you let me live,
I will never say

884
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,470
another horrible thing
about women ever, ever again.

885
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:45,806
I'll love my wife
with all of me,

886
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:50,444
and I will raise my son
to be the best man he can be.

887
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:57,384
Please, I don't want to die.

888
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:58,886
I'll do anything.

889
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:02,756
What's his name?

890
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:04,925
Huh?

891
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:07,161
Your son, what's his name?

892
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,830
Fuck.

893
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:12,866
It's Adolf.

894
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:16,770
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

895
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:18,405
No!

896
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:19,266
Good morning.

897
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,904
You slept through the night.

898
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:33,247
Has anyone ever told you
that you cry out in your sleep?

899
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:37,051
Diego!

900
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:45,025
Try all you want, you're not
getting out of those knots.

901
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,293
Boy Scout.

902
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:52,600
You seem to have left this
in the woods.

903
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,872
You came prepared.

904
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:08,583
True Grit.

905
01:04:10,217 --> 01:04:11,586
You've got grit.

906
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:14,088
I'll give you that.

907
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,257
I also found this.

908
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,262
I figured it was nothing,
but then...

909
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,469
Looks like coordinates.

910
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,407
I think I'll keep it.

911
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:36,310
Darryl,

912
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:38,613
you out there talking
to yourself or what?

913
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:42,883
I'd introduce you two,
but I'm told you already met.

914
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:02,670
Well...

915
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:06,641
hello there, darling.

916
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:11,044
Remember me?

917
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,452
You look
confused.

918
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:20,354
Is it the name?

919
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:26,226
Now who says only men can name
their kids after themselves?

920
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,964
I may be the mastermind
of the Noble Men,

921
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:34,669
but I could still be woke, no?

922
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:44,378
I hear you've been causing
quite the ruckus around here.

923
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,023
So, tell me, darling,

924
01:05:56,724 --> 01:05:59,092
where is the thumb drive?

925
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:07,134
I don't think you understand
the gravity

926
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,503
of what it is
you're doing right now,

927
01:06:09,537 --> 01:06:14,441
but I would urge you
to reconsider.

928
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:18,479
You don't seriously think
I'll tell you, do you?

929
01:06:18,513 --> 01:06:19,681
Your son said it himself.

930
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:22,684
That little piece of plastic
is the only one of its kind,

931
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,786
which means the only reason
I'm still alive

932
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:27,454
is because I know where it is.

933
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:32,159
Well...

934
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,698
how about this?

935
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:40,167
If you tell us,
there is a small chance

936
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,637
I will let you go,

937
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:46,106
but if you don't tell us,
there's a far greater chance

938
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:50,110
that I will lose my patience
and say, "To hell with it,"

939
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:55,048
and let Darryl here
have his way with you.

940
01:06:56,651 --> 01:07:01,054
So, I'm gonna ask you
once again, sugar.

941
01:07:01,689 --> 01:07:04,358
Where is the thumb drive?

942
01:07:07,529 --> 01:07:08,663
Told you.

943
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:12,534
Well, you weren't kiddin'.

944
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:18,573
I think we might be goin'
about this all wrong.

945
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:20,708
Maybe you should join us, honey.

946
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:26,146
Hell, we could use some more
of that feisty female energy.

947
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:28,315
I'll pass.

948
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,685
Aw, shucks.

949
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:33,120
That's a shame.

950
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:37,759
Get him.

951
01:07:42,129 --> 01:07:45,399
You got quite the sweetie pie
here, you know that?

952
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:52,172
Yeah, we got to spend
some quality time together

953
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:55,108
while you were, uh, sleepin'.

954
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:58,211
I guess the boys were
a little bit busy, you know,

955
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:00,213
dealing with you and what all,

956
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:02,449
so by the time
I got here this morning,

957
01:08:02,482 --> 01:08:05,753
they had forgotten
to let the poor thing out.

958
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:10,157
So I took him out
to do his business.

959
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,594
Didn't I? Yeah.

960
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:14,328
Heel.

961
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,531
That's my boy!

962
01:08:16,564 --> 01:08:19,399
Yes, that's my boy.

963
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:21,669
Incredible, isn't it?

964
01:08:21,703 --> 01:08:25,573
Dogs, fascinating creatures,
aren't they?

965
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:28,442
They love their owners,

966
01:08:28,475 --> 01:08:31,512
but the one thing
that they love more

967
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:35,248
than their moms and pops
is food, of course,

968
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,885
especially meat.

969
01:08:37,919 --> 01:08:43,691
Yeah, and does this boy
love meat.

970
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:48,896
Yes, you're my love,
yes, you are.

971
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,935
You know, I am a dog lover
just like you, always have been.

972
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:58,940
In fact, I like animals
more than I like humans,

973
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:03,611
and although it's been said that
I have kind of a mean streak,

974
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:05,780
when it comes
to these little creatures,

975
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:09,817
I don't have a mean bone
in my body.

976
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:12,954
Now, Junior, on the other hand,

977
01:09:12,987 --> 01:09:17,692
he doesn't mind getting
his hands dirty, do you, baby?

978
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:21,228
Stop it!

979
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,898
Oh, he doesn't like that.

980
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,933
Here you go.

981
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:29,537
There, all better,
all better, right?

982
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,272
You just made
a big fucking mistake!

983
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:34,776
Darling, you are gonna tell me
where that thumb drive is,

984
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:37,578
or those mistakes
are gonna keep on happening,

985
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:43,216
and they are gonna get bigger
and badder until, eventually,

986
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:47,387
there won't be any air left
for him to yelp.

987
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:57,865
Okay.

988
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:01,703
Okay what?

989
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:06,541
I'll tell you where it is,
but...

990
01:10:08,442 --> 01:10:10,812
you have to make me a promise.

991
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:14,849
Put him away.

992
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:34,267
So, name your terms.

993
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:39,874
When I get out of this chair,

994
01:10:40,808 --> 01:10:42,877
and I kill you both,

995
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:46,748
promise me you'll go
straight to hell.

996
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:50,383
And how do you plan
on getting out of that chair?

997
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:52,452
Girl Scout.

998
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:53,554
God damn it.

999
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:12,472
Fuck.

1000
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,543
Fuck!

1001
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,514
Stop!

1002
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:25,086
I was gonna let my son kill you,

1003
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,657
but I think I'll do
the honors myself.

1004
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,894
If you kill me,
you'll never find the drive.

1005
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,529
Oh, you're right.

1006
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:38,365
Sorry, pooch.

1007
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:40,835
No!

1008
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:53,047
I'll be back, okay?

1009
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,883
You can't get hurt,
but I will be back.

1010
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,417
Okay, I'll be back, I promise.

1011
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,495
It was fun while it lasted.

1012
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:18,431
It's not over yet.

1013
01:14:06,047 --> 01:14:07,648
Well done.

1014
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,301
Diego!

1015
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,737
Diego, hi.

1016
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,238
Hi, hi, come here.

1017
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:05,940
Come here, come here.

1018
01:15:05,973 --> 01:15:07,208
Hi, yes.

1019
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:09,110
Hi, hi, come here.

1020
01:15:09,143 --> 01:15:12,213
I know, I know, I know.

1021
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,123
Hi, buddy, hi.

1022
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:33,167
Well, aren't you
two just the cutest?

1023
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:44,945
Guess you missed my brain.

1024
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:50,951
Guess I didn't.

1025
01:15:50,985 --> 01:15:53,154
Oh, shit.

1026
01:15:53,187 --> 01:15:54,955
Diego,

1027
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:57,691
attack.

1028
01:15:58,893 --> 01:16:00,327
No!

1029
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:03,798
No! No!

1030
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,201
You were right.

1031
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,838
He really does love meat.

1032
01:16:54,682 --> 01:16:56,183
Hello, Rebecca.

1033
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:59,053
I'm Kate Montana of the CIA.

1034
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:01,255
Do you know what this is?

1035
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:05,359
I might.

1036
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:07,061
That's a thumb drive,

1037
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:08,929
and it contains the names
of the members

1038
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:11,765
of one of the most dangerous
terrorist organizations

1039
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:13,067
in the United States.

1040
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,269
We've been following them
for years.

1041
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:17,671
They've expanded
through all fifty states,

1042
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:20,708
into law enforcement agencies
and government agencies,

1043
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:24,745
and you, a 16-year-old girl,

1044
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:27,648
you singlehandedly took out
one of their cells.

1045
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:31,152
One of them escaped.

1046
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:34,788
DJ Turner.

1047
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:36,223
Don't worry, we'll find him.

1048
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,362
What do you want?

1049
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:43,731
Just want to ask you
two questions.

1050
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:46,867
If you answer yes
to the first question,

1051
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,369
I'll move on
to the second question,

1052
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:51,038
but if you answer no
to the first question,

1053
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:53,207
then I will be unable to reveal
the second question,

1054
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,942
I will shake your hand,
I will thank you

1055
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:56,944
for the service you've performed
for your country,

1056
01:17:56,977 --> 01:17:58,812
the CIA will forget
about all this,

1057
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:01,348
and you can go back
to living your life.

1058
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:04,952
So, what do you think?

1059
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:07,288
Would you like to hear
the first question?

1060
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:09,323
That's not
the first question.

1061
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:11,792
Sure.

1062
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:19,033
Rebecca, would you be interested

1063
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:20,968
in being
the youngest ever recruit

1064
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:23,237
for the Central
Intelligence Agency?

1065
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:29,310
Fine.

1066
01:18:29,343 --> 01:18:32,213
I'm looking
for a yes or no answer.

1067
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:33,347
Yes.

1068
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:35,816
Good.

1069
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:38,419
Then I can move on
to question number two.

1070
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,388
Are you ready to find out

1071
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:43,123
what this belongs to?

1072
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:46,860
Yes.

1073
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:54,735
Now where's my fucking dog?

1074
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:07,281
Okay, check engine.

1075
01:19:07,314 --> 01:19:11,352
Well, there's engine oil,
there's oil.

1076
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:14,421
Something...

1077
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,359
Piece of shit.

1078
01:20:24,258 --> 01:20:25,292
Oh, f--
