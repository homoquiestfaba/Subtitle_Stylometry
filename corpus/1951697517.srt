It is this way better.

00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,453
Hour of count. All up.
Hour of count.

8
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,460
From 1934 at 1963, 28 lives in total
they got lost in Pelican,

9
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:12,294
already outside for murder, suicide
or illness.

10
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,300
But there was also quantity
of other deaths

11
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,360
that they never registered.

12
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,029
What...

13
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,012
what devils does it happen there below?

14
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,645
Where devils are you?
Show you.

15
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,683
We go, convict.

16
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,323
Behind, behind.

17
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,863
Get up. What devils faces?

18
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,990
Get up, convict.

19
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,765
We go, convict. Up.

20
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,332
Get up.

21
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,002
What devils?

22
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,280
Show you.

- Not you did play anything?
- No, I found this way it when entering.

36
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,940
Very well, care. Salt of the road.
I will hit.

37
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,600
Very well.

38
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,779
Does he/she hear, what does it happen there?

39
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,725
What do you see there inside?

40
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,728
What does it happen?

41
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,525
He/she smells of shit.

42
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,897
There, Mister.

43
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,042
Greyson keeps to base.

44
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,586
We have a situation in the island.

45
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,987
Wool Campbell, Criminalística,
Police of San Francisco.

46
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,859
You Were. the gamekeeper
that it found it?

47
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,525
Yes, they were remodeling the area
when me...

48
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,262
Has something played more?

49
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,964
I cut the cloth to see what there was under.

50
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,132
And he/she said that this cell was
walled until today?

51
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,869
Yes.

52
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,241
I will need their name,
personal information

53
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,007
and their position in the park.

54
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,240
Thank you... Greyson keeps.

55
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,718
That will be everything.

56
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,982
I am in charge of of here in more.

57
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,099
This is not a scene of the crime.

58
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,339
Not I know, Wool. I find that face
quite fresh.

59
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,404
It is because this place essentially

60
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,745
it has been a mausoleum
for heaven's sake he/she knows how many years.

61
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,216
He/she takes an approach
of the cloth.

62
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,421
Do you see the symbols?

63
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,521
They seem ceremonial.
Maybe outside a funeral place.

64
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,260
What there was here before
that they built the prison?

65
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,598
What you me.

66
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,298
Good... at the moment I won't request
support some.

67
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,001
My preliminary evaluation
it is that this is historical.

68
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,644
Then we return it to him
to Parks and Recreations?

69
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,908
No. I Will Call to Hauser
in the university.

70
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,506
I will leave that him and their students
be in charge of of digging.

71
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,246
I am investigating of scenes
of the crime, non archaeologist.

72
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,288
- Students?
- Of graduate degree.

73
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,119
I have already worked with him.
Their team is quite competent.

74
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,353
And he doesn't find difficult a cent
to my office.

75
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,395
I will let them them to get dirty
the hands.

76
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,556
Will you need me no longer more?

77
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,428
- No, you finished.
- Very well.

78
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,514
Do go view, not?

79
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,077
I have lived all my life here.

80
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,918
I am accustomed.

81
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,618
I could never get tired of her.

82
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,427
Ah, good morning.

83
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,625

WELCOME INDIANS
PENITENTIARY DE U.S.

85
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,358
Devils, boys, all these
girls are beautiful.

86
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,796
Calm with the girls.
We are working.

87
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,069
We all should behave
very well.

88
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,764
There are good probabilities that this
end up in the journalist.

89
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,204
Not we need bad press.

90
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,902
We facilitate a quick investigation
for this people.

91
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,740
I want them outside of here

92
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,838
and to Pelican reabierta to the public
as soon as possible.

93
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,214
What difficulty is there, boss? It is easier
that to fight with 1.000 tourists.

94
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,617
Yes, good, those tourists pay
our wage.

95
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,518
The more time is closed the island,

96
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,057
less opportunity has
of getting increase.

97
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,788
That came of up.
Only watch over them, boys.

98
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes.

99
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,731
It is this way.

100
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,318
Michael, thank you to come
with so little warning.

101
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,224
They found remains
in a secret dungeon

102
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,593
in the heart of Pelican.
How could I resist?

103
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,655
When having known their boss
of department,

104
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,099
I understand that to you. they seem to fascinate him/her
the mummified remains.

105
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,864
I believe that these they precede
to my jurisdiction.

106
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,771
But if they find it, it would not bother me
to stay a time...

107
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,705
to see what they say.

108
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,870
This is the guard Greyson.
It was him who informed of the discovery.

109
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,972
The and other two guards will be
present during their demurrage.

110
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,346
Good day, I am Michael Hauser

111
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,784
of the department of Anthropology of
San Francisco's State University.

112
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,822
- But, please, call me doc.
- Welcome to Pelican, doctor.

113
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,155
They are the guard Vásquez
and the guard Figgs.

114
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,717
The island has been closed until
let us arrive to the bottom of this.

115
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,731
They stopped the renovations
and we close it to the tourists.

116
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,858
The guards are here
as custody,

117
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,095
but if they need something,
they will be happy of helping them.

118
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,331
Stupendous. I doubt that we are
a great nuisance.

119
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,669
Truth, Kurt?

120
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,073
Allow me to present to the team
that I have formed

121
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,134
and their varied areas
of experience.

122
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,477
They are Andrew Dittmer,
forensic anthropology;

123
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,414
Tiffany Lynch,
applied geociencias,

124
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,213
and the anthropology student

125
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,913
and black sheep of the family,

126
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,922
Sr. Kurt Polsky;

127
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,015
and finally,

128
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,650
my assistant, Alissa Deerhorn,

129
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,958
that he/she will be carrying out work
post-doctorate in archaeology.

130
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,658
All they are very capable,
surely.

131
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,031
I have fixed an exam room
storm

132
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,763
in the watch of the hospital
of the prison.

133
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,328
- I hope it is in the first floor.
- Yes.

134
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,931
He/she keeps, he/she can make that their men
show them the road

135
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,306
and do they help them with their team?

136
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,436
In fact only we need
address.

137
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,377
Not it is very easy to walk here.

138
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,507
I will make that the guard Figgs
help them.

139
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,882
Tiffany, you could help me
with that, please?

140
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,887
And Wool, if you like to show me
the road...

141
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,820
- We go.
- Will we work, yes?

142
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,473
Kurt, you could take a picture
of this, please,

143
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,774
before it exposes the face?

144
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,947
Thank you.

145
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,187
This cut in the cloth is recent.
Who did make it?

146
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,232
The guard Greyson. He/she said that there was
a small opening at the beginning,

147
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,734
but that he/she opened it a little more
to see the content.

148
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,168
That is understandable.

149
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,331
Because we will begin the exhumation

150
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,433
and he/she will end for ends
of this afternoon

151
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,035
what will put them on time at home
to have dinner.

152
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,580
Let us wait.
Some initial observation?

153
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,083
Good...

154
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,245
definitively there is an agent
preservative working here,

155
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,347
possibly in the floor,
the cloth or maybe the same body.

156
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,187
The approximate year of the death...

157
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,127
it costs to estimate it at first sight,
but I doubt that it was a convict.

158
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,359
- Why?
- Their description for telephone

159
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,027
it was incredibly detailed.
He/she has indigenous origin.

160
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,535
He/she costs to say it until
let us discover it more,

161
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,474
but I would say of principles
of the century XIX.

162
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,238
Can I look more than close?

163
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,835
Please, yes.

164
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,109
Not it is beautiful, not?

165
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,048
What does it happen, Alissa?

166
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,659
The teeth have been filed
as eyeteeth.

167
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,628
It is indicative of a tribe
in particular?

168
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,424
No longer.

169
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,730
Of what tribe was it indicative?

170
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,968
I have to see before more than it
of being able to emit an informed opinion.

171
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,633
Good, clear.

172
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,008
- Clear, it is well, Alissa, thank you.
- Sure.

173
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,071
Obviously it is not accustomed
to work with dead things.

174
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,783
He/she hears. Slowly with that.

175
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,886
- Please.
- I sit down it.

176
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,197
That was amusing.

177
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,098
You believe that we could return
to make it?

178
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,194
- Of anything, Andrew.
- As I said...

179
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,068
I thanked you the.

180
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,806
You were too busy
panting, friend.

181
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,609
Not I am your friend.

182
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,147
What problem does he/she have?

183
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,913
We are only about organizing them
in this room.

184
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,750
Are they clever?

185
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,551
Yes, that will be everything.

186
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,491
- Yes, thank you.
- Any problem. We will be here.

187
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,563
This will be interesting, yes.

188
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,947
Doc, believes that we will take out it
of here for tomorrow?

189
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,280
We are lucky... the floor is
relatively loose.

190
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,377
Do do me a favor, yes?
He/she Calls to Tiffany

191
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,445
to see if he/she already prepared the room
of exam.

192
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,217
- Tell him/her that he/she comes to accompany.
- Clear.

193
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,788
Do you make progress?

194
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,627
- Slowly.
- Rays. Not I have reception.

195
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,723
He/she won't have it. Low earth is

196
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,360
and the walls are very thick.
Not he/she will have reception

197
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,405
in any place of the prison.
He/she has to go out.

198
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,033
- That stinks.
- No, no, don't worry.

199
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,168
I already spoke with her.
I told him/her that it lowered.

200
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,871
- Sure?
- Yes.

201
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,209
I requested information on the prison
that he/she can help.

202
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,717
It seems that they were adding
cells here below.

203
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,482
This was one of first o'clock,
but they never finished them.

204
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,989
That would explain the earth floor,
then.

205
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,252
Why didn't he/she end?

206
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,920
Seemingly they retained
to a prisoner here...

207
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,988
temporary lodging until
another location was gotten.

208
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,194
He/she says that he/she went mad,
it killed a guard and then he/she committed suicide.

209
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,237
It is known why the place
is it walled?

210
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,295
No, he/she only says that he/she stopped
the construction.

211
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,034
The prison closed
some years later.

212
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,370
There is something buried next to the body.

213
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,514
Very well, do you happen to me the marshy one?

214
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,776
Thank you.

215
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,588
Do you give me place?

216
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,132
What do we have here?

217
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,770
- It seems an axe.
- It is an axe of war.

218
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,847
Here there are gifts.

219
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,459
What does he/she say of the devices, doctor?

220
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,018
Not I know. I find unknown.

221
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,121
Tribe chappa, century XIX.

222
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,063
It fits with the shroud.

223
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,398
What, now you are expert
in indigenous history?

224
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,700
No, but I am part Indian kutchin

225
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,263
and it used to visit my grandparents
in a reservation.

226
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,741
So I know a little on
the indigenous tribes

227
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,778
of the northwest of Pacific.

228
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,314
What do you know about the tribe chappa, Alissa?

229
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,351
A peaceful culture of fishermen
and merchants, more than anything,

230
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,886
until an illness
practically it eliminated them.

231
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,299
An illness?
Of what type?

232
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,066
Between 1840 and 1843,

233
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,700
the missionaries documented
a terrible illness

234
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,368
inside a coastal tribe.

235
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,709
He/she says the legend that caused insanity
and, in many cases, the death.

236
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,648
The legend?
With the due respect, Alissa,

237
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,015
we need to try with the facts.

238
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,055
The documents were scare
on the original epidemic

239
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,955
since only it affected
to the natives.

240
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,686
It cost to find facts.

241
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,888
Nobody knew what it was or why only
it affected to the tribe chappa.

242
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,135
Then, in their estimate,
are these remains of the century XIX?

243
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,367
Based on what I have seen
up to now...

244
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,205
and in this axe of war,

245
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,710
absolutely.

246
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,541
Dr. Hauser?

247
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,139
I trust the educated trial of Alissa

248
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,650
as for the origin
of these devices.

249
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,914
As it is, I would like...

250
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,388
Then this is historical.
My work finished.

251
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,516
I will request a ferry to return
to the continent

252
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,060
and I will call them for a summary
of their discoveries.

253
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,989
- By the way.
- Thanks to all for their hard work.

254
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,997
It is hurried.
Is everything well?

255
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,733
Wool investigates scenes of the crime.

256
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,970
And... San Francisco's city
it seems to maintain it very busy.

257
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,243
- The exam room is clever.
- Brilliant, excellent.

258
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,649
You could take a sample
of the floor as soon as possible

259
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,187
- and to make an elementary analysis?
- Clear.

260
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,382
- He/she takes.
- Thank you.

261
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,947
- Doc?
- Yes?

262
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,493
Go to smoke.

263
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,929
We Go, Kurt. You said that you would leave.
It will kill you.

264
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,829
Thank you for the advice, doc.

265
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,767
Well, return all to work.

266
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,068
Alissa, does something happen?

267
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,269
No, Dr. Hauser...

268
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,543
for anything.

269
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,147
Boss, is some place here
where it can get cigarettes?

270
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,990
Do you give me one whistled, old?
I die from desires.

271
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,126
He/she takes this. I have another bundle
in the station.

272
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,730
- I thank you. Do you already know how it is, not?
- Any problem.

273
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,775
I take years being about leaving.

274
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:34,175
- Yes, good luck with that.
- Yes, equally.

275
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,342
- Station of guards of Pelican.
- With the guard Greyson, please.

276
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,241
- The same one.
- There Was Wool Campbell.

277
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,473
I will leave Dr. Hauser and to the rest
of their team

278
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,879
as responsible for the rest
of the exhumation.

279
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,248
It can organize that the ferry
does he/she come to look for me?

280
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,048
I will request it for radio, Srta. Campbell.

281
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,487
I will be waiting in the jetty.
You. he/she has my number.

282
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,251
Do call me when it is in road, yes?

283
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,350
He/she can take a time, Mrs..

284
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,692
The ferry doesn't work in its schedules
habitual during this situation.

285
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,597
It is very cold here, so make
what can, yes?

286
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,770
She is unbearable.

287
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,518
Alissa, makes while...

288
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,852
you seemed very concerned
for the teeth in the skull.

289
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,757
What do you know about these remains?

290
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,822
It is a warring otaktay.

291
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,560
Otaktay.

292
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,829
It continues.

293
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,498
In sioux it means bush to many. "

294
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,404
I believed that you had said
that the chappa

295
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,103
they were a nation of merchants
and fishermen.

296
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,168
Peaceful.

297
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,079
Yes, until the illness arrived.

298
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,346
It is said that those that didn't die
they became totally crazy.

299
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,187
He/she will see...

300
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,847
the earth was near the water...

301
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,324
and other tribes considered it
property of first.

302
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,725
Then the chappa was attacked.

303
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,820
In order to be protected,

304
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,195
the craziest chappa

305
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,826
they were thrown against the invaders.

306
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,200
And these the warring otaktay is?

307
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,034
Yes.

308
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,940
I say, they are only the histories
that my grandparents counted me.

309
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,637
It is only a legend.

310
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,612
But you seem it bothers hence.

311
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,651
Alissa, looks, I want you to know

312
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,448
that the legend often
it is based on facts

313
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,115
and if you believe that there is more
that you should say me,

314
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,658
I request you that you make it.

315
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,827
It is said that they made more
that to kill their enemies.

316
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,891
They tortured them, they quartered,

317
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,493
they gutted...

318
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,006
until there was cannibalism.

319
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,668
There was less than 2.000 otaktay,
but...

320
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,506
they resisted to warriors' thousands.

321
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,545
God. Tiffany, what does it happen?

322
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,105
Anything.

323
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,243
It was only a scarab.
I hate the insects.

324
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,119
I will take these samples
to the exam room.

325
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,454
I will analyze them there.

326
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,186
Very well, Tiffany, ahead.

327
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,194
We will see each other there up.

328
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,287
It is well. It is well.

329
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,418
He/she notices for me...
to remember to make a formal complaint

330
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,923
regarding the guard and their personnel.
They are a heap of...

331
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,216
Damned it is, Kurt.

332
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,088
Don't get scared this way.

333
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,320
I only believed that you would want company.
We go.

334
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,488
- Imbécil.
- We go.

335
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,895
Seriously, we will speak of Pelican,

336
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,269
we will compare notes during the dinner.
It will be very amusing, I promise it.

337
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,967
- We go.
- Yes, it sounds well.

338
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,068
He/she waits... I forgot that it is the day
of my sister's birthday.

339
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,807
It is completely well, you can bring it.
It will be amusing.

340
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,042
He/she is 13 years old, sick.

341
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,813
Maybe later in the week?

342
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,150
Not I know. We can speak
of this later?

343
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,123
Yes, I don't know. You are really no longer
in the university.

344
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,022
And we used to throw looks.

345
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,324
And it was really good, and sweet,
do you know?

346
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,886
He/she looks at this look...

347
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,365
N - OR.

348
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,562
You know that that is
the mistaken answer?

349
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,663
I find the correct answer.

350
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,641
You will shave me the balls with that,
Andrew?

351
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,338
It is an idea.

352
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,074
Yes, good...

353
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,016
I would love to stay, but I should
to return to the excavation.

354
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,110
- Maybe later, hey?
- Yes.

355
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,779
Do we see each other then?

356
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,349
Ass.

357
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,154
Say it to me.

358
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,654
Very well, we will work.

359
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,956
God, God willing they had discovered
the body

360
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,889
in the basement of Macy's or something like that.

361
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,223
Yes, during a liquidation,
without a doubt.

362
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,426
Very comic.

363
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,230
Damned it is.

364
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,966
Can we help him in something, does he/she keep?

365
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,908
I understand why the youth
it could be uncomfortable here.

366
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,878
A lot of people died in this room.

367
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,975
Does these tijas come in the wall?

368
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,543
Each one of them

369
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,555
it was extracted of the body
of a convict

370
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,955
or... of a couple of guards.

371
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,252
Thank you, but we don't need
the details.

372
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,298
They also said

373
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,424
that 15 men of Pelican

374
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,365
they died for an illness.

375
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,064
The registrations say natural" causes,

376
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,765
but the truth is

377
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,808
that they don't know what it killed them.

378
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,008
Very well.

379
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,572
We finish per today.

380
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,208
Take everything up.

381
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,480
Thank you, friends.
A great day of work.

382
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,520
Greyson Keeps,
he/she came to look for it exactly.

383
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,893
We can organize our trip
of return?

384
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,297
Unfortunately, doctor,
we find a problemita.

385
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,999
Did they hear of the ghost of Pelican, not?

386
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,370
Sometimes, at night,

387
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,602
I hear strange things,

388
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,907
especially from this part
of the prison.

389
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,078
- As what?
- Don't listen to it, Tiffany.

390
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,153
In that place...

391
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,085
they sometimes had to amputate members.

392
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,652
In those days, there was not...

393
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,493
Well, look, thank you.

394
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,658
But like he/she can see
we are very busy.

395
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,726
We thank him/her for the information.

396
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,773
I only thought of sharing the history
of the prison with you.

397
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,138
Most has to pay
the visit.

398
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,541
Because tonight we don't give visits.

399
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,237
Vásquez Keeps,
can he/she wait for me out?

400
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,583
Very well, friends.
I have news.

401
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,716
Due to accidental circumstances,

402
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,886
we will spend the night in the island.

403
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,862
What? Why?

404
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,922
The ferry has mechanical problems

405
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,865
and we don't have how to return.

406
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,267
Is he/she joking?

407
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,597
Do we have to sleep here?

408
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,199
That is brilliant.

409
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,111
In fact, nobody has spent the night
in these cells in decades.

410
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,876
In the cells?

411
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,474
Forget it. Not I will sleep
in a cell.

412
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,020
Lament to say that you don't have
a lot of option.

413
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,283
The ferry is the only exit
of the island.

414
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,291
And there is only enough place

415
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,623
in the rooms of the guards
for them.

416
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,196
We have pillows and you cover.

417
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,857
I believe that there is enough
for all you.

418
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,869
For sure it is sanitary?

419
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,770
The mattresses are old.
They should put them above a blanket.

420
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,865
I will make that the guard Figgs
bring beach

421
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,001
for the young ladies of the store
of gifts.

422
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,109
He/she will have to go out, Mrs..

423
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,207
Among these walls, they only work
the walkie-talkies.

424
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,981
Out it is dark...
and it is cold.

425
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,616
If you will leave to call to somebody,

426
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,660
I can accompany.

427
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,718
As you will walk, brother?

428
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,060
Kurt.

429
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,599
He/she only said.

430
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,158
The station of guards
he/she has kitchen.

431
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,434
I will fix that they bring them food.

432
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,169
They already know where they are
the bathrooms out.

433
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,537
I will request to all
that they don't go for a walk.

434
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,843
Stay in the pavilion
as much as it is possible.

435
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,780
What will you make, Power Ranger?

436
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,546
Will you contain us here the whole night?

437
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,085
They are in the part of the pavilion
more restored.

438
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,355
All these cell doors
they are totally operational.

439
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,862
Good night.

440
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,376
I know that it is not a lot of dinner, Tiffany,

441
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,778
but only this could find
the guard.

442
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,408
What is, was hungry.

443
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,009
At least it will allow us to begin
early in the morning

444
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,384
and to end up for tomorrow in the afternoon.

445
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,083
I like it.

446
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,284
Which of You. he/she will walk
with me?

447
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,224
You already heard what the guard said.

448
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,990
We go, I don't want to infuriate it.

449
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,395
And I neither want
that they break the head.

450
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,297
You believe that at least they have
a washbasin

451
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,335
to be able to take off the make-up?

452
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,337
You put on make-up
to come to the prison?

453
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,270
Yes, not a lot, a little.

454
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,103
I doubt that there has been
it dilutes current

455
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,904
in this building in decades.

456
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,378
I believe that the nearest bathroom
he/she would be the public of the jetty.

457
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,005
Out?

458
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,913
Not it cares. I will hold back.

459
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,622
He/she looks, I know that it is not Ritz,

460
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,852
but there are not a lot of people
obedient of the law

461
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,156
that he/she can say
that it spent the night in Pelican.

462
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,459
Sr. Polsky.

463
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,466
It is only a prison, doc.
What problem is there?

464
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,594
In fact, this place
he/she has a great history.

465
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,798
It began as military strength
in 1853.

466
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,308
- Military strength?
- Yes.

467
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,641
To protect the coast to the other side
of the bay when they found gold.

468
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,513
And then it housed prisoners
of Guerra Civilian and to criminals.

469
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,518
Then, the Ministry of Justice
charge was taken in 1934

470
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,645
and it transformed it into penitentiary.

471
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,889
Doc, if it doesn't bother him/her,
I will see the kitchen.

472
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,690
- Yes.
- Iré to penetrate the penitentiary, doc.

473
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,791
You like that.

474
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,131
Yes, go history.

475
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,306
What he/she takes this place
that you don't like it, Alissa?

476
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,008
Why would you ask that?

477
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,108
I have just seen the way
in that looked on the way here.

478
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,015
There is something in this place.

479
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,557
Anything good it leaves never
of this island.

480
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,536
- Carlos, I have an idea.
- Which?

481
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,768
Only because our lives
they are so boring

482
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,810
and we don't have money,

483
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,073
the man with better hand
of these five letters

484
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,637
he/she receives the last beer.

485
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,876
- Agreement, friend.
- Of agreement.

486
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,684
- What do you have?
- Two bosses.

487
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,315
Two aces. Thank you
for the beer, puto.

488
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,628
He/she has to have
true food here.

489
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,728
Tiff, allow me to wonder something.

490
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,894
Do you believe that it could achieve it?

491
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,460
What thing?

492
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,438
To escape... of Pelican.

493
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,805
Kurt, you would not last 10 minutes

494
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,935
in that icy water
before drowning.

495
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,309
Allow me to educate you one second.

496
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,213
There was a couple of types that really
they escaped of here.

497
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,810
And those fond of the conspiracies
they will tell you that they escaped,

498
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,616
did they swim, and did they fish a boat, not?

499
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,247
The government...

500
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,655
and the guards of the prison will tell you

501
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,923
that they escaped, they swimed
and they drowned.

502
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,023
I don't know it.
I believe that I can achieve it.

503
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,590
I believe that you lie shamelessly.

504
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,761
You remember the Occupation Indígena

505
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,361
of 1969?

506
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,236
Ah, yes, it was very controversial.

507
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,037
It was a peaceful movement,

508
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,374
but he/she became a chaos.

509
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,846
A youth fell and you/he/she was killed.

510
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,382
What do you find this?

511
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,612
If one day I decide to challenge
to the elements,

512
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,086
you have to promise me
that you will go to an appointment with me.

513
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,385
Very well, Kurt Polsky.

514
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,120
If you arrive to the other side of that island,

515
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,185
I promise that I will go in an appointment with you.

516
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:33,957
Swear him with your little finger.

517
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,460
Not I know you, but that food

518
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,230
he/she would have known better
if we were drugged.

519
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,034
- Do you have grass?
- Salt of here. Not you do smoke, not?

520
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,632
What? Not I am so innocent.

521
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,438
He/she says the legend that this place
it is damned.

522
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,012
Do you know what? There is a scientific term
for what you say.

523
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,143
He/she calls himself foolishness, my lover.

524
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,384
Well, and how you can explain
that a place attracts so much wrong?

525
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,449
Alissa, you really believe
that this place attracts to the wrong?

526
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,961
Not believe anything of what tells you.

527
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,793
She is only about getting scared.

528
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,697
- Not it is this way.
- Of course...

529
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,998
No, it is not this way.

530
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,233
He/she listens, at the beginning,
the warring otaktay was

531
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,934
to protect to the chappa
of other tribes.

532
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,172
But once the otaktay
they defeated their enemies,

533
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,407
they began to kill their own people.

534
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,881
Then the old chappa
they told to the otaktay

535
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,714
that there was a Great Spirit
awaiting them in this island

536
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,755
that he/she would make them immortal.

537
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,484
Once the otaktay
they arrived here,

538
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,583
the chappa burned their canoes.

539
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,651
The otaktay was caught.

540
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,062
The chappa calls to this place
the Isla of the Madness.

541
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,401
What did it pass them then?

542
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,027
Nobody really knows...

543
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,073
unless in 1853, when it arrived
the American army,

544
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,301
they killed the survivors
that they were.

545
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,345
How you explain the nature ritualista
of the funeral place?

546
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,210
Not it seems something he/she would make the army,
truth?

547
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,308
The American army then
it used indigenous guides.

548
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,081
They are who buried
appropriately to the otaktay.

549
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,349
And we were lucky of finding one.

550
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,149
Not I know if luck is the word
correct, doctor.

551
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,855
The chappa said that the spirit
otaktay is vengeful

552
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,229
to be betrayed and abandoned
for their own people to die.

553
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:21,332
You really believe this curse,
no, Alissa?

554
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,770
What ridicule.

555
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,232
Agreement.

556
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,141
Do you hear that?

557
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,077
What thing, Carlos, puto?

558
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,481
Vince, are you well?

559
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,822
Vince, are you well, friend?

560
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,936
Yes.

561
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,102
Yes. Yes, I am well.

562
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,550
Carlos, allow me to make you
an important question.

563
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,212
What?

564
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,847
How it is that, on the outside,

565
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,916
you act as this Carlos
enormous and rude,

566
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,551
but inside, old,

567
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,755
you are an enormous one... maricón?

568
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,025
He/she only gives letters.

569
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,780
Shut up both.

570
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,850
Will give a last beat.

571
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,010
Make sure that the lights
be out.

572
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,978
Already.

573
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,551
I want this.

574
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,331
- What do you make?
- We go.

575
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,669
I will take the pavilion D,
the dining room and the kitchen.

576
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,079
- You take the pavilions TO", B" and C."
- Yes.

577
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,592
Not I can believe that we are
drugging in Pelican.

578
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,830
I wonder if To Capone
it was drugged.

579
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,667
Of course that yes.

580
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,432
The bad minds think equally.

581
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,670
They come here.

582
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,770
Kurt, I know good.

583
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,678
Do we go, language?

584
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,279
PROPIEDAD OF PELICAN

585
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,990
Did you hear that?

586
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,821
I swear that I heard something.

587
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,958
Let us should probably return.

588
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:22,266
If they fish us,
we will have serious problems.

589
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,103
No, what we need to make
it is to stay here

590
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,144
and to smoke the rest of this damned joint,

591
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,509
and we need to see a ghost.

592
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,639
I silence, the sound arrives far.

593
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,344
Somebody will hear us.

594
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,579
I am so flown right now.

595
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,554
- You are drugged.
- No, flown.

596
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,682
- You are drugged.
- I am only very flown.

597
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,588
Did you hear that?

598
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,958
It was probably the wind.

599
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,435
That was not the damned wind.

600
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,995
Tiff, you already read the pamphlet,

601
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,268
and you know that Pelican
it is bewitched.

602
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,675
Be quiet. You know that they scare me
the ghosts. Not say that.

603
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,051
Damned it is. You killed me of the fright.

604
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,425
Who did close this door, Carlos?

605
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,329
I don't know it. Probably
one of those boys.

606
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,267
I believe that there is a rat inside.

607
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:36,635
I will make them to open it later.

608
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,539
We go, I will travel
the pavilion D."

609
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,043
You ascend to travel the perimeter.

610
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,307
We go.

611
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,702
Good morning, Kurt.

612
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,432
Do you return to the place?

613
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,107
I will only stay to...

614
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,977
to categorize the pictures a while.

615
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,341
Do you feel well?

616
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,080
I gave turns the whole night.

617
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,122
The damned bed is a shit.

618
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,855
I will take the remains to the room
of exam up

619
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,452
in one hour, so I will need
your muscles for that.

620
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,990
That said her.

621
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,331
Oh, God, we go.

622
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,592
How did all sleep?

623
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,822
It was a memorable experience.

624
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,525
The ferry will arrive this afternoon,

625
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,696
or that has told me.

626
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,002
Well, we will take the remains up

627
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,907
to the exam room to revise them
superficially.

628
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:24,242
After that, we will prepare them
to take them out of the island.

629
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,080
That leaves disgustingly indigenous.

630
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,983
It is indigenous, yes.

631
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,516
As I said, disgustingly indigenous.

632
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,389
How crazy.

633
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,260
Not I can wait to enter there.

634
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,597
He/she looks at the eyeteeth.

635
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,407
It seems man wolf or something like that.

636
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:59,414
Yes, old, you will be a great investigator
forensic.

637
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:03,179
There is more money there that exhuming
Pygmy bones in Thailand, friend.

638
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,477
Are you well?

639
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,217
He/she knew it. There...

640
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,156
Not I know.

641
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,496
He/she looks... I don't know.

642
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,503
Allow me to lower... I don't know it.

643
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,335
Will I only go below with the other ones, yes?

644
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,874
Yes, old.

645
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:07,212
You have to stop of smoking
that shit.

646
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,298
Guerrero otaktay.

647
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:30,032
Ah, yes.

648
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,438
It is incredibly well preserved.

649
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:37,244
Probably of half-filled
of the century XIX did say, Alissa?

650
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,678
It is incredible.

651
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,119
I am taking a sample
right now

652
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,781
to verify the preservatives.

653
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,518
This is only a shroud, Kurt.

654
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,526
The chappa didn't mummify
to their deads.

655
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,289
I will take an anyway,
thank you.

656
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,662
Friends, look at this.
Look, the cavity of the chest is entire

657
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:00,134
and all the internal organs

658
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,761
they follow present.

659
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,941
Dr. Hauser, how does he/she explain to it?

660
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,570
I believe that the floor had something
that to do with it.

661
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,171
I found high you even so much
of carbonate of sodium

662
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,715
as of bicarbonate.

663
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,809
The carbonate acts as blotter
that it slows the decomposition.

664
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,411
And the bicarbonate, when it is
subject to the humidity,

665
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,616
the pH level increases,

666
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,353
and believe a half hostile one
for the bacteria.

667
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,861
Yes, but the cells were
totally blocked.

668
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,158
How did it get humidity?

669
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,960
The crowd.

670
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,627
The floor here is full
of crowd,

671
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,932
probably conduction
of the island Angel,

672
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,268
when this place was prison
of the army.

673
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,037
Excellent, Tiffany.
Excellent.

674
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,804
It is exactly what should be.

675
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,540
Thanks to all... they have been
making their task.

676
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,105
I am really very impressed.

677
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,447
But...

678
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,851
however, this doesn't explain to it
completely.

679
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,454
Thank you.

680
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,134
Thank you.

681
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,433
He/she comes to see this.

682
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,905
- Do bleed?
- It is what seems.

683
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,473
How strange.

684
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,220
That cannot have more
of one or two days.

685
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,197
Are you well?

686
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,966
No. Iré to take air, yes?

687
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,616
Dr. Hauser, your work here
did it already finish?

688
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,953
Yes, we only prepare the remains

689
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,458
to take them out of the island.

690
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,892
Their hand... it is infected.

691
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,626
- Allow me to give him/her a glance.
- That won't be necessary.

692
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,163
You. it was who cut the shroud

693
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,535
and it is their blood in the cadaver.

694
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,904
It is worse of that than it is.

695
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,307
I will warn them when the ferry arrives.

696
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,856
Tiffany, are you well?

697
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,657
I don't know it. I don't feel well.
I feel insolent.

698
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,844
God.

699
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,919
He/she keeps. What did it happen to you?

700
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,191
Sacred God.

701
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,892
He/she hears, stay with us,
stay with us.

702
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,416
Vince.

703
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,825
I finished with my beats.

704
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,835
Who did turn off the lights?

705
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,071
What devils does it happen in this place?

706
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,745
We go, friends.
Stop to play.

707
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,808
Kurt, are you?

708
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,047
We go, we have work
that to make. We go.

709
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,720
We go, friends.
Do light the lights, yes?

710
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,894
Where are you?

711
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,391
Alissa. Tiffany. We go.

712
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,197
We should leave of here now.

713
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,670
- What does it happen?
- Only grab all that of the cells

714
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,436
- and vayámonos now.
- What did it pass with the lights?

715
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,568
We go, listen.
At the moment, please,

716
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,307
we need to leave of here.
Grab everything and vayámonos.

717
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,158
We go, friends.
This is no longer amusing.

718
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,628
Hello.

719
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,868
Rays.

720
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,932
Very well, you won, of agreement.

721
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,979
You scared me. You won.

722
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,450
Kurt, show you, damned it is.

723
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,543
Tiffany, you can walk
for the corridor

724
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,417
to see if you can find
the control panel

725
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,252
and to make that they open up
these damned doors?

726
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,485
No. No, I won't go there me.

727
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,151
- Where is Kurt?
- I don't know it.

728
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,253
I don't know it, but he/she will already return.

729
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,595
Tiffany, please, I really need
that you make this for us.

730
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,567
Notice if you can open these doors.

731
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,626
He/she walks, you can make it.

732
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,729
- Take care.
- Carajo.

733
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,235
Very well.

734
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,938
What does it happen, doctor?

735
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,942
I found the guard Tyler

736
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,613
in one of the confinamiento cells
and it had been...

737
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,851
What? What?
Had it been what?

738
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,223
The brutalizaron terribly.

739
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,955
Oh, my God.

740
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,710
Vince, are you?

741
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:31,145
The control panel?

742
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,313
Not I know what a damned panel is
of control.

743
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,925
Carlos...

744
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,112
We go, we go.

745
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,545
Oh, God.

746
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,647
He/she knew it.

747
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:12,387
We should never have exhumed
those remains, doctor.

748
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,861
Apologize, I am not in a mood
for fairy tales.

749
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,398
There are other things apart from the sky
and the earth, doctor.

750
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,990
We go.

751
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,394
Please...

752
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,871
- No. Tiffany.
- My God.

753
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,742
Who... who does this make?

754
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:38,780
What type of damned ass are you?

755
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,315
Prostitute's son.

756
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,519
When he/she opens this damned door,
you are dead man.

757
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,065
Who... he/she makes... this?

758
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,294
Who are?
Not I know that I made.

759
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,827
- They come to me.
- I want to leave of here, please.

760
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,567
I know man.

761
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,610
Who... does he/she make...?

762
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,269
Oh, God.

763
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,472
That somebody helps me.

764
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:08,676
We go. Please, help me.

765
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,856
Socorro.

766
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,829
You know, it kills me to have to be flattened,
Andrew.

767
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,264
Carajo.

768
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,281
Doctor, we won't be able to leave of here.

769
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,515
We will die to the equal
that damned Tiffany.

770
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,354
He/she hears, he/she hears, calm down, calm down.

771
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,155
Concentrate. We have
that to leave of here.

772
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:02,163
How's it going that it ventilates?

773
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,825
llumínala and allow me to see
if I can remove it.

774
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,098
If I can... if I can
to remove him/her the cover,

775
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,608
do you believe to be able to enter there?

776
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,736
Me not...

777
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,016
Allow me to see.

778
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,122
We Go, Alissa.
Lower it, lower it.

779
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,320
I not even believe to be able to enter
here.

780
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,127
The door opens up. Care.

781
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,835
Descend.
Be maybe good sign.

782
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,051
Skies...

783
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,490
Oh, my God.

784
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:11,226
- What did it happen?
- Did Greyson make you this, not?

785
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:18,331
They should... to leave...
of... the... island.

786
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,643
- It is dead.
- Carajo.

787
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,012
Shit.

788
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,812
What carajo will we make now?

789
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,649
We have to get a he/she arms.

790
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,120
The exam room.

791
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,186
Very well.

792
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,308
Not look, don't look, don't look.

793
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,285
Carajo, carajo.

794
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:18,329
Oh, not. That... it is of Kurt.

795
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,334
We go, we have to leave
of here.

796
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,405
We go. We go.

797
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,332
Not I will let him to happen you anything.

798
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,173
I promise it. Now we go.

799
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,500
He/she left.

800
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,069
Oh, my God.

801
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,775
What does it happen here, doctor?

802
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,614
I Know Kurt. Not it would rot
to have made something like that of horrible.

803
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,177
When I saw Kurt this morning,
it was very strange.

804
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,519
Definitively it happened him/her something.

805
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,582
Good, they maybe also murdered it.

806
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,684
That we found it
in Andrew's hand

807
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,787
it doesn't mean that it has killed him.

808
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,831
With the... that illness
that it affected to the nation chappa,

809
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,838
you said that it caused insanity
in many cases, correct?

810
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,431
Michael, that was behind 200 years...

811
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,000
He/she looks, it follows my idea,
only follow it...

812
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,707
The guard Greyson intersected the hand
in the remains otaktay.

813
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:44,116
When I saw the wound, there was a small one
infection in the tip of their finger.

814
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,019
However, today the hand
it was swollen and colorless,

815
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,887
- only one day later.
- And what?

816
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,620
That thing could have been loaded
of germs and bacterias

817
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:54,286
and it takes hundred of years there...

818
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:57,526
I know it, but seemingly,
according to the... floor analysis...

819
01:13:57,599 --> 01:14:00,568
of Tiffany, the bicarbonate of sodium
it would have avoided it.

820
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,536
However, it would not have killed
to the virus.

821
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,708
Then he/she believes that the guard
was it infected by a virus?

822
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:13,975
I don't know it, I don't know it.

823
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,914
Not I know.

824
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,581
But if this way outside, it could be had him
transmitted to the other ones, not?

825
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,523
For example, there was vomit
in the cell of Kurt this morning.

826
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,321
And he was really sick.

827
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,123
My God.

828
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,022
Tiffany neither was seen
very well.

829
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,728
How does he/she know that he/she is spreading?

830
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,532
I don't know it.

831
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:42,668
The infection can pass of payee
to payee in quantity in ways.

832
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,678
Oh, God.

833
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,272
Below, below.

834
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,423
He/she already comes, he/she already comes.
We go, we go, we go.

835
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,365
Where do they believe that they go?

836
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,536
They are in a prison.

837
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,115
Now what?

838
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:36,254
Carajo.

839
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,196
Please, only...
loose it, old.

840
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,167
Loose it. The cut
in your finger...

841
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,964
you infected yourself with a virus.

842
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,871
- You are sick.
- In fact, doctor...

843
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,205
I feel extraordinary.

844
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,080
No, prostitute's son.

845
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,124
Coarse.

846
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,654
It is dead.

847
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,525
It is dead, it already happened.

848
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,060
It already happened.

849
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,730
We need linen.

850
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,297
Alissa, looks.
He/she walks, let us be sensitive.

851
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,036
I have an open wound

852
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,135
with their vomit and blood above.

853
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,146
I have to make it, Alissa.

854
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:09,081
Have not maybe penetrated
their sanguine torrent...

855
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,314
He/she looks, I don't know what I could spend,

856
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,877
but yes I know...

857
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:17,083
that he/she could never make you I damage,
so, please, he/she gives turn the face.

858
01:18:17,159 --> 01:18:19,218
- Please... it separates the head.
- No, Michael.

859
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,026
I am here, it is well.

860
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:53,823
What did it happen?

861
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,920
It is already safe.

862
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,555
How do we arrive here?

863
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:00,931
A ship patrols it arrived
the following morning.

864
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,197
It lost a lot of blood.

865
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,633
Am I?

866
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,336
If it is what a?

867
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,709
Infectado?

868
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,010
No, Dr. Hauser, You. he/she made the correct thing.

869
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,674
And seemingly fair on time.

870
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,742
However, he/she will have a scar
very ugly there.

871
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,650
I Am Dr. Olan Stanovitch

872
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,780
with the Center for the Control
of Illnesses.

873
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:25,190
Both are lucky
of being alive.

874
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,524
The virus with which they entered
in contact,

875
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,326
as well they surmised,
it affects the brain,

876
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,956
in particular the system límbico

877
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,523
and the hipotálamo.

878
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,162
We take years studying
a stump mutada,

879
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,900
documenting their effect
in laboratory animals.

880
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,841
- It caused insanity.
- Basically.

881
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,639
Essentially...

882
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,545
it eliminates the social behavior
learned in the fellow.

883
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,674
In that moment, there are two results...

884
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,184
or an event complete sicótico,

885
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:55,121
or a regression to our instinct
more primitive...

886
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,181
to kill.

887
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,157
We know that the bud
he/she originated in this area.

888
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,426
For that reason we alert to the authorities
when we find out.

889
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,662
CDC has requested

890
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:11,399
that both maintain this matter
strictly confidential.

891
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:14,940
We appreciate their cooperation.

892
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,011
Somebody more he/she survived?

893
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,071
There is a person that continues
missing,

894
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,549
a certain Kurt... Polsky.

895
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,515
If it is in the island, we will find it.

896
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,352
The currents would take it to him
if it was about swiming of return.

897
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,121
Srta. Deerhorn, good day.

898
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:36,892
Doctor, I wish him/her
a prompt recovery.

899
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:40,867
What will it happen with the indigenous remains?

900
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,435
Now they are the government's property
American.

901
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,642
Thank you, doctor.
Good day.

902
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,478
Alissa, what does it happen?

903
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,487
I fear that we have loosened
a terrible one bad in the world.

904
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,149
You already heard the doctor.
The virus has been contained.

905
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,318
- He/she finished.
- No.

906
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,326
The science can only explain
a part.

907
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,557
Science?

908
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,759
We Go, Alissa.
Not there is curse.

909
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,860
Michael, the wrong can take
many forms.

910
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,540
This virus is only
one of their manifestations.

911
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,643
And now it is another time I loose.
