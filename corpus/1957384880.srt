I also have totem aquatic creatures everywhere.

178
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,572
This kitchen is basically designed to be

179
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:18,177
under the sea and in outer space at the same time. The two darkest places.

180
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,381
It's pretty fun basically to just look at someone and say,

181
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,052
"hey, do you like golden showers?"

182
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,620
And then, bam!

183
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,589
I've got a golden shower.

184
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,628
It's not real gold, but it's spray paint.

185
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:40,366
If you were him, how do you think you would sound?

186
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,768
Can you pretend you're him for a second

187
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,839
and just vocalize what he would sound like?

188
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,576
Hmmm.

189
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,145
Hmm, hm hm.

190
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,246
And how does that feel?

191
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,751
Does that feel good?

192
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:03,956
Wouldn't you rather be like, "hey, i'm a singer.

193
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,992
I'm cool."

194
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,762
Don't you think maybe he's not really happy

195
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:14,467
trapped beneath this tons of armor?

196
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,071
Are we gonna sing today?

197
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,640
Okay, well you know what, i think maybe he's confusing

198
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,943
so we're going to put him to sleep for a little bit

199
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:28,013
and I will come back to him.

200
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,816
Well the reason i had him out here

201
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,019
was because I think you are just like him.

202
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,456
I just think that life can be so much simpler.

203
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,091
You know, with a guitar and music.

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,595
Why does it have to be like goin' to a therapist?

205
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,531
I feel like i'm goin' to a therapist.

206
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,199
Huh?

207
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,936
You're right. No, I know. I know, no...

208
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,439

Make sure i'm camera ready. Okay?

214
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,963
So I think for any major diva such as myself,

215
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,533
they really rely on their gay community

216
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,702
as their main support system.

217
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,540
Because I don't really have much of a family.

218
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,677
Anyway, Sebastian has introduced me to

219
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,513
some of his friends who happen to be gay,

220
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,849
and amazing fans.

221
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,019
They just shower me with praise.

Woo!

239
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,991
I'm going to be singing in this singing competition.

240
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:56,328
Hopefully I win. If you win, you get a thousand bucks, and um,

241
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,965
split in two, that could get me to New York City.

242
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,002
- You and me and our love ness

243
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,670
- and our hate and our hate!

244
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,142
- And the darkness of our soul, the darkness of our world! - World!

245
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,845
This year i'm performing with my new girlfriend.

246
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,080
So our piece is called die motherfucker die.

247
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,684
It's about existential annihilation.

248
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,252
Which is nothing.

249
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,920
Which is everything.

250
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,957
My girlfriend, she really gets me.

251
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,027
It all started with random household objects

252
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,129
that you can find in your house.

253
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:34,166
There's nothing in this spoon, just like in this piece.

254
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,802
And in the world.

255
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,971
Except when she doesn't.

256
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,374
Which is most of the time.

257
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,009
Die motherfucker, die! Die motherfucker, die!

258
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:49,982
Die motherfucker, die! [Continues]

259
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,518
But what if those things that are so necessary

260
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,554
- would actually kill you? - Yeah, just like this.

261
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,957
- All the motherfuckers that take like these sharp teeth.

262
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,027
Their forks, and their spoons, and their knives,

263
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,865
and eat, and consume, to their own death.

264
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,735
Like this guy, he just eats.

265
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,571
It's been so long.

266
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,574
I think it's been a couple of years, right Jim?

267
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,975
A couple of years he's been gone.

268
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,045
- Uh huh. - Oh boy.

269
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,547
What I just can't believe

270
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,483
is that we get to be in the contest together.

271
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,984
This will be like old times.

272
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,587
I've got it all worked out. He doesn't know, but

273
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,491
I made him a costume and it's kind of a little furry.

274
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,992
It's going to be a Doe or a deer,

275
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,361
and i'm going to be a nymph.

276
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,929
We're going to have a whole woodland scene,

277
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,997
and we're going to belt out songs!

278
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,401
- To feel, to feel, to feel... To feeeel!

279
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,537
- To bind. - To hurt, to bind, to feel, to stick.

280
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,375
Anything that is so cyclical represents the earth

281
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:54,179
and represents our rotation and our correlation with the universe.

282
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:58,517
If there's anything that's the core of existential annihilation, it's that.

283
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,787
It's true and if you put tape on your skin and lift it up,

284
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,188
all these weird skin flecks come off,

285
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,957
and it looks just like the universe.

286
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,726
Oh die motherfucker, die. Oh die motherfucker, die.

287
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,928
I mean all in all, as you can tell--

288
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,931
- it's a whole universe of skin. - All of these objects coming together,

289
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,301
- being unified-- - it doesn't really mean anything, though, really.

290
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,936
It means everything.

291
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,739
- But it was, you know-- this was pretty much my idea.

292
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,742
Pretty much all my idea.

293
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,210
Do you feel stuff weighing you down,

294
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,980
keeping you from really just...

295
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,285
'cause i'd really like to sing for the competition.

296
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,221
It's a thousand dollars if you win the grand prize.

297
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,092
Totally. and this is what I think.

298
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,662
Do you have some unresolved guilt?

299
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,097
I don't know what you mean.

300
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,635
Have you ever done something that

301
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,471
maybe you don't feel great about now, looking back,

302
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:58,343
and it's kind of disturbing your universe.

303
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,817
I had a pet cow named bessie once.

304
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:10,923
And she was my Bess-friend.

305
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:16,528
And I sold her to this farmer and I tried to buy her back

306
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:22,134
when I had enough money, but before I could he...

307
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,670
He took her to the slaughter house.

308
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,971
That explains it.

309
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,339
Bessie is angry with you.

310
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,142
She is? Yes, wouldn't you be?

311
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,611
But I didn't mean for it to happen.

312
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,480
It doesn't matter, she's gone.

313
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,983
She's been demolished. And it's your fault.

314
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,818
You have to apologize to bessie.

315
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,654
- I do? - And now, yes now!

316
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,989
Right now.

317
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,357
Do you think she can hear me?

318
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,860
You need to really sense she's here with us.

319
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:53,198
You need to see her eyes. They're staring at you, and they're sad.

320
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,167
And they can't believe that you betrayed her.

321
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,237
So I really need you to connect with her eyes,

322
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,539
and see her beautiful face.

323
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:04,243
And see her getting carted to the slaughter house because of you.

324
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,513
And I really want you to apologize, and you have to mean it!

325
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,581
Bessie, i'm sorry!

326
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,183
Say it again!

327
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,751
Bessie, i'm sorry!

328
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,255
But I really, really want you to see her this time.

329
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,190
Stop pretending, because you killed her.

330
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,592
- I'm sorry bessie! - You're a cow murderer!

331
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,662
- Louder! louder! - I'm sorry bessie. I just want to sing!

332
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,866
I'm sorry you ended up as hamburger and steak, just let me sing!

333
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,869
Just let me sing!

334
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,205
- Okay. - bessie, i'm sorry.

335
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,009
You think she... you think she heard me?

336
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:41,346
And she believes you, and she forgives you.

337
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,217
And she wants you to win. Okay?

338
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,187
- I'm going to win for her. - Okay. Very good.

339
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,090
Oh, Katrina's great. I love Katrina.

340
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,060
I have her picture next to my bed

341
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,029
and I see her every morning when I wake up,

342
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,131
and when I go to sleep.

343
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,068
You know, I work for her but she's become like my inspiration.

344
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:08,807
She's so talented and

345
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,309
she has so many gifts, you know.

346
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,146
And I kind of want to emulate them sometimes.

347
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,882
Some people think that i just do this for the fame

348
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,251
and the acclaim, and the perks.

349
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,752
But that's just not true.

350
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,121
What I really do it for is the look that I get

351
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,292
when I see poor baby orphans, and I tell them

352
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:31,496
"one day, you too can change the world with singing."

353
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,134
So I pulled this chest out, because I want to show you a little secret I have.

354
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,605
She doesn't know so don't say anything,

355
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,475
but I collect some of her personal items

356
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,278
that i'm going to sell on ebay one of these days

357
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,280
when she makes it big.

358
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,315
And i'm going to make a fortune.

359
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,850
This is a water bottle

360
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,920
that she used last year at the singing competition.

361
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,288
It actually has her saliva on it.

362
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,124
It's going to be worth a pretty penny.

363
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,327
And she writes me these cute little notes

364
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,130
love you, xo cute little notes.

365
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,800
And those should be worth something.

366
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:14,506
And this razor, used razor by Katrina Whitman,

367
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,343
has probably been places that most haven't.

368
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:23,015
And this water bottle, I like to spritz her down

369
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:29,221
when she's all sweating and schvitzing all over the place during her workouts.

370
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:34,159
And oh, a butt plug.

371
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,894
Oh my goodness.

372
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,196
- Danny? - hi, mom, dad.

373
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,166
- Danny. - it's darque now.

374
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,670
- Dark? - darque, with a q. This is ness.

375
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,340
We're darqueness.

376
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,310
- Ness? i'm Jim. - My mother I wore this blue.

377
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,147
My mother gave this to us. I wore this at our wedding.

378
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,848
He's a glam leopard.

379
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,250
It's mine now.

380
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,053
She gave it to me before she passed away.

381
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:05,424
Scarves are often associated with sexual asphyxiation.

382
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,859
- This is true. - I always wanted him

383
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,027
to be a girl for a little while

384
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,862
because we would have so much in common.

385
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,364
I know, I know, remember?

386
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,899
- We did the - marcia...

387
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,369
Okay, all right enough. Let's get on to dinner, honey.

388
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,271
- Please. - i'm starving. Let's just do this.

389
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,706
We've been fasting all day.

390
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,375
We have the cow we slaughtered out in back!

391
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,444
- Ha ha! - Is she joking?

392
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,612
- I don't know. - No, no

393
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,723
pretty good soup, marcia.

394
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,257
Oh thank you.

395
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,728
It's a nice squash.

396
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,563
Try it.

397
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,398
Try it!

398
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,799
Oops.

399
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,970
Oh, honey, please use a napkin.

400
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,705
Go use a napkin, please!

401
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,474
Napkins are bad for the environment.

402
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,109
They usually just wear a bib.

403
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,378
What, they don't wear shirts in Ohio?

404
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,581
Shirts don't have quite enough ventilation.

405
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,955
So are you excited for the competition?

406
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,891
Sure, yeah. Me and ness have

407
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,560
come up with something kind of shocking and creative.

408
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,563
- It's a... But you're performing with me.

409
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,099
Why would you think that?

410
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,270
Because for eight or nine years that's what we did, and what we do.

411
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,672
We don't believe in linear time.

412
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:32,277
Besides that, i'm a little too old to be singing about

413
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,745
puff the magic dragon now, mom.

414
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,114
That is about the hardships of growing older.

415
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,452
It's very profound, and we've always done such a great job.

416
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:44,456
Mom, everyone knows that song is about puffin' on a reefer.

417
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,092
- Smokin' pot. - Toking a reefer,

418
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,961
- puffing and seeing the magic dragon. - Gettin' high!

419
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,530
That's not true, Dan.

420
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:55,200
It's about a young boy growing up, becoming a man.

421
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,803
They're projecting.

422
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,138
Katrina, my darling. You know how much I love you

423
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,041
and how much i'm rooting for you to win

424
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,778
penskeegee's singing competition for the fifth time.

425
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,712
You're going to do it.

426
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,881
So get ready, i made you this DVD.

427
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,716
We're going to work it out, we're going to get ready,

428
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,152
we're going to start with some physical workouts,

429
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,987
so start workin' it.

430
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,991
Lift those thighs; Lift those beautiful, luscious thighs.

431
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,393
Work it, work it. All right,

432
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:25,630
let's warm up the voice laaa!

433
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,632
That's right keep singing, girl.

434
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,067
Sing it from your lady business.

435
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,803
Sing it from your lady business!

436
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,306
Sing it from your lady business, sing it from your lady business,

437
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,409
you got it, you got it, you got it!

438
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,511
First off we're going to have the tractor.

439
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,248
And that goes on your root chakra.

440
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,585
Let's say you ever get a block about your lust or sexuality,

441
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,487
all that good stuff, i would encourage you

442
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,489
to do the tractor sounds.

443
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,191
Because that helps you release that.

444
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,426
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

445
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,428
So if you see someone attractive,

446
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,396
you can always try to give that a try.

447
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,534
And the dog goes on your sacral chakra.

448
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,872
And the dog represents connection and loyalty.

449
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:11,543
And whenever you really like someone,

450
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,845
we have you "woof!" We do the "woof!"

451
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:18,516
And it brings you bonding closer to that other thing.

452
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,752
Now the sheep is a great one,

453
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,555
because the sheep goes on your solar plexus.

454
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:28,226
So together we can work on your fear and anxiety.

455
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,530
Should you go to a party and feel a little wallflower-ish, just go "baaaaaaaaa!"

456
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,099
I'm sure it's going to draw you out,

457
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,067
and indeed it'll attract other people to you,

458
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,536
if only to ask what's wrong.

459
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,909
The next one then would be of course the cow, okay.

460
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,645
So bessie would go straight to your heart,

461
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,647
no explanation needed, okay.

462
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,582
So always celebrate your love for bessie.

463
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,251
Now the rooster is very important for you,

464
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:57,822
'cause I noticed sometimes you get stuck there in the singing arena.

465
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,724
It goes right on your throat chakra,

466
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:04,796
and it represents all the expression and communication.

467
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,332
And when you feel stuck, charlene,

468
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,002
I strongly encourage you to and this is going to be an advanced,

469
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,939
I don't expect you to know it now, but cocka-doodle-doo!

470
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,943
It sounds crazy, I know, I know. That's exactly what I told her!

471
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,246
Cocka-doodle-doo! cocka-doodle-doo! cocka-doodle-doo!

472
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,814
I really wish you were there,

473
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,582
because I could have told her that

474
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,452
and I said, "Beth and I both think

475
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,754
that this is weird. This is weird."

476
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,157
Perhaps you can wear a shirt at dinner,

477
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,592
- little monkey son. - No!

478
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,595
Shirts are patriarchal! Everybody hates shirts.

479
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,632
Even... even... all the Republicans wear shirts!

480
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,636
But shirts have been around for centuries.

481
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,274
Everybody loves shirts, even tiny chihuahuas wear shirts.

482
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,875
- Oh, little monkey son. - No!

483
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,777
- Shirts are ugly! - What about me?

484
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,113
We'll sing our beautiful puff the magic dragon song.

485
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,383
No! puff the magic dragon is about smoking pot and doing crack!

486
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,519
No, it's about the hardships of life.

487
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,688
Childhood is so beautiful and light.

488
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,659
You don't worry about paying taxes or being audited.

489
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,962
Now of course, the horse, okay.

490
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,999
I know about your great relationship to your horse.

491
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:19,804
And because of that, as you know that will go into your third eye.

492
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:24,009
There you go. Okay, so it's going to keep you in balance,

493
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,178
it's going to guide you through all your tough times.

494
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,649
And the final chakra - the crown and is represented by you

495
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,486
and your highest self, represented by the cowboy.

496
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,820
And the hat is really cute.

497
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,323
So when you are all aligned,

498
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,725
when everything is coming together,

499
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:45,497
you are radiating the cowboy in all its glory.

500
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,332
And that's something to be proud of.

501
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:52,070
And see now you're all in alignment and it's gorgeous.

502
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,372
So just, you know, radiate.

503
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:59,210
♪ The glowing lights they ravish me ♪

504
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:04,716
♪ making love to all that god has sent my way ♪

505
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:09,454
♪ it's my moment

506
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:15,226
♪ i'm right where I belong

507
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,763
♪ i'm living my dream

508
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:24,202
♪ where I know nothing can go wrong ♪

509
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,572
I think you should start working on the performance

510
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,707
and how you're going to make people feel

511
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,044
- what you're saying, you know? - Yeah, yes, yes.

512
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,715
Okay, so as far as the entrance is concerned,

513
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:41,619
is there any way to be lifted down from the rafters.

514
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,754
I mean, I could make a call.

515
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,456
Can you make a call and see?

516
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,726
La la la laaaaa la laaaaaaa.

517
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,297
Unicorns and glitter ponies.

518
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,168
Unicorns, glitter ponies, shiny glitter ponies, yeah.

519
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,670
Wait ness, ness.

520
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,973
What the fuck was that?

521
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,942
- Unicorns and glitter ponies what the--

522
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,412
hold on. Okay, I don't think that language is appropriate.

523
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,347
What language?

524
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,582
F.

525
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,317
F - fuck?

526
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,452
Shhh. your mom, okay?

527
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,288
Listen, i'm having some shifts.

528
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,325
I'm feeling a little differently about this piece.

529
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,860
This piece needs some contrast.

530
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,462
We need something besides like death and darkness.

531
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,498
- There needs to be the light side. - Some of the light side?

532
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,666
Well we have like the dark side and then

533
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,435
and the ness side, we're darqueness.

534
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,137
I know, but I think in order

535
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,439
for the meaning and the depth of it to happen,

536
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,840
we need some of the light.

537
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,210
- Since last night - we have a white blender.

538
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,480
Since last night and the puff the magic dragon,

539
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,783
I feel like we need some magic.

540
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,117
- What are you talking about? - Magic.

541
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,652
What the fuck are you talking about?

542
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,487
Okay, shhh. No f word.

543
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,991
- The word magic the only dirty f word I know is feelings.

544
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,828
- What is wrong with - feelings are amazing and so is magic.

545
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,464
- Magic puff, puff the magic dragon oh.

546
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,833
Do you just need to get a little stoned before we finish this?

547
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,569
- I've got pot in my bag. - I'm not going to smoke p.

548
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,638
Use the word p, okay? I don't want your parents to know

549
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,875
- that you even use d-r-u-g-s, okay? - Can we say marijuana?

550
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,644
- Is that wrong? - M. Okay?

551
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,180
Your mother and father deserve more.

552
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,815
Your mom is special. She's amazing

553
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,083
you didn't tell me how amazing your mom is.

554
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,818
You don't know anything about my mother.

555
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,187
She is incredible. Maybe I do. Maybe we shared

556
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,355
some moments, not just last night.

557
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,924
What moments did you share last night? What are you talking about?

558
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,992
We had some tea. Some herbal tea.

559
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,228
Does t stand for something, or is that actually a drink.

560
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,197
It stands for love.

561
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,365
Maybe your mom and i love each other.

562
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,034
- Maybe your mom loves me like a daughter. - My mom doesn't love you.

563
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,569
- She doesn't even know you. - She does know me.

564
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,870
My mom barely loves herself.

565
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,104
Your mom and I have

566
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,841
been together somewhere in another life.

567
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,043
We might have been lovers.

568
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,411
Maybe your mom and i were lovers;

569
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,845
I don't know maybe we were sisters,

570
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,048
maybe we were conjoined twins,

571
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,950
maybe we were conjoined twin lovers.

572
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,954
Bessie will free you, but you have to ask her to be free.

573
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:02,594
So ask her.

574
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,230
Bessie, will you free me?

575
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,398
No, no. In her language.

576
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,035
Her language.

577
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,937
Okay.

578
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,807
Moooooo!

579
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,308
Moooooo! come on, charlene.

580
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:21,946
We have to ask in her language. Mooooo!

581
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,815
- Moo. - mooooooo!

582
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,617
- Moo. - moooooo!

583
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,752
- Moo. - mooooo!

584
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,621
Put some more into it.

585
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,256
- Moo. - come on, she has to feel you.

586
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,459
Moooooo!

587
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,261
- Moo! - charlene!

588
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,795
Moooooo!

589
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,297
Can you feel bessie?

590
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,599
[Both] moooooo!

591
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,668
- So the second chorus. - Yes.

592
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,937
It needs to be stronger, you know.

593
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,939
- Mmhm. - 'cause you're building.

594
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,574
You know, it's like sex. Music is like sex.

595
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,611
- A long time, but i'm familiar. - You start out, it's foreplay.

596
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,613
It's gentle, it's caressing.

597
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,083
And then as you go, it builds, and it builds, and it builds.

598
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,654
And we're coming up to like of the way through,

599
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,523
and we want to start to climax.

600
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,824
Okay.

601
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,260
I know you know what i'm talking about.

602
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,095
I'm familiar.

603
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,632
Okay, so we're starting the climax here.

604
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,701
I normally fake it around that time.

605
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,670
I'm just kidding.

606
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,804
I'm a stupid bitch.

607
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:24,275

00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,864
I don't need you anyway.

625
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,901

Yeah, i'm not using you as a crutch.

631
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,386
I'm using you as support.

632
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,388
Because everybody knows, rehearsal

633
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,723
is miniscule compared to the actual performance

634
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,625
where the artist comes out.

635
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,129
- Yes, but you have to rehearse the way yeah, but it's my moment!

636
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,697
Of course, it's always your moment.

- oh, okay. - Do you want money or do you want a bottle?

658
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,451
I'll take the bottle.

659
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,286
- You want the bottle? - Well I don't like change.

660
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,521
Do you think that'll be a good reflection of yourself

661
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,789
unto your neighbors and stuff?

662
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,091
The money would be fine.

663
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,492
I think money is more for you.

664
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,960
I'll take the bottle.

665
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,129
- It's like a savings account. - Yeah, exactly.

666
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,965
But don't be so literal, you know.

667
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,634
My last partner, we won't mention her by name,

668
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,037
but my last partner used to take things too literally.

669
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,839
And these are all symbols.

670
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:08,840
Symbols for other things.

671
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,675
So this could be a sofa.

672
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,511
I'm thinking something that's not an object.

673
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,712
Like an emotion.

674
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,980
Oh!

00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,317

I don't believe in competitions.

692

Sweetie, you know i cannot have rinds.
