00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,300
( Woman )
No!

2
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,533
No!

3
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,400
Help me!

4
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,000
Help!

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,833
No, no, no, no!

6
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,233
No, no!

7
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:46,033
No!

8
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,867
What do you think you're doing?

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:56,500
No!

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,767
Help me!

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,367
Please, please!

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,233
( Screaming )

13
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,700
Oh!

14
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,000
It's after checkout time!

15
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,267
I want my money!

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
Mistress, the innkeeper!

17
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,133
He wants to be paid.

18
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,300
Honey, when I spend the
night in a man's room,

19
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,400
he better pay me.

20
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,867
I want my money!

21
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,167
Zou Zou, just go back
to sleep, would ya?

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
What's he gonna do, kill us?

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,333
Here's Johan!

24
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,567
( Screaming )

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,533
( Johan )
Give me the money!

26
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,900
Now!

27
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,100
I want my money!

28
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,433
Give me the money!

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,400
( Zou Zou grunting )

30
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,733
Oops.

31
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:02,867
( Johan )
Now I got you!

32
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,167
Come back here!

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,633
Pay me the money!

34
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,333
Hey!

35
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,600
Oh!

36
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,100
Hurry, Mistress!

37
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,367
Get up!

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,300
Go on, go on!

39
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm coming down for you, eh?

40
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,033
I want my money!

41
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,900
Ooh!

42
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,833
( Wolves howling )

43
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,567
You getting tired, Zou Zou?

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,167
No, Mistress.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, I am.

46
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:40,800
Pull over.

47
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:51,267
Zou Zou, I thought I told
you to pay that inn creep.

48
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,867
With what, Mistress, my good looks?

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Well, you got a point
there, girlfriend.

50
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,733
But, I mean, couldn't
you have done something

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,100
to pay for our room?

52
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,000
You know, wash dishes, dug ditches?

53
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,633
Oui, Mistress, you are right.

54
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,133
I mean, Zou Zou, you should
be grateful to do any labor,

55
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,000
no matter how menial,
because I can't.

56
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:13,033
I am a professional entertainer,

57
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,933
and I have to save every
ounce of my strength

58
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,767
for my audience.

59
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,667
Any more of that
blood sausage left?

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,367
Hmm.

61
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,267
This sausage is good.

62
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Too bad you're on a diet.
I am?

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
But wait... Oh, oh!

64
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,500
Ooh!

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,600
Uh, did you call a cab?

66
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,967
Uh, hold on there, baldy.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,367
Hold it just a minute.

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,567
I... I... I...

69
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,867
You forgot my makeup case.

70
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,667
Oh.

71
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,500
Hello.

72
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,867
May I offer you ladies a ride?

73
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,833
Well... Oui, oui,
we'd love a ride.

74
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,800
It depends.

75
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,967
Where ya headed, sailor?

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,133
I'm traveling north
to visit a client.

77
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,600
Perhaps I could offer
you and your servant

78
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,167
a nice lodging.

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,520
That is, of course, unless
you've made other arrangements.

80
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,700
Well... Oh, sir, arrangements?

81
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,700
No, no, we do not have...
Oof!

82
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,333
Well, then, shall we go?

83
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,800
Please.

84
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:21,133
My name is Dr. Bradley...
Dr. Bradley Bradley.

85
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,533
Oh.

86
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,527
Your mother must have
thought you looked so nice,

87
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:26,220
she named you twice.

88
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,800
Elvira's the name,
showbiz the game.

89
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,867
Oh.

90
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,767
I'm just in the process of
fulfilling my lifelong dream

91
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,167
of opening in a world-renowned
Parisian revue.

92
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I know.

93
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,933
You do? But of course.

94
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,633
Your reputation precedes you.

95
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,933
Oh, damn, I hate when that happens.

96
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,233
I don't owe you any money, do I?

97
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,800
Good Lord, no.

98
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,100
I found your play
billin the village.

99
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh... Yes, of course.

100
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:05,867
And I must say, it's quite
a titillating image.

101
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, it is quite a good
likeness, isn't it?

102
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,633
Quite.

103
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,233
Oh!

104
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,233
So, what kind of medicine
man are you, man?

105
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,500
I am a psychiatrist.

106
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,800
Oh, great!

107
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,833
'Cause my feet are killing me.

108
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,267
Charming.

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,500
I say...

110
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:51,000
Perhaps we could arrange
for a private performance.

111
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,300
Oh!

112
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,867
Lucky for you, I come
equipped with my own airbags.

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,633
I beg your pardon?

114
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,500
I'm so looking forward
to the next bump.

115
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:15,167
Uh... Thanks for the...
lift, Doc,

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,467
but I really gotta
get going, you know.

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,767
Nobody told me this was gonna
be Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

118
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,733
( Horses neighing )

119
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:26,200
Oh, oh!

120
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:29,533
Oh, oh, oh!

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,800
Oh, my God!

122
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,833
Help!

123
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,267
Oh, oh!

124
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,567
Ooh, ah!

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,167
Oh, ow, ooh, ah!

126
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:52,500
I say, coachman, are you
making out all right up there?

127
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,000
Coachman!

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,267
Welcome to Castle Hellsubus.

129
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,633
Cheery.

130
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,100
( Screaming )

131
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,267
Lady Hellsubus...

132
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,933
Allow me to present Elvira.

133
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,567
Charmed.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,633
I think.

135
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,900
Please, forgive me, Madam.

136
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,567
It's just that you...
You...

137
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,933
You... Me, me, what?

138
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,800
You look pretty.

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,133
Please, come in.

140
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,900
Oof!

141
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,433
The lady and her servant
will be spending the night.

142
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,833
Very well.

143
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:45,333
I'll have the maid
prepare the rooms.

144
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,733
I trust that your
stay here will be...

145
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:51,267
comfortable, madam.

146
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,833
Your cloak, ma'am.

147
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,167
Your gloves, ma'am.

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,500
Your shoes, ma'am.

149
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,867
Hold it right there.

150
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,967
I mean, I usually get paid
for this sort of thing.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,840
You know, when I take
a... If you please, ma'am.

152
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,267
I am afraid it is imperative.

153
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,433
You see, my husband,

154
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:26,667
he suffers from an acute
affliction of the hearing.

155
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,733
Sounds that seem
commonplace to you or to I

156
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:35,667
cut into his head like knives!

157
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,733
Are you sure it's not just
some kind of kinky foot thing?

158
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,667
The shoes, if you please.

159
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,833
Ooh!

160
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,500
( Cat screeching )

161
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,900
Zou Zou? Oh!

162
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,733
Would you help me?

163
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,533
Oh!

164
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:11,400
( Gong ringing )

165
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:14,533
Lady Hellsubus, would you
mind informing Lord Hellsubus

166
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,133
that he has a guest?

167
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,833
Something tells me he's
already figured that out.

168
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,467
Ooh, a piano bar!

169
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,767
( Playing upbeat song )

170
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,767
Stop!

171
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
No more, please!

172
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,800
Oh, jeez, everybody's a critic.

173
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,433
( Thundering )

174
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,967
Elvira, allow me to present
Lord Vladimere Hellsubus.

175
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,733
Enchanté.

176
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:25,700
Ow!

177
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,200
Hey, we haven't even met yet!

178
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,500
Oh, sorry.

179
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,833
Hey, nice jacket.

180
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,167
Who shot the stove?

181
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,067
( Rim shot )
( laughing )

182
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,767
Elvira is soon to be
one of Gay Paree's

183
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,500
foremost entertainers.

184
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,933
Lots of straight guys like me, too.

185
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:46,067
( Echoing laughter )

186
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,333
Thank you, thank you, but
seriously, folks... No!

187
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,100
This cannot be.

188
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:57,600
No!

189
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Nice meeting you, too.

190
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,100
Who's the old dude in the dress?

191
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,933
Perhaps he has seen your act.

192
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:14,967
Oui.

193
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,967
( Door creaking )

194
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,033
( rumbling )

195
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,900
Oh!

196
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh, oh, oh!

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Don't be frightened, Elvira.

198
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,433
It's only the castle settling
down for the evening.

199
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,933
Come.

200
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,667
It's time for bed.

201
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,167
The village people say
this castle is evil.

202
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,833
Ehh, who listens to the
Village People anymore?

203
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,167
This castle and its
occupants are cursed.

204
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,867
It's the Hellsubus family blood.

205
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,733
It causes them to do strange
and unnatural things.

206
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,267
Sounds like fun.

207
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,400
Lucian Hellsubus.

208
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,400
Vladimere's
great-great-grandfather.

209
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,067
Sadist, murderer.

210
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,567
Thousands of innocent souls
died by his torturous hands

211
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,233
in the dungeon of this very castle.

212
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,967
Ew, nice hobby.

213
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,233
Captain Teodore Hellsubus.

214
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,333
Vladimere's grandfather.

215
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,267
Smuggler, slave trader,
pathological liar,

216
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,033
bad dancer, cross-dresser.

217
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,400
That's really weird.

218
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,400
Cross-dressers are
usually great dancers.

219
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,133
Careful.

220
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,433
The tremors seem to have
caused a bit of damage.

221
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,633
Yeah, duh.

222
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,500
Anybody ever heard of Spackle?

223
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,467
And last but not least,
the Lady Donya Hellsubus,

224
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Vladimere's mother.

225
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,533
Slut, harlot, seductress.

226
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,000
Just one man couldn't satisfy her.

227
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,067
I hear you, Grandma.

228
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,600
Right.

229
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,133
I'll show you to your room, then.

230
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,033
This was her room.

231
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,500
Her?

232
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,767
Her who?

233
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,767
Elura, Vladimere's first wife.

234
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,767
Nobody has set foot in
it since her passing.

235
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,467
Whew, pee-eww.

236
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,533
Pass of what is the question.

237
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,233
Could you light a
match or something?

238
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:10,000
Elura died exactly ten
years ago tomorrow.

239
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,367
( Coughing )

240
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,533
Dr. Bradley, I thought I
heard a voice and I...

241
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,867
Oh, what's her problem?

242
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,967
Don't mind her.

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
She does this sort of
thing quite frequently.

244
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,233
She's not well, as you can see.

245
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,467
Who is she?

246
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,233
This pitiful creature
is Roxana Hellsubus,

247
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,800
Lord Hellsubus' niece.

248
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,100
She too is afflicted with
the Hellsubus family curse,

249
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:16,800
which has ruined many a life,
including that of Elura.

250
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,100
Beautiful, unfortunate Elura.

251
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,133
I must say, the resemblance
between the two of you

252
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,267
is remarkable.

253
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,833
No wonder Vladimere was so shocked

254
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,467
at the very sight of you.

255
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,867
Oh, my God!

256
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,340
Not only that, but
we're both wearing

257
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,367
the exact same nail polish.

258
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,867
Really?

259
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,800
How remarkable.

260
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,233
Well, it's getting kind of late,

261
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,833
and I'm off to Paris
in the morning.

262
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,233
Must you leave so soon?

263
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:48,200
Dr. Bradley, opening
my show in Paris

264
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:51,400
means more to me than
anything in the world,

265
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:55,267
even playing "Hide the
Hot Dog" with you.

266
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,967
Well, then.

267
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,233
What about a quick nightcap?

268
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,300
No.

269
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,233
Brandy? Mm-mm.

270
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,367
Champagne? Mm-mm.

271
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,433
Sanka?

272
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,167
Lemonade with a twist?

273
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,733
Ooh!

274
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,133
Mistress, it's time for la douche.

275
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:14,867
Yes, quite right.

276
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,200
Well, I'll send my carriage
around in the morning.

277
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,700
Good night.

278
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,233
Oh, Dr. Bradley?

279
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,200
Yes?

280
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,167
Didn't you forget something?

281
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,967
Ah, yes.

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,467
Quite right.

283
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Good night.

284
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,533
Oh, and Doc?

285
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,967
I'll take a rain
checkon the physical.

286
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,333
Oh hi, Ema.

287
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,367
Thanks for spying on us.

288
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,933
Oh, this is so relaxing.

289
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,500
Oh, Zou Zou, turn on the
bubbles, would you?

290
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,767
More hot water, Zou Zou.

291
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
But, Mistress, I will have
Togo all the way down

292
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,033
to the kitchen!

293
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,300
Yeah?

294
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,493
And I have to sit here Ina
bathtub full of tepid water

295
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,967
until you get back.

296
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,767
Now scoot, scoot.

297
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,467
Oui.

298
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Sacrebleu.

299
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,900
Arr, ye dogs.

300
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,900
We have come for your booty.

301
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,233
Oh, no, please, please, Mr.
Big Bad Pirate,

302
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,900
please don't pillage my booty!

303
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,233
Zou Zou?

304
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,967
Zou Zou, is that you?

305
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,300
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

306
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,100
You wanna blow the
rating on this picture?

307
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,567
Hmm.

308
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Finders keepers.

309
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,800
Where have I seen
this thing before?

310
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,033
Oh.

311
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,333
Come on, you're
dripping with jewels.

312
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,033
You're not gonna miss one
little old ring, are you?

313
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:23,167
( Screaming )

314
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,567
Zou Zou, you scared the
caca-doodie out of me!

315
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,133
Shh!

316
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,933
( Screaming )

317
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,267
Haven't you ever heard of knocking?

318
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm so sorry.

319
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,600
I didn't mean to startle you.

320
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:01,467
I'm Lady Roxana.

321
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,800
Oh, and I'm Elvira.

322
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,100
Hey, what do you know?

323
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,267
The lady and the tramp!

324
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,967
( Coughing )

325
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,933
I think this is a
piece of your lung.

326
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,533
Ew.

327
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,000
Thank you.

328
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:30,033
I... I just came to apologize
for my ghastly behavior

329
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,433
earlier this evening.

330
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:36,467
I was just so shocked
by your appearance.

331
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,067
Yeah, well, most people are,

332
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,967
but they usually don't have
quite such a strong reaction.

333
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,567
For a moment, I thought that you

334
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,733
were my Aunt Elura,
risen from the grave!

335
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,267
Yeah, I seem to be getting
that a lot lately.

336
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,000
So, Roxana,

337
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,933
is it true that you
also have the curse?

338
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,300
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

339
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,867
Really?

340
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,933
And you still manage to
look so fresh all over.

341
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:09,133
Uncle Vladimere says there is no...

342
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:10,500
escape!

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,700
From the family curse.

344
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:16,800
Hey, cheer up.

345
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,367
I mean, maybe it's like hair loss

346
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,967
and it'll skip a generation.

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,067
No!

348
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,233
Uncle Vladimere says

349
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:26,600
I am destined to
remain within these

350
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,400
dark castle walls

351
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,533
for the rest of my short...

352
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:36,033
happy...

353
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
life.

354
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,600
"Uncle Vladimere says,
Uncle Vladimere says."

355
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,713
You know, girl, I don't wanna
go sticking my nose in

356
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,867
where it don't belong,

357
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,300
but if I were you, I would
just pack my little bags,

358
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,267
forget about what
Uncle Vladimere says,

359
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,900
and get the hell on out
of Castle Hellsubus.

360
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,100
Oh, if only I could.

361
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,133
Well, what's stopping
you... your legs painted on?

362
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,667
Where will I go, what would I do?

363
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,333
We leave for Paris in the morning,

364
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,433
you could come with us, no?

365
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,267
Uh, no, actually, where we're going

366
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,267
is kind of an adults-only
thing and...

367
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,867
No.

368
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,833
( Coughing )

369
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:17,433
Of course, I... I...
I understand.

370
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,367
( Hacking )

371
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,767
All right, all right,
you can go with us.

372
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,640
Just be sure to have your
stuff ready tonight,

373
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,673
'cause we're leaving first
thing in the morning.

374
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:30,633
Oh, thank you, Elvira,
you're wonderful!

375
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,000
Good night.

376
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,233
( All screaming )

377
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,367
What do you want?

378
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,000
I just came to see if
you needed anything

379
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,200
before you retire.

380
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:53,167
A cup of warm milk, perhaps?

381
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,633
You know, actually, a cup of
warm milk sounds kinda good.

382
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,933
Thanks.

383
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,300
Very well.

384
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,533
I'll have the maid milk the goat.

385
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:04,333
Um... You know, on
second thought,

386
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,200
just send up a bottle
of scotch and a straw.

387
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,100
( Clanking noises )

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,667
( snoring )

389
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,367
( screaming )

390
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,467
Oh, what... Mistress, it's me!

391
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,733
Zou Zou, what the
hell are you doing?

392
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,633
Listen!

393
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,100
I'm scared!

394
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,600
Zou Zou, that's just the
grinding and clanking noise

395
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:49,600
that, you know, instruments
of torture make.

396
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,433
( Whimpering )

397
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,367
All right, all right, I'll
throw on something skimpy

398
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,067
and head down to the dungeon.

399
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,533
Let's see.

400
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,667
Now where's the secret door?

401
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,233
They always have one of those.

402
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,100
( Grunting )

403
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh!

404
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,700
( Rat squeaking )

405
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,533
Oh, hello.

406
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,967
( Footsteps approaching )

407
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,067
Is somebody in there?

408
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,700
Hello?

409
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,100
Roxana, is that you?

410
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,233
Oh, I just saw the light on in here

411
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:12,333
and I was wondering what
you were doing down here.

412
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,007
You know, I wanted to
talk to you about...

413
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,267
( squeaking )

414
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,067
Uh, careful, that thing
might go off in your hand.

415
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,600
Oh, you startled me.

416
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,367
If you're looking for
something to steal,

417
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
there's really not much here.

418
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,300
I already checked.

419
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,567
Oh, sorry.

420
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,633
Lord Hellsubus' pistol
needed cleaning.

421
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,833
Allow me to introduce
myself, madam.

422
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,300
How does he do that?

423
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,833
Weird.

424
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,567
I am Adrian, the stable master.

425
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,100
I often come here secretly.

426
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:50,467
Books are my greatest
pleasure and as you can see,

427
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,233
the master has a
magnificent collection.

428
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,967
Of what?

429
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,767
Books.

430
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,267
Oh, books.

431
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,600
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

432
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,300
I'm constantly trying
to better myself.

433
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,800
It's working.

434
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,267
And who, may I ask, are you?

435
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,467
Oh, me?

436
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,800
I'm just Elvira.

437
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,933
You know, house guest, bon vivant,

438
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,700
entertainer extraordinaire.

439
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,433
I'm just here for the night.

440
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:27,100
But then, a lot can
happen in a night.

441
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,300
Woo, Lord have mercy.

442
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,400
It is warm in here, isn't it?

443
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:36,567
( Gasping )

444
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
Your gown! Ow, ow, ow!

445
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,267
Are you all right?

446
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,400
Is the fire out?

447
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:47,733
Honey, the fire's
just getting started.

448
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,600
I mean, it must have been a cinder

449
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,400
that landed on my nightgown.

450
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:54,500
No, it was no accident.

451
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,767
This house is not a healthy
place for you to be.

452
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,767
Ew, not healthy?

453
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,100
I have been scratching
myself a lot lately.

454
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:03,933
And I'm sure Lord Hellsubus

455
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,033
has not been the most
gracious of hosts.

456
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,733
Duh, that's the understatement
of the 19th century.

457
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,700
Since the death of his first wife,

458
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,700
he has not been feeling himself.

459
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:13,800
Too bad.

460
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,133
It might relieve a
lot of that tension.

461
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,167
I'm afraid the poor
man is grief-stricken

462
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,800
ever since the Lady Elura
committed suicide.

463
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,700
Committed suicide?

464
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,653
Why would anybody living
here at Sunnybrook Farm

465
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,533
want to kill themselves?

466
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,800
The master blames
himself for her death.

467
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:32,800
Me, I blame the Hellsubus curse.

468
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,667
Oh, you poor darling!

469
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,267
But I had nothing to do with it.

470
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,967
I don't care.

471
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,533
I mustn't be found here!

472
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,533
Get behind the curtain, quick!

473
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,333
Yeah, good idea.

474
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,033
I thought I heard voices.

475
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,400
Oh, yeah, you and everybody
else in this bug house.

476
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,933
A spider.

477
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,233
( Dog barking )

478
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,300
( rooster crowing )

479
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,000
Hello?

480
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:05,800
Can anybody help me with my bags?

481
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,900
Zou Zou?

482
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,033
Zou Zou!

483
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,367
I'm coming!

484
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,667
Zou Zou, what do I pay you for?

485
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,967
But, Mistress, you have
not paid me in months.

486
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,567
Oh, right.

487
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,233
Oh!

488
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,267
I'm ready to go, Elvira.

489
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,667
Elvira?

490
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
Mistress, do you need some help?

491
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,300
No.

492
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,667
No, I don't need any help.

493
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,067
Do I look like I need help?

494
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,800
Get rid of that damn cake.

495
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,767
Merci.

496
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:11,000
Where's that coach that
quack promised us?

497
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:13,900
I tried to tell you, Mistress, Dr.
Bradley has the emergency!

498
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,567
Emergency?

499
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
What about my emergency?

500
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,467
He said something about
people in the village

501
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,167
dying of the plague.

502
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,933
Plague-shmague.

503
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,167
I have a show to do in Paris.

504
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,367
Oh, some people are so selfish.

505
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,567
Huh?

506
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,833
Oh, Adrian.

507
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:36,000
Uh, I've got an idea.

508
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,600
You two wait right here.

509
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:39,667
Mistress, where are you going?

510
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,833
If I'm not back in an hour...
wait another hour.

511
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Oh.

512
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,733
Ooh!

513
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,167
Adrian!

514
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:02,100
( Cawing )

515
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,367
( cawing )

516
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,933
( gasping )

517
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,867
Ahh!

518
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:30,667
Ahh!

519
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,167
Oh!

520
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,200
( Screaming )

521
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:49,033
Oh!

522
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,567
Oh, it's you.

523
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,167
Oh, you scared the hell out of me.

524
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,367
Would that it was
otherwise, my dear.

525
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,600
They've struck again.

526
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:01,133
What, gophers?

527
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,000
No, grave robbers,

528
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:06,967
in a never-ending search for
the Hellsubus family jewels.

529
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,633
Oh, for the love of God, why
can't they leave us alone?

530
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,267
Hasn't my family suffered enough?

531
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,967
What manner of fiend
is it that would...

532
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,033
That would desecrate a human grave

533
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,367
in their hunger for mere riches?

534
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,067
Why?

535
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,567
Snap out of it!

536
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,900
God, what are you
going for, an Oscar?

537
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:30,467
My eyes, my eyes!

538
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,433
Would you mind, my dear,
they're over there.

539
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,533
God.

540
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,600
Here's your precious horse
blinders, you big baby.

541
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:40,033
You don't understand.

542
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,867
My... my eyes are tortured by
all but the faintest of light.

543
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,533
Oh, so you've got a
hangover too, huh?

544
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:50,433
No, I suffer from acute
ocular sensitivity, my dear.

545
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:51,867
Too bad.

546
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,167
Listen, you know, your friend Dr.
Bradley

547
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,567
stood me up this morning,

548
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,067
so I was wondering if Adrian the
stable boy could give me a ride.

549
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,033
Oh, frailty, thy name is woman.

550
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,267
Look, I just thought
you were Adrian,

551
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,233
that's why I was following you.

552
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,967
I know.

553
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,900
You do?

554
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,533
Don't tell me you're psychic, too.

555
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:15,033
No, I heard your footsteps.

556
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,367
Each and everyone of them echo.

557
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
Echo? Echo.

558
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,333
Echo.

559
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,100
My hearing's hyper-sensitive, too.

560
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:27,033
I hear everything,
each cry in the night,

561
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:31,400
the deafening whisper of
woodworm devouring the coffins,

562
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:35,000
the scratching of rats'
claws upon the stone, I...

563
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,633
I hear it all.

564
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,800
( Howling )

565
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,567
What's that? What?

566
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,633
( Howling )There it is again!

567
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,367
Really, what does it sound like?

568
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,867
Kinda like, "ah-woo"!

569
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,000
Ah!

570
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, an animal, perhaps.

571
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:57,600
Wolves attracted by the
scent of rotting flesh.

572
00:38:57,633 --> 00:38:58,967
Wolves?

573
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,233
Maybe we should head back to the...

574
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:04,700
( howling )

575
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,467
My beloved wife's grave.

576
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,567
She passed away ten years
ago this... this very day.

577
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
( Vladimere )Oh, Elura.

578
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,567
So beautiful, so young,
so full of life.

579
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:36,567
But as I carried her over the
threshold of Castle Hellsubus

580
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,333
on our wedding day, a strange
darkness befell her.

581
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,167
Soon after, she took to her bed.

582
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,667
She would neither eat nor sleep.

583
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,100
I tried everything to cheer her up.

584
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,600
Each night, Elura took
to wandering the halls

585
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:31,533
of Castle Hellsubus,

586
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:35,067
listening to the accursed
voices of the demented souls

587
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,000
emanating from within
its blood-soaked walls.

588
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,833
( Woman screaming )

589
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,500
I prayed that I might rescue her
from this infernal nightmare,

590
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:53,600
but aided by the corrupting
powers of diabolical cunning,

591
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:54,967
she eluded me.

592
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,067
And then one night,

593
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,267
those demonic deceivers
of suicidal destruction

594
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,867
imposed their poisonous and
cankerous will upon this

595
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,667
sweet, unblemished child
of innocence and grace

596
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,700
and ordered her to climb
to the top of the tower.

597
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:26,567
And then... to jump.

598
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,333
( Fabric tearing )

599
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,933
( thud )

600
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:48,467
We were married for just one year.

601
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,033
Well, you know what they say.

602
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:52,133
I mean, 50% of all
marriages end in divorce,

603
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,433
so it wouldn't have worked
out anyway, probably.

604
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,100
Are you okay?

605
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,000
It's you!

606
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,867
You!

607
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,067
Me, me, me, what? Elura!

608
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,900
Elura!

609
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:14,633
No, Elvira, Elvira, Elvira.

610
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,633
I'll send you back to hell!

611
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,333
Oh!

612
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,567
Ooh!

613
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,900
Oh, oh...

614
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:26,967
Oh, that smarts, what happened?

615
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,600
Uh, you don't remember?

616
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:33,267
No, I must have undergone
some kind of blackout.

617
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,433
Yeah, yeah... Uh,
you tripped.

618
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:38,800
( Howling )

619
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,073
You know, I'm a little sheepish
when it comes to wolves.

620
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,500
What do you say we head on
back to the castle, okay?

621
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,367
Oh, yes, good idea.

622
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,500
Oh!

623
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, thank you, my dear.

624
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:05,733
I think I might just go upstairs

625
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:08,233
and rest for awhile.

626
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:10,700
Okay, you do that.

627
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:13,600
And while you're at it, you
might want to grab an icepack.

628
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,933
Yes.

629
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,833
Ah-ah-ah!

630
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:33,933
Hold it right there.

631
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:36,067
Mutton stew.

632
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,933
Mm, mm.

633
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,267
Whoa, dude.

634
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,367
Somebody went a little
heavy on the Tabasco.

635
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,667
This is my husband's
chamber pot, madam.

636
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,633
( Rumbling )

637
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,067
( clock chiming )

638
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,300
Disturbing, yes,

639
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:24,667
but perfectly harmless,
I assure you.

640
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,567
Oh, yeah, no problemo.

641
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,967
I'm from California.

642
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,167
So, as I was saying, I
was in the village,

643
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,933
cleaning out the
pustular, runny sores

644
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,133
of this poor old woman
and I said to her,

645
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,967
"Madam, I believe you
have the plague."

646
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,200
And she said, "Oh, no, sir,
I don't have the plague."

647
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,800
And just at that moment,
her ear dropped off.

648
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,300
Roll?

649
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:50,100
I can assure you, Ema,
it was rousing good fun.

650
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:54,167
Bradley, you always have
the most amusing stories.

651
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,967
Mmm, gee.

652
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,500
This looks... delicious.

653
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,300
It's gruel.

654
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,733
Yeah, damn straight it's cruel.

655
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,900
I mean, I was really hungry.

656
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:14,133
No, madam, it's hot gruel.

657
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,700
That's... It's fine.

658
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,933
I'm afraid those of
the Hellsubus clan

659
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:26,533
can consume only the
most pallid mash,

660
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:29,400
wear only the softest of clothing,

661
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:32,900
tolerate only the
faintest of light.

662
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,267
You see...

663
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:45,800
My husband and Roxana
suffer from certain

664
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,967
peculiarities oftem perament.

665
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah, where I come from,
they call it hypochondria.

666
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:53,767
Pardon?

667
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,567
I said...

668
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,733
Maybe it's just all in their mind.

669
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:59,200
Precisely.

670
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:02,067
And when something is
in someone's mind,

671
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:07,167
it is more real, more
powerful than any mere...

672
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,600
physical malady.

673
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,767
Yeah, right.

674
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,520
Like there's something
going on in my mind.

675
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:13,533
Well now, shall we see?

676
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,300
What do you know about hypnosis?

677
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,733
It's a bunch of hooey.

678
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:18,700
I once did a show with
Ivan the Incredible,

679
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:21,433
he tried to hypnotize me and
make me bark like a dog.

680
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:23,333
And did it work?

681
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,067
Well, by the time he was done,

682
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,133
he was the one who was
sitting up and begging.

683
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,967
( Barking )

684
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,433
Girlfriend.

685
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,900
I assure you, Elvira,

686
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,133
the powers of hypnotism
are very real.

687
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,067
Allow me to demonstrate.

688
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,967
Look deeply into my eyes.

689
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,367
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

690
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,633
Wish I had a peso for every
time I heard that old line.

691
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,433
Give your will over to mine.

692
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:09,473
Woo.

693
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,767
Your hands are melting into mine.

694
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,400
Soon, very soon, they will
become one with mine.

695
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,100
Yeah, just watch the
nails, will you?

696
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:19,700
Close your eyes.

697
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:22,133
You will try, you will try,
but you will not be able.

698
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:23,767
You will try very soon,
you will try now,

699
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,533
but you will not, you
cannot move them!

700
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,000
Will you please hold it down?

701
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,300
I'm just trying to sleep here.

702
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,300
Is she hypnotized?

703
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:38,000
No, I am not hypno...
( snoring )

704
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,900
Elvira.

705
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,267
You're a little girl, very happy,

706
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,300
so young, so happy,

707
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,000
so very, very happy.

708
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,200
It's all brightness
and butterflies.

709
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:55,000
They're a wonder to behold.

710
00:47:55,033 --> 00:47:56,433
See them.

711
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:57,900
See them?

712
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:01,200
( High-pitched voice )I just
love butterflies ever so much.

713
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,967
Why look, there's one on a flower.

714
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,167
Reach out, Elvira, you
can almost touch it.

715
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Reach out...

716
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:09,933
Oh, it's a bee, it stung you!
Ow, ow!

717
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,333
Ow!

718
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:13,333
No, no, no tears, Elvira.

719
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,400
There's no reason to weep.

720
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:17,467
( Thundering )

721
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,567
( Elura's voice )Don't weep for me.

722
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,333
Weep for Vladimere.

723
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:36,500
I have come to wreak my vengeance.

724
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:38,133
Oh!

725
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,200
( Normal voice )Wow, who
turned out the lights?

726
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:48,200
See, I told you that hypnotism
thing was a bunch of hooey.

727
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,533
Ow.

728
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:57,867
I'm... I'm afraid I'm
feeling a bit "unstab-Le."

729
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,367
Speaking of "unstab-Le"... stable,

730
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,033
where's Lord Loco anyway?

731
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:11,733
( Thundering )

732
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,767
( piano playing )

733
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,600
So plague or no plague,

734
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,393
your coach is picking
me up tomorrow, right?

735
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,567
Oh, absolutely.

736
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,933
I assure you, Elvira,

737
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:28,467
you won't be spending another
night in Castle Hellsubus.

738
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,000
Happy anniversary, Elura.

739
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,400
Poor guy's had a tough day.

740
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,400
Yes, poor Vladimere.

741
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:51,100
I don't believe I've ever
seen him looking so morose.

742
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:54,167
I mean, who wouldn't be
with this dirge playing?

743
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,967
Move over, honey.

744
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,533
Let's see if we can't turn
that frown upside down.

745
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,167
* Many years ago when
I was so small *

746
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,367
* I slipped into a music hall

747
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,700
* How was Ito know curiosity *

748
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:29,900
* Would cost me my... virginity? *

749
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:33,267
* In a single night I
learned all the facts *

750
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,333
* About the birds and
bees and tit for tat *

751
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,633
* I remember seven
Turkish acrobats *

752
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:43,500
* Who taught mean unnatural act *

753
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:46,000
Come on!

754
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:49,533
* I was asked to play
with the entire band *

755
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:53,133
* I had them all right in my hand *

756
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:56,000
* The pianist confessed to me

757
00:50:56,033 --> 00:51:00,833
* There was a horse
in his family tree *

758
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:06,067
* A contortionist needed
to get his kicks *

759
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,033
* Forcing little me to
do the Chinese split *

760
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,400
* Girlfriend the trained
dogs were quite a treat *

761
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:15,400
* They thought moi was
a bitch in heat *

762
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,633
Grr!

763
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,333
Hit it!

764
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:36,067
* I was gagged and bound
by a psycho clown *

765
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,667
* I'm not even married but
I've been tied down *

766
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,767
* By the way the jugglers
were living dolls *

767
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,900
* And they taught me how to
juggle all their balls *

768
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:48,933
* I learned how to
expose my derriere *

769
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,533
* Show my legs and bam

770
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,133
* Get them in the air

771
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:58,267
* Yes I often stop
thinking to recall *

772
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,867
* Life is like a music hall.

773
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,967
Yeah!

774
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,933
( Snoring )

775
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,967
( Elura )Vladimere...

776
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:07,700
Vladimere... Who...
Who is it?

777
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:10,633
Who's there?

778
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,767
Vladimere!

779
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,333
Vladimere...

780
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,967
Oh!

781
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:37,733
Vladimere, what is it?

782
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:40,900
I saw her... it was her.

783
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,300
Who, man?

784
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,667
Whom did you see?

785
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:49,733
I... I saw... I saw...
No one.

786
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,267
Nothing, I...

787
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,400
I must have been dreaming.

788
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,367
( Speaking gibberish )

789
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,633
All of you!

790
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,867
Oh... oh.

791
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:16,467
What... What?

792
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:21,067
What... what happened?

793
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,867
Uh, you... tripped again.

794
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:27,200
You gotta lay off of that absinthe.

795
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:28,333
Thank you.

796
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,933
That ring!

797
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:34,033
Where did you get that ring?

798
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:36,000
Uh, this old thing?

799
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:38,633
I just... found it in my room.

800
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:39,767
It was Elura's!

801
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,400
Her wedding ring... you took it!

802
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,467
Sheesh, calm down, will you?

803
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,100
Here, you can have it.

804
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:47,667
Too tacky for me, anyway.

805
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,633
No, no... No, get it
away, get it away!

806
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,633
Will you make up your mind?

807
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,500
Elura was wearing that ring...

808
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,700
when I buried her.

809
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:58,800
Ew.

810
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:09,067
Don't even think about it.

811
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,867
Then it's true!

812
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,867
It is true!

813
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,500
She's alive!

814
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:19,333
Vladimere, you know very
well that's not possible.

815
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:23,233
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

816
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:33,833
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

817
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:35,800
Mmm... Here, here.

818
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,367
All spic and span.

819
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,167
I'll get the rest later.

820
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,133
Almost got it.

821
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,800
( Grunting )

822
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,500
Oh, my God!

823
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,467
It's true!

824
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,300
She is alive!

825
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,167
Girl, you are starting
to get on my last nerve.

826
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:34,033
Good Lord.

827
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:36,300
No heartbeat.

828
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,200
Mirror?

829
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,133
No breath, either!

830
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:48,567
I'm afraid she's quite... dead.

831
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:54,667
Well, at least we'll get
some use out of that coffin.

832
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:05,233
Poor Roxana.

833
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,633
She's found peace at last.

834
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,500
For a member of the Hellsubus line,

835
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:13,367
even death can bring no peace.

836
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,333
Oh!

837
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:18,367
If only it were me instead of her.

838
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,333
Yes, if only it was you.

839
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:26,833
Yes, if only... it was.

840
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:31,800
Yes, if... only.

841
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:56,067
Must you close the casket
so soon, Vladimere?

842
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,567
Yeah, boy, you guys don't
waste any time, do you?

843
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,100
I mean, the body's
not even cold yet.

844
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:03,100
It's time for Roxana

845
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:06,700
to join the rest of
the Hellsubus clan.

846
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,867
Come.

847
00:58:09,933 --> 00:58:12,200
Why, why, why?

848
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:16,800
She was so young and so...
Young!

849
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,000
Roxana!

850
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:19,900
We hardly knew ye!

851
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:23,000
She was a good girl...
she never "hoit" nobody!

852
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,867
You're with the
angels now, darling.

853
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,200
Oh!

854
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:29,567
Oh, man, I don't know about
the rest of you guys,

855
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,333
but I need a drink.

856
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,567
( Creaking )

857
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,633
( dog barking )

858
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:58,933
( iron clanking )

859
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,400
Hello?

860
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:07,433
Adrian?

861
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,533
Adrian.

862
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:38,733
That's quite a big hammer
you're swinging there.

863
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:39,933
Elvira.

864
01:00:39,967 --> 01:00:42,800
I was just shoeing a horse
for your trip tomorrow.

865
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:45,100
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd just bring you

866
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:48,000
a little something
to remember me by.

867
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,333
A book!

868
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:55,900
Elvira, you are as generous
as you are beautiful.

869
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:59,667
Ah, "Kama... Sutra."

870
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,400
Yeah.

871
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:02,700
Have you read it already?

872
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:04,567
I'm afraid I haven't.

873
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,567
Oh, too bad.

874
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,033
I hope there aren't
too many big words.

875
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,633
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

876
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,433
I mean, it's mostly pictures.

877
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:14,567
Here, let me show you
the first chapter.

878
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm not sure I follow.

879
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:23,667
Oh, read on.

880
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:31,733
( Humming )

881
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,333
( gasping )

882
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:39,833
( glass breaking )

883
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:53,000
Mmm... Nicholai.

884
01:01:55,533 --> 01:02:02,033
Elura... At long last.

885
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:05,667
My brother would have my
head if he knew about this.

886
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,233
Vladimere will never find out.

887
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,800
No!

888
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,967
( Screaming )

889
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,133
Help me... help me!

890
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:37,067
No!

891
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,300
Help me!

892
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:44,033
No!

893
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:46,333
Help me!

894
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,600
No, help me, Elvira!

895
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:49,867
( Screaming )

896
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,400
( grunting )

897
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:57,567
( muffled cries )

898
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,033
Who's there?

899
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,600
Zou Zou, is that you?

900
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,733
What do you think you
are, a freaking parakeet?

901
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,433
( Muffled cries )

902
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:26,933
Oh, you will not believe
this weird dream I had.

903
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:29,267
I think that Elura's buried
alive down here somewhere

904
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,967
and I think that I know who...
Oh!

905
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,933
How did you two get down here?

906
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:38,667
This dungeon has been
locked for 100 years.

907
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,867
Yeah, right, and I
suppose you've never

908
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,333
been down here either.

909
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:45,400
Madam, I swear to you, I've
never before set foot in...

910
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:47,533
in this place.

911
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,967
Look, little Lord Paranoid,
I didn't say you did.

912
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,933
I just said that if you are the
only person with the key...

913
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:56,533
It was in this foul dungeon

914
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:59,733
that my great-grandfather,
Lord Lucian Hellsubus,

915
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:04,233
committed unspeakable
acts of torture.

916
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:06,567
Ooh, like, "Whip me,
baby, whip me"?

917
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,167
In a nutshell, yes.

918
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,733
Ouch.

919
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,300
Oh, my God!

920
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:19,833
This is it!

921
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,600
It's this wall!

922
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:24,233
It's... It's the
wall from my dream!

923
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:26,267
What on Earth are you
talking about, my dear?

924
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,800
It wasn't a dream... it
really happened!

925
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:45,367
Elura didn't kill herself.

926
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,467
You killed her!

927
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,733
I had to do it, Elura.

928
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:52,267
Don't you see?

929
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,900
You wanted to leave me.

930
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:57,733
Leave this castle.

931
01:06:57,767 --> 01:07:00,733
No one in the Hellsubus
clan can ever leave,

932
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,467
as I told dear Roxana.

933
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,100
You mean Roxana was...

934
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:09,333
Yes, about to be buried alive, too.

935
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:13,100
That's another unfortunate
Hellsubus family trait.

936
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:15,467
Catalepsy.

937
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,967
Fear of cats?

938
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,333
It's a condition which
completely parallels

939
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:23,533
the look of death.

940
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:27,567
You mean, then...
She was...

941
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,400
And you knew?

942
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:31,133
Yes.And...

943
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:34,267
Yes, I'm afraid... I'm
afraid burying people alive

944
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,567
is another unfortunate
Hellsubus family trait.

945
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,667
And now, Elvira,

946
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,967
it's time to send you back
from whence you came.

947
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,267
To hell!

948
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,733
No!

949
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,333
I shall rip your black heart out

950
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,600
and feed it to the carrion crows!

951
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,733
Sheesh, you'd think he
would have learned by now.

952
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,200
( Door opening )

953
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:30,133
Ah, there he is.

954
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:33,600
Pretty as a picture.

955
01:08:33,633 --> 01:08:37,500
It is rather amusing,
isn't it, dearest?

956
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:42,400
Your first wife,
Elura, an adulteress.

957
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:46,533
Your brother Nicholai,
an adulterer.

958
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:50,567
Your second wife, an adulteress.

959
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,433
Your trusted doctor and
friend, an adulterer!

960
01:09:28,267 --> 01:09:30,133
Oy, mate!

961
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,133
( Whistling )

962
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,133
No, he's completely
off it this time.

963
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:37,233
We've done it.

964
01:09:37,267 --> 01:09:39,767
Look at the pathetic milksop.

965
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,267
He'd be better off dead.

966
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,233
Yeah, but we wouldn't,
would we, love?

967
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,867
And now that he's off his nut,

968
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,533
you and I are completely in control

969
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,633
of the Hellsubus family fortune.

970
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:52,600
And no one will question
his need for constant care

971
01:09:52,633 --> 01:09:55,933
from his trusted doctor,

972
01:09:55,967 --> 01:10:01,167
with the help of his
faithful wife, of course.

973
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,000
I hope you've learned your lesson.

974
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,500
Never sign a pre-nuptual agreement!
Never sign a pre-nuptual agreement!

975
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,933
( Creaking )

976
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,433
Elvira.Oh.

977
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:18,400
How nice of you to join us.

978
01:10:18,433 --> 01:10:20,333
( Elvira )Hi there.

979
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,967
Um, I was just leaving, so
I'll see you guys around!

980
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,667
No, you don't, love.

981
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,833
Oh, no.

982
01:10:26,867 --> 01:10:29,067
Don't leave, Elvira.

983
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,233
The fun is just beginning.

984
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,333
Yoo-hoo, Elvira!

985
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:55,300
Your carriage awaits!

986
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,767
Elvira!

987
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,433
Hmm, maybe she's upstairs.

988
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,333
God, it's great, isn't it?

989
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:11,767
Look at the size of that rack.

990
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,000
Elvira, I must confess, I
find the sight of you in pain

991
01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:17,333
particularly arousing.

992
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:18,967
Ow!

993
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,633
Careful, Bradley,
or you'll be next.

994
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,767
I swear, you guys, I
didn't hear a thing.

995
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,367
Ow!

996
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,467
About you and the doctor
having an affair.

997
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,000
Oh!

998
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:32,100
And... and you trying to
make Vladimere insane

999
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:34,367
so that you could steal
the family jewels.

1000
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,233
Ow, ow!

1001
01:11:37,267 --> 01:11:38,767
Nicholai!

1002
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,567
Oh, Vladimere.

1003
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,067
How are you?

1004
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,267
I must confess you're
looking better.

1005
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,667
Thank you, dear brother.

1006
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,200
That's very kind.

1007
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:48,567
I think that... Brother?

1008
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,667
Vladimere, whatever
on Earth do you mean?

1009
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,867
It was always you, Nicholai! No!

1010
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,833
Always you! No...

1011
01:11:54,867 --> 01:11:57,167
First you stole my toys...

1012
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,767
Then our dear mother's sweet love,

1013
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,067
and then finally, my beloved Elura.

1014
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,700
You must die, Nicholai!

1015
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:06,333
You must die!

1016
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:07,867
Vladimere, no!

1017
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,367
As for you,

1018
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,233
you too will suffer for
your faithlessness, Elura.

1019
01:12:16,267 --> 01:12:20,733
But, husband, I'm
not Elura, I'm Ema!

1020
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:24,400
Before this day is out, you
will beg me to release you

1021
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,300
from the unimaginable hell

1022
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:29,633
into which you're
about to be plunged.

1023
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,167
Die, die in agony, Elura!

1024
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,700
( Screaming )

1025
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:44,933
I'm not Elura!

1026
01:12:44,967 --> 01:12:47,200
She is!

1027
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:52,667
Oh, that Ema!

1028
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,633
She's such a kidder.

1029
01:12:56,533 --> 01:12:58,733
Oh, forgive me.

1030
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:02,233
My slutty adulteress, darling.

1031
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:04,400
Hey, don't call me darling.

1032
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:07,500
Let me release you
from your bondage.

1033
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:08,933
Uh, yeah, that'd be great,

1034
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,600
because I'm really not into
this kinda thing anyway.

1035
01:13:11,633 --> 01:13:13,267
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

1036
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,400
No, the other way, the
other way, the other way!

1037
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:25,000
Please forgive me, my dear,
but old habits die hard.

1038
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,400
Yeah.

1039
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:37,633
Wow.

1040
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:48,633
Elvira?

1041
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:53,833
Elvira?

1042
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:55,567
It's your stable stud.

1043
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,000
Time to go to the train...

1044
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,233
( Elvira screaming )

1045
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,467
( Elvira )Help me!

1046
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,433
( Vladimere )Do you know
where you are, Elura?

1047
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:40,933
Shall I tell you where
you are, Elura?

1048
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:43,200
Would you stop with
the Elura stuff?

1049
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:44,667
Elura is dead.

1050
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,100
I'm Elvira, remember?

1051
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:49,867
Life is like a music hall, yeah!

1052
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,767
Oh, prepare to enter hell, Elura,

1053
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,133
the netherworld, the
abode of the dead,

1054
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:57,500
the infernal regions.

1055
01:14:57,533 --> 01:15:02,167
That place of torment,
pandemonium, abandonment,

1056
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:06,000
that vast unbottomed
place that's...

1057
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:07,900
really, really hot.

1058
01:15:11,567 --> 01:15:14,567
Araka.

1059
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,567
Gehenna.

1060
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,200
Hades.

1061
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:23,833
The boundless... All right, all
right, I got it, I got it.

1062
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:27,200
Jeez, will somebody take
away his thesaurus?

1063
01:15:27,233 --> 01:15:30,533
Don't interrupt when
I'm on a roll, Elura.

1064
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,967
Elvira!

1065
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,533
Where are you?

1066
01:15:35,567 --> 01:15:37,333
Adrian!

1067
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:43,900
I'm in here, in the dungeon!

1068
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,500
Oh, Elura.

1069
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:48,467
In this place, no one
can hear you scream.

1070
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,967
No!

1071
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,533
Adrian, help!

1072
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:57,133
Elvira!

1073
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,333
Adrian! Elvira!

1074
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:03,267
Now let me present for
your final enjoyment,

1075
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,500
the pit... and
the pendulum!

1076
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:14,733
Oh, my God!

1077
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:16,633
My God!

1078
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:18,733
Adrian, Adrian, hurry!

1079
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:20,033
Adrian!

1080
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,433
Ah, ah!( laughing )

1081
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:43,833
Adrian!

1082
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:46,600
Where are you?

1083
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:47,933
Elvira!

1084
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,867
( laughing )

1085
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:02,433
Adrian, I haven't got all day here!

1086
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:04,633
( laughing )

1087
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,133
Who is that laughing?

1088
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,033
Who is that laughing?

1089
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:12,167
Hurry!

1090
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,333
Really, hurry up!

1091
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,800
I'm not kidding!

1092
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,367
Adrian, help!

1093
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,800
Oh, oh!

1094
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,567
Help, help!

1095
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,267
Oh!

1096
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,967
Hold on!

1097
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,900
I can't!

1098
01:17:39,933 --> 01:17:42,100
I have to do everything myself?

1099
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:49,300
Ah!

1100
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,233
Oh!

1101
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:09,033
You can never escape me, Elura.

1102
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:17,833
( Elura's voice )No, it is you who
will never escape me, Vladimere!

1103
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:40,933
My eyes!

1104
01:18:54,867 --> 01:18:57,307
( Normal voice )Whoa, talk about
yourdys functional families.

1105
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:58,867
Oh!

1106
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,633
My eyes, my eyes!

1107
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,067
Help, Elura!

1108
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,033
( Screaming )

1109
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:28,200
Elvira! Adrian!

1110
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,533
You came too late!

1111
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,900
Again.

1112
01:19:38,967 --> 01:19:40,467
Don't worry!

1113
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,667
We're safe now.

1114
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:59,600
( Muffled cries )

1115
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:01,767
Oh, yeah, almost forgot.

1116
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,160
( Adrian )It's your maid, Zou Zou.

1117
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,133
What to do?

1118
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,267
Here!

1119
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,500
Keep your shirt on.

1120
01:20:11,533 --> 01:20:13,667
We've got everything under cont...

1121
01:20:16,633 --> 01:20:18,833
Oh.

1122
01:20:18,867 --> 01:20:20,933
Here, give me your hand!

1123
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,600
That's it.

1124
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,967
Come on, come on, hurry!

1125
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,300
Move it!

1126
01:20:30,267 --> 01:20:32,567
Wait for me!

1127
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,767
Mistress!

1128
01:20:40,933 --> 01:20:43,567
( Glass breaking )

1129
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,033
Hurry!

1130
01:20:47,533 --> 01:20:50,133
This place is coming down!

1131
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:55,567
Bradley?

1132
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,900
Where are you going?

1133
01:20:57,933 --> 01:20:59,767
Save me!

1134
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,600
Ema, there's no time!

1135
01:21:01,633 --> 01:21:03,633
It's you or the family jewels!

1136
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:08,200
If I ever get out of here,
I'm going to kill you!

1137
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:10,200
Right, it's the jewels then.

1138
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:14,933
Damn you, Bradley!

1139
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:16,933
Damn you!

1140
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,133
( Elvira )Wait, wait!

1141
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,900
Save me!

1142
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,933
Oh, my God!

1143
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:12,367
It's Ema!

1144
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,567
She's still alive.

1145
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,933
I must go back.

1146
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:16,800
No, no, you can't go back in there.

1147
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,233
What are you, nuts?

1148
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,800
You don't understand, Elvira.

1149
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,533
I'm Ema's illegitimate
half-brother.

1150
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:24,133
No!

1151
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:25,833
( Adrian )Bye!

1152
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:28,433
Come back, you crazy bastard!

1153
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,933
My jewels!

1154
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:56,567
Ema!

1155
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,767
Ooh, ow!

1156
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,900
Ooh!

1157
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,467
Thank you, Elvira.

1158
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,033
Oh, my God!

1159
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:48,100
That's... that's incredible!

1160
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:49,300
What, Mistress?

1161
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:51,833
That the spirit of Elura
is finally set free?

1162
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:55,667
No, that... that we can afford
such a groovy special effect!

1163
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,967
Oh, oui!

1164
01:24:04,233 --> 01:24:06,600
( Wolf howling )

1165
01:24:13,367 --> 01:24:15,067
Remind me never to hitch a ride

1166
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,867
in a strange coach again.

1167
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,267
( Horses neighing )

1168
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,467
( whimpering )

1169
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,633
Yoo-hoo!

1170
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,333
( Tires screeching )

1171
01:24:45,367 --> 01:24:46,967
( horse neighing )

1172
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:55,033
Ladies, may I offer you a ride?

1173
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,267
Whoa, it's like déjà
vu all over again!

1174
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,567
So anyway, we're lucky we even
got out of there with our lives.

1175
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,167
Oui, oui, if it was not for Elvira,

1176
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,633
I would be squished
like a French grape.

1177
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:10,067
Where did you say this castle was?

1178
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,100
Just there in the
Carpathian Mountains.

1179
01:25:12,133 --> 01:25:14,633
Yeah, Castle Hellsubus,
you ever heard of it?

1180
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:20,600
You could not possibly
have visited there.

1181
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:22,953
Hello, I think I know where I
just spent the worst weekend

1182
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,433
of my whole life.

1183
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:29,533
Castle Hellsubus was
destroyed 100 years ago.

1184
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:35,967
( Wolf howling )

1185
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:43,200
( horses neighing )

1186
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,567
( laughing )
