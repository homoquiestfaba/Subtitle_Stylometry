Ira, would you
like to come in?

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,250
Yes. Yes, please.

00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,417
How are you today, Doctor?

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,333
Well, I guess
I'm feeling...

5
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:40,375
worse and worse, really.

6
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:43,001
You know, lonely,
panicked, can't focus.

7
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,250
Everyone bothers me
lately, you know?

8
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,042
Everyone.

9
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:48,750
Waiters, the doormen,

10
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,959
people on line at the ATM.
It doesn't matter who.

11
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:53,792
There's really no one I can
stand to be around right now,

12
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,500
including myself.
I hate myself.

13
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,834
I mean, if you're going
to check your balance
at the ATM,

14
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,126
you don't have to,
you know--

15
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,500
not midday, not at noon.

16
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:04,709
When there's a big line,

17
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:05,959
you don't check your balance.

18
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:06,959
I mean, is it me?

19
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,500
Is that too much to ask?

20
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:09,709
Don't check your balance.

21
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,292
I mean, you can
check your balance,

22
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,459
but check--
just check it later.

23
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,709
You know that story
I told you about

24
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,625
when I had lice
in the third grade?

25
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,709

00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,084
I just feel fat.

oh, just very fat today.

32
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:37,917
Lea says
I carry extra weight

33
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,126
so I don't have to face
my real failures.

34
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,333
I don't know why Lea and I
stay together.

35
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,250
I mean, breaking up 11 times
in one year can't--

36
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,042
well, not 11,
but, like, seven.

37
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:50,625
Well, that-- that was
one...weekend thing,

38
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:51,500
so, like, six.

39
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:56,584

stay here all day.

41
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,375
I feel, uh-- I really--
I like this couch.

42
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,417
I like this couch.
I like it.

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,792
And the...lighting
in this room is just--

44
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,709
It's terrific. I never
get tired of this room.

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
I never get tired
of spending time with you.

46
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,834

discontinue our work here.

has run its course.

To listen.

54
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,917
Yes, Ira.

55
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,126
I've been listening
for 12 years,

56
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,375
and you're not
making any progress.

57
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,667

isn't working.

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,709
You're breaking up with me?

59
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,459
I know this is painful,

60
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,417
but you need change.

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,667
You need to get unstuck.

62
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,709

00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,625
or old?

180
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,584
What?

181
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,417
No, I'm just
always curious.

182
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,917
Why today, you know?

183
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,500
As opposed
to yesterday or--

184
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:17,792
Oh, uh, nothing
in particular.

185
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:21,042
You know, just trying
to make a change.

186
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,084
Change it up.

187
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,126
Want a fry?

188
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,126
What?

189
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,126
Fry?

190
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,126
Oh.

191
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,333
They're hot and good.

192
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:30,042
No. No. Just a tour
would be good.

193
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:31,042
Of the gym?

194
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,042
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

195
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:33,042
I've been here--
Okay.

196
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,042
...for, like, 45 minutes.

197
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:35,333
Okay. Sorry.

198
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,084
Um, let's get to it.

199
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,709
It's, uh...

200
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,459
It's not that great,
really.

201
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,333
I'm sorry you waited.

202
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,417
Um, this is
the front part.

203
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,876
And, uh, this, uh,
is the training club.

204
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,168
Hey, Mare.
Hey, Ab.

205
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Uh, bulletin board,
you know,

206
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,042
class schedules,
that sort of thing.

207
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:55,209
Machines and--

208
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,959
The yoga room is upstairs.

209
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,834
Hey, Lori.
You look amazing.

210
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,959
What do you do?
You do, uh, classes,

211
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:03,333
or do you do those--
that StairMaster?

212
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,375
Oh, you know what?

213
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:05,417
Our StairMasters
are broken.

214
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,667
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,959
But, uh,
I don't work out.

216
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,292
I hate exercise.

217
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,542
Well, why would you
work at a gym if you--

218
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,542
Abby.

219
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,542
Hey.

220
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,542
Hey, Henry.

221
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,126
Henry, this is Ira.

222
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,126
Ira, Henry.

223
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,667
Hello, Ira.
Henry.

224
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,792
So I did what you said.

225
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,126
I called him up.

226
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,792
I've told him that it
really hurt my feelings

227
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,333
when he wouldn't
stay through the night,

228
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,209
and I told him I didn't
want to see him anymore

229
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,667
if he only loved me
for my body.

230
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,709
Good for you.
What did he say?

231
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,417
This morning
he sent flowers
and a card:

232
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,001
"I love you.
I can't live without,"

233
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,250
blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

234
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,542
Tonight he's taking me
to<i> Avenue Q.</i>

235
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,500
Oh, my God. I feel
I'm going to cry.

236
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,792
I'm so proud of you.

237
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,834
All because of you.

238
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,250
Oh, please.
I did nothing.

239
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,209
You did it.
That's crazy.

240
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,417
I'm sorry. I--

241
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,834
Abby.
I need you.

242
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:52,834
Oh, hey, Buddy.

243
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,417
I just got
my head shots back.

244
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,667
Can you take a look?

245
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,876
Oh, yeah.

246
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,792
I think I found
my young dad look.

247
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:00,042
Yes. What do you think?

248
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,042
Am I interrupting
something?

249
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,625
You know, Ira's actually--

250
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,209
It's okay.
I'm going to get going.

251
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,500
You obviously
have your hands full.

252
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:06,625
No, no. We, uh--

253
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,625
I shouldn't have come.

254
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,667
I shouldn't have come.

255
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,250
But don't you want to--

256
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,917
No.

257
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,876
I feel like guys
don't listen anymore

258
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,876
because I'm thin.

259
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,417
I'm like "Hello.
This is talking.

260
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,834
These ladies
can't hear you."

261
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,168
So I'm thinking
that one for commercial.

262
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,417
Okay.

263
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,209
And then dramatic.

264
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,459
Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,250
And that one
in the corner

266
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,375
for online dating.

267
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,126
Oh, that's
a perfect choice.

268
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:47,792
I have a hard time
finishing things.

269
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:50,084
Making any decisions
whatsoever, really.

270
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,917
Oh.

271
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,084
The truth is I just
woke up today

272
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:58,542
feeling fat, you know?

273
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,834
I guess I've been feeling
fat lately in general,

274
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,417
and old-- old, too.
You were right. But...

275
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,792
mostly fat.

276
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:08,001
I can't even quite
pull in my stomach anymore.

277
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,001
It's like I did the thing
where you pretend--

278
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:11,584
You pretend to be
a pregnant woman?

279
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,250
Right. Or Santa Claus
too many times, and now--

280
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,792
Now it won't go back.

281
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,209
Exactly.
Now it won't go back.

282
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,625
Really?

283
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,250
Yeah, it's huge.
Can I see?

284
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,459
My fat stomach?

285
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:24,709
Yes.

286
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:27,625
No one's looking.
No one comes in here.

287
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,417
Um, the guy's back there.

288
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,959
Okay.
I'll bet you ten bucks

289
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,625
I can stick mine out
farther than yours.

290
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,792
20.
25.

291
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,126
Done.

292
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,001
Bring it.

293
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,042
[Abby]
All right, ready?
1, 2, 3.

294
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,417
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

295
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,709
That's huge.
I win. I win.

296
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,876
All right, you win.

297
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,417
I'll take
your 25 bucks now.

298
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,459
Oh, my God, I just
got a head rush.

299
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,709
25 bucks.

300
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,709
I don't have any money.

301
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,333
What?
I don't have any money.

302
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,500
That's okay.

303
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,042
Can I see it normal?

304
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,250
No. No, no.

305
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,834
Can I just see
it normal, please?

306
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,084
Just right quick?

307
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,042
It's huge.
I got all this loose--

308
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,709
There's back fat in here.

309
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,709
It's like--

310
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,126
God, I love that.

311
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,168
Do you have a girlfriend?

312
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,709
Uh--

313
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,792
Abby, do you have,
like, three minutes?

314
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:22,584
Oh, sure, sure.
But right now?

315
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,500
I want to try out
this new monologue.

316
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,001
Can I do it for you?

317
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:28,042
Oh, sure, but Ira--
can Ira listen, too?

318
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,459
Ira, Janice.
Janice, this is Ira.

319
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,750
Hi.

320
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,917
Hi, Ira.
You want to listen?

321
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,959
Oh, no, no.
No, not at all.

322
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:35,959
That's fine.
Thank you.

323
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,750
Hell is murky!

324
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,375
Fie, m'lord! Fie!

325
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,417
A soldier and a fjord?

326
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,459
What--

327
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,168
What need...

328
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,959
"we fear hurt?"

329
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:55,042
So it's $699 all in.

330
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,042
Right, or $72.50 a month.

331
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,417
Plus the--

332
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,625
Plus the initiation fee.
I know it's a lot.

333
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,834
It is, but with the--
with the pool--

334
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,042
You know what? Maybe
you should take up running.

335
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:07,001
I mean, you live
so close to the park,

336
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:08,876
and my dad actually belongs

337
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,417
to one of those groups
where you meet at a certain--

338
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,417
Don't you work
on commission?

339
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,917
What?

340
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,001
You're a terrible
salesperson.

341
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,667
No, really, you are
absolutely horrible,

342
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,625
like one of the worst
I've ever seen.

343
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,959
When was the last time

344
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,876
you actually sold
a membership to a person?

345
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,500
Oh, um, well,

346
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:30,084
there are
a lot of renewals
that come up, so--

347
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,292
And I have a great
deal on my rent.

348
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,542
Really?
Where do you live?

349
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,542
With my parents.

350
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,834
Well, yeah, that's a--

351
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:37,168
that's a-- that's a deal.

352
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,417
Yeah. Oh, it's not
what you think.

353
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,959
I mean,
I'm not a loser.

354
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:42,542
I had my own place
and everything,

355
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,750
but they doubled
my rent,

356
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:44,750
and our dog died.

357
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:45,750
Oh.

358
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:46,750
So yeah--

359
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,584
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

360
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,709
Shepherd mix, 14, so--
Do you have pets?

361
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,792
Oh, me? No. No.

362
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,750
I have a fear
of perishables.

363
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,459
You know, pets,
dairy products, produce,

364
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,250
anything that dies,
I don't tend to--

365
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,709
Not for me.

366
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,042
I see. What do you do?

367
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,168
I'm a psychologist.

368
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,001
Right.

369
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,250
But I don't
see patients.

370
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,917
I just study.
I'm getting my Ph.D.

371
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:11,917
Oh, wow.

372
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,126
Well, trying to.

373
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,750
I'm-- I'm writing
my dissertation,

374
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,292
but I can't seem
to, uh--

375
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,625
Finish it?

376
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,876
Why are you so nice?

377
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,126
Oh, I'm not that nice.

378
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,667
Yeah, you are.
You're highly nice.

379
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,876
It doesn't track.

380
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,667
It doesn't track?
What does that mean?

381
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,667
It just means,
you know,

382
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,209
what makes you tick?

383
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,001
Oh, uh...
I don't know.

384
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:31,584
What do you think
makes me tick?

385
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,459
Oh, well, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't--

386
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,459
Come on. You're
the psychologist, right?

387
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,333
In training.

388
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,375
So give me your best shot.

389
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,042
Well, I'd just be
stabbing in the dark.

390
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,168
Okay.

391
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,292
I think you're, uh...

392
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
probably
the type of person...

393
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,584
who's scared to death
of responsibility.

394
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,168
You're probably an only child,
center of the family.

395
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,667
Parents thought
you hung the moon.

396
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,459
And I'm guessing
at a certain point

397
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,042
the pressure
got so much for you

398
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,792
that you started
rebelling and failing

399
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,625
and lowering
your expectations in there,

400
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,542
so you had nowhere to go
but up,

401
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,084
and now
they probably treat you
with kid gloves a bit,

402
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,625
sort of "Rah rah,"
you know,

403
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,250
whenever you do
anything positive,

404
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:18,584
you know, because now
you're a special case:

405
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,001
a problem child
in constant recovery.

406
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:23,584
I don't know.
I'm just...riffing.

407
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,917
Do you
want to get married?

408
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,584
I'm close, huh?

409
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,667
And would you believe
I'm only in my sixth year?

410
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,750
No, I mean it.

411
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,292
Right. Right.

412
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,542
Look, I'm going to get
a membership, by the way,

413
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,500
increase your sales record
by 500% so you don't--

414
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,417
What's going so great
in your life?

415
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,250
Pardon me?

416
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,292
I mean,
aren't you lonely?

417
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,292
What?

418
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,417
Sure, yeah. Isn't every--

419
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,333
So why not take a shot?

420
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,250
Half of all marriages
end in divorce anyway.

421
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,834
We'd probably have
as good a chance
as anyone.

422
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,625
Is this,
like, a thing you do?

423
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,209
Like a joke?

424
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,333
No. I just like you.

425
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,001
You do?

426
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,084
Yes.

427
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:08,042
Well, I--

428
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,917
I like you, too.

429
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,709
You do?

430
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,375
Are you worried we wouldn't
be sexually compatible?

431
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,250
What?

432
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,917
Is that
what's holding you back?

433
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,084
Holding me back? No.

434
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,375
I think
what's holding me back

435
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,500
is that I don't know you
at all.

436
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,500
I think you know
so much about me.

437
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,876
We've been talking
for, like, six hours,

438
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,292
and you just summed up
my life in 20 seconds.

439
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,459
Six hours? I can't--

440
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,126
Oh, my God.

441
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,417
Yeah.

442
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,542
Wow.

443
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,542
I know.

444
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,709
Wow.

445
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,667
What?

446
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,168
No. No.
I-- I-- I just, uh--

447
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,876
Are you saying
just give it a whirl,

448
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,792
just why not because
everyone's so miserable
together anyway,

449
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,417
or becomes miserable,

450
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,667
that if we can enjoy
six hours, then maybe we'd--

451
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,750
No.
This is just a joke, right?

452
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:55,750
Because-- Because--

453
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,625
Because
this is fucking crazy.

454
00:16:57,709 --> 00:16:59,333
I mean, this is what takes
people four,

455
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,500
five, six years
to figure out.

456
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:03,375
You know, living together
and going into therapy

457
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,542
and then talking
about goals and--

458
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,459
How old are you?
What?

459
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,834
How old are you?

460
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,584
Uh, how old do you, uh--

461
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,168
how old do you think I am?

462
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,417
I don't know. 34.

463
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,001
Uch. Great. That's--
Thanks a lot.

464
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,625
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
Terrific.

465
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:19,917
I'm sorry.
I'm terrible at this.

466
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,333
Sorry. How old are you?

467
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,500
33.

468
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,876
You're 33?

469
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,250
Yeah, I'm 33.

470
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,250
Okay!

471
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,876
What? What are you--
What are you getting at?

472
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,459
That I can't
afford to hold out

473
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,417
and go through
the normal channels

474
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,625
because I'm-- I'm older?

475
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,209
What are
the normal channels?

476
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,417
Okay, the normal channels

477
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,542
are, like,
dinner and the movies

478
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,584
and, you know, meeting
each other's parents.

479
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,375
Do you want
to meet my parents?
No, that's--

480
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,917
Oh, you would
love my parents.

481
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:44,917
Should I call them?

482
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,084
Should I call them
right now?

483
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:46,834
They'd
love to meet you.

484
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,542
Why would they love--

485
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,417
Oh, I just think
that they would love you.

486
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:52,959
You do?

487
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, I do.
I really do.

488
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:20,126
So do you want to have sex?
What?

489
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,542
Just to, you know,
make sure that works.
Uh, what-- what--

490
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,584
It's the one
thing we should
really find out

491
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,042
if we're
going to get married.

492
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,126
You don't-- Excuse me.

493
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,542
Don't worry.
I'm on the pill

494
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,709
if that's what you're
worried about.

495
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,959
No, that's not what I'm--

496
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,209
that's not
what I'm worried about.

497
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,292
I think I have
some condoms here.

498
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,126
I'm worried about that,
but that's not--

499
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,042
that's not the first thing
I'm worried about.

500
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,584
I mean, there's a whole host
of-- of concerns here.

501
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,084
Oh.

502
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,042
Oh, are you, um...

503
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,792
are you not attracted to me?

504
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,709
What? No.

505
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,834
No, you're not.

506
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,459
No, no.
I'm not saying no.

507
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,375
I'm-- I'm saying--
That's not what I'm
saying.

508
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,333
I'm saying y-- I--
of course I am.

509
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,709
Are you sure?

510
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,375
Yeah. Yes.

511
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,333
But you don't want
to have sex with me?

512
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,917
[moaning]

513
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,542
Mom! Dad! Are you here?

514
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,500
Ira? Is that you?
What are you doing here?

515
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,084
I need to talk to you guys.

516
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:16,333
Darling,
what are you doing?

517
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:17,876
Daddy and I have opera tickets.

518
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,168
Ira? What are you
doing here?

519
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,834
Well, I know
I'm unannounced,

520
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,042
but, uh, I guess
I should just say it.

521
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,250
I'm getting married.

522
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,542
[gasp]

523
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,333
Sy! Can you believe this?

524
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,042
Oh, we've been
waiting for this day!

525
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,250
And about time.

526
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,250
Where's Lea?

527
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,834
Where's my daughter-in-law?

528
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,084
Yeah, uh,
that's the thing.

529
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:37,209
Uh, different girl.

530
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,500
Not Lea.
I'm not marrying Lea.

531
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:39,500
What?

532
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:40,750
What are you
talking about?

533
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:41,917
Of course it's Lea!

534
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,500
No, I'm not really crazy
about Lea

535
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,709
in that way anymore.

536
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,625
Since when are you not
crazy about Lea?

537
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,459
Since I don't know.
A long time.

538
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,625
We've really become,
you know,

539
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,792
really
more like friends.

540
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,001
Well, how long?
I mean, what is this?

541
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,333
What about us?
We're crazy about Lea!

542
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,209
A wonderful girl.
Very bright--

543
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,625
Yes, yes. I realize you're
both very fond of Lea.

544
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,542
So you have been
cheating on our Lea

545
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,792
with some tramp,
somebody else--

546
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:03,959
No, no, not exactly.

547
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,250
Not until about an hour ago.

548
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,584
Have you
been drinking?

549
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:07,584
No.

550
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:08,500
I told you.

551
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,168
He never should have
stopped the Paxil.

552
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,709
Mom-- Mom--

553
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,001
Unbelievable. This is
making me nauseous.

554
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:14,250
I have to throw up.

555
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,168
No, no, no.
I know it sounds crazy,

556
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,209
but I, uh, I fell in love
a little bit today,

557
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,168
kind of at first sight,

558
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,584
and, um...
I'm going with it,

559
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,834
so I'd like you both
to be happy for me,

560
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,375
but it's okay
if you're not

561
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,333
because I'm the one
that needs to be happy.

562
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,584
I wish for your happiness,

563
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,375
but, you know,
it's not my thing--

564
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,292
Well, you know what I mean.
You're therapists.

565
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,042
Analysts.
We're analysts.

566
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,500
Whatever, Dad.

567
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,834
Half the world doesn't
know the distinction,

568
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,209
but whatever.

569
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,209
Ira, don't disrespect
your father.

570
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,584
Mom, I'm 33.

571
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,542
I think a little healthy
barb now and again--

572
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,750
You know what?
I'm not going to do this.

573
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,168
I'm having a great day.

574
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,709
I would love for you both
to come to my wedding.

575
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,917
We would love you to come,
Abby and me.

576
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,042
Her name's Abby.
Isn't that a great name?

577
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:55,209
Abby.

578
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,375
Abby and Ira.

579
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,625
Her parents
have a brownstone

580
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,834
with an outdoor patio,

581
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:00,667
so it'll be small
but tasteful.

582
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,042
We're going to write
our own vows.

583
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,459
That's about it.

584
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,168
She's downstairs.

585
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:12,792
I can't believe this.

586
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:14,042
Ohh...

587
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:15,584
How can you do this to me?

588
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,792
Oh, come on.

589
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,542
You're killing me, Ira!

590
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,250
You're killing me!
Mom, please.

591
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,500
And I said to her,
"Don't walk out
that door."

592
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:23,750
And what did she do?

593
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,001
She walked
out the door,

594
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,292
and that was the last
time I ever saw her.

595
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,542
Oh, God, Tony, I'm so--

596
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,126
Jesus, I said
I wouldn't do this.

597
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,584
[Mrs. Black]
Tony.

598
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,584
Tony?

599
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,959
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Black.

600
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,333
I didn't realize
you were there.

601
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,834
You must be Abby.

602
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,168
Yes. Oh, it's so
wonderful to meet you.

603
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,375
Ira said you had
a way with people.

604
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,084
Yes, we have tickets
for<i> Tosca.</i>

605
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,625
We'll talk in the cab.
Oh.

606
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,792
Now, Abby, I'm sure
you're very nice.

607
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,042
I'm
sure you mean well,

608
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:50,292
but marriage
is not something

609
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,292
to be taken lightly.

610
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,542
I don't take it lightly.

611
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,459
I just have a good
feeling about this.

612
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,417
Sweetheart, it isn't
about feelings.

613
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,625
Marriage
is a contract.

614
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:57,834
It isn't about feelings?

615
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:58,834
Marriage isn't about feelings?

616
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,667
No, it is.
Of course it is.

617
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,168
Yeah, it's about feeling
terrible and criticized.

618
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,084
Sy, don't start.

619
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,750
But, Abby,
why Ira?

620
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:07,625
Mom--

621
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,333
Why would you
want to marry Ira?

622
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,834
I find him adorable.

623
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:12,001
But why?

624
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,333
I don't know. Just--

625
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,375
I like his face, you know?

626
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,625
I like looking at it.

627
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,959
He's neurotic,
he's picky.

628
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,667
Mom--
He's very
high-maintenance.

629
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,709
And you're a walk
in the park?

630
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,417
I'm not talking
about me.
Maybe we should.

631
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,750
Sy, enough.

632
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,084
How long have you two
been married?

633
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,084
33 years.

634
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,333
Wow.

635
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,333
Long,
difficult years.

636
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,625
Can we pull over
right here?

637
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,209
You two need
to know the truth.

638
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,459
It's no picnic.

639
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,750
Were you in love
in the beginning?

640
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,084
Not so much.
No.

641
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,001
What? I thought
you were madly in love.

642
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,959
It's what we told you
when you were younger.

643
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:38,959
It made you happy.

644
00:22:39,042 --> 00:22:40,209
You were never in love?

645
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,126
That's--
That's depressing.

646
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,333
That's why we
didn't tell you.

647
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,667
You learn to love.

648
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,917
You learn to love

649
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,459
because you're stuck
with each other.

650
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,625
Ah, not stuck.

651
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,250
Uh, hinged.

652
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,292
Hinged.

653
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,500
You're hinged together

654
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,584
so that you can
still move a little,

655
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,417
but at the end
of the day,

656
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,459
you're
always together
for good and bad.

657
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,584
Sometimes
it's good.

658
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,792
Sometimes
it's very bad.

659
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,459
It hasn't been
so bad, Arl.

660
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,042
It's been bad, Sy.
Trust me, Abby.

661
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:04,959
What was, like,
the worst time ever?

662
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:07,001
Ha ha ha!
When he cheated on me.

663
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:07,876
Oh!
What?

664
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,834
Here we go.
You cheated on Mom?

665
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,375
This is
ancient history.

666
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,750
With one of my
patients.

667
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,042
Oh, my God.
That's so<i> Sopranos.</i>
Dad, that's awful.

668
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,542
She was terminating
with you.

669
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,876
Yes. Three months
later.

670
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,126
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Black.

671
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:21,792
Thank you, Abby.
Call me Arlene.

672
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,625
It's like having
your heart torn open.

673
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:25,001
You can't imagine
the pain.

674
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,584
You cheated on me, too.

675
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,750
Before we were married.
It's completely different.

676
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,333
Two weeks before.
It's not
so different.

677
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,542
You cheated on Dad
two weeks before the wedding?

678
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,750
I was young.
I was scared.
I was pregnant.

679
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:35,876
What?

680
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:36,959
Did you have the baby?

681
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,792
Of course. It was Ira.

682
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,542
You were pregnant with me
before you got married?

683
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,459
Darling, we've been
married 33 years.

684
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,084
Your birthday's
next month.

685
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:47,375
You do the math.

686
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,459
I never put that together.

687
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,709
So you married
for Ira.

688
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,792
We married for Ira.

689
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:56,250

00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,500
I called them
on Tony's
cell phone.

712
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,959
Sweetheart,
get the champagne.

713
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,168
It's all ready.

714
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,709
So this is
very exciting.

715
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,250
When did all this
come together?

716
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,126
Just today. Can we
do it out back?

717
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:45,917
Oh, darling, of course.
It'll be beautiful.

718
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,876
Hey, what are you going
to do about music?

719
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,417
Ira, my parents
are really talented.

720
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,333
Can they do a number
at the ceremony?

721
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,542
We just won the Clio
for our Snapple spot.

722
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,834
That's like the Oscar
for commercials.

723
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,750
Yes, but we don't
like to mention it.

724
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,667
Oh, Dad, you got
the good stuff out.

725
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,667
Thank you.

726
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,917
This is a good year.

727
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,168
Of course
they all are.

728
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,667
All right,
hear, hear.

729
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,168
If you two are half
as happy as we have been,

730
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,126
you're going to be
the luckiest two kids around,

731
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,126
let me tell you.

732
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,292
Oh, sweetheart.
Thank you.

733
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,292
Cheers.

734
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,709
Yes, indeed.

735
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:21,126
Well, welcome,
welcome, welcome.

736
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,209
Ah!

737
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,459
Don't you want to ask me
any questions?

738
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,126
Like what?

739
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:29,417
Ira's getting a Ph.D.

740
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,750
Hey, that's terrific.

741
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,917
Lynney,
Ira's getting a Ph.D.

742
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,126
That's terrific.

743
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,042
You know, Michael
used to be an attorney.

744
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:37,667
Is that right?
Yes, siree.

745
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,917
If you ever need
a quickie divorce,
I'm your man.

746
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,333
Dad.
Sweetheart,
I'm kidding.

747
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,459
Look, Mr. Willoughby--

748
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,542
Please call me Michael
or Dad.

749
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,417
Michael, uh, I realize

750
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,459
that this all seems
very, uh, sudden, so--

751
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:50,959
Let me tell you something.

752
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,209
Every good thing in life
comes all of a sudden.

753
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:54,792
Hits you
like a ton of bricks.

754
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,001
Am I right, Lynney?

755
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:57,959
Like a bolt of lightning,
Scooby.

756
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,917
Like a thunderbolt.
It's always the way.

757
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:06,959
Good night.

758
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:07,959
Just one more.

759
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:08,959
Okay.

760
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:09,959
Good night.

761
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,001
Good night.

762
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,333
Hey, George,
I'm getting married.

763
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,667

No.

Yeah.
Marriage is a big deal.

It's a great apartment.

<i>like even
if we're exhausted</i>

831
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,959

has the flu or a rash

that we still just
have to have sex every day,

00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:40,500
like a pact.

836
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,042
Would that
be okay with you?

837
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:46,333
Yeah. That would be, uh--
[exhales]--

let me understand.

People pay you just to
sit there and listen
and not say anything?

904

They do.

00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:49,292

It sounds amazing.

in our field

both have big hearts.

Doesn't she, Lynney?

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,500
It is very nice,
come to think of it.

925
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,834

do voice-overs like us

1051
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,667
Oh, baby.
No, no, no, no.

1052
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,417
You can't be asleep.
We have to have sex.

1053
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,042
It's 11:58.
Eleven--

1054
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,292
Hey, Ab!
In here, sweety.

1055
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,917
I'm sorry.
Class was really crazy today,
and they kept me over.

1056
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:06,250
Oh, no worries, baby.
These are our neighbors.

1057
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:09,084
This is, um--
This is Mrs. Stiplicky
from 4M.

1058
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:12,042
Do you know Harry? Harry.
Harry Goldfarb, 3B.
How are you?

1059
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,667
Ow!
I'm sorry.

1060
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,750
Ab, can' t you
just use scissors?
Sorry.

1063
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,834
Dr. Friedman.
Ira.

1064
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,876
How are you today?
What are you doing here?

1065
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,917
I thought I made myself clear.
Oh, you did, you did.

1066
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,792
I just wanted to stop by
and thank you so much
for what you did for me

1067
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:58,375
and tell you
that I am doing great.

1068
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,542
I'm a changed man!

1069
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,917
I got married a few weeks ago.
Married. Me.

1070
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:05,250
Oh, not to Lea.
Not to Lea.
I met this amazing girl.

1071
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,667
I went with my gut,
took a leap, and I
am feeling terrific.

1072
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,792
Like a new man.
Laid-back, no anxiety.

1073
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,792
I'm having fun!
I'm having so much fun!

1074
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,333
We have sex-- great sex--
all the time.

1075
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,542
No more issues there.
What do you know?

1076
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,375
You were right, Dr. Friedman.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, and God bless you.

1077
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,792
I thought
you should know.

1078
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:28,292
Good luck, Ira.
I hope there isn't a catch.

1079
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:37,500
Hi. Can we have
the combo, please?
Large and large.

1080
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,876
Sure. What kind of soda
would you like with that?

1081
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,209
A root beer.
Root beer, please.

1082
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,750
Aw.
[chuckles]

1083
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:44,375
Want to save seats?
You want me to go?

1084
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:45,667
Sure.
Okay. I'll go.

1085
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,292
Thank you so much.

1086
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,292
Have a good time.
Thank you.

1087
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,834
How much do I owe you?
Uh, 12.50.

1088
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,750
Wow. That's, uh--
Do you have a payment plan?

1089
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,625
Hi. Are we sure
this is diet, 'cause--
No.

1090
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,667
Ira.

1091
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:04,876
Ira.
Lea! Hey.

1092
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,250
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

1093
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,042
Hi.
[stuttering]
Hi.

1094
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:10,459
I didn't see you there.
Oh, really?

1095
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,459
'Cause I saw you
turn away.

1096
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:15,959
[stuttering]
It's all right.
This is, um, awkward.

1097
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,168
Yeah. This is--
Yeah.

1098
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,375
Got enough there or--
Loading up?
What? Oh.

1099
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,001
Yeah. Abby ordered.
She's a big eater.

1100
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:23,792
Oh, Abby.
That's your new, uh--

1101
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:27,542
Wife. Yeah.
Yeah. Wife.

1102
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,917
God, that sounds
pretty weird.

1103
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,542
Pretty weird.
So, how's it going?

1104
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,333
Good. Great.
Good. Great.

1105
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:37,417
Great.
Great again.

1106
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,417
Really love being married.
Mm-hmm.

1107
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,292
Who would've thunk?
Yeah. Not me.

1108
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,459
So-- Hmm.
[nervous chuckle]

1109
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,333
Cheers. Excuse me.
Yeah. Mazel.

1110
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:49,500
So where is she?
I gotta say I am
really curious to--

1111
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:52,042
Oh, she's, uh-- She's--
She's saving seats.

1112
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:54,876
She in your PhD program?
Is that how you guys--
No.

1113
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,500
No? I just assumed,
because let's face it, Ira,

1114
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,292
it's not like you
really need a lot of--
Yeah.

1115
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,876
But-- No?
Yeah, but... no.

1116
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,542
So what does she do?
Well, she's, um--

1117
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,084
Sh-- She's in sales.
Uh-huh.

1118
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:10,834
You know, uh,
corporate stuff.
Big deals.

1119
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:14,042
Big deals.
Wow. Corporate dynamo.

1120
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:15,876
That is... great.

1121
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,834
Look, Leah, I am--

1122
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,001
I'm so sorry about--

1123
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,834
What, about
the break-up message?

1124
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,292
Or about the marrying
somebody else

1125
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,876
after you convinced me
to stay with you four times
this year alone

1126
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,876
because you needed more time
to figure things out?

1127
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,084
Or are you sorry, Ira,
about-- what was it?
The, uh--

1128
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,876
Oh, yeah.
The intermittent
erectile dysfunction?

1129
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,084
Or the endless evenings
with your parents?

1130
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:40,250
Or-- [stammering]
You know what? Don't--
Don't say anything,

1131
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:44,042
because I should
be thanking you, Ira,
because I am so much bet--

1132
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,834
Babe, it's about to start.
Oh, hey, babe. Okay.

1133
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,250
Here. Here.
Seth.

1134
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,250
Ira.

1135
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,084
Ira? As in--

1136
00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:53,209
Yeah. The Ira.

1137
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,459
Wow!
Mmm.

1138
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:57,042
You are not what I pictured.

1139
00:41:57,126 --> 00:42:00,292
Oh?
Wait. How long were you
guys together again?

1140
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,500
Oh, we were off and on
for about--

1141
00:42:02,584 --> 00:42:03,876
Nine years.
Nine--

1142
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,126
Right.
About nine years.

1143
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:08,209
Wow!
[laughs]

1144
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,209
Well, babe, we should
probably, uh--
Okay, babe.

1145
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:12,126
Are you guys seeing
the Rwanda documentary?

1146
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,750
Oh, um, no.

1147
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,667
[stammering]
We already saw it.

1148
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,168
Oh. Was it amazing?

1149
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,709
Uh, yeah. I mean, you know,
it's as amazing
as those things can be.

1150
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,625
It's very--
It's really powerful.

1151
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,209
We both--

1152
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,375
Both of us--
We both loved it.

1153
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:32,292
Great. Okay, well,
nice to, you know.

1154
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,709
Yeah, nice to, uh--
nice to, uh-- Enjoy--
Enjoy the film.

1155
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:36,375
I mean, as much
as you can enjoy--

1156
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:37,834
[chuckling]
Stop.

1157
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:41,834
Nice to meet you, babe.
Babe.

1158
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,917
I want to see it
three more times
in the theater.

1159
00:42:57,001 --> 00:42:59,375
And I don't want
to wait for it
to be out on DVD.

1160
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,375
Wasn't it good?

1161
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:03,542
What are you trying for?

1162
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,876
What?
I mean, you know,

1163
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,209
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1164
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,084
Oh.
[laughs]
I don't know. I don't know.

1165
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:13,667
Maybe I should be a therapist
like your dad said.

1166
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,917
Oh. That'd be great.
You'd probably just become one
just like that.

1167
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,168
No class, no studying.
Just open up shop

1168
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,126
and people would
come in droves,
pay whatever you want.

1169
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:24,667
Probably win an award.

1170
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,959
That's mean.
No.

1171
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,542
Honey, no.
I'm just saying you--

1172
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,542
you have such a way
with people.

1173
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,459
No. You were saying
I don't work hard

1174
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,459
or try for things
or have any direction,

1175
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:38,126
and you resent it.
I did not say that.

1176
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,750
You implied it.
Well, maybe I implied

1177
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,834
all the rest of that stuff
but not that I resent it.

1178
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,250
Do you resent it?
No, sweetie.

1179
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,876
No.

1180
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,500
A little.
I do a little.

1181
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:52,042
[scoffs]
Sorry.

1182
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:55,417
No, I'm just saying,
don't you have something
you always wanted to do?

1183
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,792
Like a career?
No.

1184
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,876
Oh, come on.
Selling memberships
at a health club--

1185
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:02,001
or should I say
deterring people
from buying memberships--

1186
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:04,250
can't be the grand plan,
the life plan.

1187
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,168
Why can't it?
Well, I mean-- What do you mean?

1188
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,375
You mean, like work your way up
to manager of the gym?

1189
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:12,001
No, I just mean work
at some job that you like
and make enough money to live.

1190
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,792
Why can't that be the plan?
I don't know. I mean,

1191
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:15,500
don't you want
to be something?

1192
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:16,917
I am something.

1193
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:19,042
No, of course.
Of course.

1194
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,542
What if I just wanted
to be your wife?

1195
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,917
That fancy enough?

1196
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,792
[Man]
So, Ira,
you're having a problem

1197
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,209
with what you perceive
to be Abby's lack of ambition?

1198
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,709
No, no. It's just--

1199
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,959
Well, she's a smart
and talented girl

1200
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,625
who could do anything,
and she-- she--

1201
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,917
You know she went to NYU?
I went for a year.

1202
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,917
Mm-hmm.
How did you feel about that?

1203
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:46,834
Fine.
I didn't like it.

1204
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,084
Now, Ira,
you're not fine with it?

1205
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:53,209
No, um, it-- it's fine.
It's just--

1206
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,417
Well, as you know, Doctor,
all the studies say

1207
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,834
couples should be
two autonomous individuals
who coexist--

1208
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:03,959
never dependent on one another,
just in each other's spheres.

1209
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:07,959
Abby, do you feel like
you're<i> dependent</i> on Ira?

Abby's dependency issues?

Yeah.

the, uh, rubber band theory
and, uh, the magnet one.

Salvation Army--

1369
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,084
Salvation Army.
Uh, whores and pimps.

1370
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:07,084
Ooh, that was a very good year.
And the members of KISS.

1371
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,250
Oh, that makeup
took forever.
[laughs]

1372
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,542
The Rat Pack.
I was Sammy Davis.

1373
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,584
Hey, babe.
[Abby] I was Dean Martin.

1374
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:16,084
That's eight, plus today.

1375
00:52:16,168 --> 00:52:18,667
So nine.
[Michael]
I think you're forgetting one.

1376
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,292
I've got the album.
Well, check it out.

1377
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:21,792
It's right in there.

1378
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:23,375
Oh,<i> Grease!</i>

1379
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:25,792
I had forgotten.
[Michael]
See? Ten.

1380
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:29,292
Who are these guys?
Oh, that's Gus,

1381
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,126
Abby's first husband,

1382
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:33,042
and that's Ron,
her second.

1383
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:35,042
[chuckling]

1384
00:52:35,126 --> 00:52:36,625
Is that a joke?

1385
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:38,250
[Lynne]
Oh.

1386
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,417
Mmm.

1387
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:44,876
Honey?

1388
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,333
Ron and Gus?

1389
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:57,959
Ron and Gus?

1390
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:03,168
Dr. Friedman was right.

1391
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,168
[Lynne] I'm sorry.
We thought he knew.
Mom, it's okay.

1392
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,209
[Ira]
Oh, no, it's okay.
It's fine. It's no big deal.

1393
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,417
It just makes our marriage
a big lie, but, you know,
no problem.

1394
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,168
I know this looks awful.
You think?

1395
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,417
I know it's so bad, but--
but they were--
they were dumb mistakes.

1396
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,792
I was really young,
and I-- I--

1397
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,959
I have a hard time
saying no to people.

1398
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,625
So you marry them? What else
have you lied about, Ab?
No.

1399
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,584
I didn't lie. I mean,
you-- you didn't ask.

1400
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:28,001
Oh, come on.
And if I thought to ask,
if I thought to say,

1401
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,292
"Gee, baby, how many times
have you been married before"--

1402
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,168
Then I would've told you.
Great. And did you think

1403
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,500
that I would be thrilled?
No, I just

1404
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:38,042
hoped that by the time
you found out, you'd love me,
and it wouldn't matter.

1405
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:40,250
Why should it matter?
It's only two husbands.

1406
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,250
Come to think of it, I
don't know if that's true.
Is there any more in there?

1407
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:46,876
Should I keep flipping through?
Maybe I'll find
three through six.

1408
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:49,084
Are they numbered on the back?
There were only two.

1409
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:52,292
Only two, huh?
Great news.

1410
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:55,500
Did they all have
nice ceremonies out back
just like ours?

1411
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:57,500
Just Ronnie.

1412
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:59,709
Oh. Ronnie.

1413
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:01,417
Now Ron's Ronnie.

1414
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,625
Well, why on earth
did you divorce Ronnie, Abby?

1415
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:07,168
He looks pretty hot here
as Danny Zuko.
Did you like his face too?

1416
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,417
No, I didn't. I mean, I don't
know.
Then what happened?

1417
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,168
If you have such a hard time
saying no to people,
what happened?

1418
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,625
Why'd you get a divorce?
Did he find out you were
an ex-con or something?

1419
00:54:16,709 --> 00:54:19,709
What happened, Ab?
Why'd you get a divorce?
That's what I want to know.

1420
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,959
Why didn't you--
Why did you get a divorce, Ab?

1421
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:23,042
[door slams]

1422
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,417
They got a divorce
because Ron cheated on her.

1423
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,417
Gus cheated on her too
with one of her bridesmaids.

1424
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,209
Well, why are they
still in the album?

1425
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,168
I just like the pictures.

1426
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:44,292
[footsteps approaching]

1427
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,042
Honey--

1428
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,792
I'm sorry I got
so crazy.

1429
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,292
No, I'm so sorry.

1430
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:02,667
I'm so sorry.
[crying]

1431
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:09,042
Hey. Hey.
It's 11:00. It's 11:00.

1432
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,250
Let's not mess up
our perfect record, okay?

1433
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:12,459
Really?
Yeah, really.

1434
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,959
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.

1435
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:15,917
Okay.

1436
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:18,417
[laughing]

1437
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,417
Get those off.

1438
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,417
Turn the light off.
Okay.

1439
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,250
[both chuckle]

1440
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,250
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1441
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,126
[both muttering]

1442
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,625
Babe--
Just give me a second.

1443
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:37,625
Okay, sweetie.

1444
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,876
Do you want me to--
No, don't tug it.

1445
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:43,250
So, Ira, it seems you
can't accept the reality
of Abby's past relationships.

1446
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:46,084
No, I can. Of course I can.
I just can't eat or sleep,
that's all.

1447
00:55:46,168 --> 00:55:49,792
Or get an erection.
Hmm.

1448
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:51,792
Why we came.
I know, but just--

1449
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:54,792
And, Abby,
how does this make you feel?

1450
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:56,625
Well, bad.

1451
00:55:56,709 --> 00:55:58,625
I mean, it makes me
feel bad.

1452
00:55:58,709 --> 00:56:01,834
Like he regrets
marrying me or something.

1453
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,667
Ask him.

1454
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:06,042
Ask Ira, Abby.

1455
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:07,917
Okay.

1456
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:10,709
Um, Ira,

1457
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:14,042
do you regret
marrying me?

1458
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:16,459
Regret? No.

1459
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,417
Sweetie.
[chuckles]

1460
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,709
No, of course not.
[chuckles]

1461
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:25,042
I just--
You know, maybe

1462
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:27,209
things could've gone more slowly
without this taint,

1463
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:30,001
this false premise, you know,
which everything is based on.

1464
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:32,250
So, no, no matter what we do,
it's all wrong.

1465
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:34,292
It's like the shotgun wedding,
only instead of pregnant,

1466
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,750
we got two lied-about divorces,
so it can never be right again.

1467
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:38,625
It can never be right again.
I don't know.

1468
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:41,001
I mean, you didn't tell me
about Gus or Donnie.
Ronnie.

1469
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:42,333
Right.
That's my name.

1470
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:43,750
Oh, yeah?
I always loved that name.

1471
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,084
Oh. Well, thank you.
It's a nice ring to it.

1472
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:48,209
It's like someone
you want to know.
You know what I mean?

1473
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:50,584
I was actually named
after my great uncle,
the Honorable Judge Ronald.

1474
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,001
Really?
Look, the point is,

1475
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:53,625
she didn't tell me
about two ex-husbands.

1476
00:56:53,709 --> 00:56:55,084
That's big.
Okay, but, sweetie,

1477
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,459
that was back when we
were getting married,
before I loved you.

1478
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:59,459
You didn't love me when we got
married?
I didn't know you.

1479
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,417
We only knew each other a week.
It was a leap.

1480
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,667
God, I hate the way you get
totally reasonable
in a crisis situation.

1481
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,834
I mean, do you see
what I'm dealing with here?
I mean-- Ahh!

1482
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:08,417
It's so infuriating,
because it's not like her.

1483
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,333
I mean, she's like
a "head in the clouds,
live for the moment" girl.

1484
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:14,250
And now she's-- she's--
[stammering]
I don't know what she is.

1485
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:17,250
I mean, that's the point, man.
What was I thinking when I said
I would marry you?

1486
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:21,500
I think you thought
I was cute and smart,
and you liked that I liked you.

1487
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:23,709
You did like me, right?

1488
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:25,500
Right off the bat?
I liked you right off the bat.

1489
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:27,375
Me too.
I liked you too.

1490
00:57:27,459 --> 00:57:29,292
And I had
a really good feeling
about everything.

1491
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,667
Me too. I had a really
good feeling about everything.

1492
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,209
And for me, it just--
it got... better

1493
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:37,292
and better every day
that I knew you.

1494
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:41,292
Me too. Every new thing
every new thing
was, like, fuck!

1495
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,709
How did I get this lucky?
Me too.

1496
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,168
I mean, you know,
what are the odds

1497
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,834
that two strangers,
basically, could get married

1498
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:51,834
and then fall...
totally in love
with one another?

1499
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,375
Are you totally
in love with me?

1500
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:58,792
Um,

1501
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,959
I don't really know.

1502
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,417
I guess not.

1503
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:13,876
Are you totally
in love with me?

1504
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,792
Yes.

1505
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:33,876
I'm sorry.

a chin implant

around your mouth a little bit

so that it matches
the rest of your new face,

1795
01:12:53,584 --> 01:12:57,042

it's pretty much maintenance.

01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:15,667
Could you just
give me a sec?

1866
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,584
Just give me
one second.

1867
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,042
Sir?
Hi, do you have any cash?

1868
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:30,126
Oh, thank you
so much.

1869
01:16:30,209 --> 01:16:32,333
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1870
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:34,333
Hey, thank you.

1871
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:36,084
Thank you so much.

1872
01:16:36,168 --> 01:16:39,084
Oh, thanks--

1873
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:41,500
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1874
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:46,126
Hey, babe.
Hey, you guys.

1875
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:47,667
You wanna go next?

1876
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,959
Yeah.
Yeah. Rock and roll.

1877
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,333
Oh, great.
Excuse me.
Thanks a lot.

1878
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,042
I'm so glad you're here.

1879
01:16:53,126 --> 01:16:55,001
Mmm.

1880
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:57,292
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
This will just take a second.

1881
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,959
Take a second...
[echoes]

1882
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:00,459
[cheering, whooping]

1883
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:06,667
Abby, no!

1884
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,459
[phone rings]

1885
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:09,959
Abby, no!

1886
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,084
Ah, shit.

1887
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:20,625
[ringing continues]

1888
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:22,001
Hello?

1889
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:23,500
Hello, Da--
Hey.

1890
01:17:23,584 --> 01:17:25,209
Hey, pop.
How are you?

1891
01:17:27,168 --> 01:17:28,459
What?

1892
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:31,792
No, I...
No, I haven't eaten.

1893
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:33,459
Why?

1894
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:37,917
So, uh, is Abby coming?
Should I save any of this?

1895
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:39,876
Oh, uh... no.
No.

1896
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:43,126
She's out late with a...

1897
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:46,834
She won't be coming.

1898
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:50,917
You all right?
You seem a little...

1899
01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:52,292
Preoccupied.
Oh, no. I'm fine.

1900
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:56,542
I just had weird...
Just...

1901
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:57,709
I don't know.

1902
01:17:57,792 --> 01:18:00,333
Can I get your professional
opinion on something?

1903
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:02,042
I don't like my
new guy that much.

1904
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:04,333
Sure. What's on your mind?

1905
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:09,042
Well, what's your advice
dealing with jealousy
bordering on obsession?

1906
01:18:09,126 --> 01:18:11,625
Are you still on
that Gus and Ronnie thing?

1907
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:13,333
Come on, Ira.
You've gotta get past that.

1908
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:14,876
No, I just--
It's not just them.

1909
01:18:14,959 --> 01:18:17,001
It's a bigger
kind of jealousy.

1910
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:19,042
Of everyone, really.

1911
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:26,417
I mean, do you ever get
jealous if Mom, you know,
flirts with another man?

1912
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,250
Yeah, sure.

1913
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,625
You mean Michael?

1914
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:31,667
What?

1915
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,667
What do you mean?

1916
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,625
Come on.

1917
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:37,333
I drink.
I'm not blind.

1918
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:41,042
Right, yeah.

1919
01:18:41,126 --> 01:18:44,333
I guess I could see some...

1920
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:50,084
kind of flirtation.
You know, if I was
really looking for it.

1921
01:18:50,168 --> 01:18:52,584
Yeah, that's one
word for it, yeah.

1922
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:56,459
So, how do you...

1923
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:57,876
Are you...

1924
01:18:57,959 --> 01:18:59,667
Am I jealous?
Yeah, sure.

1925
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:00,792
Hurts like hell.

1926
01:19:00,876 --> 01:19:02,750
What can I do about it?

1927
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,542
I can yell and scream.

1928
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:07,417
I can go into therapy.
I can get a divorce.

1929
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,542
I can get even.

1930
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,834
Have an affair of my own.

1931
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:14,042
It helps.
You know, it does.

1932
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:17,750
Or I can just
wait it out, right?

1933
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,792
Those are my options.

1934
01:19:19,876 --> 01:19:21,500
But God, Dad, don't you...

1935
01:19:21,584 --> 01:19:22,625
want...

1936
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:24,084
What?

1937
01:19:24,168 --> 01:19:26,001
Safety?

1938
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:29,750
A guarantee that you're
always gonna know someone?

1939
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:32,042
That they're never
gonna leave you?

1940
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:34,959
That they're never gonna
find someone they like
better than you?

1941
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,959
Yeah, maybe.

1942
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:38,250
Yes.

1943
01:19:40,001 --> 01:19:41,333
Got news for you.

1944
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:43,126
You'll never get that.

1945
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:46,084
The best you can do is

1946
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:48,834
stack the deck,
build a history,

1947
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,292
logs the years,
have kids.

1948
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,667
It helps.
It all helps.

1949
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:57,333
Makes it more
difficult to leave.

1950
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,292
But you'll never
really know someone.

1951
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:03,459
God.

1952
01:20:03,542 --> 01:20:05,209
Dad...

1953
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:07,417
That's depressing.

1954
01:20:11,001 --> 01:20:12,500
That's why I drink.

1955
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,375
Hey.
Ira, hey.

1956
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:10,084
Lea, hi.

1957
01:21:10,168 --> 01:21:11,917
Hi.
What are you doing here?

1958
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,834
Oh, God,
this is so weird.

1959
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:15,834
I just-- I was trying
to e-mail you,

1960
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:17,042
and I just--
[stammers]

1961
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:20,042
I am going through stuff,

1962
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:23,584
and I wanted to see you,
and talk, and get some closure

1963
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:25,584
but I'm sure
this is a bad time, so...

1964
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,209
No, no, it's not.
It's fine.

1965
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:29,750
Yeah?
Well...

1966
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:33,126
Want to go to the diner
and get a cup of coffee?

1967
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:35,542
Is everything all right
with, um--

1968
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,168
Something going on
with that tall guy, Scott?

1969
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,792
Seth? No.

1970
01:21:38,876 --> 01:21:41,084
I mean... good.
We're good.

1971
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,709
No, I mean, it didn't--

1972
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:45,876
That's part of
the whole--

1973
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,001
I'm sorry.

1974
01:21:48,084 --> 01:21:49,667
Thanks, me too.

1975
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,042
Uh, how about you?

1976
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:53,250
How's your marriage,
and, uh, you know.

1977
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,250
Oh, it's--

1978
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,292
It's...

1979
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:01,876
You okay, Ira?

1980
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,584
Uh...

1981
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:07,959
Yeah.

1982
01:22:08,042 --> 01:22:09,500
Are you sure?

1983
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:11,959
Yeah.

1984
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:14,126
But you know what?
I, uh...

1985
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:17,250
I don't really feel like--
I feel like a drink, you know?

1986
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,917
Would you be up for that?
Not a coffee.

1987
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,250
No, okay.
Where to?

1988
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,876
Uh, let's go to that place
on 92nd that you like so much.

1989
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:25,250
Is that okay?
Yeah.

1990
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,667
What were we saying?
What were we talking about?

1991
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,042
You were telling me
how your marriage was.

1992
01:22:29,126 --> 01:22:30,042
Right, oh.
How is my marriage?

1993
01:22:30,126 --> 01:22:31,542
Right, right.
Well...

1994
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,168
Where to start,
where to start.

1995
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,709
We got divorced a while ago--

1996
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,084
You did?
And then we...

1997
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:37,459
That's terrible.
I'm sorry.

1998
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:38,876
I didn't know.
I...

1999
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:40,876
We've been so out of touch.

2000
01:22:40,959 --> 01:22:42,750
Yeah. Yeah, well...

2001
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:44,959
It's been awhile--

2002
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:48,876
Listen, I, um--
I have a great bottle of red

2003
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:52,001
at my apartment, if you--
do you want to just talk there?

2004
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:34,625
Listen to me
just droning on

2005
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,667
when we haven't even talked
about you and your divorce.

2006
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,709
What happened?

2007
01:23:37,792 --> 01:23:40,250
Oh...

2008
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:42,209
The short version is she's
still in love with her ex.

2009
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:43,834
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

2010
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:45,667
Yeah. Me too.

2011
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,001
Mmm.

2012
01:23:47,084 --> 01:23:48,209
But I guess
it's my fault, too.

2013
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:51,250
I didn't really--

2014
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:56,292
I didn't really
know her that well.

2015
01:23:56,375 --> 01:24:01,042
I guess you can't really know
someone unless you spend
a lot of years with them.

2016
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:04,542
Uh-huh. I mean,
that's exactly what
I was saying.

2017
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,917
God knows, I certainly
didn't know Seth.

2018
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:08,876
[laughs]

2019
01:24:31,459 --> 01:24:33,209
Fuck.

2020
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:34,209
What?

2021
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:36,625
Uh--
What's the matter?

2022
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:38,126
Look, Lea, I'm sorry.

2023
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:40,126
I can't--
What?

2024
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:43,834
I can't do this.
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.

2025
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:46,042
Look, Lea,
you're a great person--

2026
01:24:46,126 --> 01:24:48,042
Oh, my God.
But I'm still in love--

2027
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:50,292
I gotta go home.

2028
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,333
I gotta go home.
Okay.

2029
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:08,667
I want to know everything.

2030
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,542
Hi.

2031
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:33,959
Hey.

2032
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:35,126
Where were you?

2033
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:36,834
I was...

2034
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:39,209
I thought you were
gonna be late.

2035
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:40,292
Are you okay?

2036
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:44,168
Yeah.

2037
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,542
No. I don't know.

2038
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:48,917
I just, I-- uh...

2039
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:53,709
I really needed
to talk to you after
seeing Ronnie tonight.

2040
01:25:59,126 --> 01:26:00,500
Uh...

2041
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:03,542
Why?

2042
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:08,250
Okay, what happened?

2043
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,292
Well, he, um--

2044
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:16,667
He needed to see me
to make amends

2045
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,584
for cheating on me.

2046
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,876
He's in a 12-step program
He's a heroin addict.

2047
01:26:20,959 --> 01:26:22,667
He is? Oh, my God,
that's great!

2048
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,209
What?

2049
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:26,709
No, I mean, that's--
Wow, babe, that's heavy.

2050
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:28,917
But that's great
that he's getting help.

2051
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:30,792
Yeah.
Yeah.

2052
01:26:30,876 --> 01:26:34,500
Yeah, but it's just...

2053
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:37,292
It just brought up
all this stuff for me.

2054
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:41,084
You know? Just trust stuff
and old stuff,

2055
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:43,500
and I--

2056
01:26:43,584 --> 01:26:45,584
I just wanted to be with you.

2057
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,792
And when I got home
and you weren't here,

2058
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,750
and you didn't
come home, I just--

2059
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:51,792
I'm sorry.

2060
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:53,792
I love you.

2061
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,168
I love you, too.

2062
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,126
I love you so much.

2063
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,709
It's okay.
It's all right.

2064
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:04,417
[crying]

2065
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:12,834
So, then he ran out
because he's still
hung up on the ex-wife.

2066
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:14,834
Oh, you're kidding.
Oh, yes.

2067
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,834
It was so humiliating.

2068
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:19,042
We're kissing, he seemed
very into it.

2069
01:27:19,126 --> 01:27:20,209
I took off my clothes,

2070
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:21,459
and he bolted.

2071
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:22,792
Oh, my God.
I feel so guilty.

2072
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:24,709
I'm the one who told you
to call the back-up.

2073
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:27,292
No, no, no, no.
You told me to get closure.

2074
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,542
Not to have sex with him.

2075
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,625
It's just me.
I'm very vulnerable,

2076
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:32,876
and he seemed different.

2077
01:27:32,959 --> 01:27:33,876
I know.
I get it.

2078
01:27:33,959 --> 01:27:36,500
But you know what?
People don't change.

2079
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:39,542
And I never had
good sex with this guy.

2080
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:40,542
You're kidding?

2081
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:41,542
Never.

2082
01:27:46,168 --> 01:27:48,209
Oh, that's good.

2083
01:27:48,292 --> 01:27:50,126
Good stuff today.

2084
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:52,542
And to think I almost
got a face lift for him.

2085
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,333
No. Your face is beautiful.
It's original.

2086
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:56,584
Thank you.
I couldn't agree more.

2087
01:27:56,667 --> 01:27:58,126
I earned every one
of these wrinkles.

2088
01:27:58,209 --> 01:27:59,292
You go, Mommy.

2089
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,834
Listen, Abby doesn't know yet.

2090
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:02,417
Of course.

2091
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,333
Lynney, please.

2092
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:05,917
Can I just talk to you
for a minute?

2093
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:10,876
Lynney.

2094
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:12,042
[Arlene]
I mean, I had an affair
for the same reason

2095
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:14,250
you had an affair.
It was exactly
the same reason.

2096
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,500
I don't know why you
can't absolutely see
that point of view.

2097
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:18,542
I really don't
understand that.

2098
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:19,750
I'm afraid we're out of time.

2099
01:28:21,168 --> 01:28:22,542
Thank you.

2100
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,917
That was a great
first step, right, Cy?

2101
01:28:25,001 --> 01:28:26,959
Great step.
How much we owe you?

2102
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:28,625
I'm $400 an hour.

2103
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,459
Of course you are.
Cy.

2104
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:31,750
And I don't accept insurance.

2105
01:28:33,667 --> 01:28:38,625
[chatter]

2106
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:39,792
Hey, babe.

2107
01:28:39,876 --> 01:28:41,292
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, this is--

2108
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,500
Ira?
Lea!

2109
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:44,250
Wait--
[both]
You know each other?

2110
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,876
He's my husband.
He's the back-up.

2111
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:47,375
What did--
What?

2112
01:28:49,542 --> 01:28:52,126
Oh, my God, Ira.
How could you?

2113
01:28:52,209 --> 01:28:54,001
This is the guy
from last night?

2114
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:56,584
No. Nothing really happened.
We just--

2115
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,126
You told me
you were divorced.

2116
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,584
I did. I did,
and we were.

2117
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,542
Just not now.

2118
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:03,709
What?

2119
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:04,750
How could you?

2120
01:29:04,834 --> 01:29:06,542
Okay, okay, okay, babe.
I know this looks bad,

2121
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,542
but I saw you in
the diner with Ronnie, so--

2122
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,459
Wait, you saw me?
You were following me?

2123
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:11,750
No, I wasn't following you.

2124
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:13,709
Abby, I had no
idea that you were--

2125
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:14,667
Excuse me.

2126
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,209
Babe, babe, I wasn't
following you.

2127
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:18,667
I just--
You said she was
in corporate sales.

2128
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,500
Honey. Honey,
I had this horrible dream,

2129
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:21,750
and then I saw you
with Ronnie,

2130
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:23,459
and Ronnie's hot, Ab.

2131
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:25,042
He's tall and ripped,
and he's hot.

2132
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:26,584
So you cheated on me
because Ronnie's hot?

2133
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:27,625
You cheated on Abby?

2134
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:28,709
No.

2135
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:29,792
Ira, how could you?

2136
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:31,126
Daddy, what are
you doing here?

2137
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:34,667
I, uh, brought
your mother flowers.

2138
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:38,667
That's so nice.
That's so nice.
Do you see, Ira?

2139
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,667
Do you see what marriage
is supposed to be like?

2140
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,333
Sweet and loving
and thoughtful

2141
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:46,375
and-and honest,
and no one gets cheated on.

2142
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:50,834
Honey...your father and I
have something to tell you.

2143
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:56,750
Dr. Saperstein,
this is Dr. Silverberg.

2144
01:29:56,834 --> 01:29:57,959
Oh.

2145
01:29:58,042 --> 01:29:59,876
You've both been
so instrumental to me.

2146
01:29:59,959 --> 01:30:00,917
Oh, call me Aurora.

2147
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:02,417
Aurora. Oh.

2148
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,375
...if you were in session.

2149
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:06,168
Dr. Friedman, do you
know Dr. Goldman?

2150
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,959
Do you know Friedman,
Dr. Friedman?

2151
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:09,333
This is
a fucking nightmare.

2152
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:10,750
I am not sitting near you.

2153
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:11,709
Where do you want me?

2154
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:13,500
I understand you've been
seeing the man

2155
01:30:13,584 --> 01:30:15,292
who's been
screwing my wife.

2156
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:17,333
We met at Abby and
Ira's second wedding.

2157
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:18,917
Right. Great party.

2158
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:21,625
If I could
have everyone's
attention, please.

2159
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:22,834
I think we're ready
to get started,

2160
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,500
so why doesn't
everybody grab a seat

2161
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:26,667
or a Pilates ball.

2162
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,500
We'll just,
we'll jump right in.

2163
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:29,709
We'll get going.

2164
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:31,417
Uh, for those of you
who don't know,

2165
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,250
Ira cheated on Abby,

2166
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:37,209
and her parents are
deciding to separate.

2167
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:38,209
Wait a minute.

2168
01:30:38,292 --> 01:30:40,042
Ira cheated on Abby?

2169
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:41,126
Sort of.

2170
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:42,126
How can you
'sort of' cheat?

2171
01:30:42,209 --> 01:30:43,333
With Lea.
With Lea?

2172
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,292
How is she?

2173
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,584
Mom.
I'm just asking.

2174
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:46,584
Who's Lea?

2175
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,168
Ira, how could you?

2176
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,417
I mean, Abby's the best thing
to every happen to you.

2177
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,792
Thanks, Cy.

2178
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:51,625
Dad, you're the one
who said it'd help

2179
01:30:51,709 --> 01:30:52,584
to have an affair
of your own,

2180
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,292
along with some
other depressing--
What?

2181
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:55,834
I said it helped

2182
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,417
that your mother and I
both cheated, but--

2183
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
You've both cheated
on each other before?

2184
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,126
I only did before
we were married.

2185
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:02,417
A family of cheaters.

2186
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,709
Cheating is big with you.

2187
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,250
He cheated, too.
Because he met you.

2188
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:08,417
We were happy 32 years.

2189
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,084
Were we really happy, Mom?
Or did we just never
talk about anything?

2190
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:12,459
Is that what
you think, honey?

2191
01:31:12,542 --> 01:31:13,625
I don't know. Maybe.

2192
01:31:13,709 --> 01:31:15,584
I mean, how could you
let me marry Gus and Ronnie?

2193
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:16,584
Who are Gus and Ronnie?

2194
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:17,625
I thought
you'd like them.

2195
01:31:17,709 --> 01:31:19,209
Yeah, but what did I know?

2196
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:21,750
I was 19 years old with Gus,
and Ronnie was a drug addict.

2197
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:23,500
It's true.
They were losers.

2198
01:31:23,584 --> 01:31:25,084
God, I wish
I'd known that before.

2199
01:31:25,168 --> 01:31:29,250
Okay, let's get back
to the cheating.

2200
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:31,542
The 'sort of' cheating.

2201
01:31:31,625 --> 01:31:33,834
Ira, I thought
you had worked out

2202
01:31:33,917 --> 01:31:36,168
your resentment
about Gus and Ronnie

2203
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,584
prior to asking Abby
to remarry you.

2204
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:40,876
Well, I thought
I had, too.

2205
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:43,750
But I realized I hadn't
after the nightmare

2206
01:31:43,834 --> 01:31:45,375
I had yesterday
about the mugging.

2207
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,250
What nightmare?
What mugging?

2208
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:49,084
It was a while ago.
We were fine. It was nothing.

2209
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:52,168
Walking up to muggers
with guns is not nothing.

2210
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,876
One mugger, and I don't even
think it was loaded.

2211
01:31:53,959 --> 01:31:55,667
Honey, how do you know?
What, are you Kojak?

2212
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,667
I just had a feeling.

2213
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,459
That's what you
said about Ira.

2214
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:01,417
Look, the point is
she could've been killed.

2215
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,667
No, we made friends.

2216
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,834
Honey, you make friends
with everyone.

2217
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:06,333
With muggers and killers
and strangers on the street.

2218
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:08,542
You'd make
friends with Hitler if
he came in for a tour.

2219
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,292
Ira, it sounds to me
as if you have--

2220
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:11,292
Jealousy issues?

2221
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,709
God, you're good.

2222
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,292
And a great deal
of hostility.

2223
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,001
Do you have any idea
what might be

2224
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:18,042
at the root of
that hostility, Ira?

2225
01:32:18,126 --> 01:32:20,959
Yes, I'm married to someone
who's married to everyone.

2226
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:24,876
All right, Ira,

2227
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:27,542
what I think
I hear you saying

2228
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:31,750
is that you
have always doubted
Abby's love for you.

2229
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:34,042
No, not really.

2230
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:37,292
It's just been, you know,
sometimes hard for me

2231
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:40,834
to believe that she
loves me in particular.

2232
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:43,042
Even though
she married you.

2233
01:32:43,126 --> 01:32:44,333
Twice.

2234
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:46,126
Yes. Right.

2235
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:48,625
What is your relationship
like with your mother?

2236
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:50,042
Oy, here we go.

2237
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:51,834
It's, um, fine.

2238
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:52,834
It's fine.

2239
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:54,084
Although she never
liked me that much.

2240
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,084
Honey, how can
you say that?

2241
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,333
I gave you
everything I could.

2242
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:59,001
You're always
putting him down.

2243
01:32:59,084 --> 01:33:00,001
I am?

2244
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:01,959
Yes. Why do you think

2245
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:04,625
he has difficulty thinking
that people really like him?

2246
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:06,168
Lea liked him.

2247
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,417
Not really.
He was a backup.
They never had good sex.

2248
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,709
She told you that?

2249
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:11,917
So, Ira, your mother's
always been a bit critical.

2250
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:12,917
And judgmental.

2251
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,209
And overbearing.

2252
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:16,084
But that really changed
when she started

2253
01:33:16,168 --> 01:33:17,333
having the affair
with Michael.

2254
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,709
I don't want to
hear this anymore.

2255
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:21,959
That's so disappointing.
I worshipped you guys.

2256
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,333
I mean, how could you, Dad?

2257
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:25,375
I don't know, honey.
It's over now.

2258
01:33:25,459 --> 01:33:27,168
It certainly is.

2259
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,750
[sighs]

2260
01:33:30,168 --> 01:33:33,084
Jesus.

2261
01:33:33,168 --> 01:33:36,709
Why would anyone
wanna get married
if there are no...

2262
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:38,792
good marriages.

2263
01:33:38,876 --> 01:33:41,209
I mean,
what's the incentive?

2264
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:46,709
I think it
makes you try harder
to stay together.

2265
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:48,709
Not in our case.

2266
01:33:48,792 --> 01:33:51,584
It's easier, financially.

2267
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:54,625
No different from
living together.

2268
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:55,917
There are some
things with taxes, but--

2269
01:33:56,001 --> 01:33:58,459
Children are the reason.

2270
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,250
You do it
for your children,

2271
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:01,417
to set a good example.

2272
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,168
Look how well
that turned out.

2273
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:07,001
Maybe...

2274
01:34:07,084 --> 01:34:08,542
there is no reason.

2275
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:11,001
Except for a great party.

2276
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:13,750
Yeah, you know, maybe
marriage is just a fad.

2277
01:34:13,834 --> 01:34:16,584
That's had
an unusually long run.

2278
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:19,042
You know, some guy
came up with the idea
back in the day,

2279
01:34:19,126 --> 01:34:20,417
people went with it,
and now, you know,

2280
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,667
no one really
thinks about it anymore.

2281
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,126
They just...just do it...

2282
01:34:25,209 --> 01:34:29,917
because...because
everyone else does.

2283
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:30,959
Like bottled water.

2284
01:34:31,042 --> 01:34:33,459
Or man sandals.

2285
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:34,709
Or paying
complete strangers

2286
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:36,168
to solve your
personal problems.

2287
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,084
You know, I have to
take offense at that.

2288
01:34:38,168 --> 01:34:40,042
I'm sorry, Roland.
She didn't mean it.

2289
01:34:40,126 --> 01:34:41,917
You're just
sticking that to us.

2290
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:42,917
She's right.
She's right.

2291
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:44,209
The only reason
we make money

2292
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:46,168
is that people can't
talk to each other.

2293
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:48,792
Ab?

2294
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:50,667
Yeah?

2295
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:56,001
I'm really sorry
about the Lea thing.

2296
01:34:56,084 --> 01:34:58,959
No, I'm sorry I didn't
make you feel loved enough.

2297
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:00,417
Honey, honey,
it's not your fault.

2298
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,667
It's my mom's.
My fault.

2299
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:04,750
All right, I don't think
this is about assigning blame.

2300
01:35:04,834 --> 01:35:06,667
No, blame
can be liberating.

2301
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:07,917
I do think it's her fault.

2302
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:10,042
This is very
unprofessional.

2303
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:11,667
She has
ruined my life.

2304
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,250
Okay, I think we're all
a little hungry,

2305
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,834
so let me just
pass these around.

2306
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,333
This is not about
being hungry.

2307
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,959
That was really,
really unnecessary.

2308
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:20,459
You didn't have to
say that to me.

2309
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:23,959
It meant nothing?
Meant nothing?

2310
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:27,667
All that secret time
for the last 6 months
meant nothing?

2311
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:30,084
[everyone talking at once]

2312
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:45,209
I promise to finish
whatever I start.

2313
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:47,292
Eventually.

2314
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:48,876
Good one.

2315
01:35:48,959 --> 01:35:55,375
I promise never
to lie to you

2316
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:58,292
or not
tell you something,

2317
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,792
or not tell you
everything about
something.

2318
01:36:01,876 --> 01:36:05,333
Even if
it's really hard.

2319
01:36:05,417 --> 01:36:09,834
I promise to never,
ever go into therapy again.

2320
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:11,417
For any reason.

2321
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,126
Okay.

2322
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:18,750
I promise to
never marry you again

2323
01:36:18,834 --> 01:36:21,333
no matter how many
times you ask me.

2324
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:25,250
I promise
to love you...

2325
01:36:25,333 --> 01:36:27,917
and only you

2326
01:36:28,001 --> 01:36:29,834
as long as that's true.

2327
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:33,333
Me, too.

2328
01:36:33,417 --> 01:36:35,959
And I hope it's
a really long time, Ab.

2329
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:38,542
Me, too.

2330
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:49,750
Okay. All right.

2331
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:51,709
Me first, you first?

2332
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:53,292
You first.
Okay.

2333

I'm the plaintiff

2334
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:59,667
