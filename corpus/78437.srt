(. ''If I Had $ 1 000000'' 
 by Barenaked Ladies))

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,318
You know, you ever heard 
 someone say that old expression,

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,031
''Everything happens for a reason''? 
 Well, I don't think that applies to me.

4
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,825
I mean, I spend every morning 
 rushing to work

5
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,746
trying to catch the same subway 
 to the same lousy job.

6
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,164
What's the reason for that?

7
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,627
See, I'm a researcher for one of the 
 biggest publishing houses in Chicago,

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,712
but where I really belong is in Creative.

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,342
The problem is, is my boss doesn't 
 know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.

10
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,386
While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,639
''You gotta be optimistic. 
 You gotta be positive. ''

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,266
OK. OK. You know what?

13
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,769
Today is gonna be my lucky day. 
 Today is gonna be my...

14
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,064
- Aah! 
 - Oh! Wow!

15
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,109
- Hey, look at that, lt's your lucky day, 
 - Did you just see that?

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,151
Oh, l've seen it a million times,

17
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,611
- You want it? 
 - No,

18
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,281
l don't want it, Go ahead, 
 You got a new briefcase,

19
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,283
Yeah, maybe its got a name 
 on it or something,

20
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,743
- Oh, come,,, What are you, nuts? 
 - What?

21
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,370
- You're gonna return it? 
 - Yeah,

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,622
Did you not just say 
 you needed a new one?

23
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,124
Yeah, when l get my raise,

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,168
Haven't you been working 
 there for, like, a year?

25
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,628
l bet Taylor doesn't even know 
 you work there, l'd be pissed,

26
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:30,966
- Are you pissed? l'd be pissed, 
 - Yeah, l'm-l'm a little pissed,

27
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,303
You know, come to think of it, 
 l've never really seen you angry before,

28
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,929
Henderson, you ever 
 seen Tom really angry?

29
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,682
- No, 
 - All right, fine, So l don't get angry,

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,475
What is that, a bad thing?

31
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,104
lt's, you know, you keep it bottled up 
 and then sooner or later,

32
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,232
you come into work and you mow 
 everyone down with one of those,,,

33
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,485
- AK-47, 
 - AK-47, You know, just to impress, uh,,,

34
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,321
- Jodie Foster, 
 - Jodie Foster,

35
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,657
(chuckles)) All right, l'll do it 
 on your day off, all right?

36
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,287
(Paul) Touché, There she is, 
 lt's your Jodie Foster,

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,371
Paul, come on, man,

38
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,748
How you ever gonna get 
 to know her if you just sit there?

39
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
lt's Taylor's daughter, man, l can't just,,,

40
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,296
You can't just what? Huh? Are you 
 gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?

00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,716
Just go over there 
 and talk to her, Go, Go,

42
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,636
- OK, fine, l'm going, l'm going, 
 - You're going,

43
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,696
Excuse me,

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,281
Aah!

45
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,367
(baby crying))

46
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,703
(mouthing))

47
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,417
Hi, l'm--

Oh! Uh,,,

 - No one's taunting your dog, He--

56
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,487
Oh! Uh,,,

00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,614
Um, the-the d-- Um,,,

00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,743
Here, why don't you take my seat? Here,

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,873
Great, Now, that's great,

60
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,541
Two more minutes, and l'm gonna 
 be closer than you are,

61
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,209
Look, Opening, Go,

62
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,336

lt's OK, Go, just go,

65
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:43,599
(conductor) Lake Street. 
 Lake Street is next.

66
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,896
You're Tom Stansfield, right? 
 From Research?

67
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,900
Yeah, Yeah, Tom, Tom Stansfield,

68
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,116
Stansfield from Research,

69
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,704
lt's a growing sport, you know?

70
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,248
Paul, there is no way that she thought 
 that it was a wrestling magazine,

71
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,876
Oh, come on, Get over it, OK?

72
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,170
You're a little embarrassed, 
 lt happens, OK?

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,880
Let me tell you something, 
 lf l had a dime for every time

74
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,798
a gay naked magazine fell out of my,,, 
 l'm kidding, l'm kidding,

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,841
What? Paul!

76
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,635
No, But seriously, 
 so you're a little humiliated,

77
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,763
At least now we've established 
 that she knows who you are, right?

78
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,806
- l'm gonna have to leave the company, 
 - No, you're not,

79
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,183
Oh, God, There she is,

80
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,310
Oh, and l need to see the proofs 
 on Thailand immediately,

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,562
All right, What else have we got?

82
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,987
- Are you Tom? 
 - Yes,

83
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,116
- Mr, Taylor wants to see you, 
 - Oh,,, OK,

84
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,785
OK,

85
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,372
OK, you see? This is your chance, This 
 is fate, This is what l'm talking about,

86
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,458
lt's about that new opening in Creative 
 and you're the man for the job,

87
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,877
You're gonna go in there and you're 
 gonna pitch him those book ideas,

88
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,796
No, l just,,, l'm really not ready,

89
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,090
Let's get to business, 
 Now we're steppin' up, OK,

90
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,842
Come on, You're gonna go in there, 
 you're gonna pitch him an inside curve,,,

91
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,301
Wait, wait, Where is my blue folder?

92
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,595
You don't need it, Enough with 
 the excuses already, Come here,

93
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,181
- You look good, You feel good? 
 - l feel like l'm gonna throw up,

94
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,058
Well, that's good, 
 l want you to use that, OK?

95
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,227
What is this? This dad's? 
 lt's nice, Now get in there, OK?

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,105
- Don't-don't touch my ass, 
 - What? lt was a light spank, lt was light,

97
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,609
- Hey, 
 - Hey,

98
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,279
- Uh, do l just go in there? 
 - Um, no, He's not finished yet,

99
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,698
- but you can have a seat over there, 
 - Oh, OK,

100
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,367
Let me explain something 
 to you, Henderson,

101
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,831
l did not dislike your ideas, 
 l found them loathsome,

102
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,335
l hated them,

103
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,005
- You're dismissed, 
 - From your office?

104
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,132
Nice try,

105
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,972
- Good luck, You're gonna need it,,, 
 - He's ready to see you,

106
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,390
You can come in,

107
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,310
You know what? We should have 
 never let up after the Revolution!

108
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,812
Sit down, Sit down, Coffee?

109
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,983
We shouldn't have left you at toehold, 
 We should have driven you to the sea!

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,239
Now,,, what's this l hear 
 about you making threats

111
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,409
to spray this place with an AK-47?

112
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,494
What?

113
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,667
Oh, oh, oh, No, That,,, 
 l was just making a joke,

114
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,837
Oh, that's funny to you? 
 Killing everyone in this office?

115
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:25,636
No, No, No, no, no, no, The,,, 
 Paul said how l never get angry,,,

116
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,222
And what about you 
 making fun of midgets?

117
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,057
l never made fun of midgets,

118
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,434
You said it'd be fun to date one

119
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,561
because then you could rest 
 your beer on her head,

120
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,855
No, No, l never said anything like that,

121
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,775
Apparently Henderson thinks you did,

122
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,111
Now l've got a good sense of humor, 
 but that's just plain sick,

123
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,989
- But, sir, l didn't say,,, 
 - Audrey?

124
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,826
- Which file did l ask you for? 
 - Uh, the Platt file?

125
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,288
- John Platt, Not Sam Platt, 
 - l'm sorry, l guess l didn't think that,,,

126
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,123
That's right, You didn't think,

127
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,252
Now if it's not too much trouble, 
 if you could fetch me the right file,,,

128
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,546
- OK, 
 - And get Tom and me some doughnuts,

129
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,005
OK,

130
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,760
Now,,, l'm told you've been trying 
 to schedule a meeting with me

131
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:10,305
about some ideas, What are they?

132
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,310
Oh, uh,,, yeah, l had-l had some ideas,

133
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,566
- Something wrong with the coffee? 
 - Uh, no, lt's fine,

134
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,110
- Why'd you make a face? 
 - What?

135
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,488
Oh, well,,, lt's-it's a little bitter, but,,,

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,953
- Jesus, Audrey, get in here! 
 - Sir, really, it's f,,, lt's not a problem,

137
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,747
- l've burped up stuff better than this, 
 - Sir, it's fine,

138
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,876
- ls something wrong? 
 - Taste Tom's coffee,

139
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,336
No, really, lt's OK,

140
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,633
- How would you rate that? 
 - Well, it's not that great,

141
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:52,431
Not that great? l guess so, 
 Tom thinks it's shit,

142
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,642
Audrey, are you retarded?

143
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,979
lt's not a rhetorical question, 
 Are you retarded?

144
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,022
No, l'm not retarded,

145
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,568
Because a retarded person can make 
 a cup of coffee, Am l right, Tom?

146
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,987
Oh, l,,, l don't-l don't really know much

147
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,615
about the limitations 
 of the handicapped,

148
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:14,995
l know of an employment agency that 
 hires out retarded people for $4 an hour,

149
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,625
So, if making a cup of coffee is too 
 difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,

150
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,753
perhaps you'd be good enough to let 
 me know, and l'll contact this agency

151
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,381
and give a retarded person a job,

152
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,968
(mouths)) Wow,

153
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:36,058
- l wasn't too rough on her, was l? 
 - Well, she is new and all,

154
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,436
Maybe l was out of line, But do you 
 understand what l'm dealing with?

155
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,232
l mean, here l am trying 
 to fill a position in Creative,

156
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:48,028
and l can't seem to find one person 
 responsible enough to earn my trust,

157
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,448
l sometimes wonder if anyone here 
 even knows what they're doing,

158
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,283
l can understand how you 
 could see it that way, sir, but,,,

159
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,161
So you don't think l was out of line?

160
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:02,125
Well, if what you're saying 
 is that a company

161
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,128
is only as strong as its weakest link, 
 that makes sense, but,,,

162
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,464
Exactly, That's exactly right,

163
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,925
A company is only as strong 
 as its weakest link,

164
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,927
- Yeah,,, 
 - Audrey, get in here!

165
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,971
You were right, Tom, 
 l was too soft on her,

166
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,222
- What? No, 
 - Yeah?

167
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,224
Audrey, after talking it over 
 with Tom here,

168
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,310
l've come to realize that 
 l'm gonna have to let you go,

169
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,188
- You're firing me?! 
 - l'm sorry, lt's just not working out,

170
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,190
- But, sir, l was suggesting,,, 
 - l take my job very seriously,

171
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,442
A chain is only as strong 
 as its weakest link,

172
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,654
- Right, but there's a whole other side, 
 - Thanks for the support,

173
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,948
Audrey, empty out your desk 
 by the end of the day,

174
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,033
- Fine, 
 - Sir, this,,, l,,,

175
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,785
Thanks for straightening me 
 out there, Tom,

176
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,246
Right, right, But l didn't get to say 
 what l wanted to say,

177
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,959
Oh, your ideas, of course, Schedule 
 an appointment with my new secretary,

178
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,303
Tom, Are you OK?

179
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,222
Uh,,, yeah, sure,

180
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,224
l'm guessing by the way 
 you look he's on another one

181
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,601
of his rampages this morning,

182
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,936
- Definitely, 
 - Damn,

183
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,438
l was hoping to catch him 
 in a good mood,

184
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,650
Yeah, that's, um,,, 
 that's probably not gonna happen,

185
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,320
l'm supposed to go to this party tonight, 
 but my dad's making me housesit

186
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,488
for his stupid bird while 
 he's away this weekend,

187
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,158
Well, why don't you go in there 
 and tell him you're not gonna do it?

188
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,993
l can't just,,,

189
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,246
You can't just what? l mean, live your 
 own life and have a free weekend?

190
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,249
No, it's not that,

191
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,212
- Wait, it is that, 
 - Yeah,

192
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,007
- l should just go to that party, 
 - Yeah, of course,

193
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:37,679
Well, um,,, OK, l'm gonna 
 go back to, uh, work,

194
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,890
OK, sure,

195
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,644
Tom? l know this might seem 
 a little out of place

196
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,646
because we barely 
 even know each other,

197
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,357
But, do you have any plans tonight?

198
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,026
(mouths)) No, no, no,

199
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,531
- Uh,,, no, l'm-l'm wide open, 
 - We won't be home too late,

200
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,823
Hey, it's no problem,

201
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,993
So the party starts at 7, 
 You could be at my dad's house by 6?

202
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,703
- Sure, 
 - You sure you're cool with this?

203
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,957
- Are you kidding me? 
 - Tom, you're such a sweetheart,

204
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,877
Thank you so much, 
 l'm gonna love you forever for this,

205
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,841
- All right, Yeah, who's the man now? 
 - See? What'd l tell you?

206
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,719
(chuckles)) l'm a lady-killer,

207
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,184
How the hell could he be 
 so excited about housesitting?

208
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:28,480
He's nice, Daddy, That's how, 
 Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that,

209
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,108
l don't know if l want him 
 around my bird,

210
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,237
Oh, Dad, will you just relax? 
 lt's gonna be fine, l promise, OK?

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,074
l'll check in as soon as l get there, 8:00,

212
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,494
lf l sense anything's wrong, 
 you're coming back here,

213
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,538
OK, OK,

214
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,467
(. light rock)

215
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,379
Very good, Right on time,

216
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:39,343
Oh, sir, Uh,,, Hey, is that a bear trap?

217
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,722
Yes, lt's to keep the neighbor's kids 
 out of my yard,

218
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:55,734
Sir, l just wanted to let you know 
 how much l appreciate you,,,

219
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,445
well,,, letting tonight happen,

220
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:04,117
l mean, l know it means a lot to Lisa, 
 and l think you're doing the right thing,

221
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,662
l don't know what 
 you're planning, Stansfield,

222
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,290
but you're attitude 
 is making me very nervous,

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,462
- Those socks are clean, right? 
 - Um,,,

224
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:20,551
- You hesitated, Put those on, 
 - Are you serious?

225
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,480
lf you want to watch TV, 
 the remote's there,

226
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,525
That panel controls the lights, 
 alarm, skylight, etc,

227
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,277
Yeah, l probably won't 
 use any of that stuff,

228
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,572
- You know, since the party starts at 7, 
 - Party?

229
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,325
l made it clear to Lisa you're not 
 to have any guests in here,

230
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,704
You're the only one 
 allowed in the house,

231
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:54,626
- What? Lisa's not here? 
 - No, Of course not,

232
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,714
Lisa's at the party,,,

233
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,551
and l'm staying here,

234
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,680
ls this concept too complicated 
 for you, Stansfield?

235
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,977
Don't touch the furniture,

236
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,108
And this is my bird's room,

237
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,570
(chuckles)) He's got his own room?

238
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,241
That's cool,

239
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,456
- (gasps)) 
 - How's my little boy?

240
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,669
- This is OJ, 
 - OJ? Like the murderer?

241
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:42,716
No, Like the football player, 
 OJ Simpson,

242
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,011
l've set the alarm, 
 When you hear it go off, feed him,

243
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,932
- (mice squeaking)) 
 - Aw, What do l feed these little guys?

244
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:56,021
They don't get fed, They are the food, 
 His diet varies, but they're his favorites,

245
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,732
Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

246
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,402
Not anymore, He's been depressed 
 since his mate died,

247
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,573
He won't fly, Just sits in his cage,

248
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:14,289
Medication, Give him two 
 of these at 1 0:00,

249
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,500
l have to shove these down his throat?

250
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,170
Just one, The other is inserted 
 into his rectum,

251
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,256
Don't worry, lt's not 
 too unpleasant for him,

252
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:27,553
- He doesn't bite, does he? 
 - No, Not unless you taunt him,

253
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,096
You're not planning on taunting him, 
 are you, Tom?

254
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,639
- No, 
 - l mean, that'd be really sick,

255
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,016
No, of course not,

256
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,229
And the most important thing, 
 make sure he gets a pint of water,

257
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,690
The medication tends to dry him out 
 and then he can't breathe,

258
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,984
- OK, 
 - Well, l must be off,

259
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,112
- Henderson should be waiting outside, 
 - Henderson? l thought you fired him,

260
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,281
Because his ideas were stupid? 
 Of course not,

261
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,283
He's gonna drive me to the train station,

262
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,953
So, you can leave as soon 
 as Lisa and Hans get back,

263
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,330
- Hans? 
 - Lisa's boyfriend,

264
00:15:56,248 --> 00:16:00,502
So remember, uh,,, water in the bowl, 
 medication, and,,,

265
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,756
anything happens to this house 
 while l'm gone, l'll kill you,

266
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,969
(door shuts))

267
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,430
(Paul over phone)) You're housesitting? 
 You gotta be kidding me.

268
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,639
(Tom)) l know, it sucks,

269
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,601
What are you talking about? 
 Don't you see? This is a test.

270
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,020
You watch Taylor's house, 
 come up with a couple of great ideas

271
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,022
and if everything goes smooth, 
 you get the promotion.

272
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:23,192
- You think so? 
 - Of course I do. What could be easier?

273
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,027
(crackles))

274
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,155
(. ''Not What I Wanted'' by Evan Olson))

275
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,003
(Lisa giggling)) What are you 
 doing, Hans? Come here.

276
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:47,674
Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you 
 don't let me put this on you right now.

277
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:57,476
Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans. 
 You're insane. Put that down.

278
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,773
Want to put some on me? 
 Put some lotion on me.

279
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,242
- ls Jack around? 
 - Hey,,, what? Who are you?

280
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:17,371
lt's OK, l'm Red Taylor, l'm Jack's son, 
 l let myself in the back,

281
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,498
- Oh, Hey, Tom Stansfield, 
 - Hey,

282
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:23,043
Tom, nice to meet you, 
 Am l interrupting something here?

283
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:28,340
Oh, no, Uh,,, l was,,, uh,,, 
 Oh, your shoes,

284
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,636
Nike, Uh, listen, Tom, can you 
 do me a favor? l lost my TV Guide.

285
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,723
l came over here to see if maybe 
 my dad's got a copy of one,

286
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,309
You haven't seen a copy of 
 the guide laying around, have you?

287
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,104
- My sister in? 
 - No, actually she's out for the evening,

288
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,774
- Bingo, (chuckles)) 
 - Oh,

289
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:49,570
So, uh, you're here to,,,

290
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,447
- Housesit, 
 - Oh,

291
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:58,120
Yeah, it's probably for the best if you 
 don't, uh, tell Lisa that l stopped by,

292
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:02,374
- Why? ls there a problem? 
 - Well, you know how uptight she is,

293
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,460
- Really? 
 - l'm more the free spirit of the family,

294
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:11,216
Oh, Oh, boy, See that right there?

295
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,303
- Kirstie Alley? 
 - Yeah, l dated her maid,

296
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,473
- Really? 
 - l boned Kirstie Alley's maid,

297
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,393
And this is while they were 
 making Look Who's Talking ,

298
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,270
Wow, that's really something,

299
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,148
l'll tell you another thing, 
 You know Michelle Pfeiffer?

300
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,274
Yeah,

301
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,319
l did the deed 
 with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin,

302
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,446
- Wow, 
 - Right out there in those bushes,

303
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,823
- Right, 
 - Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,

304
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,950
except she was brunette 
 instead of blond,

305
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,411
and she was kinda short and dumpy,

306
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:43,040
Well, uh, ya certainly have 
 an interesting life, Fred,

307
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,250
You married, Tom?

308
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,961
- No, l'm single, 
 - No girlfriend?

309
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,965
No, and, no, actually l had a girlfriend, 
 but we, uh, broke up,

310
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,342
- Ah, 
 - Ah,

311
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,513
Listen, l really gotta get back to work, 
 and since you got your TV Guide and,,,

312
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:02,017
So, you broke up, huh? That's too bad,

313
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,810
- Was your ex a looker? 
 - Yeah,

314
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,021
Yeah, in my opinion she was,

315
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:10,526
l bet you you still keep a picture 
 of her in your wallet,

316
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,237
- Yeah, l do, 
 - Can l see it?

321
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,669
Oh, l could knock on that back door

322
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,213
- Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl, 
 - Wow,

00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,299
She has gotta be wicked in bed, 
 Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom,

324
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,510
l bet you she banged your johnson raw 
 every single night,

325
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,387
- OK,,, 
 - ,,,'cause that is one fine-looking broad,

326
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,097
All right, Hey! Would ya--

327
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,559
l me-- You're talking about my girlfriend,

328
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,104
- Ex-girlfriend, you said, 
 - Yeah, but still, it's,,,

329
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,649
Come on, l'm just making conversation, 
 You know, guy-talk,

330
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,318
Look, l just,,, l don't tell comfortable

331
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:57,197
talking about my intimate relationships 
 with a complete stranger,

332
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,366
Understood,

333
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,703
Well, you know, given how uptight 
 you are talking about sex,

334
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,538
you pretty much 
 answered the question,

335
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,957
l am not uptight! OK?

336
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,252
Just because l don't feel like 
 revealing personal details

337
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:14,173
about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits 
 does not make me uptight,

338
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,717
l didn't ask you anything personal,

339
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,761
Well, then, what the hell 
 do you consider personal?

340
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,473
Well, it'd be like, you know, 
 if l asked you how big your rod was,

341
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,101
Then l would be out of line, 1 00%%%,

342
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:30,898
No, no! That is no worse than 
 asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph,

343
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,692
l just asked you if she dug sex,

344
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,111
Besides, l wouldn't have asked 
 if l'd known she was frigid,

345
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,739
Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

346
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,782
Are you leaving?

347
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,284
Oh, yeah,

348
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,453
And listen, Could you do me a favor?

349
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,038
- lt's no big deal, 
 - What?

350
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,750
A business associate of my dad's 
 is gonna come by to pick this up,

351
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,922
- lt's frozen steaks, it's a gift, 
 - lt's not cold,

352
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,635
Dad says that's the way the guy 
 likes 'em, What are you gonna do?

353
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,595
Will you give it to him?

354
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,764
(doorbell)

355
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,807
Just one second,

356
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,810
(doorbell)

357
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,982
- Audrey, 
 - Tom,

358
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,442
(man)) Let's go! Come on!

359
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,570
Oh, l guess this makes sense, 
 He's got you living with him now?

360
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,906
- Uh, no, l'm just watching his place, 
 - (car horn))

361
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,742
- He's,,, Jack's out of town, 
 - He is?

362
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,537
- Yeah, 
 - Aw, shoot!

363
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,081
l came by 'cause l was 
 hoping to get my job back,

364
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,749
You know, the one that 
 you got me canned from

365
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,417
'cause l made a bad cup 
 of coffee? Remember that?

366
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,794
Listen, l'm really sorry about that,

367
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,171
How can you fire someone 
 for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?

368
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,506
l know, That's what l tried to say to him,

369
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,926
l mean, who do you think you are - 
 Juan fucking Valdez?

370
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,260
l might have had a future at that place 
 if you'd just give me half a chance,

371
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:48,267
- (man)) Let's get a move on, saddlebag! 
 - Oh, my God, That's my idiot boyfriend,

372
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,271
- (car horn)) 
 - Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!

373
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,731
God, He drives me crazy,

374
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,026
Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the 
 rug, would you mind putting these on?

375
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,155
- They're medical,,, l got 'em on, too, 
 - Ugh! Licorice,

376
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:05,534
l hate licorice, l need water 
 or l'm gonna throw up, Ugh!

377
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,538
Thanks to you, l lost my second job 
 inside a month and now l'm flat broke,

378
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,998
You lost another job?

379
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,792
Yeah, l got fired from my waitress job 
 just last Friday,

380
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,545
- Why did they fire you? 
 - Oh, l don't know,

381
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:19,131
One of the assistant managers 
 caught me making out with a customer,

382
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,883
- Excuse me? 
 - Well, l mean, actually the customer

383
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,384
was my boyfriend,

384
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,887
l mean, he became my boyfriend 
 after the incident anyway,

385
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,723
- You got any beer in here? 
 - Uh,,, Hey,

386
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,225
- Here we go, 
 - Would you mind putting these on?

387
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,520
lt's a house rule, Oh, actually, 
 that's a twist,,, Aah!

388
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:38,317
That's the counter, Listen, Jack, 
 is just a real stickler, That'd be great,

389
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,861
No kidding, l found that out this morning,

00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,830
- (knocking))

396
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:55,083
lf you don't open this door this second, 
 l'm gonna come in there and,,,

397
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,168
- Hi,

398
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,503
- (clatter) 
 - Don't worry, Nothing broke,

399
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,715
Hey, Baby, come on, What are you 
 doing leaving me in the goddamn car?

400
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,383
Shake that tail, baby, 
 Come on, Let's get a move on,

401
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:07,221
- Hold your horses, Try acting civilized,

402
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,597
This is Tom, the guy that l was 
 telling you about from the office,

403
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,599
Oh, the coffee dude,

404
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,435
You got some black ass karma 
 headed your way, superfreak,

405
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,438
Oh, we don't need no lecture 
 from you, Mr, High and Mighty,

406
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:19,775
Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little 
 lady, before l bounce you off the wall!

407
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:24,154
Look, l would appreciate it 
 if you would take this outside, please,

408
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:29,034
Hey, l'd appreciate it if you'd go 
 and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy,

409
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,870
Jewy? l'm not Jewish, And l don't 
 think that making fun of the,,,

410
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,249
- Don't pay attention to him, He's nuts, 
 - l'm nuts?

411
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,835
- Who do you think you are? 
 - Look, can we please take this outside?

412
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,336
Oh, come on,

413
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,130
You know what you are? 
 You're a filthy, little tramp,

414
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,632
Me? What about you and that waitress?

415
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,759
- Keep going, 
 - l never touched her ever,

416
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:47,719
- Swear? 
 - So help me God,

417
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,221
You swear on your mama's life?

418
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,265
Hell, woman, l ain't gonna 
 swear on my mama's life,

419
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,142
- Why not? lf you're telling the truth, 
 - l think he's telling the truth, Audrey,

420
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,602
Then why won't you swear 
 on your mama's life?

421
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,355
Well, because l don't feel 
 like l have the right

422
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,940
to gamble with my mama's life, 
 that's why,

423
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,317
Gamble? But apparently 
 you got nothing to worry about

424
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,111
unless you're lying like 
 a hunk of morgue meat,

425
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:08,615
Hey, l ain't gonna sit here and get 
 called a liar by no skankin' whore!

426
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,994
Who you calling a whore, 
 you shrimp-dick bastard?!

427
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,120
Audrey, see now 
 you're just provoking him,

428
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,621
That's a vicious, flat-out, 
 bold-faced lie and you know it!

429
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,916
- ls it? ls it? l don't think so! 
 - l'll whip it out right now!

430
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,251
- No, no, no, l don't wanna see it, 
 - l'm gonna whip it out right now

431
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,962
and prove to you that she's a lying slut!

432
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,839
- Keep your meat in the fridge! 
 - You wanna see my piece?

433
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,258
- All right, All right! That is enough! 
 - Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get,,,

434
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:29,887
That is it, l don't care 
 if you have a tiny shrimp dick!

435
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:36,018
- Or a giant whale dick, which that's,,, 
 - Goddamn it, Audrey!

436
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,021
You tell him you're a liar or l'm gonna 
 smash your face in, l swear!

437
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:44,276
- Wait a minute! You put that down! 
 - All right, Can we please just use fists?

438
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,237
- Come here, you little,,, (slap)) 
 - You hit me, you bastard!

439
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,865
- l did not and you know it! 
 - He hit me!

440
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:51,992
He hit me as sure 
 as l'm standing right here!

441
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,702
- Did you hit her, Spike? 
 - Yes,

442
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,621
With an open hand, 
 lt was with an open hand,

443
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,039
- So what if it's open? 
 - You can't,,,

444
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,582
- Then it don't count, 
 - Says who?

445
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,543
Says anyone, Ask the Jew,

446
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:04,046
All right, that's it, 
 You two have got to leave,

447
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,632
All right, that's fine, 
 But she is not coming with me,

448
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,050
You are not welcome in the double ride,

449
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,553
Fine, l don't care, l don't need your lousy 
 trailer, l'll stay right here with Tom,

450
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,222
- Fine, Stay with Tom, 
 - l'll stay right here,

451
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:18,977
Wait a minute, Whoa, Guys, you need 
 to try to work this thing out,

452
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,731
- He hit me! He knocked me on my can! 
 - l know, l know,

453
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:27,402
Well, but it was with 
 an open hand after all, and,,,

454
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:31,073
Relationships have their 
 ups and downs, you guys,

455
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,991
and you don't want to ruin this great,,,

456

470
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:30,716
Oh, yeah,

 you helping me out tonight.

00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,808
But l'd like to crash at a friend's place 
 tonight after the party,

474
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,103
Would you think it was horrible if l asked 
 you to stay the whole night tonight?

475
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:48,650
Oh, well,,, l-l don't think your dad

00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,494
(Audrey)) l ain't afraid of you and Tom

479
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,539

And l'm sorry about 
 that whole office thing,

487
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:25,854
l know that you didn't mean 
 to get me fired,

488
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:30,859
- Yeah, You didn't deserve to get fired,

489
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:32,986

Well, l guess l'll just go try 
 to find a homeless shelter then,

491
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,663

00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,290
Aw, shit! l gotta find him,

Don't worry, He'll probably 
 come back when he's hungry,

526
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,798
No, l have to find him or l'm gonna 
 lose my job! You know what?

527
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,968
This isn't gonna help your chances 
 of getting your job back either,

528
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,427
OK,

529
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:06,014

00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:08,600

539
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,463
No,

00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,008
Then why do you keep

lf you let me live, l'll give you my 
 most valued possession, Here, take it,

546
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,690
You know what that is, don't you?

547
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,693
- Evander Holyfield's ear, 
 - What?

548
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:03,280
The part of the ear that 
 Mike Tyson bit off and spit out,

549
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,365
- But it's white, 
 - So?

550
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:10,162
- So, shouldn't it be black? 
 - Well, if it's still on his head, sure,

551
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,582
But anybody knows that a 
 severed ear loses its color,

552
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,334
- No, 
 - Sheryl?

553
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,544
- Yeah? 
 - What happens to an ear

554
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:21,882
- if it's severed from your head? 
 - lt changes color, Duh,

555
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:24,718
- (thud) 
 - (Sheryl) Ow! Damn!

556

l invited some friends over 
 to help us look for the owl,

564
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,614
And Darryl even fixed 
 the table in the hall,

565
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,574
- Thank you, 
 - He won't even know it was broken,

566
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,868
- (bottle breaks)) 
 - (man)) Air ball,

567
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,871

But could you make sure that your 
 friends stay out of the house?

573
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,015
- All of them or just the colored guy? 
 - No, all of them,

574
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,270
Ooh, that's smart, That way the 
 colored guy won't take it personal,

575
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,439
- l have nothing against,,, Look,

576
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,983

- (Tina)) What about the cake? 
 - Don't worry, they're all good people,

582
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:39,001
They're not gonna steal nothing 
 or drink too much like the lndians,

583
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:42,796
Look,,, just make sure they stay outside,

584
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:45,382

585
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:52,097

00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:53,932
- Lisa? 
 - Hi, Tom,

587
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,144
Uh, you're home? Why are you home?

588
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:00,314
lt's not worth going into, 
 l got in a huge fight with Hans,

589
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:05,736
Oh, So,,, it's over?

590
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,031
lt's my own fault for dating 
 a guy my dad likes,

591
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,115
Really?

592
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,951
Yeah, he's one of his top marketing 
 execs, You know, Harvard Law,

593
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:16,788
Comes from a good family, top

00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:20,709
- Tom, can l talk to you for a second?

595
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,921

00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,151
Here, How about this one?

603

- What's going on? 
 - We found the owl!

604
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:52,157
- Where is he? 
 - Uh, well, he got away,

605
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,785
- Where'd he go? 
 - He hopped somewhere in the bushes,

606
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,037
- That's right, 
 - What are you doing?

607
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,499
Getting hamburger meat, 
 That's a good way to lure birds,

608
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:04,169
- They like hamburger meat? 
 - l don't know, l've never had a bird,

609
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,797
- But most animals respond to meat, 
 - lt's a fact,

610
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,675
Wanna help me separate the meat?

611
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,553
Speed, tell Tom about 
 the Kennedy assassination,

612
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,389
This is so cool, Tom, 'cause Speed 
 knows who killed JFK,

613
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,808
No, ask him! Tom, ask him,

614
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,686
- Ask him who killed him, 
 - All right, All right,

615
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:26,525

617
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,700

All right, All right, You listen to me,

788
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,538
You're not even supposed 
 to be in this house,

789
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:47,581
Says who?

790
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:50,417
l know about the restraining order, Red,

791
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:55,130
Restraining-shmaining, l mean, 
 that's just a big misunderstanding,

792
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:56,840
(Audrey)) Tom! lt's OJ!

793
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,926
(overlapping chatter)

794
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,930
(Audrey and friends)) Oh,,,

795
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:07,601
- Whoa, Hey, Who are you?

 - No,

797
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,940
What, you surprised she'd go out 
 with someone like me?

798
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,274
No, no, lt's not,,,

799
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,860
Give me a break, man, 
 You oughta be ashamed of yourself,

800
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,238
Let me tell you something, 
 There are a lot of girls out there

801
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:21,698
who can see past the fact 
 that l just happen to be,,,

802
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,242
a few pounds overweight,

803
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,786
(crying)) You know, inside 
 l'm just like everyone else,

804
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:28,956
- Let me get you a tissue, 
 - Thank you,

805
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,166
- l'm on the second day of a new diet, 
 - Hey, uh, Hans,,,

806
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,085
- l gave up chocolate, 
 - l'm really sorry,

807
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,796
l think that, uh, we just 
 got off on the wrong foot,

808
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,260
Oh,,, uh,,, lt's good 
 to meet you, Hans, l'm Tom,

809
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,553
l, uh,,, (clears throat)

810
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:45,389
l'm just a friend of Lisa's,

811
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:48,559
Oh, great, Well, maybe you can 
 help me, ls she here? Lisa! Lisa!

812
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:50,227
Whoa, Hans, you know what?

813
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,272
Maybe right now isn't a great time 
 for you to see Lisa,

814
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:55,440
What say, uh, we get you a drink?

815
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:58,360
Oh, OK, Yeah, she's 
 probably really upset,

816
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:02,948
You see, we got in a misunderstanding 
 tonight and, well, she left me,

817
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:05,117
- Wow, that's unfortunate, 
 - Yeah,

818
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,035
Uh, what happened?

819
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:11,331
Well, l think seeing me naked from 
 behind like that kind of shocked her,

820
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:15,335
Oh, So, tonight was the first time,

821
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:18,172
Yeah, Tonight was the first time, 
 lt was awesome,

822
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:21,383
l mean, l was lying up on the bed like 
 this with one leg straight up in the air,

823
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,343
- l don't think l really need to see,,, 
 - And l had a handful of ass right here,,,

824
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:24,386
- Whoa, 
 - ,,,and l had a handful of this,

825
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,098
Hans, please, Whoa, 
 God, you're,,, that's,,,

826
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:32,728
- And that's when Lisa walked in, 
 - What?

827
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:35,522
She caught me in the bed with a blonde,

828
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:37,065
What?

829
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,860
Aw, come on, man, Tell me you 
 haven't ever wanted to do it with a,,,

830
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:43,030
Hans, Hans, No,,, you cheated on her,

831
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,868
You know something, Tom? 
 You're right,

832
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,706
Aw, l guess that was cheating, 
 And now l've gone and lost everyone,

833
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,375
l should have known 
 from the start it wasn't right,

834
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,920
She kept telling me 
 l reminded her of her dad,

835
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:01,006
Hans, you gotta realize 
 that this is over, you know?

836
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:04,676
And you gotta put an end to it, 
 and-and move on,

837
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,180
- And get yourself to a better place, OK? 
 - Yes,

838
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:12,392
- l think you know what l mean, 
 - Yeah, l do know what you mean,

839
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:16,522
And l'm ready, l know what l have to do,

840
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:23,070
Well, l guess this is good-bye,

841
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:30,536

842
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,371
(Hans)) Thanks, Tom,

843
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,373
(Tom)) OJ, come back!

844
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,042
(dog barks))

845
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,169
OJ!

846
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:42,714
(squawks))

847
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,267
Hello, You must be Julie's date, 
 Come in, Come in,

848
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:56,728
Actually l'm just here looking for a bird,

849
00:48:56,812 --> 00:49:00,274
Make yourself at home, Albert, 
 Julie's still getting ready,

850
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:03,527
- No, actually, uh, my name is Tom, 
 - l'm sorry, l'm hard of hearing,

851
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,113
- Could you speak up, please? 
 - (shouts)) My name is Tom!

852
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,615
l could've sworn Julie 
 said your name was Albert,

853
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,325
No, see, l'm afraid that you're mistaken,

854
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:14,663
- ls someone here? 
 - Yes, This is Julie's date, Albert,

855
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,331
- Ah! Ah! 
 - This is my nephew, George,

856
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:20,627
- He's blind and crippled, 
 - Oh, Uh,,, (shouts)) nice to meet you,

857
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:21,962
l'm not deaf,

858
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:26,633
Excuse me, l'll go see what's 
 keeping Julie, She's probably nervous,

859
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:28,594
So you're Julie's date, huh?

860
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,847
No, l'm just,,, l just came here, 
 l was looking for an owl,

861
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,809
(laughs)) You don't have 
 to make lame excuses,

862
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,605
Listen, do you know what the 
 advantage is in being a cripple?

863
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,523
No, l can't say that l do,

864
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:43,859
You don't really care to hear much 
 what l have to say, do you?

865
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:46,653
No, no, lt's not that, l'm,,,

866
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:49,698
You know what? 
 Go ahead, l'm listening,

867
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,992
Sit down, Tom,

868
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,457
You know what l gained 
 by becoming a quad?

869
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,542
What, are you shaking your head? 
 l can't see, you know!

870
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:05,464
l'm sorry, Uh,,, uh,,, 
 Tell me what you gained,

871
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,467
l no longer need my Viagra,

872
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,846
Now l can maintain 
 my arousal for hours,

873
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,474
That's-that's great, 
 l guess things have a way

874
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:17,226
of evening themselves out 
 in the long run, huh?

875
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,728
No, not really, And do you know why?

876
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:21,146
No, why?

877
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,690
Because l am a blind, 
 quad freak, you moron!

878
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,734
What, you think women dig this?!

879
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:27,027
- l mean, you think women go,,, 
 - Well, hello,

880
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,071
,,,''l wanna give that mutant 
 freak my number''?

881
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,449
- Ken Morehouse, l'm Julie's dad, 
 - Hey, nice to meet you,

882
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:36,036

00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:38,413
- Tripe,,, 
 - No, not at all,

884
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:41,708
''l'm blind, l'm crippled, Boohoo-hoo,''

885
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,837
Leave the room, l wanna talk 
 to Albert alone for a second,

886
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,256
- l can stay if l want,

887
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,549
- OK, OK,

888
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:51,051
- You don't have to be huffy about it! 
 - Get out now! Get out!

889
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:54,721
- OK, 
 - Turn it, turn it, turn it,

890
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:57,766
- Oh, for God's sakes, 
 - (clatter)

891
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:00,769
- l'm so sorry, 
 - (George)) Who the hell put that there?

892
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:01,854
- (cat meows)) 
 - (thud)

893
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:05,315
My daughter's gonna be a few minutes, 
 Have a-Have a seat, Albert,

894
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,067
- Tom,

895
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,443
- Right, You're Ken, 
 - Yes,

896
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,947
Before you say anything, Albert, 
 l just want you to know that Julie

897
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:16,535
is really self-conscious about her 
 appearance since the,,, the accident,

898
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:17,703
- (door shuts)) 
 - Right,,,

899
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:22,249
- Oh, Julie, 
 - Julie, this is Albert, Albert, Julie,

900
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:26,128
- lt's nice to meet you, Albert, 
 - Wow, lt's,,, wow,

901
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:31,633
lt's nice to meet you, too, 
 But, the thing is, is that l'm not Albert,

902
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:37,431
- That is to say that l'm not your date, 
 - Oh,,

903
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:40,475
There's been a giant misunderstanding,

904
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:44,062
- Oh, how could you? 
 - (crying)) l knew this would happen!

905
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:46,398
No, l'm telling the truth,

906
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:49,485
Julie wasn't pretty enough 
 for you, Mr, GQ? ls that it?

907
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:54,072
- No, you don't understand, 
 - Oh, l understand, Fabio,

908
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,992
- You broke that poor girl's heart, 
 - No, no, See, l'm not,,,

909
00:51:57,075 --> 00:52:00,496
Do you think Julie is an idiot? Do you 
 think she bought your little fairy tale

910
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:03,123
Mr, l'm Too Sexy 
 for my medical booties?

911
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,585
- Oh, th,,, 
 - Get the hell out of here,

912
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:11,256
Or l'll kick your pretty-boy ass 
 to kingdom come,

913
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,260
- Am l interrupting something? 
 - No, it's just that the,,,

914
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:19,681
- (squawks)) 
 - (grunts))

915
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:22,476
Tom, there's two things 
 that we need to talk about,

916
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:23,519
What?

917
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:25,896
First of all, l don't wanna 
 wear these booties anymore,

918
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,899
- No one else is wearing the booties, 
 - Fine,

919
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:32,778
- What's the other thing? 
 - Tina thinks she's got cancer,

920
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,824
- Do you feel it? 
 - Uh, l'm just,,,

921
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:41,245
- What's supposed to be there? l don't,,, 
 - See, Tina?

922
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:44,498
Move your hand to the left, 
 Now move it around,

923
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,750
Uh-huh,

924
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:50,504
- Don't you feel anything? 
 - Yeah, l mean, no, no,

925
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:52,381
No, it seems to be,,, Well,,,

926
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:55,008
Tina, your breast is no 
 different than mine, OK?

927
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:00,180
- lt is, There's no comparison, 
 - Tom, feel my breast and compare,

928
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:03,058
Now, do you detect any difference 
 between our breasts?

929
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,186
- Well,,, You gotta slow down a little, 
 - lt sure feels good,

930
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,814
- Well, yours is a,,, 
 - (door opens))

931
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,192

 - l believed everything you said,

932
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:13,694
l'm,,,

933
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,279
lt was all just a bunch of lines, wasn't it?

934
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:19,449
No, no, Lisa, it was all,,, 
 l swear to you, l meant every word,

935
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,993
This is,,, nothing's going on here,

936
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:23,912
Great, Tom, l'm glad you think 
 l'm a complete idiot,

937
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:28,876
No, no, l'm telling you, l was just 
 checking these girls for breast cancer,

938
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:34,173
- You make me sick, 
 - No,,, Lisa, wait!

939
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,551
- She's never gonna forgive me, 
 - Of course she will,

940
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,760
ls this the first time you cheated on her?

941
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:42,181
Yeah, No! l,,, yeah,,, wait,

942
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:45,726
l didn't cheat on her, l mean,

00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,203
You didn't give him the pill 
 with whiskey, did you?

1038

 - OK, You watch TJ, Use this,

1047
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,317
lt's not loaded, but he doesn't know that,

01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,369
(Audrey)) All right, You grab his ankles,,,

1053
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,455
Why don't we go 
 to that room over there?

1054
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:25,125
- (Speed) OK, yeah, l got this end, 
 - (Audrey)) Man, he's heavy,

1055
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:29,505
Do you mind if l sit down?

1056
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:33,759
- Uh,,, yeah, Sure, 
 - Thank you,

1057
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:40,933
Oh, hey, Sorry to butt in, Hi, l'm Red,

1058
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,352
- Hi, it's nice to meet you, 
 - Nice to meet ya,

1059
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,980
Anyway, l realized you were telling 
 the truth when my real date showed up,

1060
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:51,527
- Of course he didn't stick around, 
 - Well, that guy is a bum,

1061
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,654
Well, l'm sure that had 
 nothing to do with you,

1062
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:55,155
No, l know it did,

1063
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:58,992
l've never had any guys attracted to me, 
 even before the accident,

1064
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,161
Now that cannot be true,

1065
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,665
Well,,, about six months ago, 
 l was hitchhiking

1066
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:07,793
and a trucker tried to rape me, 
 but other than that,,,

1067
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:11,296
Come on, You're gonna tell me, 
 you never had a real boyfriend?

1068
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:15,259
Well, once, but l think 
 he just felt sorry for me,

1069
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:18,554
Oh, well, uh,,, how long did that last?

1070
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:23,016
Um,,, about six years 
 and then one day, he just left,

1071
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:26,937
- Another woman? 
 - No, He got hit by a bus,

1072
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,605
(Red) Well, see that's not your fault,

1073
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:31,108
Well, he didn't seem to try 
 very hard to avoid the bus,

1074
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:33,735
l think he just wanted 
 out of the relationship,

1075
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:36,405
Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

1076
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,866
Oh, geez, l'm starting 
 to feel a bit woozy,

1077
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:41,034
(blood squishes))

1078
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:44,329
OK, All right, l have to go find OJ,

1079
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,917
So, Red, if you could watch things 
 for me, that'd be great,

1080
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:52,171
Got ya,

1081
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:58,844
Look, l think you're being 
 way too hard on yourself,

1082
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:03,182
l mean, besides, l bet there've been a lot 
 of guys who've been attracted to you,

1083
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:05,893
No, he was the only one,

1084
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:09,605
What about that trucker? l mean, 
 he was obviously attracted to you,

1085
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:12,608
(sighs)) l think the trucker probably 
 would have raped anyone,

1086
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:16,403
l doubt that, You were probably 
 pretty special to him,

1087
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:18,697
(chuckles)) So sweet of you, Red,

1088
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,909
l'm not just jerking 
 your chain either, l mean it,

1089
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,870
- (giggles)) 
 - Yeah, (chuckles))

1090
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:33,629
- What are you doing to the lawn? 
 - lt's OK, Tom, We just had to bury TJ,

1091
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:37,424
Bury,,, what? You mean, he's,,,

1092
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:41,595
You said he was gonna be OK! 
 l thought you were a paramedic,

1093
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:45,098
- Well, l took a course, 
 - You took,,, you-you guy,,,

1094
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,059
You can't just bury him, you guys!

1095
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:48,977
Well, we're not gonna put him in my car,

1096
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:52,523
- (Audrey)) That's right, 
 - All right, Forget it, l'm calling 91 1 ,

1097
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:55,400
- That's for emergencies, 
 - What do you think this is?

1098
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:58,612
The guy's dead, ln 20 minutes, 
 he's still gonna be dead,

1099
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,114
- There's no sense of urgency here, 
 - (chuckles))

1100
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:04,284
No, we have to call the cops 
 and report it!

1101
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:09,581
- And tell 'em what? 
 - The truth! That there was a,,, accident,

1102
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:14,002
- They might not see it that way, 
 - Let's face it, Tom, You did kill him,

1103
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:17,506
- You gave me the pill, 
 - Hey, l didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?

1104
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,299
Well, you didn't tell me 
 not to use the whiskey!

1105
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:22,427
- Well, if you'd listen to me,,, 
 - You didn't say anything about whiskey!

1106
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:24,304
- (whistles)) 
 - l would think you would listen to me!

1107
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:25,889
There's no time for blame games,

1108
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:28,684
Why don't you spread around 
 some leaves? Make it look good,

1109
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,812
l am not gonna help 
 you conceal a dead body!

1110
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:35,023
Hey, you know what? Don't you 
 think we should say something?

1111
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:36,358
- What? 
 - You know what? She's right,

1112
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:39,153
Some kind of last rites or eulogy 
 or something like that?

1113
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:41,530
- l'm so screwed, 
 - We should say something,

1114
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:48,162
Fine, fine, You know what? Say 
 something, Get,,, just make it quick,

1115
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:54,293
Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ, 
 who was, uh,,,

1116
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:56,879
- l really didn't know him, 
 - l don't know him,

1117
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,714
l mean, Tom, you know him the best, 
 Why don't you say something?

1118
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,299
- Me? 
 - Yeah,

1119
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:04,845
All l know is that the guy was a violent, 
 sadistic goon that was into lesbians,

1120
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,264
Amen,

1121
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:10,726
- Tom? 
 - Lisa,

1122
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:13,562
- l can't believe you're still here, 
 - Listen, please,

1123
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:14,855
You have to let me explain,

1124
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:18,692
Look, Tom, Tonight was just a 
 big mistake, That's all there is to it,

1125
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:25,574
No, you,,, that,,, what you saw with 
 the girls, all that was was weird timing,

1126
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:28,368
Red? What's Red doing here?

1127
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:32,414
Red? Oh, uh, Red 
 was in the neighborhood

1128
01:04:32,456 --> 01:04:33,999
and he-and he stopped by,

1129
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:37,211
But, you see, nothing really 
 bad happened tonight,

1130
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:43,050
- ls he the reason OJ's gone? 
 - No, No, uh,,, OJ got loose,

1131
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,636
And that's a little problem, 
 But we're gonna find him,

1132
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:48,180
And we're looking for him, so,,,

1133
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:49,640
What's this?

1134
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:53,727
Oh, uh, Tom killed a guy 
 and we're burying the body,

1135
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:56,063
- OK, that was bad, 
 - Aah!

1136
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:59,274
OK, well, now you're 
 overreacting, lt's not,,,

1137
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:00,943
- Oh! 
 - Aah!

1138
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:08,951
(all yelling))

1139
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:10,786
All right, all right, hey,

1140
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:16,416
Anybody moves, there's gonna be 
 a big hole where her brain used to be,

1141
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:21,839
Yeah, Go ahead, shoot,

1142
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:24,883
Well, what are you waiting for? 
 Come on!

1143
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:26,218
What are you waiting for?! 
 Waste the bitch!

1144
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,262
- Tom! 
 - No, l don't give a shit!

1145
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:32,015
- Hey, l'm not joking, asshole, 
 - Yeah?

1146
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:35,811
Pull the trigger, Come on, Come on!

1147
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:41,441
l think you're just all talk,

1148
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,990
Looks like we both got guns,

1149
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:52,452
Who's gonna shoot first this time?

1150
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:58,250
(chuckles))

1151
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,502
(groans))

1152
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,796
(Red) Well, that should do it,

1153
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:05,841
Tom! You are so brave,

1154
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:09,136
No, no, lt's not even that big of a deal, 
 This gun's not even loaded,,,

1155
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,345
- (gunshot) 
 - (grunt)

1156
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:12,347
(man)) What the hell is going on?

1157
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:15,851
l never should have doubted you, 
 You risked your life for me,

1158
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,770
Audrey found some bullets in 
 the kitchen and l may have reloaded it,

1159
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:20,856
Yeah, l did,

1160
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:25,152
Yo, excuse me, Does anyone here 
 know a Jack Taylor?

1161
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,528
Why?

1162
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:30,407
This dude just called, said if l don't pick 
 him up at the train station in 1 5 minutes,

1163
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:33,494
l'm out of a job, What do 
 you suppose that means?

1164
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:34,661
Oh, my God,

1165
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:36,705
That's what l thought, 
 'cause l ain't got no job,

1166
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:38,665
- He's coming home early, 
 - OK, don't worry about it,

1167
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,835
l'll take care of everything, OK? 
 Trust me, Just don't drive too fast,

1168
01:06:41,877 --> 01:06:43,212
Got it,

1169
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:45,839
And, um, maybe you 
 should put that away,

1170
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:49,384
Oh, God,

1171
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:51,887
(. ''Go Home'' by Barenaked Ladies))

1172
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:06,318
Ooh,

1173
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:10,656
(squeaks))

1174
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,378
(sighs))

1175
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,218
(. whistling))

1176
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:43,355
l knew that was you,

1177
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,268
(beer bottles clank)

1178
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,694
(Taylor) As long as we're in Thailand 
 for the meeting on Monday afternoon,

1179
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:16,949
Yeah, We can pick it up 
 when we refuel in Hawaii,

1180
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:20,410
Hey, uh, do you wanna stop 
 and, uh, get something to drink,

1181
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:21,787
go to the bathroom or something?

1182
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,956
We'll take the departmental heads now

1183
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:27,376
and the Creative team 
 in a couple of weeks,

1184
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:28,794
(squeaks))

1185
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,929
That's the agenda up to lunch, 
 then there's lunch,,,

1186
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:42,182
(squawking))

1187
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:51,650
- OK, And then,,, 
 - (squawks))

1188
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:55,362
- (horns honk) 
 - (tires screech))

1189
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:58,740
OK, OK,

1190
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:02,536
OK, fine,

1191
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:11,253
- Stansfield, what are you doing? 
 - Nothing, sir,

1192
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:14,089
Hold on a moment, please,

1193
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:19,052
Stansfield,,, why don't you 
 just concentrate on the driving

1194
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:22,055
and let me get on with making my call,

1195
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:24,766
- Wait! 
 - What is it now, Stansfield?

1196
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,271
Oh, nothing, sir, Almost home,

1197
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:51,793
- Hey, How'd this get in there? 
 - Oh, be careful with that,

1198
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:53,712
l will, Good thing l found it,

1199
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:56,757
There's several ways to properly 
 dispose of a handgun,

1200
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,301
none of which include 
 putting it in a garbage bag,

1201
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:02,429
(cop over megaphone)) 
 Freeze! Police! Freeze!

1202
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:04,473
Let go of the girl 
 and put your hands in the air!

1203
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:06,308
You're completely surrounded, TJ!

1204
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,936
Put down your weapons 
 and put your hands on you head!

1205
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:14,399
No, you guys, Wait, He's not TJ, 
 l'm Lisa Taylor, This is my dad's house,

1206
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,318
Ma'am, we've received 
 numerous reports

1207
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,820
from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire,,,

1208
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:22,115
All right, Look, l know you probably 
 think we may have killed somebody,

1209
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,909
but Tom didn't know 
 he poisoned the guy,

1210
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:27,955
and we thought he was dead when 
 we buried him, But he seems OK now,

1211
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:31,458
His head's just a little bloody 
 from where we hit him with the shovel,

1212
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,586
And l swear when Tom shot the gun off, 
 he didn't think it was loaded

1213
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:38,006
'cause l put the bullets back in, 
 so if you'll all just step inside,

1214
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,259
you'll see there's nobody dead here,

1215
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:42,261
He may have had the wind 
 knocked out of him temporarily,

1216
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,847
but with a little first aid, 
 l think he'll be just fine,

1217
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,432
(screaming))

1218
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,309
(screaming))

1219
01:11:49,393 --> 01:11:54,606
- (screams)) 
 - (screams))

1220
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,733
Holy mother of God!

1221
01:11:59,194 --> 01:12:00,529
(Lisa)) Hans!

1222
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,823
Yes, l see, l see,

1223
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,950
- (squeaks)) 
 - OK, fine,

1224
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,243
- (squawking)) 
 - Whoa!

1225
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,871
Could you say that again? 
 You're breaking up!

1226
01:12:08,954 --> 01:12:14,168
One moment, please, OJ!

1227
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:16,086
(tires screeching))

1228
01:12:23,427 --> 01:12:28,307
l just can't understand why you would 
 do this, Hans, what were you thinking?

1229
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,767
He'll be fine, He may complain 
 about a sore throat,

1230
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,437
but he's in a lot better shape 
 than this chandelier,

1231
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,980
Well, l'd hate to be here 
 when the owner gets back,

1232
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,858
You can say that again,

1233
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:39,401
- (man)) Whoa! 
 - (car horn))

1234
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,405
- Tom! Daddy! 
 - What do we got?

1235
01:12:43,447 --> 01:12:45,657
- What was that? 
 - Watch the glass, OK, everybody?

1236
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,743
- Let's get 'em out of the car, 
 - Oh, my God! Daddy!

1237
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:50,037
- Everybody, stay back and remain calm, 
 - (Lisa)) Are you all right?

1238
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:52,372
That's him, That's the one spying 
 on me through the bushes,

1239
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:54,583
He shot the bullet right through 
 my Julie's bedroom window,

1240
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:57,711
Here, Tell 'em, Julie,

1241
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,131
You guys, Tom wants the body in here,

1242
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,717
- (TJ)) Take it easy, Put me down, 
 - (gasps))

1243
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:08,555
Stansfield, what have you done?

1244
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:12,226
Lisa, pack your things, 
 You're coming with me to Thailand,

1245
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,772
No!

1246
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,527
Get his ass out of here,

1247
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:25,614
lt's funny you should mention 
 the word ''ass'', Jack,

1248
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:28,742
Why don't we start 
 by talking about yours,

1249
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:29,785
Excuse me?

1250
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:33,914
Lisa, your father is not 
 who you think he is,

1251
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:38,710
The whole publishing operation, 
 lt's a great cover,

1252
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:42,756
Now how'd you do it? What'd you do? 
 Did you hollow out the books?

1253
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:47,261
Oh, and locating the plant 
 in Thailand, lt's genius!

1254
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:52,599
- What are you talking about? 
 - What am l,,, Jack,

1255
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:57,396
You know, l-l would've believed 
 you, Jack,,, until l met this man,

1256
01:13:57,479 --> 01:13:59,648
who seems to know a lot about ya,

1257
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:06,989
Recognize this? l hear it's very 
 effective in relieving folliculitis,

1258
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:10,200
l don't have folliculitis,

1259
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:13,954
He's given me no choice,

1260
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,831
- He's given me no choice! 
 - Tom, what are you doing?

1261
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,625
- This is insane! 
 - Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass,

1262
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,460
- No! 
 - Then tell me l'm insane, huh?

1263
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:25,007
- (all) Oh! Ooh! 
 - Huh? Huh? Look at it!

1264
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,676
Look at it! Huh? Huh?

1265
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:29,678
- Ooh,,, 
 - What?

1266
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:36,477
(man)) Oh, that's nasty,

1267
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:47,362
l told you l don't have folliculitis, 
 you blithering idiot,

1268
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:53,160
Well, guys, the ointment 
 must have worked,

1269
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:55,370
Let's go,

1270
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:59,750
Wait! l have something to show ya,

1271
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,712
(all) Oh!

1272
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:05,005
(Hans)) What's with this movie 
 and the ass cheeks?

1273
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:10,385
My real name is Jack Taylor,,, Jr, 
 Red is my nickname,

1274
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:14,389
Now you know why, 
 l'm the whole reason that TJ's here,

1275
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,519
Goddamn it, Red, You've been 
 dealing drugs out of my house!

1276
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:22,648
No, Dad, l swear, 
 l gave this guy a bag of flour,

1277
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:26,068
l dumped a kilo of the real stuff 
 down the toilet,

1278
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:28,237
l'm finished dealing for good,

1279
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,490
The lime green toilet 
 with the wooden seat?

1280
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:34,660
- Yeah, why? 
 - (squawking))

1281
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:45,546
(all) Ooh!

1282
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:47,214
(all) Whoa!

1283
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:52,010
Wait a second, He's flying,

1284
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:54,930
He's flying,

1285
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,145

1286
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,732

 - (crash))

1289
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:20,289
Get him out of my sight, Now, 
 Lisa, let's go,

1290
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:25,085
That's the one, He got my ear! 
 Evander Holyfield's ear,

1291
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,880
You have to right to remain silent, 
 Anything you say can and,,,

1292
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,798
Lisa, wait!

1293
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:32,551
(Arthur) That's Holyfield's ear 
 for God's sake,

1294
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:35,596
(thunder rolling))

1295
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,867
- (squawking)) 
 - OJ?

1296
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:03,749
OJ! Come to Daddy, 
 How's my little boy?

1297
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:09,087
(squawking))

1298
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:23,644
- You're going with him? 
 - What choice do l have? He needs me,

1299
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,313
Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

1300
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:29,942
He's manipulating you 
 and you are buying it,

1301
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:34,696
All right, fine, You do what you gotta do, 
 l am gonna bail Tom out of jail,

1302
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,823
With what? Your drug money?

1303
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,950
No, no, no, l stole this out of Dad's safe,

1304
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:41,078
Look, the important thing is, 
 somebody has gotta help Tom,

1305
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:44,832
You know that nothing that happened 
 here last night was any of his fault,

1306
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:49,378
lt's funny, The nicest guy in the world's 
 the only one with enough balls

1307
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,755
to stand up to Dad,

1308
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:59,346
All he wanted to do was 
 to spend some time with you,

1309
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:01,557
Look what it gets him,

1310
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:06,478
Classic Dad, l'm not allowed in the 
 house, you're not allowed out of it,

1311
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:09,982
He doesn't care about us, 
 Only that stupid bird,

1312
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,028
- Hey, Red, can l tell you something? 
 - Sure,

1313
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:19,616
l know this is gonna sound weird, 
 but ever since l was a little kid,,,

1314
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:26,623
l used to always wish 
 that l was that stupid bird,

1315
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,668
Aw,

1316
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:33,255
(squawks))

1317
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:40,387
Look, l think it's about time 
 you talk to Dad,

1318
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:44,224
At least tell him how you feel, 
 You can do it,

1319
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:45,684
(grunts))

1320
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,604
(yells))

1321
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:52,399
Don't you see, we have no reason 
 to be afraid of him?

1322
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:54,526
- Aah! 
 - (screaming))

1323
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,528
Aah!

1324
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:05,245
(grunting)) Aah!

1325
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:06,413
- (yells)) 
 - (thud)

1326
01:19:06,497 --> 01:19:11,293
- Daddy! 
 - Lisa, don't let him do this to you,

1327
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:15,589
Lisa! Aah!

1328
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:39,238
- Lisa! 
 - Tom!

1329
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:43,033
Red bailed me out,,, and told me you 
 were here and l'm not letting you go,

1330
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,619
- Yeah, but l'm,,, 
 - No, You're gonna let me finish,

1331
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:49,164
l went through hell last night and it was 
 my fault 'cause l let people do it to me,

1332
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:50,999
And now you're gonna 
 make the same mistake,

1333
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,793
- Yeah, but,,, 
 - This isn't what you want,

1334
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:55,838
This is what your father wants, 
 And you know what?

1335
01:19:55,921 --> 01:20:02,010
Maybe you and l,,, never 
 are gonna work, And that hurts,

1336
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:06,306
But not as much as watching you 
 be controlled by a ruthless tyrant

1337
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,976
that would screw his own mother 
 if he thought it'd help him get ahead,,,

1338
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:20,445
Tom! l'm not going,

1339
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:22,573
She's-she's not going,

1340
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:29,746
ls this whole concept too complicated 
 for you, Stansfield?

1341
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:44,178
No, No,

1342
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,847
All right, (chuckles))

1343
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:50,225
Wha,,, l,,, What made you stay?

1344
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,319
That,

1345
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:13,165
- How did you guys,,, 
 - We finally had our long overdue talk,

1346
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,835
Then-then who's taking 
 your place in Thailand?

1347
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:18,545
- He is, 
 - (gong))

1348
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:19,922
- What's this? 
 - (neck cracks)) Ow!

1349
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:23,258
- l'm kidding, 
 - l don't wanna go, l'm afraid,

1350
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:26,386
Nonsense, Everyone knows that, uh,,,

1351
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,765
Asian people are very 
 intimidated by, uh,,,

1352
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:31,892
- Tall men? 
 - Canadians?

1353

 - Blacks?

1354
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,522
- Henderson? 
 - Yes, sir,

1355
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:38,315
l won't have that kind of thinking 
 in this company,

1356
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:41,276
There's no room for racism here, 
 You're fired,

1357
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:46,073
Now, Tom, the point that l'm getting to 
 is that with a big part of the team away,

1358
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,909
l'm gonna want you to take over 
 the Creative Department,

1359
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:51,245
- Me? 
 - No need to be modest,

1360
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:54,331
l saw those ideas you left 
 in the living room,

1361
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:59,211
Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant, 
 And the moon landing, a hoax?

1362
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:01,380
You're really on to something there,

1363
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:05,467
That's the kind of thinking 
 that's gonna sell books,

1364
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:09,471
Uh, thank you, sir,

1365
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:13,183
Bye, Daddy, Have a safe flight,

1366
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:21,150
Well, Dad,,, that's fantastic, 
 You promoted Tom,

1367
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:24,778
Yeah, well, l figure anyone who's got 
 the guts to piss on my Persian carpet

1368
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:29,658
has gotta have what it takes, 
 Stansfield!

1369

(trickling))

1370
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,335
- What the hell are you doing? 
 - Just trying to get my job back, sir,

 - (chuckles))

1373
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:49,344
(Tom)) You know, after everything 
 that happened, after all I went through,

1374
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:53,348
I guess it was my lucky day. 
 And I'm not the only one.

1375
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:55,434
Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

1376
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:58,103
Jack restructured the company 
 from top to bottom.

1377
01:22:58,187 --> 01:23:01,815
Even instituting casual 
 Fridays every day.

1378
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:05,110
And last Friday was Henderson's 
 2 7th straight day on the job

1379
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:06,695
without being fired.

1380
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:09,781
OJ's back off the drugs 
 and now he only drinks beer.

1381
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:11,825
(burps))

1382
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:14,536

 an occasional flashback.

1384
01:23:17,206 --> 01:23:19,708
Jack begged Audrey to come back, 
 but she got a job

1385

at, of all places, a coffee shop.

1386
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:24,171

 - Ugh!

1387
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:27,966
- Ew! 
 - Ew!

1388
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,844
This is terrible!

1389
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:34,515
Hans succeeded in turning around 
 the company's factory in Thailand.

1390
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:37,059
But apparently he's still struggling 
 to cope with the local customs.

1391
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,520
- Back of bus! 
 - Excuse me?

1392
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:42,940
- You people belong back of bus, 
 - That's an outrage!

1393
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:45,901
Man, l'm not gonna let you treat me 
 like that merely because l'm,,,

1396
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:54,159
As for me, with my new promotion,

1397
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:57,204
I could at last write books 
 based on my own experiences.

1398
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:58,705
- So I did. 
 - Thank you,

 a career that she loved.

01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,462
You know, you ever heard 
 someone say that old expression.:

01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:08,757
''Why does everything bad 
 always happen to me?''

1402
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:12,803
Well, I don't get those people... 
 'cause I've learned that if they just stop

1403
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:19,601
and look around, they'd realize 
 that everything happens for a reason.
