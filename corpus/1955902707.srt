Yes. Well, um,

it might be

affecting their school work.

00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,166
Ms. Eskel. Ms. Skarlatos.
May I be quite frank?

36
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,797
Spencer is behind
on his reading.

37
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,029
Very behind.

38
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:29,396

too easily distracted.

ADD with you two?

In my opinion,

41
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,964
both Spencer and Alek suffer
from something called

00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,064

ADD.

It's not a quick jump,
Ms. Eskel.

As I previously mentioned,

47
00:03:45,798 --> 00:03:47,930
Spencer cannot concentrate
on his reading.

48
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,362

And Alek spends most of his
day staring out the window.

51
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:58,562
I'm sorry. Did you say that
Alek "looks out the window"?

52
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:00,429
Yes.

53
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,164
Just so I'm clear,

54
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,197
do the other kids
not look out the window?

55
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,696
There are things you can do
to help them focus.

56

- No, it's not okay.

00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,230
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to pinpoint you.

61
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,729
So, you're telling me that
I need to drug my child

to make your job easier.

63
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,329
These medications
will help them focus,

64
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,766
and it would be easier
for the boys...

65
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,662
If you don't
medicate them now,

66
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,662
they'll just
self-medicate later.

this is a good solution?

it's just statistics.

But statistically,

00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:42,265
they are more likely
to develop problems.

that you can do?

00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,195
Maybe we can write a letter.

accomplished much with my life.

At least before I could say

591
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:47,729
it's because
I hadn't really tried.

00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:53,794
You do. But did you notice
that our friend here

849
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,160

850
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,327

Spinal fluid, ma'am.

854
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,960
Correct. Spinal fluid.

855
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,960
And if your friend has
spinal fluid in his ears,

856
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,193
what does that tell us?

857
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:08,694

to his skull.

858
00:41:08,696 --> 00:41:10,560
Okay. So, to recap.

859
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:11,994
You just walked up
to a guy who was

860
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,760
already having a pretty
bad day to begin with

861
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,360
and you shove a piece of
silicone into his brain.

862
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:17,761
You just lobotomized him.

863
00:41:17,763 --> 00:41:19,794
Well, I figured I'd get that
in first so he could breathe

864
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:21,594
and then I'd move on to his
other stuff.

865
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:22,794
Okay, but sometimes you need

866
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:24,160
to deal with
the bleeding first.

867
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,427
SPENCER: So, I'd put
a tourniquet on it, then?

868
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:26,694
Not always.

869
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:28,194
What if the wound
was on the neck, say?

870
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,960
A tourniquet on the neck
is better known as a noose.

a different experience.

That's actually funny
you said that.
