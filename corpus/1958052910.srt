1
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:07,685
Whoo

2
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:08,880
Come on

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,217
Whoo

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,382
Come on

5
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,891
Whoo

6
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:13,891
Come on

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,018
Whoo

8
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,221
Come on

9
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:18,696
Who's the man
with the master plan?

10
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,926
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

11
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,663
Who's the man
with the master plan?

12
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:25,637
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

13
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:27,139
I used to kick it
with the thugs

14
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,504
Pushin' drugs
in the park

15
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,701
Makin' every mark

16
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,107
That was out
after dark

17
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:32,145
Stick 'em
for their loot

18
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:33,736
Cut 'em up,
then I'd dash

19
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:34,838
And when
I had to shoot

20
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,382
I'd nutted up
for the cash

21
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,441
Ran down the block
with my .45 Glock

22
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,952
Capped off a round,
everybody hit the ground

23
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,080
The next thing I heard
was a siren

24
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,647
Couldn't turn around,
money grip kept firin'

25
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:48,251
Runnin' for the ride,
I can't go inside

26
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,660
I'd rather that I died,
I got too much pride

27
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,029
I guess it's just something
that you can't understand

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,331
My gun's in my hand,
tell me who's the man?

29
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,871
Who's the man
with the master plan?

30
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,339
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

31
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:04,036
Who's the man
with the master plan?

32
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,375
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

33
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,914
Who's the man
with the master plan?

34
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:11,382
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

35
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,215
Who's the man
with the master plan?

36
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,448
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

37
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,991
I used to sell yayo
back in the day-o

38
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,391
Ran with the gang,
had all my homie's slang

39
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,929
Grams to the quarters,
I'm takin' all the orders

40
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:24,929
Makin' all the runs

41
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:26,295
Rakin' in the funds

42
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,199
I always got my gun,
it's that old 6-shooter

43
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,327
I'm the king
of the neighborhood

44
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:31,701
Crazy white peckerwood

45
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,740
People thinkin'
Danny lost his mind

46
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,297
It must have been
from all the wine, man

47
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,774
And all the hard times

48
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,107
Like chillin' in the park
in the dark with the crew

49
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,545
I'm always gettin' high,
I saw my man die

50
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,606
Now I got the work
and the dough

51
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:46,516
25 grand and
the 5 keys of blow

52
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,611
I got to relocate
and start all over

53
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:51,521
But watch it blow up
like a supernova

54
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,491
I keep my game in tight
and follow my plan

55
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,688
My gun's in my hand,
so tell me who's the man?

56
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,254
Who's the man
with the master plan?

57
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:02,324
10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90...

58
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:04,267
1...2...

59
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,670
Morning, Brenda.
Wanna get in?

60
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,265
Sorry, I got
man business.

61
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,309
Whoo!

62
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:12,607
Brenda's got man business.

63
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,839
Look at her, man.
Yo, check it out.

64
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:15,006
Check it out.
Check it out.

65
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,481
Yo, Brenda,

66
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,540
Damn!

67
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:19,778
That
was House of Pain

68
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:20,820
with ''Who's the Man?''

69
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,184
here on the Kid
Capri music show.

70
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,552
It's 55 degrees

Don't worry--I'm keeping

00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,042

Hey, hey, hey, slow down.

We only have so much time.

91
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,254
You understand, my brother?

92
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,255

You hear me, motherfucker?

99
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,521
Chill! Chill!

100
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,363
The F.C.C. is gonna

We want y'all

105
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,468
and feel the vibe
of New York City.

106

What do you think about
those condos, Albert?

109
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,986
I don't know why they building
them condos in Harlem, Nick.

110
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,390
It don't make no sense.

111
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:36,725
Black man can't live
in no condo.

112
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:37,888
I hear you.

113
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,488
Want some talcum powder
for your neck?

114
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,924
I love that talcum powder.

115
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,267
A condo's a good investment.

116
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:46,566
What you talking
about investments?

117
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,232
Give me
that $20 you owe me.

118
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,798
What $20?

119
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,241
Look, Gerald, everybody's
doing that B-boy thing.

120
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:53,108
Look like someone took
a chainsaw to their head.

121
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,272
Let me hook you up,
give you something new...

122
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,280
something fresh!

123
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,976
Yo, fuck
good and fresh, man.

124
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,848
Just hook my shit up
the regular way: fade.

125
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,945
Fade, fade, fade.
That's all everybody want.

126
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,114
Fade, fade, fade.

127
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,178
Fine, it's your head.

128
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,349
Back the fuck up
off me, man.

129
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:06,357
Why you touching me
like that for?

130
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,859
You know you like it.

131
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,520
You be my way soon.

132
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:10,528
Yo, whatever you say.

133
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,529
Save that shit.

134
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:12,690
That's right.
Whatever I say is right.

135
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,131
I'll ride you like...

136
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,363
one of them go-go
dancers on ''Soul Train.''

137
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,905
Lickin' her toes
all in my mouth.

138
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,703
Working myself up
toward her thighs.

139
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,869
Kissing ever so gently
around her gut.

140
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:28,574
Then I started
kissin' on her titties.

141
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,309
Then, you know
she's got a big mouth.

142
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,044
She says, um--she says...

143
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,415
''What you gonna do
with my lips?''

144
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,714
''I says, I'm gonna put
some crazy glue on you...

145
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,484
if you don't
shut the fuck up.''

146
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:39,286
You need to stop talking
all that shit, G.

147
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,553
Hey! Nigger dude...

148
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:41,889
I'm not talking no shit.

149
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:45,295
What you laughin' at, Ray,
with your ugly ass?

150
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:46,889
Look like you bit a brick.

151
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:47,899
He's right.

152
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,993
You through.

153
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,004
What's up, everybody?

154
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,096
Hey, how you doing?

155
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:54,105
Good, man.
What's up, man?

156
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,198
What's up, Roscoe?

157
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,244
What up? What up?
What up? What up?

158
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,778
Come on.
Get in the chair, man.

159
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,074
Come on, Roscoe,
get in the chair, man.

160
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:02,614
Yeah, Roscoe, get in
the chair, man.

161
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,913
Keep your dick fingers
off them clippers, man.

162
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:08,284
Look what you did to my shit
the last time I was in here.

163
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,186
That's in!
That's the new Hammer!

164
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:11,348
Fuck, Hammer, man.

165
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:13,654
My shit is like
George Fucking Jefferson, man.

166
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,786
My shit is backed up
like traffic, man.

167
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:16,886
Man, if he
don't want his cut...

168
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:18,021
can I get mine cut now?

169
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,463
You next!

170
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,464
Always next.

171
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,465
Motherfucker,
please!

172
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,501
Roscoe,
get in the chair!

173
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:23,695
It's got to be
an improvement.

174
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,862
Got to!

175
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,872
Yo, I'll kick
both your asses.

176
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:29,533
And we're
moving on up

177
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,633
Movin' up--

178
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,303
- Weezy--
- We--

179
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:36,314
Hello, fellas.

180
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,680
Hey, Nick.

181
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,683
Hey, Frankie.

182
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:39,684
Who's playing today?

183
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:40,879
I am!

184
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,080
Holy Mother of Mary.

185
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,350
Let's, uh,
just get going here, huh?

186
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,051
Give me my
8-2-1, Frank.

187
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,354
Give me 7-5-4.

188
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,258
1-8-4, and if
I don't make my rent,

189
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,956
I'm giving your number
to my landlord.

190
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,623
A little snippy there,
Mushmouth.

191
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,929
I really--I don't know
about your whole attitude.

192
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:58,736
Get your hands...

193
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,238
- Hey, Big Nick.
- Hey.

194
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,001
How long's the wait, man?

195
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,167
No wait at the end, Boogie.

196
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,403
...for letting me
touch his hair.

197
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:06,775
You the one that fucked
his hair up the last time.

198
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,814
Man, I wouldn't let them
2 brothers cut my taxes.

199
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,814
I think I'll wait.

200
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:10,815
Half price.

201
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:11,908
Half price, Roscoe.

202
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:13,612
Hey, Nick,
you playing today?

203
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,518
Uh, 4-6-2.
I feel lucky, Frankie.

204
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,112
Great. You love 4-6-2.

205
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,420
Hey, Nick, you really
know Sugar Ray Leonard?

206
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,290
Yup. I cut his hair
right in this chair.

207
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,886
Wow. You know,
I grew up with him

208
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,794
on 109th and Amsterdam
in the same building.

209
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,333
He grew up in Maryland,
Frankie.

210
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,301
A tremendous fighter.

211
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,703
Hey, Nick, why let
that white boy in here?

212
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:37,504
You just mad because
he makes more money than you do.

213
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,943
Damn squirrel makes
more than he does.

214
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,674
A crippled squirrel.

215
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:47,050
Uh-oh, Mushmouth Rockefeller,
come on, and sit down here.

216
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,144
Can I get a cut?

217
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:49,347
No wait down at the end.

218
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,720
- My man.
- What's up?

219
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:58,688
Hey, get that there
on the other side!

220
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,133
Adrian! Adrian!

221
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,937
All right, homes,
you're the victim...

222
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,637
of another Doctor Dré
and Ed Lover masterpiece.

223
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,509
Yo, man, what'd you do
to my hair, man?

224
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,048
And that'll be
17.50 plus tip.

225
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:17,674
Yo, man, what did you do
to my hair?

226
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,242
Damn!

227
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,584
You better put your head
in a bag, man.

228
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:26,318
I wouldn't let them brothers
cut my grass.

229
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:27,882
Shut up, K.K.
See, this is...

230
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:31,021
that new Wesley Snipes
''New Jack City, Part 6'' shit.

231
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,361
Man, Wesley Snipes
after the money ran out!

232
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,129
Oh, Wesley was here yesterday.
I gave him his last cut.

233
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,897
When was Wesley Snipes
in this chair, man?

234
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,029
When your ass was
at White Castle.

235
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,367
Now be quiet.

236
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,101
Come on. Why you gotta be
bullshitting everybody, man?

237
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,301
What did you do
to my hair, man?

238
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:44,843
Now, you gotta hold
your head at the angle.

239
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,038
Man, see, women are gonna think
you're a big Wesley Snipes.

240
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,377
Go, Wesley, go Wesley

241
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,747
Go, go, go Wesley

242
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:52,750
It's your birthday

243
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,218
Ed Lover, you a liar!

244
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,219
Yo, Brenda.

245
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,846
Shut up, Dré!

246
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,754
You been telling people
you're sleeping with me?!

247
00:07:58,825 --> 00:07:59,757
But, Brenda,
I ain't--

248
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,384
Don't ''But, Brenda'' me.

249
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,986
You ain't nothing
but a virgin anyway.

250
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:06,122
Who?! Me?!
Ed lover?!

251
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,565
I ain't no virgin.

252
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,761
I ain't!

253
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:10,860
Oh!

254
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,529
- Damn!
- Damn!

255
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:18,237
Ooh!

256
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:19,243
Fuck Tyson.

257
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:20,336
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

258
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,380
Fuck him.

259
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,675
So her panties
around my neck, right?

260
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,842
Around your neck?

261
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,681
Yeah, yeah, so she said to me,
''Ed, baby...

262
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,015
I want you to take
your hand''...

263
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,179
I bet she did.

264
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,552
''And put it right here...

265
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:31,920
'''cause you know
the way I like it...

266
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,253
when you put your hand
right there.''

267
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,258
Why are you lying to me?

268
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,192
Shut your lying mouth
and sweep, boy.

269
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:37,593
Oh, come on, Nick.

270
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:40,394
How come we always gotta sweep
up after everybody, man?

271
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,161
Yeah, Nick. We've been
here for over a year.

272
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:45,432
Ed, Dré, you know
I love you like sons, right?

273
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,665
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

274
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,900
We've gone through a whole
lot together, haven't we?

275
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,840
True. We've been
through a whole lot.

276
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,241
For the last 6 months,
all I've been getting...

277
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,906
is complaints
about your haircuts.

278
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,041
I ask you to straighten up.
You haven't done it.

279
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,551
You 2 are the worst
barbers in Harlem.

280
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,414
What you trying
to say, Nick?

281
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,117
I have to let you go.

282
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,750
Fired? Come on, Nick.
Come on, Nick.

283
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,761
Ain't nothing happening.
Nothing happening.

284
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,921
I'm serious.

285
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,431
You boys have got to find
careers for yourselves.

286
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,433
I was just reading
in the paper today...

287
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,627
the police force
is hiring brothers.

288
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:17,931
- The police?!
- The police?!

289
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,096
Uh-uh, Nick. Uh-uh.

290
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,196
Ain't trying
to be the man.

291
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:21,205
Dré, you trying
to be the man?

292
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,935
I am not trying
to be the man.

293
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,941
See that, Nick?

294
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,977
Dré don't want
to be the man.

295
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,068
I don't want
to be the man.

296
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,010
Nobody here wants
to be the man, Nick.

297
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,105
Give me one reason.

298
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,241
- Rodney King!
- Rodney King!

299
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,375
It's a job, boys.

300
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:34,283
It's too violent, Nick.
Man, we not doing that.

301
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,447
You're always watching
karate movies.

302
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,786
Man, those Bruce Lee movies
are B.S., man...

303
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,120
but when you the man...

304
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,184
people really shoot at you.

305
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,194
That's right.

306
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:44,958
Anyway,
we got another career.

307
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,328
What is it this week?

308
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,388
We're gonna be
nightclub promoters, man.

309
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:49,458
That'll be real risky
for you boys.

310
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,629
See, me and my man--we
live right on the edge, man.

311
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,195
I'll tell you what.

312
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:56,174
If you take the test,
you can stay here...

313
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,174
till you find out
the results.

314
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,870
If you don't...

315
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,469
I'll fire both
your asses right now.

316
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,343
What's wrong with you?!

317
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,144
I saw a rat, Nick.
What's up with that?

318
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,582
What you laughing at?

319
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,381
How can you be scared
of a little rat...

320
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:08,385
you big wuss?

321
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,716
Hey, Nick, I can't believe...

322
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,019
he pissed in his pants
over a little rat.

323
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,319
You're a wuss, man.

324
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:14,724
Knock it off, both of you!

325
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:18,059
If you don't take the test,
you won't get paid no more!

326
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,996
That's it!

327
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,697
Yo, man, come on.
Get back.

328
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,137
Come on, man, you
bad-haired motherfucker.

329
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,731
Go to the end
of the line, baby.

330
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,073
One line. One line.

331
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:36,673
Come on, man,
stop holding back.

332
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,183
Brother, chill out, man.

333
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:40,412
Yo, there ain't
no guest list.

334
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,418
So stop talking that.

335
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,217
There ain't no guest list.

336
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,815
Hey, ho

337
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:47,951
You drew a picture
of my morning

338
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,085
But you couldn't
make my day

339
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,356
I'm rockin'
and you're yawning

340
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,556
But you never
look my way

341
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:52,563
I'm lickin'
down you, darlin'

342
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:53,621
In every single way

343
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,031
Your funny flow
is foreign

344
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,568
And a green card's
on the way

345
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:57,762
This ain't got to do
with shampoo

346
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,236
But watch your
head and shoulders

347
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,364
Brother older bold enough
to fold ya, yo, I told ya

348
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,807
A raid afraid of what I made
plus played a funky fit

349
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,036
So save ya flips plus tricks

350
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,408
For that music
and the monkey bit

351
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,878
Thank you.

352
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,710
Dré needs you upstairs
right now.

353
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,249
It's an emergency.
Sweatin' his balls off.

354
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,114
All right.
Here go the money, Frankie.

355
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:14,210
Yo, George,
I'll be right back.

356
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,517
Frankie, it's $10.
No skimming.

357
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,113
I know. $10.

358
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:19,954
It's $15.

359
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:20,993
$20. $20.

360
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,618
- I'm sorry. $20.
- $20.

361
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,560
20-damn-dollars.
Get your ass on in there.

362
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,257
What you looking at,
old scarecrow?

363
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,697
Who you calling
a scarecrow?

364
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:30,133
40 for you.

365
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,296
Hey, ho

366
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,840
Hey, ho

367
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:37,637
Hey, ho

368
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,144
Hey, ho

369
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:42,044
You heard a lot about
a brother gaining mo' ground

370
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,810
Being low down,
I do the showdown

371
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,510
With any little ho round

372
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:46,677
I wanna know
who you're believing

373
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,084
Through your funny reasons

374
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,917
Even when I'm sleeping
you think I'm cheatin'

375
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:52,219
You said I know you're
Mr. O.P.P. Man

376
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,953
Yo, P.P. Man,
won't only see me, man

377
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,757
You should've known that
when we hit in the stack

378
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,263
That I was with it a bit,
not to consider the rep

379
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,857
I did your partner
cause she's hot as a baker

380
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:02,923
Cause I'm naughty by nature

381
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,526
Not cause I hate ya

382
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,198
You put your heart in a part
of a part that spreads apart

383
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,537
Even though I forgave ya
when you had a spark

384
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,076
Yo, man,
I'm telling y'all...

385
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:12,168
y'all got that look.

386
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,338
I could make y'all
the dopest rappers.

387
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,110
Hype, my man here
got crazy contacts.

388
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:19,014
Motherfucker, please.
Motherfucker, please.

389
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,677
Listen,
y'all, cockstrong.

390
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:21,720
When I finish with y'all,

391
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,380
y'all gonna be hotter
than Public Enemy...

392
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,981
E.P.M.D., and Vanilla Ice!

393
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,686
And Vanilla Ice.

394
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,022
Motherfucker, please.
Motherfucker, please.

395
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,062
Tell 'em.

396
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,118
Ho

397
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,858
Hey, ho

398
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,298
Hey, ho

399
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,030
Hey, ho

400
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,368
Hip-hop hip-hip-hop
hip-hip-hop hooray

401
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,566
There's many hungry
hip-hoppers

402
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,541
One reason
hip-hop's hip top today

403
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,577
Swerve what ya heard
cause I ain't bailing hay

404
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,045
Ain't choppin' no crops
but still growin' every day

405
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:49,843
Here's a thunder sound
from the wonders found

406
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,077
From the underground
town down the hill

407
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,085
Feel how illtown
drown smiles to frowns

408
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,313
Snatchin' crowns from clowns

409
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,480
Beat downs are found

410
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:57,750
Don't know me,
don't come around

411
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,416
Tippy tippy pause,
tippy tippy pause

412
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,221
Sometimes creepin' up
I eat em up

413
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:02,591
Your style is older
than Lou Rawls

414
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,857
Peace to this one
and that one and them

415
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,559
That's when I shout out
and I didn't miss one friend

416
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,931
Yo, man, Naughty By Nature
is ripping shit, man.

417
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:10,934
How we doing?

418
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,563
Yo, we cleared
about 2,000 so far, man.

419
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,697
- We way up.
- Aah!

420
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,173
That's 3 months' rent,
homeboy.

421
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:17,709
Yo, man, Nick
must have been crazy...

422
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,244
to make us take
that police test.

423
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,244
I'm telling you something,
man...

424
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:21,610
Nick's gonna be
frickin' surprised...

425
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,411
when he find out we ain't taking
nobody's police test.

426
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,416
You understand
what I'm saying?

427
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,146
And every hood, G

428
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,312
That's right,
my fight is ill

429
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,184
Peace goes to L.O.N.S.
and Quest

430
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:31,848
Nice and Smooth
and Cypress Hill

431
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:32,948
I live and die
for hip hop

432
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,322
This is hip hop of today

433
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:37,191
I give props to hip hop,
so hip hop hooray

434
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,560
Ho

435
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,792
Hey, ho

436
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:43,961
Hey, ho, hey

437
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,971
Everybody get the fuck
down on the floor!

438
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,105
Everybody
on the motherfucking floor!

439
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,909
Next person that moves is
dead in this motherfucker.

440
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,279
All right!
Give it up!

441
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,476
Give up all your shit!

442
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:01,486
Damn it!
This ain't no joke.

443
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:02,885
Don't fuck with me!
Give it here!

444
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,617
Put it in
the fucking bag!

445
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,625
Give it up!
Take it off!

446
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,991
Give it up!
Bring it over!

447
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,188
Give me the money, man.

448
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,664
Yo, give me--
yo, give me the money, man!

449
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,963
Real man don't need a gun.

450
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:16,967
Sucker.

451
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,162
Give me the fucking wallet.

452
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,704
Why don't you
get out of my face?

453
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,137
Damn.

454
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,176
Put your fucking head down.
What you looking at?!

455
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,807
Name?

456
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,039
Date of birth?

457
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,411
Social security number?!

458
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,744
Why they gotta know all that?

459
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,977
It's what you gotta do
on most job applications.

460
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:34,781
But I don't want
the damn job.

461
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:36,515
You got any other
bright ideas?

462
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,080
We're about to be evicted.

463
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,184
Why are you holding on
to this piece of property...

464
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,489
like it's your wife?

465
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:45,497
I got my stake here, Lionel,
don't you understand that?

466
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,192
Sell it, man.

467
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,131
It's just a barber shop.

468
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:50,760
You're being offered
a fortune.

469
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,862
You got junkies and
dealers in this block.

470
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,703
Later, man.

471
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:56,742
See you, Nick.

472
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:57,798
Bye to you, Lionel.

473
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,936
Good night, K.K.
Get home safe, son.

474
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,879
Lionel, look at the pictures
on my wall here.

475
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,680
Muhammad Ali, Marvin Gaye,
Adam Clayton Powell.

476
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:09,778
I cut Adam Clayton Powell's
hair in this chair.

477
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,323
I was so nervous,
I almost cut the man.

478
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,655
Just look
outside the window.

479
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,719
You got pipeheads
and crack dealers...

480
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,129
right out there.

481
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,724
The kids can't play
in the street anymore.

482
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:26,203
Didn't used to be
like that, Nicky.

483
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:29,036
We've got to get all this
bad shit outta here.

484
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,406
L.D., how we gonna get the bad
shit out with me selling?

485
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,536
We've got to stay here,
brother.

486
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,638
The people have got to take
responsibility for this mess...

487
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,148
not the government...

488
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,774
and not some outside
real estate developer...

489
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,751
like the one
you're working for. Here.

490
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:46,150
Demetrius is not
the problem, Nicholas.

491
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:49,194
He's just a white boy
with a lot of money...

492
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,729
and if he wants
to invest up here...

493
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,287
I say let's get a taste.

494
00:15:55,768 --> 00:16:00,899
Every man's free to make his
own choices, right, L.D.?

495
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,969
Don't forget
who you are, brother.

496
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,103
Don't forget who you are.

497
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,814
Ed, Dré, lock up.

498
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:11,975
All right, Nick.

499
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,211
See you later, Lionel.

500
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,275
Good night.

501
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,995
No show.
Give me all.

502
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,763
Get it, yo.
Get yours, yo.

503
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,394
Love it, Rashid.

504
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,462
I'm telling you...

505
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,304
don't let me catch you
on this block again.

506
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,970
Yo, man, put that gun down,
man. What's up with you?

507
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,344
Cool out, man.
I know this old fool.

508
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:45,612
You gonna be sorry you ever
pulled a gun on me, old man.

509
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:47,084
I remember when your mother
would bring you...

510
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,245
to my shop for haircuts.

511
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,754
Now you're out here
selling stuff to your people.

512
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,687
You got Billy and Rashid
out here with you.

513
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:53,486
You know what
you need to do, man?

514
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,754
You need to get that gun
the fuck out my face...

515
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,295
because you ain't
fittin' to use it, man.

516
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,796
Take Dracula with you.

517
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,957
Yeah, fuck all you
motherfuckers.

518
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,796
Fuck you old ass bastards, man.

519
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:03,926
Yadda, yadda.

520
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,800
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

521
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,499
Yeah, next time we'll
rip you a new asshole...

522
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,166
you stupid son of a bitch.

523
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:11,504
They're breakin'
my heart, man.

524
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:13,010
These kids are
breakin' my heart.

525
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,411
I know. Put your gun away now.
Put your gun away.

526
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,450
Yeah, it's all right.
Let's get out of here.

527
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,576
Let me buy you a drink, man.

528
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,317
Yo, man, you eat
some of my chips?

529
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,187
Why you always
think about food, man?

530
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,247
I don't always think
about food.

531
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,418
I think about
other things.

532
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:29,426
That's all you worried about.

533
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:30,757
You don't think
about nothing else.

534
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,956
I think about
some other stuff.

535
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,259
What?

536
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:36,358
Girls, man: Tall ones,
short ones, big ones--

537
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,665
Please, Dré. Please.

538
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,797
Ed Lover, what's up, man?
How you doing?

539
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:43,865
Yo, Jose, what's up, man?
I'm just coolin', man.

540
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,376
- Word.
- Who's that?

541
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:46,809
That's my man,
Jose Gomez, man.

542
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,471
We stole a car together
when we was 15.

543
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:49,514
I ain't seen him since.

544
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:51,641
Hey, yo, Jose,
this is my man Dré.

545
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,651
Yo, what's up, Dré?
How you doing, man?

546
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:54,947
Word up, man.

547
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,386
Yeah, Jose, say hi to
your sister for me, man.

548
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,981
Yeah, don't even try that.

549
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,720
I am John Boothby.

550
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:02,988
I'm the proctor.

551
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,086
The what?!

552
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,095
What's a proctor?

553
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,655
This is the standard
police exam.

554
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,360
Please answer
all the questions...

555
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,665
to the best
of your abilities,

556
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:15,229
and don't forget to use
your number 2 pencils.

557
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:18,637
Begin.

558
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,949
- Yo, man.
- What's up?

559
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,254
How you finish
the test so fast?

560
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,295
I spelled ''abbacadaba''
all the way down.

561
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,294
You did what?

562
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,958
I spelled ''abbacadaba''
all the way down.

563
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:18,561
My man! Yo, I did the same
exact thing, man.

564
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,332
No way we passing that test.

565
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,668
Definitely not.

566
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,969
Look, man, you were
not with Lorraine, man.

567
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,674
I'm telling you.
Last night at my house...

568
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:30,976
on the couch, man.

569
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,982
I don't believe you.

570
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,348
- Me and lorraine.
- No.

571
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,784
She's all over me, man.
I'm telling you.

572
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,049
Yo, I heard y'all
2 wanted to be the man.

573
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,054
What's up with that?

574
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,647
Nah, man,
we flunked that test.

575
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:40,657
Ain't nothing happening.

576
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,489
So why you wanna
be the man, anyway?

577
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,758
Why? What do you
2 knuckleheads wanna be?

578
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:46,763
What you think?

579
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:47,890
Rappers.
Rappers.

580
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:48,899
Rappers?!

581
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,095
You 2 can't even
dress yourselves.

582
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,161
Yeah, suckers!

583
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,468
A bunch of wise-apples, man.

584
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,534
You want apples?
3 for $1.00.

585
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,045
I also got grapes!

586
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,842
Special on tomatoes.

587
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,746
Hey! Where you going?!

588
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,680
Now, look, Lionel.

589
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:10,085
I hired you to acquire
certain properties in Harlem.

590
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:13,181
I must say I'm very
chagrined...

591
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,556
that your friend Nick...

592
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,654
who owns a very important part
of that Godforsaken block...

593
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,757
has refused to sell to me.

594
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:25,702
I can't make any moves
until I acquire his property.

595
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,238
I've done everything
I possibly--

596
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,104
No, you haven't!

597
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:33,474
You must take care of this.

598
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,537
We had a deal.

599
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:39,141
And if you renege on it...

600
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,482
I'll give your markers
back as a gift...

601
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:44,352
to the guys that you
owe that money to.

602
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:48,860
Now, that would be
very unfortunate.

603
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,875
Joey, what happened here?

604
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,706
Building burnt down
this afternoon...

605
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:41,302
and of course the fire
department was late...

606
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,109
just like they was
last week up the block.

607
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,514
Ain't nobody looking out
for us out here, man.

608
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:46,676
Damn!

609
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:48,947
Nick, where we gonna live?
Where we gonna go, man?

610
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,386
What's the landlord doing
about this?

611
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,787
That Demetrius ain't nothin'.

612
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:53,882
That motherfucker
don't give a Goddamn...

613
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,859
about what happens to
none of us around here.

614
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:57,054
He owns this building?

615
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:58,391
He owns most
of the neighborhood.

616
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,460
These people gonna stay
in the church tonight.

617
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:02,795
I'll--I'll let you in.
Come on.

618
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:03,800
Bring your children with me.

619
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:04,801
We're going with Nick, man.

620
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,303
Come on,
let's go with Nick.

621
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:08,636
Fuck Demetrius.
Let's get out of here, man.

622
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:10,368
Later for this fire department.

623
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,610
Look at Jed Clampett.

624
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,873
The man shoots
at a possum...

625
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,141
and strikes oil.

626
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:17,876
How come that shit
don't happen to us?

627
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,247
This ain't Hollywood, man.

628
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:20,580
This is Homeywood.

629
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:22,052
I want to be
Jed Clampett.

630
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,383
What for?

631
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,753
He's got a phat house
in Beverly Hills!

632
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:27,155
With his granny.

633
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,750
He's got more money
than Bill Cosby.

634
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,590
You ever see Jed Clampett
with a woman?

635
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:31,789
He's got a swimming pool.

636
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:34,196
You can't swim.

637
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:35,665
Elly May is fly.

638
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:37,395
You right.
Elly May is fly.

639
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,369
But they're related,
and if you Jed Clampett...

640
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:41,565
you got that fool Jethro
living with you.

641
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,369
Man, l'd kick
his monkey ass out.

642
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:44,602
But you can't do
none of that...

643
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:45,871
'cause you
here with me, Dré.

644
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:47,502
And you ain't never
gonna get rich...

645
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,241
and you ain't moving
to Beverly Hills.

646
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,806
Is anything ever
gonna happen to us?

647
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,911
Someday, my brother.

648
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:56,955
That's it?

649
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:59,183
Life ain't
no TV show, Dré.

650
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:00,987
Look at that fool
Jethro, man!

651
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,584
I hate that motherfucker!

652
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,959
Throw his ass out, Jed!
Get him out!

653
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,021
We are not going
to the police academy...

654
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:08,031
are we?

655
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,364
Ain't no way
that's gonna happen, man.

656
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,427
No way, no how.

657
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,801
You are police officers now!

658
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:18,502
Being a police officer
is about one thing!

659
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,704
Who knows what that is?!

660
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,679
Harassing
black people.

661
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,184
It's about order!

662
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:30,688
We are the people
who have to maintain order!

663
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,748
Order in our own lives,
and order on the job!

664
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:36,727
That means you can't go
into a fried chicken joint...

665
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:39,821
and eat the Goddamn
party plate anymore!

666
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,525
Is that clear?!

667
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,862
- Why not?
- What?!

668
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:43,993
He said why not?

669
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,367
And if my man likes
fried chicken, he can--

670
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,702
I don't like
your attitude, boy!

671
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,571
Boy is a white
racist word.

672
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,269
Shut the fuck up, pig!

673
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,868
I know how
you got in here...

674
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,505
and I'm gonna
be watching you!

675
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,019
Did you see him
wrinkle my shirt, man?

676
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,680
Yeah, he fucked up
your shirt.

677
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,725
Did you see him wrinkle
my shirt, man?

678
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,282
What's wrong with
old Mr. Clean?

679
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,590
Black Kojak trying
to be better than Baretta.

680
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,596
Freeze!

681
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:14,690
Oh!

682
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,938
Every once in a while,
there are civilian losses.

683
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,439
Try to avoid it.

684
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,802
Next!

685
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,505
Ready...

686
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,488
What the hell?!
Get out of here!

687
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,580
Next!

688
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:39,646
Ready...

689
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,192
Ooh!

690
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,666
Get--get out of here!

691
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:52,033
You are gonna last about
2 minutes on the street!

692
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,038
Next!

693
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,937
No, no, no, y'all!

694
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,908
You're gonna blow
your johnsons off.

695
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,103
Do it police style!

696
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,950
That's uptown style.

697
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:14,219
Gimme some.

698
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,624
Get back in line!

699
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,059
Ow!

700
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,058
Captain...

701
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,828
they screwed up every drill,
every exercise...

702
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:26,962
and they have no respect
for police regulations.

703
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,301
You know, when I was
in Vietnam with Nick...

704
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,340
he was just like you 2.

705
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,171
He had no time
for regulations...

706
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:33,268
but he was a helluva lot
smarter than you 2 clowns...

707
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,245
and he could get away with it.

708
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,179
You were in 'Nam with Nick?

709
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,614
You don't think
you got in here...

710
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,515
by the merit system, do you?

711
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:44,215
Now get your act together
and do what Griles says.

712
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,314
Now get the hell
out of here.

713
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:49,292
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

714
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:00,537
Take it easy on them,
Sergeant.

715
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:01,937
They're all right.

716
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,998
Yes, sir.

717
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:06,933
Amen!

718
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,001
Amen!

719
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,570
Amen!

720
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,548
I know God heard us today!

721
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:12,982
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,541
One of our community
leaders...

723
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,453
has asked to speak
to you today.

724
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:18,511
Is it all right?

725
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,852
Yes!

726
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:20,914
Is it all right?

727
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:25,223
Let's have an amen
for our brother...

728
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,229
Deacon Nick Crawford.

729
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:28,493
Amen!

730
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,558
Thank you very much.
Thank you, brother.

731
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,137
We in the Harlem community...

732
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,541
are faced with the threat
of creeping gentrification.

733
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,442
Oh, that's a fancy word.

734
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:44,004
It means that people move
to your block...

735
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:46,050
and make it nice.

736
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,142
They make it so nice...

737
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,777
you can't afford
to live there...

738
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:51,755
unless you a judge,
or something like that.

739
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:54,383
Now, we have got to let
the people behind this...

740
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,654
know what time it is.

741
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:01,856
We have got to gain control
of our neighborhood.

742
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:04,596
We need to support
our own businesses.

743
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,003
We need to own
our own homes.

744
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,267
We need to take Harlem back!

745
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,605
Now, I'm gonna
lead a demonstration...

746
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,548
to stop these condos...

747
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:20,778
and I want to see
all y'all there!

748
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:23,446
Give us back our
neighborhood!

749
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,114
Don't go on,
the strip is good...

750
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,090
Give us back
our neighborhood!

751
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,922
Don't go on,
the strip is good...

752
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,586
To protest
the gentrification of Harlem...

753
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:32,527
by outside developers.

754
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,030
Our own Ralph McDaniels
was on-site...

755
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,533
to interview the organizer
of the march Nick Crawford.

756
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,533
Do you really think
you'll be able...

757
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:38,534
to stop Demetrius?

758
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,570
The man has got
to be stopped.

759
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:41,037
He's turning people
from their homes.

760
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,300
The people in Harlem
have got to stop...

761
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:43,602
the colonization
of their neighborhood.

762
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:46,644
We have to give ownership
back to these people.

763
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:47,872
You can't keep 'em
down on the plantation.

764
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:48,878
They got to rise up.

765
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,676
He says he's building condos.

766
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,977
I don't see
no building going on.

767
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,039
Oh, no, Dré!
Look, man!

768
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:54,745
Nick's on TV!

769
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,584
The big problem in Harlem
is Demetrius.

770
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:58,953
Crawford is a local merchant...

771
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,582
who has owned
a barber shop...

772
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,286
You call us, boss?

773
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:08,260
I need to talk to you
about a problem I'm having.

774
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,001
I'm telling you,
Redd Foxx is alive.

775
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,593
Man, you crazy!

776
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,663
Redd Foxx ain't alive!

777
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,231
No, he's not dead.

778
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,606
He faked his own death...

779
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:19,939
so the I.R.S. wouldn't
come looking for him.

780
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,479
Oh, God.

781
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:22,535
Him and Sammy Davis...

782
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,912
are hiding out
together out in Las Vegas.

783
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,451
Redd Foxx dead!

784
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,713
Yo, man.

785
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:30,220
I want my initials
on the side of my head.

786
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:31,516
Oh, no. See,
where you been, son?

787
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,114
That was last year.

788
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:34,988
Why don't you let me
style you, baby?

789
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,494
Make you look like Peabo.

790
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,329
- Oh, shit!
- What the hell?

791
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,664
What up?

792
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,202
Wait. Wait.
Hold up, guys.

793
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,204
Now--now this
is fucked up!

794
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,001
Oh, lookee here.
Lookee here.

795
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,065
My boys are cops.
Well, all right.

796
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:52,576
Wait. Hold up, man.
You mean to tell me...

797
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,009
they gave y'all guns?

798
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,910
Say, who in the fuck...

799
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,915
believe you 2
niggers cops, man?

800
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:59,678
Look at you--looking
like before and after.

801
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:00,809
I swear to God.

802
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,444
I wish you would
try to arrest me.

803
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,318
You'd be wearing 3 shoes.

804
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:08,189
2 on your feet,
and one in your ass.

805
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,318
Back off, man.

806
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,589
I know y'all brothers
ain't doing no real work.

807
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:14,154
I bet y'all writin'
parking tickets.

808
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:16,530
Y'all need to represent...

809
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,263
comin' here with
that bullshit, man!

810
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:20,565
Hold it!

811
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,674
We're here to fight
the forces of evil...

812
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:24,674
to make the streets safe...

813
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,370
for you people to walk on.

814
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:27,776
So don't fuck with us.

815
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,847
Y'all are police!

816
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,180
It's wonderful!

817
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,719
Come on.
Come on.

818
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,118
Come on, man!

819
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:39,987
What? I love
a man in uniform.

820
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,397
You're looking mighty fly...

821
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,568
in that uniform,
Officer Dré.

822
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:01,373
Looking mighty fly yourself,
Officer Lover.

823
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,038
Man, this is
a trip, Dré.

824
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,582
I never thought
we could be cops.

825
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:05,581
You know we're going
to have to do...

826
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,641
a lot of explaining
in the street.

827
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,811
Yo!

828
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:10,445
Isn't that Jawaan's jeep?

829
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,319
Yeah, that's
his jeep, man.

830
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,322
I'm going
to pull him over...

831
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,382
so I can get
my $10 he owes me.

832
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,878
I don't understand, man.
What's going on, man?

833
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,321
I'm just here
chillin' like.

834
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,415
You see us
with our people...

835
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,516
me and my mens-like.

836
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,220
What's going on?
Why's we being prohibited?

837
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,819
Jawaan.

838
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:53,296
Oh, shit!

839
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:55,390
Ed Lover. You the man?

840
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,526
That's right, Jawaan.
I'm the man.

841
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:58,534
Who's the man?

842
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,468
Ed Lover's the man? Damn!

843
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,699
Yo, Jawaan!

844
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:03,673
Doctor Dré?!

845
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:05,073
You the man, too?

846
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,043
Oh, that shit
is fucked up, kid!

847
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:09,171
Fucked up!

848
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,370
OK, OK. Listen up.

849
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,382
Listen up. Quiet!

850
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,782
Put the magazines away, now!

851
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:16,480
You guys are
not selling enough...

852
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:17,783
of these
raffle tickets, OK?

853
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:19,483
Somebody's gonna win
this trip to the Poconos.

854
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,082
Get on the stick
with this, all right?

855
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,091
OK.

856
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,092
Number one:

857
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,321
- Barnes.
- Here.

858
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:25,624
I want you to go up
to 153rd Street.

859
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:26,664
Keep the gang members
away from the old ladies...

860
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:27,663
all right?

861
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:28,664
Got it.

862
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:29,995
- Day!
- Here.

863
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,501
I want you to go up
to St. Peter's.

864
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,731
Get the crackheads out of
the bake sale, all right?

865
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,568
And get that hair
out of your face.

866
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,800
Thank you.

867
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,433
All right. Uh...

868
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,341
Uh... Louver?

869
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,744
Lever?

870
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:44,179
Lover, Sergeant.

871
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,645
Lover.

872
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:51,882
And, uh...

873
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:54,118
Dree?

874
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:55,216
Dru?

875
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:56,317
Dra?

876
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:57,486
That's Dré, Sergeant.

877
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:58,688
Dré...

878
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,527
Doctor...Dré.

879
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,897
Yes, sir.

880
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,195
Everybody else dismissed.

881
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:08,967
Dree, Larva,
up here, now.

882
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,053
Lover.

883
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,089
Yes, sir?

884
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:26,851
Have a doughnut.

885
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,086
Thank you, Sarge.

886
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Doc.

887
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:38,494
Doctor...Dré.

888
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,095
Let me ask you something.
You got a stethoscope?

889
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:43,436
No. Do you, uh--
do you work in a hospital?

890
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,736
- No.
- Do you have any patients?

891
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:46,538
No, no, no.

892
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,409
Did your mother
give that name by birth?

893
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,413
No.

894
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,541
You just decided
to become a doctor?

895
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,245
Yeah. OK. Uh...

896
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,949
Can I borrow
your billy club, please?

897
00:32:59,024 --> 00:32:59,956
Thank you.

898
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,014
Ahem.

899
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:05,052
Ahem!

900
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,188
Mother--

901
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:14,835
Thank you.

902
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,430
You know, my, uh, brother...

903
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:19,705
went to school for 8 years
and took out $350,000...

904
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,109
in federally financed
student loans...

905
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,942
that he's paying back
at an interest rate of 18%.

906
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,914
So he should be done
paying that about...

907
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:26,814
I don't know--when he's
about 75 years old...

908
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:30,286
just so he can
call himself Dr. Cooper!

909
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,648
Excuse me, Sarge...

910
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,386
mind if I have
a doughnut?

911
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:38,929
No...

912
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,589
you may not have
a doughnut, OK?

913
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,599
You will never have
a doughnut again, ever.

914
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,464
You will never have
another doughnut, OK?

915
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:45,730
Lover can have as many
doughnuts as he wants.

916
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:46,736
He can have
a dozen doughnuts.

917
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:47,794
He can have 2 dozen doughnuts.

918
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,396
He can strap a fag bag
full of doughnuts...

919
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,771
around his waist
when he goes to work.

920
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,106
He can have a giant doughnut
on the top of the squad car, OK?

921
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,770
But you will never
have another doughnut.

922
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,279
You can't even say
the word ''doughnut.''

923
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,872
Do you understand?
The word ''doughnut''...

924
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,940
is no longer
in your vocabulary, OK?

925
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,246
If you meet
a guy named Don...

926
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,014
you call him by
his last name from now on.

927
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:05,488
That's the way it works.
No bagels. No life savers.

928
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:07,354
Nothing round
with a hole in it! Nothing!

929
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,917
Now...here's the situation.

930
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:13,327
You guys are the good guys...

931
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:16,799
and you chase and arrest
the bad guys.

932
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,301
What a surprise, huh?

933
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,428
It's a good system.
It works.

934
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,529
And here's your assignment:
all of Harlem, OK?

935
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:22,664
From Lennox Ave.
to the river.

936
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,174
And I want all crime
and all drugs...

937
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,903
stamped out
by 6:00 tonight, OK?

938
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:27,410
You got that, Doc?

939
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,411
Dismissed...

940
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
Larva.

941
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,250
Larva?

942
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:39,415
What kind of doughnuts
they got over there, man?

943
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,460
Oh, a whole lot.
A wide assortment.

944
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,459
Jelly?

945
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:47,157
Jelly, eclair, crullers.

946
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:48,859
Think I can get some?

947
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:50,867
The long ones
with the cream.

948
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:51,902
Those, too.

949
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,631
Jesus.

950
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:57,438
This is a piece of junk.

951
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:58,908
I can't believe
they give us...

952
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,070
this big hunk
of scrapola, man.

953
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,137
At least we got a car.

954
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,511
What you complaining about?

955
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,015
I think the sergeant
dissed you, man.

956
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,016
I don't know.

957
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:08,347
I think the sergeant
kind of likes me.

958
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,183
No, I'm telling you.
He dissed you.

959
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,246
Come on.
Let's go see Bubba.

960
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,951
Yo, man. Remember that old
TV show ''Mod Squad?''

961
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,050
That was some
dope shit, man.

962
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,059
Oh, hell, yeah.

963
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,153
Clarence Williams III
was Mack Daddy!

964
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,925
You know, that big
Afro-wearin' brother--

965
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:22,694
you know he was goin'
with Peggy Lipton, right?

966
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:23,927
The white girl?

967
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,334
The same white girl that
got married to Quincy Jones.

968
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:27,735
She's into that
black culture shit...

969
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,740
or some shit like that.
You know what I'm saying?

970
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,435
Get up against the wall!

971
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,136
Oh, man!

972
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:35,577
Man, why the cops
always hassling us?

973
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,478
Now, drop your pants
around your ankles...

974
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,211
and sing me a tribute
to your favorite black woman.

975
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:42,310
They want to see
our butts or something?

976
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,319
Sing!

977
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:44,685
Super fine

978
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,258
She's got it going on

979
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,157
Something's going wrong

980
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,217
Super fine

981
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,388
Well, boys.

982
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:53,396
Super fine

983
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:54,397
You guys sing real good.

984
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:55,592
Hey, my man, what's up?

985
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,793
Shut up.
Yo, Bubba, man.

986
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,233
Can you do some magic
to this car?

987
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,736
Yeah...

988
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:02,830
I always wanted
to soup up a police car.

989
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:03,839
Word up.

990
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm telling you, man.

991
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,100
When I get that
police car...

992
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,667
I'm going to turn it
into a lovemobie.

993
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,213
I want fur pillows,
reclining seats--

994
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,579
Damn! I forgot
to tell Bubba about the VCR.

995
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,844
Are you Ed Lover?

996
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,079
The one and only, baby.

997
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,086
Ow.

998
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:18,918
That's for my sister Lorena...

999
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,685
you ain't bonin'.

1000
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,521
Lover, come here and
check this out, man.

1001
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:24,425
She just knocked
the shit out of me.

1002
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:25,861
You didn't see that?

1003
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,522
Forget that, man. Come over here
and check this out, man.

1004
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,534
I don't know nobody
named Lorena.

1005
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,433
Oh, OK.

1006
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,405
They've been drilling
down here for about 6 months.

1007
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,407
Man, it don't look like
they're building...

1008
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:38,874
any condominiums over here.

1009
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,138
Let's go see what
they are building.

1010
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,049
Yo. Pull the stake
and bring it in the corner.

1011
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,417
Excuse me.
The far corner.

1012
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:51,420
Excuse me.

1013
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:52,478
What are you guys doing?

1014
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,218
Just taking
soil samples.

1015
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:56,351
Soil samples?
What for?

1016
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:57,655
Standard procedure, Officer.

1017
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:59,697
We check the soil before
we start construction.

1018
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:02,995
So it's OK if we borrow
one of your soil samples?

1019
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,500
Uh, I don't think
that's possible.

1020
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:05,627
Why not?

1021
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,227
There's enough dirt
around here for everybody.

1022
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:08,738
This is private property.

1023
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,831
Well, how about
if we just borrow...

1024
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:12,604
some of your
private property?

1025
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:15,674
I don't think
Mr. Demetrius...

1026
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:16,975
would like that very much.

1027
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:20,415
You tell Mr. Demetrius
to kiss my ass.

1028
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:23,852
Come on. We got to go talk
to Nick. Come on. Let's go.

1029
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,389
Private property.

1030
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,686
Soil sample.

1031
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:42,728
Precious Lord

1032
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,569
Take my hand

1033
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:54,635
Lead me on

1034
00:38:54,712 --> 00:39:00,742
Let me stand

1035
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:05,255
I am tired

1036
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:10,386
And I am weak

1037
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:17,333
But I am worn

1038
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:18,562
Oh

1039
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:23,429
Through the storm

1040
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:29,208
Through the storm
and the night

1041
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,212
Oh

1042
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,910
Lead me

1043
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:40,151
Lead me on
to the light

1044
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:43,159
Take my hand

1045
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:47,926
Oh, precious Lord

1046
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:53,437
And oh

1047
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:54,471
We love you

1048
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,507
Brother Nick,
we love you

1049
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,405
We'll always love you

1050
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:06,110
And that precious Lord

1051
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:07,412
Oh oh

1052
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,010
Oh, that precious Lord

1053
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:13,023
We just need you,
need you, need you

1054
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:17,892
Need you,
n-n-n-need you

1055
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:22,922
Oh, precious Lord

1056
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:26,963
Appreciate that, man.

1057
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:28,005
I'm sorry.

1058
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:29,061
Thanks a lot
for coming.

1059
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,072
You're welcome.

1060
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,073
Thank you so much.

1061
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,905
Thanks.

1062
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:33,909
Hey.

1063
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,502
Hey, what's happening, man?

1064
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,309
You guys remember
my niece Teesha.

1065
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,372
She was in Europe
for the past few years.

1066
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,247
That's definitely
home's loss.

1067
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,251
Thank you.

1068
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,514
Teesha.

1069
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:44,987
Would y'all excuse me
for a second?

1070
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,546
I'm sorry to hear
about Nick.

1071
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,421
- Sure.
- I'll be back.

1072
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,518
Can I have a word
with you guys?

1073
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,621
- What's up?
- In private.

1074
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,365
I talked with Nick's
lawyer this morning.

1075
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,236
You guys have been
named in the will.

1076
00:41:03,307 --> 00:41:05,639
He left you
the barber shop.

1077
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,905
- The barber shop?
- Damn.

1078
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:09,207
And I know some people
that'll pay you...

1079
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,077
a lot of money
for that property.

1080
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:13,617
See, I don't care
about money right now, man.

1081
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:15,879
I just want to find out
who killed Nick.

1082
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:17,511
Maybe it was
the same people...

1083
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,453
that's been
setting these fires.

1084
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,651
You have any other
ideas, Lionel?

1085
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,024
He had a nasty exchange...

1086
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:26,120
with that
crack dealer Chauncey.

1087
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:27,425
Thanks, Lionel.

1088
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:28,430
- Thanks Lionel.
- See you later.

1089
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,431
Come on, Dré.

1090
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,161
Damn! Chauncey!

1091
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,806
- Bubba.
- Yo, B.

1092
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,468
How's the ride?

1093
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:41,477
It freaks.

1094
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,706
Let's get him.

1095
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,183
Whoever burned
this barber shop down...

1096
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,877
knew exactly
what they were doing.

1097
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,078
It's going to cost
a fortune...

1098
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:23,848
to put this place
back on its feet, man.

1099
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,185
Yeah. Money we ain't got
right now, partner.

1100
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,691
Money we ain't
never gonna have.

1101
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:31,059
Shit.

1102
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:32,891
Hey, yo, Dré,
check this out, man.

1103
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,329
What you got
there, man?

1104
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,559
This look
familiar to you?

1105
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:40,228
Nick never owned
a gun like this.

1106
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,737
This ain't Nick's gun.

1107
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:43,103
Let's bring it to Fuji.

1108
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,403
Fuji!

1109
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,310
Can you do a test
on this thing?

1110
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:51,507
Test on what?

1111
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,140
- Test on gun.
- Gun kill Nick?

1112
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:54,650
- Do a test.
- On the gun.

1113
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,346
- When you want?
- Today is good.

1114
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,047
- Today?
- On the gun.

1115
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,453
On the gun?

1116
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:01,582
No need.
Gun German.

1117
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:02,683
Cannot be traced.

1118
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:05,654
An untraceable German gun?

1119
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,220
- Later, Fuj.
- Later, Fuj.

1120
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:08,230
- Hai.
- Hai.

1121
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:09,288
Hai.

1122
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,865
Eh, Doctor Dré, Ed Lover...

1123
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:14,632
what a pain in the ass.

1124
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,074
Say, brother...

1125
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,410
say, brother...

1126
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:27,007
you need to get off
that stuff, man.

1127
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,483
That's stunting your growth.

1128
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:29,644
Damn, Dré,
if you're the man...

1129
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,848
I've definitely been
on the crack pipe too--whoa!

1130
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:38,256
Man, Chauncey's not here.

1131
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,291
Wait a minute.

1132
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:52,233
Baby, you should
be up outta here.

1133
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,244
Yeah. Don't be...

1134
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,246
Baby, I got money.
You buggin'.

1135
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:58,145
Excuse me.

1136
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:03,250
What's up...Chauncey?

1137
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,551
Name's Nighttrain,
all right, nigger?

1138
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:07,318
Your name is Chauncey?

1139
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,086
Vanessa, shut the fuck up.

1140
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,627
What is this, man?

1141
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,128
Halloween or some shit?

1142
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,426
Your eyes do not
deceive you, brother.

1143
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:15,430
Say, man, you
know anything...

1144
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:16,932
about Nick's murder, man?

1145
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,400
I know something about it.

1146
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:19,561
I know homeboy got smoked...

1147
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:20,695
but I ain't got
shit to do with it.

1148
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:21,760
I ain't got no
beef with him, man.

1149
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:22,931
Yo, man!
What's up, huh?

1150
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:24,872
Mmm-mmm.

1151
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:28,236
Oh, shit!

1152
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:30,576
Who's going to pay for
my fucking booze, pig?

1153
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:31,615
Mind yours!

1154
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:33,206
Where'd you get the piece
from, Chauncey?!

1155
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:35,275
My name is Nighttrain, fool!

1156
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:36,285
Yo, man!

1157
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,286
Where'd you get
the gun from, man!

1158
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:38,822
It fell off a fucking
truck, all right?

1159
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,052
Come on, man!
What's up here?

1160
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:43,616
Ooh...

1161
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:46,822
Oh, OK. Uh-huh.

1162
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:49,127
Now I got you on
gun charges and drug charges.

1163
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,963
You tell me a story.

1164
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,059
Look, man...

1165
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:53,797
you need to just cool
the fuck out on me, man.

1166
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:55,600
You need to be talking
to Lorenzo Martin--

1167
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:57,368
315 West 137 Street--

1168
00:44:57,441 --> 00:45:00,035
but I ain't no
motherfucking snitch.

1169
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:03,341
You ain't heard that
from me, man.

1170
00:45:03,414 --> 00:45:04,676
What you lookin' at?

1171
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:16,725
Anybody want
to go for a swim?

1172
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:19,524
Y'all folks
have a nice day.

1173
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:20,529
Let's go, Dré.

1174
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:21,860
Later, Chauncey.

1175
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,160
Nighttrain.

1176
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:24,599
Nighttrain, man!

1177
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,067
Nighttrain!

1178
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,069
You...

1179
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:30,107
don't even try.

1180
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:36,042
It don't look like
Lorenzo lives there.

1181
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,707
I think Chauncey played
us like a B-side, man.

1182
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,216
I told you he was frontin'.

1183
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,842
You didn't say
nothing, Dré.

1184
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:44,649
Ed, look, man, you don't
listen to nobody, man.

1185
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:47,384
All you do is lie about all
the women that you ain't got.

1186
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,358
Please, man, OK?

1187
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:51,691
Central, this is car 2899.

1188
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:53,957
l need an address
on a Chauncey Jackson...

1189
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,465
A.K.A.: Nighttrain. Over.

1190
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,308
Yeah, I think this
is Chauncey's house.

1191
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:07,708
Gotta be, man.
It's gotta be.

1192
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:08,938
Knock on the door.

1193
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:11,846
Open the door, Chauncey.
It's Ed and Dré. Knock again.

1194
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,679
Chauncey,
we going to count to 3...

1195
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:15,184
then I'm going
to kick in the door...

1196
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:16,947
then we're going
to kick in your ass.

1197
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:19,148
One...

1198
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:20,918
Ready?

1199
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,299
Yaaahhhhh!

1200
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:30,924
Damn, Dré.

1201
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,969
Somebody talked to that
motherfucker already.

1202
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,732
Could have cut
himself shaving.

1203
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,433
Shit. He's dead
as a motherfucker, man.

1204
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,203
What were you 2
guys doing here?

1205
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:41,141
We thought he knew something
about the Nick Crawford murder.

1206
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:43,544
So you were functioning
as detectives?

1207
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:44,672
No, not really.

1208
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:45,680
Look, we each
got our own...

1209
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:47,239
responsibilities
on the force, fellas.

1210
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,580
Who's your sergeant?

1211
00:46:48,652 --> 00:46:49,641
Sergeant Cooper.

1212
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,210
Look, guys, you let
the real detectives...

1213
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:52,812
handle this, all right?

1214
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,585
Y'all guys just
get out of here.

1215
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:55,625
Beat it!

1216
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,627
Big Laurel and Hardy
look-alikes...

1217
00:46:57,695 --> 00:46:58,719
wannabe detectives.

1218
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:00,229
Now what are
we going to do?

1219
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:01,662
Get the results
of the dirt...

1220
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:02,824
we took to the lab.

1221
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,867
You gave him
the dirt, right?

1222
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:05,299
You were supposed
to give him the dirt.

1223
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:06,495
No, no, no, man.

1224
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,162
You were supposed to give him
the dirt. Trust me.

1225
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,501
Damn it, Dré!

1226
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,507
I never had
the dirt, OK?

1227
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,578
Those guys look like
Run D.M.C.

1228
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:20,043
Oh, that's good.
Come on, baby.

1229
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:22,608
There. That's it.
That's it.

1230
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:24,620
Fuji!

1231
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:26,019
Fuji, my man.

1232
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,057
Gun untraceable.

1233
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:28,182
Yeah, Fuji, we know.

1234
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,658
We want you to check out
that soil sample...

1235
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:30,751
and let us know
what's in it.

1236
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:31,760
Drugs in soil?

1237
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:33,421
- You tell us.
- Tell you what?

1238
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:34,964
- Something in soil.
- What in soil?

1239
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:36,158
You tell us.

1240
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:38,531
Need police geologist.

1241
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:39,591
Who's the geologist?

1242
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,602
I call Bernstein.

1243
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:41,603
- Go call Bernstein.
- Hai.

1244
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:42,661
- Hai.
- Hai.

1245
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:45,039
Good morning, men.

1246
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,303
Good morning, Captain.

1247
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:47,708
Sergeant Cooper tells me...

1248
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,473
that you two have been
playing detective.

1249
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:50,673
Yes, sir.
We're investigating--

1250
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:52,010
Excuse me.

1251
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:54,107
You're patrolmen.

1252
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,051
And l want you
to understand...

1253
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,212
in no uncertain terms...

1254
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,222
that you are not
to investigate...

1255
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,485
Nick Crawford's murder
or anyone else's.

1256
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:02,583
Is that clear?

1257
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,491
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

1258
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:06,120
Somebody new is being
put on the case today.

1259
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,357
I think he's a friend
of yours.

1260
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:08,728
Come in, Detective.

1261
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,499
- Griles?!
- Detective?

1262
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,162
Got promoted.

1263
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:16,604
Now Griles is going
to head the case...

1264
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:18,403
and I don't want
you 2 near it.

1265
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:19,407
Capisce?

1266
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:21,171
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1267
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:24,373
Ok, good. Dismissed.

1268
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,550
Yo, Griles.

1269
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:29,847
Griles.

1270
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,852
Yo, Griles.

1271
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,320
Lorenzo Martin, man,
this guy, man...

1272
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,254
he's selling this type
of gun, man.

1273
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:35,815
Hey, look!

1274
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:37,360
I don't want your help...

1275
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:39,191
and I don't need your help.

1276
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:40,389
Now you 2 dickheads...

1277
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:42,762
are lucky you're
even on the force!

1278
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,130
Now you stay
away from me...

1279
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,429
and away from this case!

1280
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:46,764
Hey, look!

1281
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,702
This is no
''Police Academy'' bullshit...

1282
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,535
you can just clown
your way through!

1283
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:52,041
Now you stay
away from me...

1284
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,770
and away from this case!

1285
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,402
You got it?!

1286
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:57,777
Fuckin' dickheads!

1287
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,613
Why it be all that, man?

1288
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:01,742
Dickheads.

1289
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,446
We're doing
the best we can.

1290
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,886
Isaac Hayes lookalike.

1291
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:07,719
All right, people,
quiet down.

1292
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:09,691
Quiet down.
Pipe down.

1293
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,692
They got George back.

1294
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,251
They got pitching.
They got the whole--

1295
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,490
Hertzog!
What the fuck?

1296
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,658
Why is it every time
I start a meeting...

1297
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:17,666
everybody else shuts up...

1298
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:18,667
you keep talking?

1299
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:20,363
Shut the fuck up.

1300
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:21,369
Yes, sir.

1301
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:23,633
Thank you. OK...

1302
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,732
the first order of business...

1303
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,267
Barnes and Day,
37 collars this week.

1304
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:30,813
Not bad.

1305
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:36,316
Well, look who came
to join the party.

1306
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:39,982
Doctor Dree and his partner
Mr. Lurver.

1307
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:40,989
What'd you guys get?

1308
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:42,491
You got 2 collars this week.

1309
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,892
Pretty sure they're
the ones on your shirts.

1310
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,931
I'm sorry. My mistake.
My mistake. Uh...

1311
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,226
I forgot the dead guy
you apprehended...

1312
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,824
on your day off.

1313
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,698
Tell you what.
Everybody dismissed...

1314
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,000
except for...guess who.

1315
00:49:55,072 --> 00:49:57,199
Doctor Dré.

1316
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:58,866
Let's go.

1317
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,720
Sergeant Cooper?

1318
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:13,017
What is it, Lover?

1319
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:15,314
May I have a doughnut?

1320
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:17,952
You can have as many
doughnuts as you want.

1321
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:20,258
Thanks, Sarge.

1322
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,846
Hi.

1323
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:41,078
Don't even
think about it.

1324
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:42,743
I'm glad you dropped by.

1325
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,220
Little change
in precinct policy.

1326
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:46,381
As of today,

1327
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:49,324
I will be known as
President Cooper.

1328
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:51,327
I'm not going
to get paid or anything.

1329
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,260
I'm not going to debate or go
on the ''Larry King Live'' show.

1330
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,423
No--I'm just going
to be President Cooper.

1331
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:56,693
As a matter of fact...

1332
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,428
Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
I'll be President Cooper...

1333
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:00,834
and Tuesday and Thursday,
I think I'll be...

1334
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:01,768
King Cooper!

1335
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,363
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1336
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,737
And you know why?

1337
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,070
Because I...

1338
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:07,371
feel like it!

1339
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:08,638
I just want to be a king,
and now l've decided...

1340
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:10,270
I'm going to call myself king--
so I'm a king!

1341
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:12,372
I'm a king.
King Cooper. That's me.

1342
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:13,973
King Cooper...

1343
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,075
we want to be assigned to...

1344
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:16,642
the Nick Crawford murder case.

1345
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,483
That's right. We got a--

1346
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:19,886
We felt like--

1347
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:22,317
But--

1348
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:27,257
I got a better idea.

1349
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,424
Tony Como.

1350
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,024
- Tony ''Clams''?
- Mm-hmm.

1351
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:32,568
- The wise guy?
- That's right.

1352
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,001
He's supposed to be
testifying...

1353
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,629
as a government witness in
a case over in Brooklyn...

1354
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,867
but his gall bladder
acted up, so now...

1355
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:39,374
there's apparently
a hit out on him.

1356
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:40,842
We got a 24-hour
surveillance thing going on...

1357
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:42,003
and you guys
are going to go over...

1358
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,103
and relieve
the 2 officers on duty...

1359
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,775
and take over for
the next 24 hours, OK?

1360
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,442
But King Cooper,
we just feel that--

1361
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:53,689
See you later,
King Cooper.

1362
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:55,281
By the way, uh, Lover.

1363
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,383
Yeah?

1364
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,449
How's that doughnut?

1365
00:51:57,528 --> 00:52:02,090
Mmm. It's good.

1366
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:09,896
And there's
a whole big box...

1367
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:12,771
of chocolate doughnuts
sitting over on that table.

1368
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:30,391
Hey, Clams, where are
the ashtrays around here?

1369
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,486
What do you think this is,
a hotel?

1370
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:34,292
This is a hospital.
I'm sick over here.

1371
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:35,388
Relax. Your gall bladder's...

1372
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:36,990
going to explode,
for Christ's sake.

1373
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:38,625
Do me a favor.
Get rid of that cigarette.

1374
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,669
There. You happy?

1375
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:40,964
Hey! That's my water,
for Christ's sakes!

1376
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:41,970
What did you want me to do?

1377
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:43,006
Stick it up
in your ass?

1378
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:44,438
You know, you're driving me
fucking crazy.

1379
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:45,998
You're supposed to be
over here taking care of me.

1380
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:47,703
Hey, I'm not your
fucking nursemaid.

1381
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:49,473
Hi, Tony.
We're your replacements.

1382
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:52,037
I'm Officer Dré.
This is Officer Lover.

1383
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,275
We're here to protect you.

1384
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,612
What's this?
Abbott and Costello?

1385
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,915
You mean Amos and Andy,
don't you?

1386
00:52:56,987 --> 00:52:58,386
Who sent these
moulies in here?

1387
00:52:58,455 --> 00:52:59,387
How the fuck do l know?

1388
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:00,582
I don't work here.

1389
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,557
We'll be right outside.

1390
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:05,355
Vito, do me a favor, huh?

1391
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,329
Get rid of these guys.

1392
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:09,365
Yo, Dré, man,
what's a moulie?

1393
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,128
You're supposed
to be taking care of me.

1394
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:12,133
I think it's
an uncomplimentary...

1395
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:13,169
description
of a brother.

1396
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:14,727
Who the fuck are you?

1397
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:17,933
Damn, man. This day
is not going well at all.

1398
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:22,510
I'm out.

1399
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:23,944
I'll call.

1400
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,941
Where'd that third
ace come from?

1401
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:30,884
I palmed it.

1402
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:33,946
Bad, man.
That's bad.

1403
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,228
Hello?

1404
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:39,990
Dré, what's up?

1405
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,065
Bellevue?

1406
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,794
All right.

1407
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:48,200
Fellas, Frankie's
outta here.

1408
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:50,206
I gotta go bail out
my homies.

1409
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:52,504
Yo, why you always hang
with those pigs, man?

1410
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:54,510
Steve, I told you, when
I was the only white kid...

1411
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,170
growing up on
114th street...

1412
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:58,237
them 2 are the only ones
that ever had my back.

1413
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:00,340
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

1414
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:02,078
You grew up on 120th street.

1415
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:04,177
That's not the point,
Billy, really.

1416
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:06,085
It's about friendship--

1417
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:08,351
men with other men,
playing cards.

1418
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,190
Man, we got things to do.

1419
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:12,694
We can't stand around all day

1420
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:14,196
guarding this racist
piece of shit.

1421
00:54:14,264 --> 00:54:16,198
One more word
from the pasta king here...

1422
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm deflating all his tires.
I can't stand it.

1423
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:20,862
Nuh-huh-huh.
Fuckin' day, man.

1424
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:22,599
Fellas, sorry I'm late.

1425
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:24,072
It was that 2 train.
The power went out.

1426
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:25,938
In the dark, somebody
starting touching my balls!

1427
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:28,534
The lights come on, I look
at this guy in a silk shirt--

1428
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:30,546
Frankie, Frankie.
We got Tony Como in the room.

1429
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:32,548
Tony Clams?
I love that guy!

1430
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:33,878
Good, 'cause
you're guarding him.

1431
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,714
Tell him you're a cop.
We gotta go out for a while.

1432
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:36,878
It's about Nick. Cool?

1433
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,888
Cool, yeah. Can I borrow
your hat to look legit?

1434
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:40,048
Thanks, Frankie.

1435
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:41,454
Gotta be realistic, fellas.

1436
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:44,720
Hi, how are ya?
Detective O'Hearn.

1437
00:54:44,795 --> 00:54:46,023
From the 2-3.

1438
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:47,688
Tony. Tony, how are ya?

1439
00:54:47,764 --> 00:54:48,890
Who are you?

1440
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:50,399
Detective O'Hearn
from the 2-3.

1441
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,764
Oh, good.
A white cop.

1442
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:05,005
Hello, officers.

1443
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,346
Hi. Is Mr. Demetrius available?

1444
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,351
I'm sorry.
He's in a conference.

1445
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:12,252
Well, tell him
the police are here.

1446
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:17,119
This one is gonna
be real popular.

1447
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,128
They'll be in the next
issue of ''Vogue.''

1448
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,185
Teesha?

1449
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:23,699
Ed, Dré, what are
y'all doing here?

1450
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,234
You know each other?

1451
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:26,234
Yeah.

1452
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:27,702
From the same neighborhood.

1453
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:30,171
Well, what can l do
to help you gentlemen?

1454
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,902
You seem pretty interested
in Harlem, Mr. Demetrius.

1455
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:34,568
Well, it's a great
neighborhood...

1456
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,078
and I believe
it's coming back.

1457
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:37,511
Did you know
a Nick Crawford?

1458
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:40,277
He was that
unfortunate barber...

1459
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,477
who was killed
by the drug dealers.

1460
00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:45,419
I understand he was
a model citizen.

1461
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:47,047
So this is a map
of Harlem, huh?

1462
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:48,887
All these buildings
on this block...

1463
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:50,085
are coded red.

1464
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,287
Except for one
the barbershop is in.

1465
00:55:52,362 --> 00:55:54,227
Why is that?

1466
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:56,231
Here, let me show you.

1467
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:00,562
All the red ones
are the ones that I own.

1468
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:01,831
I'm developing
those properties...

1469
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,600
into condominiums.

1470
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:05,005
Well, what's that drillin'...

1471
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:06,838
you doing uptown?

1472
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,435
My engineers are collecting
geological samples.

1473
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:11,674
It's what one does
when one builds.

1474
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:13,682
How come you ain't done
no building in Harlem?

1475
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,183
All that drillin',
no building.

1476
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:16,810
Don't make sense to me!

1477
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:19,822
Because it takes time to get
the necessary information.

1478
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:24,691
One spends a lot of money
to put up a building.

1479
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,559
If the preliminary steps
aren't handled carefully...

1480
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:29,531
you can imagine
the results.

1481
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,124
Would you care for
some coffee or tea?

1482
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:33,533
You buying up
all the property...

1483
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:34,797
around the barber shop.

1484
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:36,202
Nick is leading
demonstrations...

1485
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,365
to try to stop you.

1486
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:38,806
Somebody tries to buy
the property...

1487
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:42,709
but he won't sell.
Bang! He's dead.

1488
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:44,508
Dré, you smell
something?

1489
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:46,014
I smell bullshit.

1490
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,209
I knew it!

1491
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,980
I knew it smelled like
bullshit in here!

1492
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:51,213
If you're implying...

1493
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,222
that I had anything
to do with that murder...

1494
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,222
I can assure you...

1495
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,656
I do not do business
like that.

1496
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:57,626
Now, if there's
anything else l can do...

1497
00:56:57,694 --> 00:56:59,059
to help you gentlemen...

1498
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:01,154
No. Thanks for your time.

1499
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:08,468
You know, I cannot believe
you 2 just did that--

1500
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:10,472
Save the drama for your mama.

1501
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,235
I ain't tryin' to hear.

1502
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,671
What's up with you
and Demetrius?

1503
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:20,342
We are business partners.
My uncle introduced us.

1504
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,509
Lionel?

1505
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:23,519
Yes, Lionel. He's backing
my design company.

1506
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:25,953
And by the way, we're having
our first fashion show...

1507
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:27,182
in a couple of days.

1508
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:29,191
I would appreciate it
if y'all did not show up.

1509
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,159
Cool. But I'm telling
you, he's dirty.

1510
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:32,525
What do you think
he's doing?

1511
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:34,530
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it ain't cool.

1512
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:36,190
I'm a pretty good
judge of character...

1513
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:38,029
and if I thought
the man was dirty,

1514
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:39,625
I wouldn't be doin'
business with him.

1515
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:46,809
Frank. It's Ed.

1516
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,401
Everything cool?

1517
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:50,639
No. He's gettin' to be
a royal pain in the balls...

1518
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:51,806
for one thing.

1519
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:54,214
Yo, Frankie, man.
Yo, gimme 4 on 615.

1520
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:56,878
Sure. Can you get me
some of those catheters?

1521
00:57:56,953 --> 00:57:58,614
All right. Thanks.

1522
00:57:58,688 --> 00:58:00,315
It's impossible. I can't!

1523
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:01,721
Hey, Detective.

1524
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,194
I can for a couple of hours.

1525
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:07,992
I didn't--no, I can.
Yes.

1526
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:09,531
OK. 2 hours.

1527
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:10,725
Good-bye.

1528
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:16,738
You know what?

1529
00:58:16,807 --> 00:58:17,831
Maybe Teesha was right, man.

1530
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,671
Why would Demetrius
have Nick killed?

1531
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,176
I know she's fine, Dré...

1532
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:23,508
but don't let your johnson
run your life, all right?

1533
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,480
Who else got a motive?

1534
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:26,573
What the--

1535
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,989
Do you guys know what
happened today at 4:36?

1536
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,526
Do you have any idea what
happened today at 4:36?

1537
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,526
No, you don't.
Let me tell ya.

1538
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:39,527
Tony Clams got shot.

1539
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:40,688
He got fuckin' shot!

1540
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:41,958
Only by the Grace of God
is he still alive!

1541
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:43,021
You guys were supposed to
watch him!

1542
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:44,361
You fucked me!

1543
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,368
You might as well kiss me,
'cause you're fucking me!

1544
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,199
Where were you guys?
Where the--

1545
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,000
Is that jelly...

1546
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:51,540
that I smell?

1547
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:54,406
Bavarian cream?

1548
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,106
Bagels?

1549
00:58:58,882 --> 00:59:01,077
Gimme the club.

1550
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:21,695
You guys are
on foot patrol...

1551
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:23,238
for the rest of your lives!

1552
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:24,603
Do you understand that?
Foot patrol.

1553
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:26,164
Capital ''f,''
small ''o'', small ''o''...

1554
00:59:26,243 --> 00:59:27,175
little tiny ''t.''

1555
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:28,336
Did you ever see
a little tiny ''t''?

1556
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:29,503
It's like
a little curlicue--

1557
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,206
little--

1558
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:34,975
Tell me...

1559
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:36,518
that...you're...not...

1560
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:40,454
touching my fucking badge!

1561
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:49,664
He lost it.

1562
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:54,198
The sergeant lost it.

1563
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,602
Let's get outta here.

1564
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,870
Yeah. I went to that Michael
Bolton concert last night.

1565
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:03,537
Oh! He's such
an accomplished performer.

1566
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,740
I was really impressed.

1567
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,248
014 to 183
Amsterdam right away.

1568
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:08,511
That's us.
Let's hit it. Let's go.

1569
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:11,076
Whoa! Whoa!
What is that?

1570
01:00:11,154 --> 01:00:12,086
Stop it!

1571
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:13,452
I can't!

1572
01:00:17,494 --> 01:00:19,621
Go, go, go, go!

1573
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:28,600
Yo, man, I don't understand.
You guys fucked up!

1574
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:29,934
You oughta be cops...

1575
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:31,906
like Leon Spinks shoulda
won a beauty contest...

1576
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:33,237
and that nigger ugly!

1577
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,902
Now, Leon's a good brother.

1578
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,811
Now, Biz Markie--
that's a ugly motherfucker!

1579
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,846
Bullshit. Yo, yo,
I--I need a refill.

1580
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,612
Who's comin' back
with me to the store?

1581
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:43,744
Oh, man!

1582
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,583
Why the fuck you keep
drinkin' that shit, man?

1583
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,919
Your insides'll be fucked up
like your ugly-ass face.

1584
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,288
I just--

1585
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,384
Forty, you're so
messed up all the time...

1586
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:52,928
you don't remember
nothin' no way!

1587
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:53,928
That's fucked up--

1588
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:55,259
Shut the fuck up, man.

1589
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:57,732
Sound like you have
a dick in your mouth, man.

1590
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:00,861
You don't make
no Goddamn sense.

1591
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:02,336
Hey, fair ladies.

1592
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,635
Hey.
What up, light skin?

1593
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,074
Hey, I'm sorry
about Tony Clams.

1594
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,235
Where the fuck were you?

1595
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:09,243
Yolanda showed up.

1596
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:11,041
What do you mean,
Yolanda showed up?

1597
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,945
We oughta kick your ass,
Frankie.

1598
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,950
You almost got us busted
off the force!

1599
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:16,542
Hey, I did you guys
a favor...

1600
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:18,052
and they tried to arrest me!

1601
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,053
It's unbelievable.

1602
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:20,919
I was in the smoking lounge
5 minutes.

1603
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:23,926
Some wise guy comes in and--
boo-yah--pops Tony Clams...

1604
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:25,188
and it's my fault?

1605
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:26,751
I don't wanna hear
that shit, Frankie.

1606
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,229
You supposed to be
my friend, man.

1607
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:30,528
And you supposed to be guardin'
that racist piece of shit...

1608
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,625
and you doin' the wild thing
with Yolanda.

1609
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:35,000
Lorenzo!

1610
01:01:35,071 --> 01:01:36,003
Get that motherfucker!

1611
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:38,666
Come on!
Hurry up, man!

1612
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,233
He knows who killed Nick!

1613
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:42,835
Come on!

1614
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:08,469
There he goes!

1615
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:09,903
Y'all go that way!

1616
01:02:09,973 --> 01:02:11,304
Get that motherfucker!

1617
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:18,367
Don't move.

1618
01:03:18,441 --> 01:03:19,635
You fucked up, Ed Lover...

1619
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:20,937
Tryin' to be the man.

1620
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,602
Fuck you, Lorenzo.

1621
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,306
Say good-bye,
Mr. Man.

1622
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:32,152
So, Lorenzo,
you're in the gun business?

1623
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:33,587
Naw, man,
I'm retired, man.

1624
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:35,055
Where'd you get the gun?

1625
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,387
I don't remember.

1626
01:03:36,459 --> 01:03:38,723
Think I should let Frankie
refresh your fucking memory?

1627
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:40,126
Yo, what about my rights?

1628
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,528
You got the rights to get your
ass thrown in the East River...

1629
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,396
if you don't start
answerin' my questions!

1630
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:45,900
All right. All right.
I don't know the guy.

1631
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:48,062
All I know is he's bringing
them in from Germany.

1632
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:49,503
Can I go now?

1633
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:50,561
You ain't goin' nowhere!

1634
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,471
Does anybody
have any cab fare?

1635
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:01,847
Yo, man, did you
have to take a cab, man?

1636
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,180
Man, I got there, didn't I?

1637
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:04,686
After Frankie
saved my ass, man.

1638
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:06,381
Me and you are
supposed to be--

1639
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:07,388
Look at Flavor, man!

1640
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,652
Yo, Dré, get me
outta here, man.

1641
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,694
I can't do nothin'
for you, man!

1642
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:13,695
Hey, Griles, what's up
with the case, man?

1643
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:14,855
We're makin' progress.

1644
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:16,694
When you gonna go talk
to Demetrius, man?

1645
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:18,028
What's he gotta
do with it?

1646
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:19,363
He know what's goin' on.

1647
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:20,697
Oh, yeah?
Tell me, Sherlock.

1648
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:21,862
What be goin' on?

1649
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,030
We don't know exactly--

1650
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:24,801
Yeah, yeah. Great.
I'll go arrest him.

1651
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:26,136
Beat it!

1652
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:30,040
Hey, Griles...

1653
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:32,047
I want you to keep
your eye on those 2.

1654
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,377
Yes, sir.

1655
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,608
Oh, yes...

1656
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:39,314
uh, maybe once more...

1657
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:40,720
how's...it look?

1658
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:43,122
I have no idea
what you're doing.

1659
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:45,218
Perfect!

1660
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,218
Fuji!

1661
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:51,395
Ed, Dré...

1662
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,661
this is Bernstein.

1663
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,396
- Hi, Bernstein.
- Hey.

1664
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,732
Where'd you guys
get this sample?

1665
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:57,204
Uptown.
Guys were drilling.

1666
01:04:57,273 --> 01:04:59,036
Have any idea what they
might be lookin' for?

1667
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,201
- This is peat.
- Who's Pete?!

1668
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:02,539
Peat's a substance.

1669
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:03,544
Found in bogs.

1670
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,376
- Found in swamps.
- What else?

1671
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:06,415
We have leaves.

1672
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:07,414
Like from a tree?

1673
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:09,508
Yes. From trees.

1674
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,144
- That it?
- No, not it.

1675
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,018
The layer above the peat,
the leaves...

1676
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,488
is made up of sand.

1677
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:15,546
Sand from the beach?

1678
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,456
Precisely.

1679
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:19,085
Peat, leaves, sand?

1680
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:21,027
There's a geological profile
the drillers look for...

1681
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:22,655
when they're
trying to find oil.

1682
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:25,064
Oil. Like what
Jed Clampett got?

1683
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:27,864
You trying to tell me
there's oil in Harlem?

1684
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:29,097
Possibly.

1685
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:30,764
Demetrius
is lookin' for oil!

1686
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,740
It's very unlikely.

1687
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,175
I mean, they never found oil
around here before.

1688
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,372
That's why he smoked Nick.

1689
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:38,414
- Hai!
- Hai!

1690
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:39,948
Hello.

1691
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:46,914
- Ed.
- What's up, Dré?

1692
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:49,049
Man, what makes
a beautiful girl like that...

1693
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:52,788
wanna go out with a short,
slimy sauerkraut-suckin'...

1694
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:54,727
short and slimy
motherfucker like that?

1695
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:56,230
I'm-a go ask.

1696
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:58,824
Hold it. Aren't we supposed
to lay back a little bit?

1697
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,732
I'm gonna throw him
off his game, man.

1698
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:03,135
Looks like we got
company, y'all.

1699
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:07,540
Oh, man! It's Griles!

1700
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:10,078
Yo, Fab, you got
any ideas, man?

1701
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:11,340
Plenty, baby.

1702
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:13,405
I got you covered like
a rug on this one.

1703
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:14,575
Watch this.

1704
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:15,845
Come back, Daddy.

1705
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:17,078
Baby, I'll be back.

1706
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:27,019
Ooh, Daddy,
you're home!

1707
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:28,688
You lookin' good
tonight, girl.

1708
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:30,027
Mm. How you been?

1709
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:31,361
Everything's cool.
Looky here, baby...

1710
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:34,460
you see that kid in that car
back over there?

1711
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:35,936
Yeah, I see him.

1712
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,529
I want you to go
over there...

1713
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:39,336
and I want you
to rock his world.

1714
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:40,876
- You hear me?
- Yes, Daddy.

1715
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:42,843
I want you to
make him scream.

1716
01:06:42,912 --> 01:06:44,209
Anything for you,
Daddy.

1717
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,508
Yeah. Handle it, girl.

1718
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,379
You look pretty hungry
back there, baby.

1719
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,351
Why don't you call me...

1720
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,354
when you're ready for
dessert, big boy? Rrr!

1721
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:09,431
That's what
I'm talkin' about!

1722
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:11,097
What's he got
that I don't got?

1723
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:12,198
I'm-a go ask.

1724
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:13,503
Hold that.

1725
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:15,771
You got soda all on my jacket.

1726
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:18,541
I got half a burger
and soda on my jacket.

1727
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:20,275
Why am I gonna do that?

1728
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:49,969
I'm suspending you 2
from the force...

1729
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:51,308
effective immediately.

1730
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:52,814
But, Captain, we got
a suspect and a motive...

1731
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:53,974
in the Nick Crawford
murder case.

1732
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,039
We think
there might be...

1733
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:56,107
oil in the hood,
Captain.

1734
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:57,311
Oil?

1735
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:58,581
That's why Demetrius is
buying up all the property.

1736
01:07:58,654 --> 01:07:59,848
You see, Nick Crawford
was sitting...

1737
01:07:59,922 --> 01:08:01,549
on the last piece of
property on the block.

1738
01:08:01,624 --> 01:08:04,115
And that's why
Demetrius had him killed.

1739
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,627
So, wait a minute.
What you're telling me...

1740
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:08,095
is that one of the most
successful...

1741
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:10,257
real estate developers
in this city...

1742
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,062
is digging for oil
in Harlem?

1743
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:13,159
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1744
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:14,294
Listen to me.

1745
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,133
There is oil
in Saudi Arabia...

1746
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:17,297
not Harlem.

1747
01:08:17,373 --> 01:08:19,170
There is oil in Venezuela.

1748
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:21,972
There is no oil
on 125th Street!

1749
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,033
Am I clear?

1750
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:24,079
But, Captain, if you--

1751
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:25,808
You're lucky
that Mr. Demetrius...

1752
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:27,315
is not pressing charges.

1753
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:29,578
Now, clean out your lockers
and get out of here!

1754
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,952
Hey, Mel, I need
some more tape.

1755
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:40,920
Sue, we gotta
get those--

1756
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:42,396
Is Teesha around?

1757
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:43,489
Uh, yeah,
she's in the back.

1758
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:44,658
Thanks a lot.

1759
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:46,531
Hey, Mel, that tape!

1760
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,598
Ok. You got it?

1761
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:53,574
- Yeah.
- All right, good.

1762
01:08:53,643 --> 01:08:55,110
Yeah, these
shoes are much...

1763
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:56,440
much better.

1764
01:08:58,114 --> 01:09:00,048
Does it have to
be so tight?

1765
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:01,105
Yes, it does.

1766
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:02,378
Child, for the money
you getting paid...

1767
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:03,714
we can strangle you.

1768
01:09:03,786 --> 01:09:06,482
OK. We'll loosen it
after the show, Kelly.

1769
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:08,023
Don't worry about it.

1770
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,114
Hey, yo, Teesha.

1771
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:10,921
Can we speak to you
for a minute, please?

1772
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:13,154
Come on, y'all, I can't
talk to y'all right now.

1773
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:14,787
I've got work
to do here.

1774
01:09:14,864 --> 01:09:17,856
My first show in New York
is tonight.

1775
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,424
It's kind of important.

1776
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:22,266
All right. Dana, come here.

1777
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:24,135
Something's wrong in here.
Could you--

1778
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:27,608
I don't know what it is.
Just fix it, please.

1779
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:30,211
Outfit is really fly.

1780
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,679
It's a new fabric.
Imported, thank you.

1781
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:35,012
Now look, y'all, we all
from the same neighborhood...

1782
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:36,574
and I really want to
help y'all out.

1783
01:09:36,652 --> 01:09:37,710
Don't get me wrong.

1784
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:40,483
But this is my shit happening
here tonight, OK?

1785
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:42,956
And I'm not gonna let y'all
mess this up for me.

1786
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:43,957
Check this out.

1787
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:45,015
We're not here
to mess nothing up.

1788
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:46,026
We're here to find...

1789
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:47,187
a little bit more
about Mr. Demetrius.

1790
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:48,753
Well, what do you want
to know about him?

1791
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:50,196
He's my financial backer...

1792
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,131
and he imports this
new fiber for me.

1793
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:53,168
From Germany?

1794
01:09:53,236 --> 01:09:54,703
How'd you know that?

1795
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,998
Where's the warehouse?

1796
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:57,369
In Brooklyn. Why?

1797
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,032
Don't worry about it.
We got it.

1798
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:01,133
Whatever. I got work to do.
I'll see y'all later.

1799
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,336
Save that drama though.
Word up.

1800
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,847
Ed Lover.

1801
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,110
What's up, Sherise?

1802
01:10:08,184 --> 01:10:10,379
There she is, baby.

1803
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:11,977
Baby, y'all look so good.

1804
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:13,112
What the hell you doing...

1805
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:14,884
telling people
I'm sleeping with you?

1806
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:16,424
- Sherise--
- Un-uh! Un-uh!

1807
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,187
Yo, I'm telling you,
Ed Lover...

1808
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,058
don't fuck with me!

1809
01:10:20,129 --> 01:10:23,621
Ow! Sherise? Sherise!
I didn't--

1810
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:27,060
3 times this week.
Third one.

1811
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:29,730
She smacked me right
in my fucking band-aid, too.

1812
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:30,897
Come on.

1813
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:32,907
I swear to God, man.

1814
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,408
How you gonna smack a man
with a band-aid on?

1815
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:37,611
Man, I hope
we ain't down here...

1816
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,977
wasting our time, man.

1817
01:10:39,048 --> 01:10:40,242
Man, I feel we're
getting real close now.

1818
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:41,248
We're gonna find
something down here...

1819
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:42,750
and nail him on it.

1820
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:44,649
I hope so, man.
Yo, man, yo, Teesha likes me.

1821
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,778
What?!
What Teesha want...

1822
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:46,787
with somebody
like you, man?

1823
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:47,982
She likes me.

1824
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:49,388
Why does every girl
in the world...

1825
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,823
gotta like you, man?

1826
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:52,520
They don't have to.
They just do, man.

1827
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:53,562
So you're bugging.

1828
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:54,561
No, no, you bugging.

1829
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,619
You bugging.

1830
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:57,325
Yo, I'm not bugging, man.
You're bugging.

1831
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:11,143
Man, it's dark in here.

1832
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:12,737
That because
it's nighttime, man.

1833
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:14,442
Stop wasting time.
Come on.

1834
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,075
Yo, what's the number
we're looking for?

1835
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:18,382
3 and 4.

1836
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:22,522
Ok. There's 3,
there's 4.

1837
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:24,560
It's over here.
Bingo.

1838
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:26,424
God, please.

1839
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:29,431
Let's get to work.

1840
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,238
There ain't nothing
in these crates...

1841
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:38,796
except this damn fabric.

1842
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:40,239
Keep looking, man.
You'll find something.

1843
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:42,106
There's gotta be
something in here.

1844
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:49,778
Damn. Thing's tight.

1845
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:53,181
Crazy.

1846
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,115
I can't believe this.

1847
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,423
How do you get this open?

1848
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:01,929
Damn, the thing's
locked up tight, too.

1849
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:04,193
Wait a minute. Look
what we got here.

1850
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:10,367
Mm. Smart enough
to put Teesha's name...

1851
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:11,872
all over the crates, too.

1852
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,408
We're gonna
nail his ass.

1853
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:14,966
We got him, kid.
Got him.

1854
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:17,103
Drop it!

1855
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:19,010
Call the boss.

1856
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:20,742
Aw, come on, fellas.

1857
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:22,113
You know the bad
guys are gonna lose.

1858
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:23,412
That's word up.

1859
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:24,783
Just like in
''The Magnificent Seven.''

1860
01:12:24,854 --> 01:12:25,821
Yep. I like that movie.

1861
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:27,287
Or Bill Cosby
and Sidney Poitier...

1862
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,516
in ''Uptown Saturday Night.''

1863
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:30,320
I like that.

1864
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:31,690
Shut up!

1865
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,729
Demetrius.

1866
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,263
Yeah, boss.

1867
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:37,424
Yeah, we got 'em.

1868
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,027
No. That won't be
a problem.

1869
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:42,070
Can I place a call--

1870
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:43,127
Shut up!

1871
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,967
Say good night, boys.

1872
01:12:48,044 --> 01:12:49,568
Don't do it!

1873
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:54,405
You guys all right?

1874
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:55,472
Yeah.

1875
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,882
What took you
so damn long?

1876
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:58,010
Proper police procedure.

1877
01:12:58,087 --> 01:12:59,884
Griles.

1878
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:01,252
What are you guys
doing here?

1879
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,585
Demetrius
is smuggling guns.

1880
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,023
This warehouse
is full of them.

1881
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,355
You got a search warrant?

1882
01:13:05,428 --> 01:13:06,486
Griles, we ain't
cops no more.

1883
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:08,029
Who gives a damn
about a search warrant?

1884
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,122
Can we please go pick up
Mr. Demetrius?

1885
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,419
These shoes
are killing me.

1886
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:37,925
Go ahead, Kelly.
Just keep complaining.

1887
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:39,858
You'll be modeling
post office uniforms...

1888
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:42,159
I'm telling you.
Get up there!

1889
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:43,994
All you do is complain.

1890
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:52,806
What's happening, baby?
Didn't I see you...

1891
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,105
on the cover
of ''Essence Magazine?''

1892
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:57,475
Oh, shit. I know you ain't
trying to dis me...

1893
01:13:57,546 --> 01:13:59,639
with that bright-ass orange
carpet on your head.

1894
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:03,776
Fuck you! Shit!
Hey, yeah.

1895
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:06,117
Hey! What's
happening, baby?

1896
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,246
Didn't I see you...

1897
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:09,188
on the cover
of ''Essence Magazine?''

1898
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:23,162
What have you been
telling people...

1899
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:26,037
about my business
affairs, Lionel?

1900
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:27,735
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1901
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,971
Don't bother
prevaricating.

1902
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:32,878
Those 2 moronic police
officer friends of yours...

1903
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:35,781
have gotten in my way
for the last time.

1904
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:38,183
They've finally been
taken care of.

1905
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:41,052
And you can be
taken care of, too.

1906
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,887
Don't threaten me,
Demetrius.

1907
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:46,689
I don't have to
threaten you, Lionel.

1908
01:14:58,674 --> 01:15:01,700
Sashay, sashay, sashay!

1909
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:05,579
Yo, Lamar.

1910
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:07,115
Oh, Doctor Dré, Ed Lover,
how y'all doing?

1911
01:15:07,183 --> 01:15:08,741
Lamar, where's
Demetrius at?

1912
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:10,911
Oh, he's over there
in a fabulous suit.

1913
01:15:10,986 --> 01:15:12,283
6 buttons, buttery
leather shoes--

1914
01:15:12,354 --> 01:15:14,345
All right,
thanks, Lamar.

1915
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,482
All right, y'all. Bye.

1916
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:33,207
Demetrius,
where you going?

1917
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:34,435
I'm sorry.
Something came up.

1918
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,499
I have to go.

1919
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:36,704
Oh, you can't leave now!

1920
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:38,542
The show is great,
but I have to go.

1921
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:40,809
Come on, Demetrius,
don't go!

1922
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:42,874
Freeze!

1923
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,352
You're under arrest.

1924
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:47,355
Your chief is gonna be
awfully upset...

1925
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:48,788
when he hears
how I've been treated.

1926
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:50,120
First, he's gonna hear
about those guns...

1927
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:52,023
you running through
Teesha's warehouse.

1928
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:53,459
And then we're gonna
pin Nick's murder...

1929
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:55,497
- to your ass.
- That's absurd.

1930
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:57,691
If there's any guns
in Ms. Braxton's warehouse...

1931
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,324
I know nothing about it.

1932
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:01,494
And as far
as Nick Crawford goes...

1933
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,901
I never murdered anyone.

1934
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:04,701
If you didn't,
then who did?

1935
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:09,240
You ever read the bible?

1936
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:10,972
The book of ''Daniel'' says,

1937
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:14,743
''Every man's sword shall be
against his brother.''

1938
01:16:14,817 --> 01:16:18,082
Man, what the hell
are you talking about?

1939
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:33,999
Hello, yes. This is
Lionel Douglas.

1940
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:36,230
I want to book
a flight for Jamaica.

1941
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,170
Yes, tonight, yes, yes.

1942
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,731
You already have my credit
card number there.

1943
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,277
Yes.

1944
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:45,609
Come on, come on, come on.

1945
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,707
Lionel Douglas.
Right, that's it, yes.

1946
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:50,445
OK, that's tonight, right?

1947
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:52,612
OK. I'll be there.
Thank you.

1948
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:59,122
Why'd you go to work
for Demetrius, Lionel?

1949
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:01,355
What are you doing
in my house?!

1950
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,990
We had a talk
with him tonight.

1951
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:05,658
I smoothed over...

1952
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:07,497
some uptown feathers
for the man.

1953
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:08,934
There's nothing
wrong with that.

1954
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:11,370
What's in Jamaica, man?

1955
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,668
Vacation.

1956
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,606
Kind of a spur of
the moment thing, huh?

1957
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:16,668
Yes, Ed.

1958
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:19,509
What else were you
doing for Demetrius?

1959
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:21,310
I told you.

1960
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,645
Nothing else?

1961
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:26,245
What's your point, Ed?

1962
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:27,584
This is my point.

1963
01:17:27,656 --> 01:17:28,714
We found a warehouse
full of guns...

1964
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,351
out in Brooklyn, and maybe
you know about that.

1965
01:17:31,427 --> 01:17:33,987
And maybe you know
who killed Nick.

1966
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:36,327
I don't know anything
about warehouse guns...

1967
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:39,458
or who put
that bullet in Nick.

1968
01:17:42,004 --> 01:17:44,529
Bullet?

1969
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:47,734
Everybody thinks Nick
was killed in an explosion.

1970
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:51,109
The police didn't say
nothing about no bullet.

1971
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,909
How'd you know
he got shot, Lionel?

1972
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,210
Where you there?

1973
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,147
Why'd you kill Nick, man?

1974
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:06,956
I tried to save Nick.

1975
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,520
I said, ''Nicky...

1976
01:18:09,598 --> 01:18:12,396
sell the property.''

1977
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:13,992
But he wouldn't listen.

1978
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,936
What was I supposed to do?

1979
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:22,166
That shit don't make
no difference, man.

1980
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,041
Nick loved you.

1981
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:27,082
You killed
your best friend...

1982
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:29,447
you sorry motherfucker!

1983
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:33,010
Just shut up!
Just shut up!

1984
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,350
Demetrius was setting me up.

1985
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,254
He was gonna ruin me...

1986
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:40,193
and I couldn't
let that happen.

1987
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:42,196
I'm on my way now...

1988
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:45,756
to take care
of Mr. Demetrius.

1989
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:46,823
But now, I have to...

1990
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:50,463
take care of you first, Ed.

1991
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:52,700
I am sorry, Ed.

1992
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:57,473
Not as sorry as I am.

1993
01:18:57,546 --> 01:18:58,570
You all right, man?

1994
01:18:58,647 --> 01:18:59,978
Yeah,
I'm straight, man.

1995
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:02,142
Son of a--

1996
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:03,180
Well, boys...

1997
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:04,719
Demetrius and Lionel
are behind bars.

1998
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:06,778
I still don't know why
anyone would want to kill Nick.

1999
01:19:06,855 --> 01:19:08,322
There's a lot of sick people
in this world.

2000
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,654
The important thing
is that you guys were right.

2001
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:14,423
How'd you like
to rejoin the department?

2002
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:16,794
No, I don't think so.

2003
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:17,957
Not even if I made you...

2004
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:19,864
the youngest detectives
on the force?

2005
01:19:21,036 --> 01:19:22,333
- Nope.
- No, I don't think so.

2006
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:23,803
We're not cut out
for police work, man.

2007
01:19:23,872 --> 01:19:24,839
Nah, too violent.

2008
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:25,874
Well, what are you guys
gonna do?

2009
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:27,431
I mean, it's not like
you found oil.

2010
01:19:27,509 --> 01:19:28,999
You guys need jobs.

2011
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:30,136
We'll think of something.

2012
01:19:30,212 --> 01:19:31,270
You know us.

2013
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:47,023
Yo, check this out.

2014
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:48,188
I'm going to the store...

2015
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:49,457
to get us some more
40 ouncers...

2016
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:51,328
so we can all celebrate.

2017
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,867
Forty...

2018
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:55,267
Go grab a beam, man.

2019
01:20:04,113 --> 01:20:06,638
Hey, George, help Mickey
with that beam, man.

2020
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:07,704
All right.

2021
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,094
Yo, Dré.
Check this out, man.

2022
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,706
I miss Nick, man.

2023
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,266
So do I, man.

2024
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,781
Oh. Oh, y'all just got
men working in here.

2025
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,010
Where's all the women at?

2026
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:44,017
What's up, Teesha?

2027
01:20:44,086 --> 01:20:45,075
How y'all doin'?

2028
01:20:45,154 --> 01:20:46,519
Sorry how everything
turned out.

2029
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:48,818
Yeah, well, you know,
life goes on.

2030
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,586
Hey, we could
always use another barber.

2031
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:53,025
No, got a job.
Thank you.

2032
01:20:59,168 --> 01:21:01,830
Dré, where the hell you
get that cannon from, man?

2033
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:03,428
I hate rats, man.

2034
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:08,766
Yo, what's that black stuff?

2035
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:25,552
I worked for 3 hours
for this shit.

2036
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:27,219
I'm telling you, this
new Spike Lee joint...

2037
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,320
they're ''Crooklyn,'' man.

2038
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:30,160
Ed told me
this is the new Arsenio.

2039
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:31,790
- Arsenio who?
- Arsenio Hall.

2040
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:34,097
Nah, Dré told me
this is Arsenio Hall cut.

2041
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:36,103
It's the ''New Jack City,
Part 7.''

2042
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:37,103
See, I know Wesley.

2043
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:38,139
He wouldn't go out like that.

2044
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:39,299
This original
Shabba Ranks?

2045
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:42,070
I got your Shabba Ranks,
Buster.

2046
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,406
See you later. Yo, Dré,

2047
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:44,911
I thought once
we struck oil, man...

2048
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,277
we wouldn't have
to work here no more.

2049
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:47,280
I know, man.
I thought...

2050
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:48,316
things were gonna
get better...

2051
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:49,315
being rich
and wealthy now--

2052
01:21:49,384 --> 01:21:50,351
We'd be
laying on beaches...

2053
01:21:50,419 --> 01:21:51,477
with girls
with little bikinis.

2054
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:52,542
Know what I'm saying?

2055
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,088
Third time in 2 days...

2056
01:21:54,156 --> 01:21:55,487
you cut my hair, man.

2057
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:57,616
I can't help it.
We ain't got no customers.

2058
01:21:57,693 --> 01:21:59,251
They got all the damn customers.
Look at 'em.

2059
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:01,387
Yeah, Dré and his
Fat Albert ass.

2060
01:22:01,463 --> 01:22:02,794
Man, like he stink!

2061
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:03,888
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

2062
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,093
And the world's
coming to an end.

2063
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:08,227
- Mm-hmm!
- Mm-hmm!

2064
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:10,965
Hey, guys, can I get a cut?

2065
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,170
Whoo

2066
01:22:14,243 --> 01:22:15,210
Come on

2067
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:16,301
Whoo

2068
01:22:16,378 --> 01:22:17,504
Come on

2069
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:19,979
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2070
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:22,209
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

2071
01:22:22,284 --> 01:22:23,876
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2072
01:22:23,952 --> 01:22:24,919
Hey, how you guys been?

2073
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:26,386
Just great, Sarge.

2074
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:28,218
Can you hold your head
to the side, Sarge?

2075
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,655
That looks great, Sarge.

2076
01:22:29,725 --> 01:22:30,987
You know, if you
had a pony tail...

2077
01:22:31,059 --> 01:22:31,991
everything would be
just right.

2078
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,992
Oh, is that right?

2079
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:34,688
Ow, ow!
What are you doing?

2080
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:35,695
Nothing. Don't worry
about it, Sarge.

2081
01:22:35,764 --> 01:22:36,731
I got this.

2082
01:22:36,798 --> 01:22:38,322
We professionals. Remember?

2083
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,367
I'll take that.

2084
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:40,366
Ouch! Ow.

2085
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:41,367
Move your head
to the left, Sarge.

2086
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:42,528
What's that thing for?

2087
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:44,265
Don't worry about that.
These won't hurt at all.

2088
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:46,967
Professionals.
We're professionals.

2089
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,270
Put your head down, please.
Down.

2090
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:49,935
This is what we did before
we were police offices.

2091
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,104
Couldn't you use
the mirrors? Ow, ow.

2092
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,079
Oh, we will be using
mirrors before it's done.

2093
01:22:53,148 --> 01:22:54,706
How's things down
at the precinct, Sarge?

2094
01:22:54,783 --> 01:22:55,875
Good.

2095
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,179
Ok. Down there.

2096
01:22:57,252 --> 01:22:58,742
Could you hold your head
down to the side, please, sir?

2097
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,788
You know, you really are
bashful...

2098
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:02,517
I'm not paying for this.

2099
01:23:02,591 --> 01:23:05,082
Could you just kind of
turn your head this way!

2100
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,355
Ow!

2101
01:23:07,429 --> 01:23:08,862
I used to kick it
with the thugs

2102
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,227
Pushin' drugs
in the park

2103
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:11,425
Makin' every mark

2104
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,831
That was out
after dark

2105
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:13,868
Stick 'em
for their loot

2106
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:15,459
Cut 'em up,
then l'd dash

2107
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:16,561
And when
I had to shoot

2108
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:17,866
I'd nutted up
for the cash

2109
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:19,930
Ran down the block
with my .45 Glock

2110
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:22,442
Capped off a round,
everybody hit the ground

2111
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:24,570
The next thing I heard
was a siren

2112
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:27,137
Couldn't turn around,
money grip kept firin'

2113
01:23:27,215 --> 01:23:29,740
Runnin' for the ride,
I can't go inside

2114
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:32,150
I'd rather that I died,
I got too much pride

2115
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:34,518
I guess it's just something
that you can't understand

2116
01:23:34,589 --> 01:23:37,820
My gun's in my hand,
tell me who's the man?

2117
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:40,361
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2118
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:42,897
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

2119
01:23:42,964 --> 01:23:45,592
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2120
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:47,931
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

2121
01:23:48,003 --> 01:23:50,471
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2122
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:52,939
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

2123
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:55,772
Who's the man
with the master plan?

2124
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:57,971
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

2125
01:23:58,046 --> 01:24:00,241
Mic check, here I go again,
check me out

2126
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:01,247
Bust the flavor

2127
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:02,248
Hey

2128
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:04,046
You know my clout,
rough and rugged

2129
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:05,848
Funk's the contact
I hit you with

2130
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:08,355
To make your head split,
trip, and do a backflip

2131
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,914
I swing it hard-core,
like an orangutan

2132
01:24:10,992 --> 01:24:12,926
I bring it wicked,
and freak the funk slang

2133
01:24:12,994 --> 01:24:14,188
Like, goddamn

2134
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:15,889
Yeah, dude,
gnarly, fuckin'-a

2135
01:24:15,964 --> 01:24:17,898
I don't Play-Doh,
my nickname ain't Clay

2136
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,058
Hittin' switches

2137
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:20,999
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2138
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,264
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2139
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:25,499
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2140
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:27,769
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2141
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:28,969
Hittin' switches

2142
01:24:29,044 --> 01:24:30,944
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2143
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:32,946
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2144
01:24:33,014 --> 01:24:35,812
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2145
01:24:35,884 --> 01:24:37,749
Off and on, off and on,
it's on

2146
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:38,945
What's the law?

2147
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,214
Pimp or die

2148
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:41,312
What's the law?

2149
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:42,584
Pimp or die

2150
01:24:42,657 --> 01:24:43,783
What's the law?

2151
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:45,053
Pimp or die

2152
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:46,059
What's the law?

2153
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,390
Pimp or die

2154
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:49,487
To my niggas uptown,
gotta pimp or die

2155
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,896
To my niggas downtown,
gotta pimp or die

2156
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:54,561
To my niggas crosstown,
gotta pimp or die

2157
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:57,434
To my niggas round town,
gotta pimp or die

2158
01:24:57,506 --> 01:24:58,871
I just jump in my cab

2159
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,339
Drive up the ave

2160
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:02,969
Talkin' on my cellular,
huh, I'm too cool to laugh

2161
01:25:03,044 --> 01:25:04,739
I'm the man,
that's how I get down

2162
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:06,280
I follow through,
knock the boots

2163
01:25:06,348 --> 01:25:07,940
And then I got
the stiff change

2164
01:25:08,016 --> 01:25:10,041
Ease up,
what's that all about?

2165
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:12,279
Why you wanna try
to play 3rd Eye out?

2166
01:25:12,354 --> 01:25:15,118
Ease up,
what's that all about?

2167
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,818
Why you wanna try
to play 3rd Eye out?

2168
01:25:17,893 --> 01:25:19,360
Somebody said my shit

2169
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:20,554
What's up with that?

2170
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:21,926
Somebody said

2171
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,123
Do you believe that?

2172
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:24,597
Somebody said
my shit ain't hip

2173
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,758
What's up with that?

2174
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:27,199
Somebody said

2175
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:29,430
Well, that's OK,

01:25:33,975 --> 01:25:36,000
Don't even sleep,

2179
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:37,374
Enclosed by the cops

2180
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:38,936
So go ahead with that,
you're dead with that

2181
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:41,414
Trouble's coming,

Ease up,

2187
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:53,122
Why you wanna try
to play 3rd Eye out?

2188
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:55,857
Ease up,
what's that all about?

2189
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:58,456
Why you wanna try
to play 3rd eye out?

2190
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:02,902
Hey, baby

2191
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:04,996
Ho

2192
01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:07,837
She, she

2193
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:10,537
Do you wanna pump?
Do you wanna pump with me?

01:26:15,383 --> 01:26:17,647
Do you wanna pump?
Show me with your body

2197
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:19,687
If you don't wanna
get sexy, babe

2198
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:22,552
If you don't
wanna get nasty

2199
01:26:22,624 --> 01:26:24,683
Maybe we can compromise

2200
01:26:24,759 --> 01:26:27,193
And both get
a little bit freaky

2201
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:28,194
Slide

And let me rub that body

2204
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:34,464
Maybe you would

01:26:34,536 --> 01:26:36,766
It might get you
in the mood, gee, yeah

2206
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:39,272

We can go home

2217
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:03,863
If you wanna go home

2218
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,628
I say it won't,
I'll say it again

2219
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:08,828
It won't be long

2220
01:27:08,904 --> 01:27:11,372
If you wanna moan

2221
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,839
'Cause you look

2222
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:15,672

01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:37,654
Hey, cutie,

Come stay with me

And hypnotize me
with your sexy ways

2232
01:27:44,406 --> 01:27:47,204
And, baby,

2233
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,869

2234
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:51,936

my way of thinking

2235
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:54,481

Come and stay with me,

You will see
how true love can be

2254
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:42,361
If you stay with me,
I will make you happy

2255
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:43,692
