1
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:48,839
<i>I came to America in 1914,
by way of Philadelphia.</i>

2
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,017
<i>That's where I got off the boat.</i>

3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,209
<i>And then I came to Baltimore.</i>

4
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,422
<i>It was the most beautiful place
you've ever seen in your life.</i>

5
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,553
<i>There were lights everywhere.
What lights they had!</i>

6
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:06,323
<i>It was a celebration of lights.</i>

7
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,161
<i>I thought they were for me:
"Sam was in America."</i>

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,229
<i>Sam was in America.</i>

9
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,947
<i>I didn't know what holiday it was,
but there were lights.</i>

10
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,280
<i>And I walked under them.</i>

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,482
<i>The sky exploded! People cheered!</i>

12
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,125
<i>There were fireworks.
What a welcome it was!</i>

13
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,126
<i>What a welcome!</i>

14
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,245
<i>I didn't know where my brothers were.</i>

15
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,717
<i>I had an address on a letter,
but when I went there, they'd moved.</i>

16
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,049
<i>I found the man
who knew the name Krichinsky.</i>

17
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,955
<i>He was a little man with big shoes.
I'll never forget him.</i>

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,724
<i>He had such big shoes!
They were brand-new, beautiful shoes.</i>

19
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,663
<i>He told me this was
how he made his living.</i>

20
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,064
<i>He would break in shoes
for the wealthy.</i>

21
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,764
<i>Stuff them with newspaper
and walk in them.</i>

22
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:00,605
<i>I said, "What a country is this.
What a country."</i>

23
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,874
<i>The wealthy didn't even have
to break in their own shoes.</i>

24
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,689
<i>So this man with the shoes took me
down one street after another.</i>

25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,255
<i>We walked and walked...</i>

26
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,326
<i>...and the skies would light up
and explode in a celebration.</i>

27
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,992
<i>And then we came to Avalon.</i>

28
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,766
<i>And the man with the shoes yelled,
"Krichinsky! Krichinsky!"</i>

29
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,476
<i>And my four brothers looked down
and saw me.</i>

30
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,737
<i>"Sam!"</i>

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,704
<i>Sam.</i>

32
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,045
<i>Sam.</i>

33
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,721
And that's when I came to America.
It was the Fourth of July.

34
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,232
Boy, did they used to celebrate.
Big celebrations.

35
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,894
They closed the streets
and would celebrate through the night.

36
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,440
What happened to the guy
who wore the big shoes?

37
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,171
The funny thing is, he did it
for another two years.

38
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,441
He brought his brother
into the business.

39
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,451
They would walk the streets, breaking
in shoes. Then he got an idea!

40
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,782
Why not make shoes that fit right?

41
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,789
They became custom shoemakers:
The Solomon Brothers.

42
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:26,030
They made shoes, pants.
And then they were a department store.

43
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,201
But the Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

44
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,702
The five Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

45
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,897
<i>And we worked and worked
and worked.</i>

46
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,202
<i>Except Gabriel didn't work.</i>

47
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,871
<i>Gabriel used to point a lot.
"There's a crease, it's not straight."</i>

48
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,884
He was the inspector.
He was the inspector.

49
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,621
How did you all get
to be wallpaper hangers?

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,423
It was your grandfather William.

51
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,563
He came to America first
and worked in the department store...

52
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,565
...where they sold wallpaper
and do wallpaper hanging for people.

53
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,464
So he became a wallpaper hanger.

54
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,301
And as each brother came over,
we all became wallpaper hangers.

55
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,202
But on the weekend, we made music.

56
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,676
What music it was!

57
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,346
<i>We liked American music.
We were very popular ourselves.</i>

58
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,701
<i>One night...</i>

59
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,910
<i>...I looked across the floor
and I saw...</i>

60
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,449
<i>...this young, lovely girl.</i>

61
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,449
<i>I wasn't handsome,
and I didn't have a beautiful body.</i>

62
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,059
<i>But when I touched a woman...</i>

63
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,423
<i>...they fell in love with me.</i>

64
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,563
<i>Oh, the family! How it grew.
The wives, the kids.</i>

65
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,605
<i>Krichinskys everywhere, everywhere.</i>

66
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,469
<i>So we had the family-circle meetings.</i>

67
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,749
<i>We put money in the hat to bring over
the cousins, the aunts, the uncles.</i>

68
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,512
<i>And then, out of the blue,
William gets the flu.</i>

69
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,089
<i>It was a terrible epidemic,
the flu of 1919.</i>

70
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,884
<i>Thousands died.</i>

71
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,561
<i>William died.</i>

72
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,927
<i>He was a young man.
He left three kids.</i>

73
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,400
Sam, how many times do we
have to hear this story?

74
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,867
We know this story.
We heard it before.

75
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,200
If we don't tell them, they don't know.
Last year, Bill died.

76
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,003
Was very warm last year
when Bill died.

77
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,339
How many times
do we have to hear this?

78
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,345
The children know this story.

79
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,415
I'm telling them about
when I came here.

80
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,314
Yeah, we know about it.
We all heard it before.

81
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,547
Dad, you want to cut the turkey,
or do you want me to?

82
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,955
I wanted to tell them about
when my father came here.

83
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,153
You have plenty of time
to talk about your father.

84
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,855
Sorry we're late.

85
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,527
Another minute, we would've cut the
turkey without you and started to eat.

86
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,934
To cut the turkey without me present?

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,541
We leave the house!

88
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,576
- We didn't cut the turkey.
- I heard the turkey was cut.

89
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,941
I was just talking
about when Bill died.

90
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,377
Thank God we are late.

91
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,921
I don't understand this holiday.
I'll never understand it.

92
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,579
- What's not to understand?
- Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving.

93
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,487
We're giving thanks to who?

94
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,628
You're giving thanks
for what you have.

95
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,093
How many times do we have
to go through this?

96
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,325
All I'm saying is, we had to get
the turkey and kill it to give thanks.

97
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,869
If it wasn't this holiday,
we wouldn't have turkey.

98
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,941
I don't eat turkey the rest
of the year. Why do I have to now?

99
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,577
Mom, don't give thanks, okay?

100
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,407
Time to tell the kids
when my father came to America.

101
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,311
Can't it wait till later?

102
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,342
They should hear this story.

103
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,544
Eva, this is very tender.

104
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,280
Of course it is.
It's a beautiful bird.

105
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,086
The turkey was in the basement alive.
She killed it.

106
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,729
We brought my father over in '25.

107
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:58,267
- '25?
- William died in 1919. '25.

108
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,803
'25? It was later than '25!

109
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,532
He came the same year
we brought Bill and Edith.

110
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,904
Bill and Edith came after!

111
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,636
- After?
- Yeah, after.

112
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,474
It was '26.

113
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,446
What's the difference?
He came to America, right?

114
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,746
It's a big difference
between '25 and '26.

115
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,219
One is '25 and the other is '26.

116
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:24,863
All's I'm saying is,
who cares if it was '25 or '26?

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,433
Jules, Jules, if you stop remembering,
you forget.

118
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,129
It was '26.

119
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,034
I remember the excitement
when you went to meet him.

120
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,699
<i>Finally, the father was coming.
We saved the money and sent it to him.</i>

121
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,936
<i>The whole family went to the border--</i>

122
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,741
<i>Jules, you were just a little kid.</i>

123
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,247
<i>It was cold!</i>

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,680
<i>We went to the marketplace.
It was cold. It was cold.</i>

125
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,915
What are you talking about,
it was cold? It was late May.

126
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,320
May? I remember cold.

127
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,361
No, you're thinking of when
Irene was getting married.

128
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,898
It was bitter cold then. No,
it was May 17 when your father came.

129
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,127
Anyway, we went, the whole family.

130
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,135
<i>The brothers, the wives, the kids.</i>

131
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,036
<i>I didn't go,
and all the kids didn't go.</i>

132
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,675
We waited in the house.

133
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,779
There was such excitement.
The father, the father was coming.

134
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,951
All I ever heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."

135
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,382
The head of the family.
I pictured this big, powerful man.

136
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,352
<i>All I'd heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."</i>

137
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,292
<i>The father's word when he speaks...</i>

138
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,054
<i>So I'm there. I see him.</i>

139
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,964
<i>He's shorter than me, and I'm only 6.</i>

140
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,794
<i>He was this little...</i>

141
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,701
He was a little, little man.

142
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,170
I never said he was big.

143
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,781
But I said he was the father.

144
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,678
From the day...

145
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,878
<i>From the day he came to America,
he never had to work.</i>

146
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,048
<i>Not a day in his life.
Each of us would give him 10 percent.</i>

147
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,750
<i>Ten percent?</i>

148
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,063
<i>Right? Right? Yeah.</i>

149
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,363
<i>Ten percent. He was the father.</i>

150
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,600
<i>He never drank water.</i>

151
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,502
The entire time he was in America,
from the day he came...

152
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,235
...he drank whiskey or seltzer water.

153
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,710
He never drank water.

154
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,884
And oh, boy, could he drink!

155
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,047
What was that stuff called
he always used to drink?

156
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,590
Slivovitz. Slivovitz.

157
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,120
He used to call it "Block and Fall."

158
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,697
You have one drink of that,
you walk one block and you fall!

159
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,300
If you have one drink...

160
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,596
It's such a strong drink,
it burned the gums out.

161
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,536
He was funny. He was funny.
Very, very, very funny.

162
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,403
How often did he drink water?

163
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,537
Never, ever touched it.
How many times--?

164
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,409
I'm sitting across from you,
you can't hear it?

165
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,482
He never drank water!

166
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,712
That means he doesn't drink.
I got it.

167
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,858
You asked me, I told you.
Now I'm telling you some more.

168
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,527
Occasionally, maybe,
he had some water.

169
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,800
He never drank water.

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,467
So he didn't like it.

171
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,303
- He didn't like water.
- How many times...?

172
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,736
Hymie, Gabriel, Jules.

173
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,365
Are aunts kids
before they become aunts?

174
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,936
Everybody's a kid
before they become an aunt.

175
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,200
They are?
I thought they just popped out.

176
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,115
I've been thinking about it.

177
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,115
It's a good time
we open our own business.

178
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Open our own business?
What, are you kidding?

179
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,413
Think of the risk involved.

180
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,355
We got good routes.
Why should we gamble?

181
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,655
It's perfect.
We got built-in customers.

182
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,732
We open our own place. We keep
the routes, but switch people to us.

183
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,769
We sell the same goods,
except the money goes in our pockets.

184
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,803
You don't think
Simmons will sit still?

185
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,374
We open our own place,
he'll put someone on our routes.

186
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,774
We'll hold on to the customers.
They like us, trust us.

187
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,074
We won't hold on to everybody.
We'll lose customers.

188
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,219
This is less dollars,
and we got to find new customers.

189
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,853
The war is over, right?

190
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,821
There's lots of people with lots
of money. It's a good time to gamble.

191
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,248
Dessert!

192
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,619
I hear dessert?

193
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,388
I hear dessert.

194
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,597
Dessert.

195
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,329
Bring me dessert.

196
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,163
The kids aren't having dessert?

197
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,205
My grandmother is grandmother to me,
but she's not grandmother to Teddy.

198
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,172
- Yes, right.
- Then what is she?

199
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,038
She's Teddy's great-aunt.

200
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,838
There are aunts and great-aunts?

201
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:13,144
What's the difference between
a regular aunt and a great-aunt?

202
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,320
They're older. That's the difference.

203
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,216
It's not because they're older.

204
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,086
Because then someday,
all aunts would be great-aunts.

205
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,955
But why are great-aunts
just called great-aunts?

206
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,758
Why not "good aunts" or
"fantastic aunts" or "terrible aunts"?

207
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,063
No. It doesn't have anything to do
with what kind of person they are.

208
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,037
It's got to do with great.
You know, they're great, older.

209
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,336
What about those red ants that
crawl around and bite you?

210
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,241
No, no, no. That's A-N-T.

211
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,871
Ant.

212
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,717
What's a first cousin, twice removed?

213
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,482
I have absolutely no idea.

214
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,191
I'm going selling with my dad today.

215
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,231
You're not going to school?

216
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,335
Christmas holidays. No school.

217
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,129
Christmas holiday.

218
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,609
- Keep your nose clean.
- Yeah.

219
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,308
How come you didn't become
a wallpaper hanger like Sam?

220
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,953
Well, Sam always had this idea...

221
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,955
...that doing manual labor
had no dignity, but selling...

222
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,128
"Selling was security," he said.

223
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,923
No matter where you are
or what you're selling...

224
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,622
...you can always make a living.

225
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,898
- Can you sell anything?
- Anything. I can sell anything.

226
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,670
See, it's all a question of
being able to talk to people.

227
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,241
The product?
It doesn't make any difference.

228
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,674
You're selling yourself.

229
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,781
Can you sell model trains?

230
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,052
- As many as they can make.
- Can you sell toothbrushes?

231
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,086
To as many people as have teeth.

232
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,484
Quick! See that car?
What car is that?

233
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,886
Chrysler!

234
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,291
The one over there on the right?

235
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,688
- Nash!
- Pretty good.

236
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,504
Give me your money.

237
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,201
- What's that?
- Give me your money.

238
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,041
Are you kidding me?

239
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,082
No, I'm not kidding you.
Give me your money.

240
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,121
What, are you robbing me?
With all these houses around?

241
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,018
Yeah, I'm robbing you.

242
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,030
Get help.

243
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,220
I can't play.

244
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,014
I can't play.

245
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,556
<i>I never learned to play the piano.</i>

246
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,019
<i>I never learned.</i>

247
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,525
I said, I never learned.

248
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,027
Jules!

249
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,367
I can't. I can't play the piano.

250
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,279
I can't play.

251
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,253
No, I can't.
I can't play the piano.

252
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,253
See!

253
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,265
He can't play, but he can learn!

254
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,409
<i>I can't play.</i>

255
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,556
<i>That's the problem with collecting.</i>

256
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,286
<i>I know that's got to be
a problem with collecting.</i>

257
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,589
<i>It's unheard of.</i>

258
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,527
<i>When you have lots of money...</i>

259
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,226
It's unheard of to stab somebody
and take the money.

260
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,802
I never heard of it.

261
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,770
I don't want to know about it.
Not like in the old days.

262
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,138
When they know you got lots of money,
somebody wants the money.

263
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,437
We know that.

264
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,376
We know that. But who wants it?

265
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:47,985
It's not like it used to be!
A man can't walk in the street?

266
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,748
Never, never, never.
It's the money that's the problem.

267
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,017
- You're right.
- Somebody tries to kill--

268
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,060
Somebody tries to kill my boy
just for money.

269
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,027
- That's not good. That's not good!
- It's the money.

270
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,700
- It's not good.
- No good.

271
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,960
Money, money, money, that's it.

272
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,607
- That's the whole problem. Money.
- Money.

273
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,404
When I was a little younger
than you...

274
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,110
...I used to think
the world was made up...

275
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,843
...of big people and little people.

276
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,789
And that's the way
it would always stay.

277
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,687
And then I always wondered
why sinks were too high.

278
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:08,059
You had to climb up to wash your face.
Cupboards, too high.

279
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,361
The hole in the toilet was too big.

280
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,731
Nothing was made for us.

281
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,300
It's just a world of big people
and little people.

282
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,105
You never got any older...

283
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,679
...and nobody ever died.

284
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,909
<i>Michael!</i>

285
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,812
Michael.

286
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,017
I talked to the doctor.
Your father's gonna be all right.

287
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,122
- There, you got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Hold it.

288
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,293
What is it? What is it?

289
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,263
What could it be? It's so big.

290
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,096
- It's a holiday gift.
- What is it?

291
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,602
What is it? What is it?

292
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,967
It's a surprise. Wait and see.

293
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:55,112
The family circle voted and decided
to get you a holiday get-well gift.

294
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,474
For me?

295
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,853
Oh, you didn't! You didn't!

296
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,428
So, what is this?

297
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,066
A television.

298
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,490
That's television.
You can only watch for so long.

299
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,134
To me, it doesn't have
what a radio has.

300
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,139
Yes, it does.

301
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,040
Anybody want coffee?

302
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,505
Yes.

303
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,448
Nice picture, huh?

304
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,214
Beautiful picture.

305
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,432
Never happened.

306
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,394
In the old country, never heard of
stabbing someone to take their money.

307
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,767
Never happened.

308
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,602
You're right.
But the government would kill you.

309
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,610
Would take your money,
your property, whatever you had.

310
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,442
You know what you have to do?
Be like in Westerns.

311
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,278
Have a stagecoach
and the shotgun when you collect.

312
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,455
That's what they had in the Wild West,
because of outlaws.

313
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,648
Yeah, that's what you need.
There's always robbers.

314
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,659
What was the movie we saw with
the stagecoach? A very good movie.

315
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,525
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- The movie had a stagecoach.

316
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,758
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- Very active movie.

317
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,096
John Wayne, he was an outlaw
but was not an outlaw.

318
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,967
What was the movie called
with the stagecoach?

319
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,107
<i>Stagecoach.</i>

320
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,278
That's what I'm saying,
with the stagecoach.

321
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,046
<i>- Stagecoach.
- Stagecoach</i>?

322
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,110
I saw a nice little shop
off Helen's Market...

323
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,144
...on the southeast corner.

324
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:21,483
Supposing we do do this, what are
we selling? Same things we sell now?

325
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,218
Yeah, only for less
than running the routes.

326
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,388
Pots and pans?

327
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,496
Pots, pans,
vacuum cleaners, everything.

328
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,965
The time is right
we get out on our own.

329
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,661
We don't have enough money.
Now is not right.

330
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,137
- Ann, please.
- All right.

331
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,402
The problem is, Jules,
we never have privacy.

332
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,310
Everybody's on top of everybody.
We need our own place.

333
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,815
And we'll get it.
But Izzy's right.

334
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,386
This is the time for us to use
our savings for our own business.

335
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,388
We can get off the street
and try to make a go of it.

336
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,493
Well, I know that's the best thing.

337
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,186
I just can't promise
I'm gonna remain sane.

338
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,692
You put on a little sweater.

339
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,704
Yeah, be sure to take small steps.
There's a little wind.

340
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,499
Michael! Forgot your lunch money.

341
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,970
Toss it.

342
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,037
Ann! Do we leave at 10:30?

343
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,874
Yeah, that'll be fine!
I have to be back at 1:00.

344
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,110
I have to go to the doctor's
with Jules.

345
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,954
You're not driving, are you?

346
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,183
- No, I'm still taking the lessons.
- Oh, thank God.

347
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:36,033
"Can" is whether you're capable
of doing something.

348
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,725
"May" is asking for permission.

349
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,763
- Yes, Michael?
- Can I go to the bathroom?

350
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,465
Michael, do you want
to repeat that question?

351
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,736
Oh, no, I'm going
to be made an example of.

352
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:48,935
Michael.

353
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,613
I said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

354
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,786
You can, but you may not.

355
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,055
Well, can I or can't I?

356
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:02,223
I don't think you've been paying
attention, have you, Michael Kaye?

357
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,621
Yes, I have.

358
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,228
So how would you
rephrase the question?

359
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,896
Can I please go to the bathroom?

360
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,162
Children.

361
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,000
Michael Kaye, why don't you just
spend some time in the hallway...

362
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,803
...until you've learned the difference
between "can" and "may."

363
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,647
When you've learned the difference,
then you may come back in.

364
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,817
I have to go to the bathroom,
but I'm afraid to ask.

365
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,891
Now, does anyone know the difference
between "can" and "may"?

366
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:45,102
Young man, have you learned the
difference between "may" and "can"?

367
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,870
Not yet.

368
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,007
You stay out there
until you've learned the difference.

369
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,176
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

370
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,552
Well? Are you ready
to rejoin the class, Michael?

371
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,051
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

372
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,456
And what's the difference
between "may" and "can"?

373
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,090
Give me a little more time.

374
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,737
Young man, what are you doing
in the hallway?

375
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,306
Learning the difference
between "may" and "can."

376
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,705
How long do you think it would take?

377
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:40,880
Hello?

378
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,582
Is this Mr. Kaye?

379
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,921
His father, Mr. Krichinsky.

380
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,323
No, he's at the doctor's,
but he's fine. Who is this?

381
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,331
This is Mr. Dunn,
the principal of Michael's school.

382
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,266
We seem to have a problem.

383
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,561
Is he sick?

384
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,398
We seem to have a problem
between "may" and "can."

385
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,175
What's the problem?

386
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,142
That's the lesson they were learning.

387
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,714
Michael asked
if he could go to the bathroom.

388
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,178
He said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

389
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,287
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

390
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,185
What's the problem?
He asked to go to the bathroom.

391
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,020
He asked, but he asked incorrectly.

392
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,856
- Did he raise his hand?
- Yes, he did.

393
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,762
But the point is, it was
a lesson about "may" and "can."

394
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,369
Okay, it's fine with me.
So, what's the problem?

395
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,699
He asked, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

396
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,469
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

397
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:37,136
That's confusing to the kid,
because you're saying, "You can"...

398
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,283
...and then you say,
"You can, but you can't."

399
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,616
You don't understand the subtleties...

400
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,881
...of the English language,
Mr. Krichinsky.

401
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,324
This English, it's very difficult.

402
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,724
I never realized
how difficult English is.

403
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,534
"May" or "can."
You can, but you may not.

404
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,396
We've come a long way.

405
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,835
In the old days, if you had to pee,
you peed on a tree.

406
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,772
There's no "may" or "can."
That's progress for you.

407
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,343
Oh, my God.

408
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,688
Hon?

409
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,089
I got it.

410
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,660
The store...

411
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,668
...televisions.

412
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,997
Wall-to-wall televisions.

413
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,299
We'll sell more of them.
How will we sell more of them?

414
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,976
We'll sell them cheaper.

415
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,045
Televisions, televisions,
from one end of the shop to the other.

416
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,307
Nothing but televisions.

417
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,129
I think something's about to happen.

418
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,733
Seems like the humming's getting less.

419
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,336
That's when something's
about to happen.

420
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,269
Seems like it's humming
the same hum to me.

421
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,305
You better hope they start getting
some more interesting programs.

422
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,724
See, I told you something
was going to happen.

423
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,587
It's <i>Howdy Doody.</i>

424
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,857
We're getting ahead of ourselves
with this television.

425
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,932
Why don't we add some linoleums,
toasters, pots and pans, brooms.

426
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,729
Get a little foot traffic
in here, you know?

427
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,496
Maybe that'll help.

428
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,599
Why are they not coming in here?

429
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,946
<i>Electronic equipment!</i>

430
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,554
<i>Here's adventure!</i>

431
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,987
<i>And now let's return
to</i> Westinghouse Studio One.

432
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,526
<i>And</i> Letter from Cairo.

433
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,857
<i>--fighting for law
and order, captain...</i>

434
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,057
<i>Here's adventure.</i>

435
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,997
<i>Here's romance.</i>

436
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,070
<i>Mr. I-magination</i>

437
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,265
<i>The Cisco Kid.</i>

438
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,469
<i>- Henry Aldrich!
- Coming, Mother.</i>

439
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,013
<i>The Colgate Comedy Hour.</i>

440
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,878
<i>Say the secret word for $100.</i>

441
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,180
<i>It's a common word for something
you find around the house.</i>

442
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,991
<i>Well, well, well.
Good evening.</i>

443
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,494
<i>It is Wednesday night again,
and I'm back on television.</i>

444
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,461
<i>--Your Hit Parade.</i>

445
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:47,493
<i>Time now to enjoy</i> What's My Line?

446
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,543
The George Burns
and Gracie Allen Show.

447
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,917
- Well, what does it mean?
- What?

448
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,489
- What does it mean, the suburbs?
- It's just a nicer place to live.

449
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,751
That's what it means? A nicer place?

450
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,419
Yes, it's nicer.
It's got lawns and big trees.

451
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,166
Uncle Izzy and Teddy and everyone,
they'll be there too?

452
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,892
In one house in the suburbs?

453
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,401
God, please be careful!
It's a very old piece.

454
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,336
- Yes, ma'am. We've got it.
- Huh? In one house?

455
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,737
No, Michael, it's gonna be the same.

456
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,140
Your grandparents will live
in our house.

457
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,145
We'll all live near each other.
Please don't distract me.

458
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,979
It's gonna rain, I got furniture
in the street, I'm gonna panic.

459
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,755
Aunt Dottie, Aunt Dottie!
Is this a good thing that's happening?

460
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,952
What?

461
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,997
Is this a good thing,
going to the suburbs?

462
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,761
- Am I gonna like it there?
- You kids are gonna love it.

463
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,604
We've been here forever.

464
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,539
We're even gonna have
to go to a new school.

465
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,004
You ever been in the suburbs?

466
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,581
I never even heard of the suburbs
until this thing happened.

467
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,216
Wait a minute.
Where you running with that?

468
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,047
- Wait a minute.
- Ma, they'll wrap it.

469
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,315
- No, no. We take this in the car.
- It'll be wrapped.

470
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,255
No, no. We take it in the car.

471
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,761
The truck hits a bump,
anything could happen.

472
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,576
Okay, we're all set.

473
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,611
I remember Michael learned
how to walk right here.

474
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,682
Held on to the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

475
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,716
He went right to your room.

476
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,582
Yeah, I remember.
What was he? A year old?

477
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,089
No, no, not a year.

478
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,282
Nine months.

479
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,591
Held the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

480
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,665
Nine months.

481
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,734
What's wrong, Pop?

482
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,871
I don't know, I don't know.

483
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,608
I get nervous about making a change.

484
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,752
What are you talking about?
You came to America.

485
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,148
We're just going to the suburbs.

486
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,683
I came to America in 1914...

487
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,085
...but I was a young man.

488
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,390
Oh, come on, Dad.

489
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,760
What about the house?
You saw the house.

490
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,902
Forest Park area. It's beautiful.

491
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,073
We're gonna have more room
for the whole family.

492
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,039
We're getting farther
and farther away from Avalon.

493
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,042
I think I'm getting
too old for change.

494
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,988
<i>- Bill, are you hurt?
- Not a bit. Cut me loose.</i>

495
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,326
No, Sam, don't feed the dog
from the table.

496
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,004
He likes meat.

497
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,539
Don't give him big pieces.
He has a small throat.

498
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,614
- What's wrong with the green beans?
- I don't like green beans.

499
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,010
Since when you don't like green beans?

500
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,947
Never. I never eat green beans.

501
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:26,852
I cannot believe we argue over the dog
and the green beans every meal.

502
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,720
Green beans and the dog.
Like it's the first time.

503
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,952
Constantly you argue
about the same thing.

504
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,222
It's not an argument,
it's dinner talk.

505
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,832
Dad, this goes on all the time.

506
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,899
Whether it's green beans
or feeding Nimo...

507
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,663
...constantly you two
have a problem at dinner.

508
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,966
- Constantly?
- Yeah. How about drinks?

509
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,200
Mom says you can't mix drinks.

510
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,708
The mixes he makes
is not a good drink.

511
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,904
Let's not get into
the drinks thing now.

512
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,573
What are you talking about?
I take the juice from the pears...

513
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,912
...mix it with Coca-Cola.
It's a good drink.

514
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,215
Oh, please. You're going to
make me sick with this.

515
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,927
Sam, I said don't feed the dog
from the table.

516
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:04,958
Oh, my God.

517
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,690
We're thinking of keeping the store
open a couple nights until 9.

518
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,060
Do you have to?

519
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,830
If we want to stay competitive.
The other shops stay open later.

520
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,973
He's gonna choke to death.

521
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,474
One night we look under the table,
the dog will be dead.

522
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,274
I spoke to Izzy about the family
meeting that's supposed to be here.

523
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,247
Some of the brothers feel
it's too far to go.

524
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,850
Too far?

525
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:34,115
How far can it be? They get on
Rogers over the Liberty Heights.

526
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,223
We know how to go.

527
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,623
Why Rogers? You take Greenspring.
There's no light.

528
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,126
It's a bottleneck.

529
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,320
- It's not.
- It is.

530
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,556
It's not!

531
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,463
It's a bottleneck.
I say you take Rogers.

532
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,299
To go to Rogers, he's got to go up
Park Circle. Why Rogers?

533
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:54,206
The question is not which way they'll
come. They think it is too far.

534
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,483
What do you want? You want me to
tell them to move out?

535
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,119
I don't want you to tell them
to move out.

536
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,984
I just was expressing a feeling
that maybe, you know...

537
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,423
...you can get them their own place
and chip in with the rent.

538
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,995
Their own place? Where would
the money come from?

539
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,428
I don't have the money yet.
They don't either.

540
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,194
I know, I just feel...

541
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,337
...there's always
somebody watching over me.

542
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,336
Every time I do something,
I feel like somebody's...

543
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,169
...thinking that they
could do it better.

544
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,107
What? I don't know.

545
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,646
I put something down, I like how
it looks on the coffee table...

546
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,841
...I come back and it's moved.

547
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,246
You want me to talk to her?

548
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,583
I'd like to put something down,
and have it there when I return.

549
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,086
Do you want me to talk to her?
I will.

550
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,592
I'll talk to her again and again,
but it doesn't do any good.

551
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,525
You know her. She's like an enigma.

552
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,756
I feel like I'm still with
my mom and dad.

553
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,960
I'd like to feel like this is my home.
Feel like the mom in my own house.

554
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,368
I understand. I understand that.

555
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,135
I go out and buy what I consider to be
an attractive outfit.

556
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:38,873
I come home, "No, it's too tight here.
The material's not becoming to you.

557
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,517
It looks too heavy for summer."
Or whatever it is.

558
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,744
She speaks her mind.
She's got opinions.

559
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:47,685
I'd like to feel good about what I buy
for my house or myself.

560
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,053
Don't let her make you feel bad.

561
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,523
How can I help it?

562
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,923
- Put her in her place.
- Right.

563
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,654
You gotta do that sometimes.

564
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,129
- I don't know.
- You gotta put her in her place.

565
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,099
I just would like to feel like
I live in my house.

566
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:01,794
You do. You live here.

567
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,236
What do you want from me?
I don't know what to do.

568
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,342
I know. I'm just...

569
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,011
...talking.

570
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,853
I got it!

571
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,121
Hi, Eva.

572
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,590
- Hi, Nimo.
- Where's your mother?

573
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,460
She's in the dining room.

574
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,431
Come on, let's play a game.
Got it.

575
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,773
You're not going to believe this.

576
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,636
I got a call.

577
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:44,372
American Red Cross.
My brother's alive in Europe.

578
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,881
What?

579
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,916
I can't believe it.
I have to sit down.

580
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:54,181
I need something to drink.
I ran to get here.

581
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,825
I'll get you some lemonade.

582
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,325
Oh, it's too sweet. Not too sweet.

583
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,259
My heart. My heart is running.

584
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,660
So, Ma, what happened?

585
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,768
Well, I don't know exactly.

586
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,265
He was in a concentration camp.

587
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,600
He lived through
the concentration camp.

588
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,972
They found him, but I don't know.

589
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,371
I don't know...

590
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,946
...how he lived through it.
I don't know.

591
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,746
I never saw him. I heard about him
from letters.

592
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,185
When I came to this country,
he wasn't born.

593
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,985
And when he was old enough to come...

594
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,062
...he wouldn't leave my father.
No, he was blind and dying.

595
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,130
And then the war started.

596
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,130
So where is your brother now?

597
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,463
I don't know. With refugees.

598
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,900
But now they found me...

599
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,511
...they make plans for him
to come to America.

600
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,475
It's 4-1.

601
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,619
And after the concentration camp...

602
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,916
...he's put in a camp
with the displaced people.

603
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,457
Now he says he has a sister
in Baltimore...

604
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:07,222
...but he can't remember
my married name: Krichinsky.

605
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,696
Doesn't have his letters anymore.
They were all destroyed.

606
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,665
He knows the name's Russian,
not Polish.

607
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,807
It's a Y, not an I,
but he can't remember the name.

608
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,671
I cannot imagine having a brother
I've never seen.

609
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,638
Never seen.

610
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,679
Thought was dead.

611
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,314
All right, Michael.
Give me your best shot.

612
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,350
That's an out.

613
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,222
Oh, my God.

614
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,263
Bees!

615
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,762
Bees!

616
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,333
Bees! Bees! Bees!

617
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,096
Stand still!
You're supposed to stand still!

618
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,797
Run, run!

619
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,039
Bees! Bees! Bees!

620
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,280
Oh, my God!

621
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,319
Get the hose!

622
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,423
Run, Michael!

623
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,754
Put your hands over your eyes.
Don't let them get in your eyes.

624
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,806
He's not allergic to the bees,
so there's no real problem.

625
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979
He's just gonna be a little
uncomfortable for a while.

626
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,248
I hate the suburbs.

627
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,576
I'm surprised your mother-in-law
didn't come along with you today.

628
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,878
She refuses to get in the car with me.

629
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,352
She's never been in a car
when a woman drives.

630
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,888
One, two, three.

631
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,222
Jump!

632
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,631
The election of a new family-circle
president will take place...

633
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,268
...three weeks from Sunday.

634
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,961
So we have to make some serious
decision-making.

635
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,903
It's like a furnace in here.
Like a furnace.

636
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,599
That concludes old business.

637
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:04,975
I make a proposal that we take
the next meeting at Frock's Farm.

638
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,615
- Very good idea.
- I'm with you.

639
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:08,681
A very good idea.

640
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,911
It's cooler. We won't
suffocate to death.

641
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,783
This is a family-circle meeting,
not an outing.

642
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,118
Why not combine the two
when it's this hot?

643
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,795
An outing and a family-circle meeting.

644
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,261
An outing is an outing, and
a family circle is a family circle.

645
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,626
I'm dripping.

646
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,359
Let's finish the meeting
and that'll be it.

647
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,595
And that will be it.
That will be it.

648
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,139
When Schulman was alive,
we sat in the meeting.

649
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,140
The meeting finished.
Then we left.

650
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:37,041
It was hot, it was cold,
it was snow...

651
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,613
...it was rain.
We sat and we had a meeting.

652
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,309
If we don't want to meet because
it's hot, let's not meet.

653
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,818
- Do not meet.
- No one said not to meet.

654
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,183
Nobody said not to meet.

655
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,358
It's a furnace.

656
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,325
We need to decide how much money
we'll give to our charity this year.

657
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,757
This is a heat wave.

658
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,898
It was hotter at Avalon.

659
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,331
We had a meeting and it was
so hot you couldn't stand up.

660
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,868
What are you talking about?
Aunt Molly fainted.

661
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,437
Still, we had the meeting.

662
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,975
Last year we gave--
Just let me have a look.

663
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,305
We gave to six charities.

664
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,244
An elephant just went by the window.

665
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:14,906
What?

666
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,848
It's the heat.
You're hallucinating.

667
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:22,222
Then the heat made me see another
elephant, because another is going by.

668
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,221
The circus! The circus!

669
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,495
The circus!

670
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,702
The circus!

671
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,037
Oh, look at this!

672
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:42,610
They must be going through here
to get to the tent site.

673
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,273
- What tent?
- They have a tent at Edmondson Avenue.

674
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,631
Wow, look at the circus, Mom!

675
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,735
The circus is coming.

676
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,940
Yeah! Yeah!

677
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,254
Do you got everything?

678
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,487
You'll waste the battery.

679
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,856
- And remember, you stay with Sam.
- Okay.

680
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,522
Don't wander off around
the reservoir without him, understand?

681
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,032
We know. We know.

682
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,000
Later, I'll make you breakfast.

683
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:34,282
In the old days, it used to be
hotter in the summertime.

684
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,482
Did I tell you my father
never drank water in America?

685
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:09,090
The whole time he was alive,
he never drank water in America.

686
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,158
What did he drink? Coca-Cola?

687
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,419
Whiskey.

688
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,688
If he didn't drink whiskey,
mineral water.

689
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,128
But he never drank...

690
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,833
...from the faucet.

691
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,003
Why?

692
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,866
He had the old ways. You see,
we drank from a well.

693
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,906
Spring water in the old country.
And he said:

694
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:29,670
"Water that comes through a pipe under
the city can't be good water.

695
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,780
Can't be good for you."

696
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,041
He was a very stubborn man.

697
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:37,220
And we never could convince him
otherwise.

698
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,446
Your grandmother
is a stubborn woman.

699
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,453
We know.

700
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,455
We know.

701
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,735
Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael.

702
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,934
I came to America in 1914.

703
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,473
And when I came to Baltimore...

704
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,613
...it was the most beautiful place
you ever saw.

705
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,288
We know that story, Sam.
Can you tell us another one?

706
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,816
Yeah, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

707
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,427
Did I tell you I used to
own a nightclub?

708
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,058
You used to own a nightclub?

709
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,393
Yeah, yeah. Not a big nightclub.

710
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,661
A small place
on lower Pennsylvania Avenue.

711
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:31,034
It had a bar and a dance floor.

712
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,746
You went off and got married?

713
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,122
You see, we didn't plan
to get married.

714
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,762
They decided to get married. We
were taking them to get married.

715
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,330
We were getting married. Jules
has the car, so he gave us a ride.

716
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,728
Because you needed a ride,
my son is married?

717
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,132
No, well, we sort of got
caught up in the moment.

718
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,604
Yes, it was very...
Well, you know.

719
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,777
We were gonna marry
sooner or later.

720
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,570
- Sooner or later?
- We got a deal too.

721
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,441
The justice of the peace
charges $10 a couple.

722
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,640
I got him down to $15 for
the whole thing.

723
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,251
It's wonderful.
A bargain wedding.

724
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,218
You save $5 by getting married.
I am so pleased.

725
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,891
Come on, Dad. Be happy for us.

726
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,756
Do you love my boy?

727
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,563
Yes, I do, very much.

728
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,224
Good. Because that's one
young man that's crazy about you.

729
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,699
Kiss the bride.
Let me see you kiss the bride.

730
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,305
Izzy, kiss your bride.

731
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,670
That's it, that's it, that's it!

732
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:20,310
Dad, if it's all right, she's gonna
sleep at the house tonight.

733
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,855
Where is that marriage certificate?
Let me see it.

734
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,856
- Let me see it.
- Here.

735
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,224
I don't want any hanky-panky
going on in my house.

736
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,935
Who's this?
Who's this Jules Kaye here?

737
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,563
That's me, Dad.

738
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,401
I changed my name.

739
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,770
Me too. I changed mine to Kirk.

740
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,879
It's easier to say than Krichinsky.
Kirk. It's better.

741
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,948
Who said names are supposed to
be easy to say?

742
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,016
What are you, a candy bar?

743
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,349
You got a name: Krichinsky.
It's a name.

744
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,684
Kaye. Kirk.

745
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,861
Two cousins, different names.

746
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:09,692
How can this be a family when the
father is called Sam Krichinsky...

747
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,428
...his son is called Jules Kaye
and his first cousin is Izzy Kirk.

748
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:19,542
This is a family, goddamn it!
Krichinsky is the name of the family!

749
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,975
It's not Kaye! It's not Kirk!
It's Krichinsky!

750
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,344
It's Krichinsky.

751
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,213
We argued and argued.

752
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,118
Then the way things are in life,
you stop arguing.

753
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,886
It's your life.
You're gonna have to live it.

754
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:44,263
What a celebration.
And we celebrated that night.

755
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:52,326
<i>It wasn't your ordinary
family celebration.</i>

756
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,638
It was the best wedding...

757
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,671
...I ever went to.

758
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,916
It's nice.

759
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,782
It's easy to sleep when you have
a breeze. It's easy to sleep.

760
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,997
<i>I'm getting nervous.
Too much expansion.</i>

761
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:34,109
<i>We bought out that store and that one.
We got all this merchandise.</i>

762
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:38,213
Nothing's ready, we got no customers.
Money's going out, not coming in.

763
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,748
- I'm getting a little nervous.
- You're not the only one.

764
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,419
I've talked to some of the people
around here in the marketplace...

765
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,583
...and I'm not sure anyone knows
what this "discount" is.

766
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,619
I don't know whether it means
anything to anybody.

767
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,765
It's not like we invented the word.

768
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,697
I didn't say that,
but it doesn't mean anything.

769
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,564
What are you saying?

770
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,365
I'm saying we need to be more clear.

771
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,601
- We need a catchy slogan or something.
- More clear than discount?

772
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,780
More clear than discount.
Something that--

773
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,575
All right. You want a catchy slogan?
How about:

774
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,876
"Guaranteed lowest prices in town."

775
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,779
That's good.

776
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,479
A little higher! Higher!

777
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,309
Higher! A little higher!

778
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,985
What if someone buys and it's cheaper?

779
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:54,316
Cheaper than they guaranteed is
the lower price. What do you do then?

780
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:59,351
Jules, what happens if somebody buys
cheaper than what you sell?

781
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:03,020
Good question. What if they get it
cheaper someplace else...

782
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,895
...since we guarantee
the lowest prices in town?

783
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,763
Find somewhere else cheaper,
then we'll match it at that price.

784
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,872
That's good. We'll match it!

785
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,067
They'll match it?
What does that mean?

786
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:19,874
Whatever the guy buys somewhere else
he can get here for the same price.

787
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,381
What the hell does he need to
do that for?

788
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,419
He bought it, and then they guarantee
they'll give him the same price.

789
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,558
That makes no sense. He's gotta
take it back to the shop...

790
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,819
- ...and then get it here?
- Why wouldn't that make sense?

791
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,826
- They'd guarantee it?
- Yes.

792
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,397
They'd guarantee it.
Maybe make it lower.

793
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,068
How much lower? Because if it's
a nickel lower...

794
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,535
...I won't take it all the way back
to get it here for a nickel less.

795
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,264
A little higher!

796
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,534
Can we just put up the sign?

797
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,240
Is it me,
or does it look a little low?

798
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,313
No, it's still low. It's low.

799
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,247
I gotta go to the doctor's, then pick
up the kids from the movie around 4.

800
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,546
- The movies?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:03,124
From 10 in the morning to 4?
What do they watch, 9 movies?

802
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,691
You're going to the doctor's?

803
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,862
Just a checkup.
What time will you be home?

804
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,792
I'll be home probably around 7.

805
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:12,525
Can you see if my mother wants to go
back with you? Please?

806
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,331
What are they doing? They're arguing
again. Arguing again.

807
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,868
You want to ride back with me?

808
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,103
With you?

809
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,411
Yeah.

810
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,140
No, I think it's still too soon.

811
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,553
- I've been driving for six months.
- No, still too soon.

812
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:35,657
You gotta go all the way uptown.
Lot of turns to make. It's too soon.

813
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,828
You'll have to wait till 7:00.
That's when Jules is going home.

814
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,258
I'll take a streetcar.
It's on tracks.

815
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,728
You take the 32 and you're there.

816
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,628
All right. Fine.

817
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,263
Higher!

818
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,132
- I cannot believe your mother.
- She's not going with you?

819
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,900
No, I haven't been driving
long enough for her.

820
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,570
<i>What's that?</i>

821
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,689
I wonder how long it'll be
until we get our own rocket suits.

822
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,957
It'll be great.

823
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,330
We'll be able to rocket to school
and rocket back home.

824
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,367
It will be great.

825
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:26,340
I'd love to see my grandmother
rocketing to the store to get bread.

826
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,953
Go, Rocket Man!

827
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,231
Yeah!

828
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,853
Hi, will you fill her up?
I'm going to get my kids.

829
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,149
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

830
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,692
Oh, I can't see.

831
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:30,930
It's because you've been sitting in
a dark movie theater all afternoon.

832
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,822
<i>I can't believe this.
Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

833
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,726
<i>What are you saying?
That it's my fault?</i>

834
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,764
I'm not saying it's your fault.

835
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:02,870
You say it like it's my fault
that the streetcar smashed my car.

836
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:07,236
I'm not saying it's your fault.
No, you took the car and it got hit.

837
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,708
- And I could have been sitting in it.
- You don't understand.

838
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,611
You make it sound as if I'm
responsible, as if it's my fault.

839
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,751
I've been in this country 40 years.

840
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,286
I've never seen a streetcar jump
the track and hit a car.

841
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,015
Am I crazy, or does it sound
like it's my fault?

842
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,218
You're being sensitive.
She's not blaming you.

843
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:30,126
- You're not blaming her, are you?
- No, no, I'm not blaming her.

844
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,427
What I'm saying is, they should
get rid of the streetcars.

845
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,332
They got buses.
Why do they need streetcars?

846
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,404
The tracks are too slippery.

847
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:41,838
I don't even like Sam
to drive in the rain.

848
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,606
The tracks is dangerous. When it
gets wet, it gets too slippery.

849
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:49,842
Do you know anyone whose car got hit
by a streetcar off its tracks?

850
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,111
It's a first.

851
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,789
To think I could've been
sitting in that car.

852
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,515
Thank God I didn't get into
that machine.

853
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,921
I cannot believe this conversation.

854
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,255
Can we put the streetcar talk to rest?

855
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:04,524
We're lucky it was nothing serious.
That's the end of it.

856
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:08,135
You should've seen it, Dad.
It was just like the cliffhangers.

857
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,268
Michael!

858
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,565
- Ellen Ferguson.
- What?

859
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,743
Ellen Ferguson's car got hit
by a streetcar.

860
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,505
It wasn't a streetcar.
It was a train.

861
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,946
Off of Saratoga. Freight train.
It wasn't a streetcar.

862
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,244
- It wasn't a streetcar?
- It was a train.

863
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,819
Do you know where my coat is?

864
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,388
In the back closet.
It was too crowded.

865
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,617
Never has there been a streetcar
jumped its tracks.

866
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,161
Now, a train has jumped its tracks,
but never a streetcar.

867
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,665
I circulated over 10,000 fliers for
the opening of the new store, Dad.

868
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,268
I never believed in fliers.

869
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,998
If people don't pay for something,
they won't bother reading it.

870
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,870
The newspaper you pay for,
then you read an ad.

871
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,774
Let's hope you're wrong, because we
can't afford newspaper ads.

872
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,782
You can gamble, you're young. You make
mistakes, you can always start again.

873
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,353
See what Solomon did. He could have
stayed in the shoe business...

874
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,557
...but he gambled. Today, he's got--

875
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,353
One of Baltimore's
biggest department stores.

876
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,530
- That is true.
- I can't find the coat.

877
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,529
Oh, God. I sent it to the cleaners.

878
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,861
Dad, where's the keys to your car?

879
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,007
Here.

880
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,069
You ready, hon?

881
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,210
I'm just putting on my coat.

882
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,474
- Michael, be good.
- I will.

883
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,907
Don't be late.

884
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,786
And it's true with Solomon.

885
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,532
I'm about this far away
from losing my mind.

886
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:52,869
Thank you.

887
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,604
Want pictures here? Pictures?

888
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,249
Pictures? Pictures?

889
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,209
- Pictures?
- No, thank you.

890
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,353
Pictures here? All right.

891
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,749
Pictures here?

892
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,532
Can I get a picture?

893
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,972
All right. Come on.
Everybody smile.

894
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,371
Don't laugh.

895
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,137
I'm not laughing.

896
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,815
Yes, you are. I can see it.

897
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,381
Miss? Miss?
Let's do it again.

898
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,486
- What do you want?
- My eyes weren't open.

899
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,179
They were fine.
What's your problem?

900
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,721
I'm getting nervous.

901
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,517
You? You getting nervous?

902
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:45,716
He makes me nervous.

903
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,896
We're back to
the business again.

904
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,086
He started it.

905
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,287
- What?
- No, no, no.

906
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,695
Maybe the customers won't show.

907
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,302
We're expanding. We're getting in
over-- You getting this?

908
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,906
It was a genuine concern,
and it remains a genuine concern.

909
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,702
Genuine concern? That I like.

910
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,812
Genuine concern. Very nice phrase.

911
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,245
I have to admit, he tends to be
on the conservative side.

912
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,817
If this expansion doesn't go over...

913
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,751
...we're out of the suburbs
and back into row houses, huh?

914
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,618
That's a genuine concern.

915
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,057
We'll toast to genuine concerns.
It's been acknowledged.

916
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,823
No, let's toast to the suburbs,
shall we?

917
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,329
Better.

918
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,302
Honey, don't count.
Just...

919
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,470
Am I doing good?

920
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,651
- You're doing wonderful.
- Thank you.

921
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:48,085
Who would've thought that this bargain
marriage would have lasted this long?

922
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:54,329
You know, I didn't get a chance
to tell you before, but...

923
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,531
But what?

924
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,127
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

925
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,070
You're what?

926
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,032
I am pregnant. I'm pregnant.

927
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,676
- You're kidding?
- No, I am not kidding.

928
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,547
You have great news
and you wait until now to tell me?

929
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:17,617
I would've told you sooner, but the
streetcar discussion got in the way.

930
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,516
It didn't seem like the proper time
to get in the fact...

931
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,691
...that I'm pregnant again.

932
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,659
Let's face it, the streetcar
story was all-consuming.

933
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,357
Honey, this is great news.

934
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,736
Let's do that promenade thing.

935
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,557
Please. It's bad enough
over there.

936
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,133
What is this?

937
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,973
What is this?

938
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,537
There's a lot of people for something.

939
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,272
This is us.

940
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,845
This is for us!

941
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,313
- Discount is here.
- Oh, this is good.

942
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,988
- Look at this!
- This is good.

943
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,318
Don't go anywhere,
we're coming right out!

944
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,058
But I don't even know what
he looks like.

945
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,731
Where are the people who
know where the people are?

946
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,711
Simka.
