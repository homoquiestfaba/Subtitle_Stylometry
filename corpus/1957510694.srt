1
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:28,724
I told you, I, I need you.

2
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:32,724
I told you, I'll
be going for you.

3
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:11,448
I told you, I, I, I need you.

4
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:16,517
I told you, I'll
be going for you.

5
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:22,793
I told you, I, I, I need you.

6
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:24,206
Good morning, everyone.

7
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,655
Good morning.

8
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,172
Can you please
open your folders?

9
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:28,586
OK.

10
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,103
So as you can see,
the model that we

11
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,275
used in the first quarter
has outperformed...

12
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,137
the model that
we used in the third quarter

13
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:38,172
by 25%.

14
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:48,448
With that being said, we
can't continue to use...

15
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,137
Ooh.

16
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,172
Cori, are you OK?

17
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,413
Yeah.

18
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:58,724
Yeah, I'm f... oh, no.

19
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:01,310
Please... please
give me a minute.

20
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:04,689
Is she going to be OK?

21
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,241
God, no.

22
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:07,827
God, no.

23
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,206
No, no.

24
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,310
No.

25
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:11,448
No.

26
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,965
No.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No.

28
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,206
Hello?

29
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,655
Happy birthday.

30
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,724
Thanks, mom.

31
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:41,827
What's wrong, baby?

32
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,310
It's happening again.

33
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:50,379
What do you mean?

34
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,379
The dreams.

35
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:56,586
Well, more like the
nightmares about Cori.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,275
They're back.

37
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,275
The same dreams?

38
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,310
Yep.

39
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:14,206
Her screams, it's like they just
keep getting louder and louder.

40
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,517
Aw, I'm so sorry, honey.

41
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,482
Yeah.

42
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,965
I just... I don't know.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,275
I thought that after two years,
they would fade, you know?

44
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,241
DAWN'S MOM: I understand,

45
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:34,241
but there's no blueprint to
grieving someone you loved.

46
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:35,758
Hmm.

47
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:37,620
I'm still not over
your father's passing,

48
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:39,862
and it's been 10 years.

49
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,586
Cori was like a sister to you.

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,586
And although you feel guilt,
her death is not your fault.

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,827
I just wish it felt like that.

52
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,275
Well, I love you,

53
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,896
and I hope you
enjoy your morning.

54
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,586
Everything's going to be OK.

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,310
Happy birthday again, sweetie.

56
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:56,517
Thanks, mom.

57
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,000
Hey, baby.

58
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,034
Happy birthday.

59
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:02,482
Yay.

60
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,655
Thank you, baby.

61
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,517
Happy birthday.

62
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,551
Happy birthday, my queen.

63
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:17,413
You have no idea
how much I needed this.

64
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:18,689
I know.

65
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,310
Happy birthday.

66
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,344
I felt the knots in your
shoulders the other day.

67
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:28,310
So listen, I'ma take
Lennox to day care.

68
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:36,344
And I just need you to
relax, get that massage,

69
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,793
and step away from your
feelings for a minute.

70
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:51,000
It's your birthday.

71
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,068
You deserve nothing
but positive energy

72
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,517
and maybe a little bit
of living a little later.

73
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:57,551
Oh, shut up.

74
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,586
Come on, Lennox.

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,896
Let's tell mommy bye bye.

76
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,586
Mommy, bye bye.

77
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,689
Come give me love.

78
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,724
Aw, there's my baby.

79
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:09,551
Mwa.

80
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,034
Mommy loves you.

81
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:11,827
Bye, bye.

82
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,620
Let's go.

83
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:14,655
Yay.

84
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:18,724
Happy birthday, Mommy.

85
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,758
Bye.

86
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,551
Happy birthday.

87
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,758
I love you so much.

88
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,689
It's a special key that goes
to my heart, a heart that holds

89
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:58,034
laughs, cries, and secrets.

90
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,068
We're sisters.

91
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,793
We're best friends.

92
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:07,206
We're connected to the end.

93
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:11,586
That special day in the bathroom
is where our journey begun.

94
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,551
I mean, look, this is
the perfect location.

95
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:33,724
With the gym we opened up
last year on the West Side,

96
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:37,034
you see the numbers we're
putting up with that.

97
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:39,000
But it's about
this foot traffic.

98
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:42,034
We don't get half of
this at the other gym.

99
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,689
Some big money, huh?

100
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,482
Private jet money.

101
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:49,655
"Mistress on the
private island" money.

102
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,482
What kind of numbers
they talking about?

103
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:53,931
500K cash.

104
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,034
The bank going to
give us the rest.

105
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:57,862
And we'll own
the whole building?

106
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,655
The whole building.

107
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,206
You're sure?

108
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:05,137
We're going to put the gym,
the spa, the cigar lounge,

109
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:08,034
have it all popping
at the same time.

110
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,517
We got to move fast on this.

111
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,517
Dude is not going
to wait forever.

112
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,231
When do you think you're
going to be ready?

113
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,000
I need a little more time.

114
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,034
I'm going to be ready.

115
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,251
The clock's ticking
on this, Alex.

116
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,268
Hit my line when you're ready.

117
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:46,000
What is this?

118
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,620
Really, Ma?

119
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,275
A taser?

120
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,870
You just never know
when you'll need it.

121
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,620
Thank you.

122
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:53,655
You watch too much TV.

123
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,620
Anyway, to my
first and only born.

124
00:07:58,655 --> 00:07:59,724
Happy birthday.

125
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:00,793
Thank you, Mommy.

126
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,689
You're welcome.

127
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,620
So I got you something.

128
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:05,793
Here's your gift, and
here's your birthday card.

129
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:06,793
I know it's in the bag.

130
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,689
I was rushing. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:08,724
Oh, really?

132
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:09,344
I love you.

133
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,586
In the gas station bag?

134
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Don't judge me.

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,172
Enjoy.

136
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,241
Let me see what I got.

137
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:18,931
Mom, I love it.

138
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,586
Uh-huh.

139
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Now, all you need is a
little bit in your bath, OK?

140
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:23,103
OK.

141
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,000
All right.

142
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,310
I'm sorry I was late.

143
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:28,241
A couple cousins came
in at the last minute.

144
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,793
Please, Mom, you
don't have to explain.

145
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,867
I just appreciate you helping
me out with the store.

146
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,068
Of course.

147
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,689
It's your birthday.

148
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,251
I really didn't expect
you to come in today.

149
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,068
How was your massage?

150
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,310
So good.

151
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,172
Yeah?

152
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,724
I need, like, three
of those a week.

153
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:43,758
Is this seat taken?

154
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:44,862
Aw.

155
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,965
Mark, what a surprise.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,586
Well, she told me that you
guys were going to be here.

157
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,517
Right.

158
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,344
So I felt I would
Deebo the situation...

159
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,724
No.

160
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:54,965
And intrude.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,206
Well, you can intrude any time.

162
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,251
You're are always welcome.

163
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,689
So how's your birthday going?

164
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:00,137
Oh, my god.

165
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,655
I'm so sorry.

166
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:04,034
I should pay more attention.

167
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:04,896
You got it, babe?

168
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:05,724
Yeah.

169
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,413
You good?

170
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:07,793
Yeah.

171
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:08,655
OK.

172
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,827
Thank you.

173
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:10,862
Sorry again.

174
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:13,827
Um...

175
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,137
All right, well.

176
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,452
Well, the birthday
is going good.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,241
OK.

178
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,034
Alex and Lennox took
me to the spa, so...

179
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:21,148
- Oh, a spa.
- That's so sweet.

180
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:22,217
- That sounds really...
- Yes.

181
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,000
- Really amazing.
- It does.

182
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,310
Yes.

183
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,689
It'd be nice if someone
sends me to the spa.

184
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:27,724
Hint, hint.

185
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,724
Well, I think I'm
going to take off.

186
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:33,344
I'll probably just walk home
so I can relax a little bit.

187
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,379
Mm.

188
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,034
Yes, baby.

189
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:35,896
Relax.

190
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,068
Clear your mind.

191
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:38,000
Take a hot bath.

192
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,413
Eat some ice cream, OK?

193
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,251
And if you want, I'll
come over and watch Lennox

194
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:44,103
so you and Alex can
have some alone time.

195
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,896
You really are the best, Mom.

196
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,724
You're my baby.

197
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:47,862
OK.

198
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:48,344
So I will call you later.

199
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,310
OK.

200
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,827
Mark, always a pleasure.

201
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:51,551
Good seeing you.

202
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:52,758
You don't look a day over 45.

203
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:53,827
Oh, shut up.

204
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,310
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

205
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:57,758
Bye.

206
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:58,862
That's my little baby.

207
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,137
Look at her.

208
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,803
- I know where she gets it from.
- I do too.

209
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:02,793
- Yeah?
- Mm.

210
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:03,827
So this...

211
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,310
Girl took the wrong bag?

212
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:36,137
He used
to undress me with his eyes.

213
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:38,344
Today was so crazy at work.

214
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,931
I had meetings nonstop,
and then the damn projector

215
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,689
broke right in the middle
of my presentation.

216
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:48,689
And yet, all I could think
about was cookie dough.

217
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:54,000
Why are you looking
at me like that?

218
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,862
You're so beautiful to me.

219
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:56,965
Please, all right?

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,241
My hair is a mess.

221
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:01,482
I've had this makeup
on for, what, 10 hours?

222
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:05,896
Can't help myself.

223
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,034
You're perfect.

224
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,793
It must be the dress.

225
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,172
Look at what you're doing to me.

226
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,379
Why nobody else...

227
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,413
What's underneath
is the prize, right?

228
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:19,103
Addicted to you, can't you see?

229
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,310
Caressing my body, body.

230
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:27,379
You make me feel
naughty, naughty.

231
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:33,793
And before I know, I'm
taking off my clothes.

232
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:41,827
Oh, it's deja vu, the same every
time that I want to fantasize.

233
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:46,448
I can't help but
have you on my mind.

234
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:48,068
In the beginning,

235
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:53,275
I felt loved every moment,
but that part of our lives

236
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,413
feels so long ago.

237
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,862
He hasn't looked at me the
same since I lost the baby.

238
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:08,034
Hey, are you OK?

239
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,862
Yeah, I'm good.

240
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,976
Well, is there something you
wanted to talk to me about?

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,793
You seem distant.

242
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:18,034
I mean, what you
want to talk about?

243
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,965
I don't know.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,931
Maybe how was my day or my
meeting at social services.

245
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:28,137
This whole adoption thing is
something I don't want to do.

246
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,827
Derrick, you act like
we have a lot of choices.

247
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:35,448
If it was my choice, my
baby would have my DNA.

248
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:39,827
You don't think I
want the same thing?

249
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:43,137
Every time I walk past
that room, my heart hurts.

250
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:46,000
For six months, I
carried that baby.

251
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,896
Six months!

252
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,448
I know.

253
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,275
Baby...

254
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,000
I wanted to be buried with him.

255
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,793
I'm trying so hard
not to be depressed...

256
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey...

257
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,172
but it's hard.

258
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:01,206
Babe, I just...

259
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:12,034
Uh, sorry, Miss Dawn!

260
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:13,068
It's all right!

261
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,379
Dawn?

262
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,896
Dawn?

263
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:23,000
Dawn!

264
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:23,931
You OK?

265
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:24,965
Yeah.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,931
Hey, baby.

267
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,034
Hey.

268
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,172
How was your day?

269
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:32,241
It was good.

270
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,896
I had lunch with Mom and Mark.

271
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:34,448
Good.

272
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:36,034
And how was the spa?

273
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:38,137
Oh, it was so bomb.

274
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,965
Thank you so much for that.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,965
Of course.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,551
Anything for you.

277
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,586
Aw.

278
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,103
How's my little pumpkin doing?

279
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:51,034
He's good.

280
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:52,424
He's inside waiting for Mommy
to put him down for a nap.

281
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,206
Of course, he's
waiting for Mommy.

282
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,379
Let me go get my baby.

283
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:04,482
Hey, I wanted to talk to
you about a couple things

284
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:06,137
a little later when
you get a minute.

285
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,172
OK.

286
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,965
What are you building?

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,344
I make it.

288
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,137
Oh, you're building your blocks?

289
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:19,137
Look at that.

290
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,413
So tall.

291
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,586
Want to build, too?

292
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,586
Yeah, I want to build.

293
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,206
Like this?

294
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:48,758
Hello, Dawn.

295
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:51,172
I hope all is well
with you and the baby.

296
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:54,034
I know you haven't responded
to any of my letters,

297
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:56,034
but I really want to have
a relationship with him

298
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,310
as his grandmother.

299
00:15:57,344 --> 00:16:01,758
I know every letter says the
same thing, but I'm innocent.

300
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,241
I had nothing to do
with Cori's death.

301
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:08,482
My appeal will be heard soon,
and the truth will set me free.

302
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:09,689
I just ask...

303
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,379
Cori?

304
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:17,586
Where are you?

305
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,241
I got your text.

306
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,827
Cori?

307
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,862
Cori.

308
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,137
Cori!

309
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:37,034
Cori!

310
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:37,827
Cori, wake up!

311
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:38,862
Cori!

312
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,344
Oh, oh.

313
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,413
You scared me.

314
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,482
He's sound asleep.

315
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:07,241
How was your day?

316
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,413
Good.

317
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:10,241
Really good, actually.

318
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,275
My meeting went well.

319
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,448
Well, that's good.

320
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,724
Yeah.

321
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,586
That's what I wanted
to talk to you out.

322
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,896
Check this out.

323
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:20,551
You see that?

324
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,310
That's a great investment.

325
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:24,517
This allows me to have
all three of my businesses

326
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:27,448
in one building.

327
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,862
Well, which businesses?

328
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:32,551
Well, we were thinking the gym,

329
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,862
the spa, and the cigar lounge.

330
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,413
All three pretty risky though.

331
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,896
No, no, no.

332
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,734
See, this isn't risky because
it's a great location.

333
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,413
It's a high traffic area.

334
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,310
So what's the investment?

335
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:46,103
A couple 100,000, but
definitely worth it.

336
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,793
Trust me.

337
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:50,379
Yeah, I don't know, babe.

338
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:54,137
I 100% guarantee you'll
get all the capital back.

339
00:17:54,172 --> 00:18:01,310
I mean, I really
don't have a couple $100,000.

340
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:03,620
And even if I did, I
think we should put it

341
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:06,655
toward Lennox's college fund.

342
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,482
That's what Cori would want.

343
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:11,827
Babe, Lennox is my son, too.

344
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:12,941
And that's why I want
to get this building,

345
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:15,482
so I can contribute to
his college fund as well.

346
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:16,655
OK.

347
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:20,379
Well, I mean,
what's the big rush?

348
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:23,379
Look, I think that we should
just do some more research,

349
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:26,862
and then we'll figure it out.

350
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:29,275
This doesn't have
to be done tomorrow.

351
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,769
I'm not saying it has
to be done tomorrow,

352
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:32,379
but we both know
what it means when

353
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,275
you say let's figure it out.

354
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,458
We've been talking
about me starting

355
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,275
my own business forever.

356
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,517
I don't know why it's
such a problem now.

357
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:43,206
Really?

358
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,862
Babe, I never said
it was a big deal.

359
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,379
I just said we'll
handle it later.

360
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:50,172
Well, I don't want
to handle it later.

361
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:51,562
I'm tired of waking
up every morning

362
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,655
and going to work
for somebody else.

363
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:55,700
And you being your own boss,
I figured you of all people

364
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:56,586
would understand that.

365
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,448
Yeah, and I do.

366
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,896
I do understand that.

367
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,931
And I want you to be
financially stable as well,

368
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:06,620
but it's got to make sense.

369
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:16,827
Look, when you and Cori asked
me to be your surrogate,

370
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:19,344
I didn't know she
was going to die,

371
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,689
and I damn sure didn't know
that I was going to be raising

372
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:25,965
a child, but here we are.

373
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,586
I'm his mother now, and
I have to be financially

374
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,896
responsible for all of us.

375
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,310
All of us.

376
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,724
- Mr. Morant?
- Yes.

377
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:52,689
I'm Special Investigator

378
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,000
Tony Morgan with the state.

379
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,424
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

380
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:56,413
about Michelle Raymond.

381
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:57,310
Sure.

382
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:58,379
Come on in.

383
00:19:58,413 --> 00:19:59,310
Absolutely.

384
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:00,344
Thank you.

385
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,413
So what's all this about?

386
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,965
Well, her appeal
hearing is coming up soon,

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,448
and I wanted to go over your
testimony just to refresh

388
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:11,379
our knowledge of the case.

389
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:11,931
OK.

390
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:13,655
Good morning, ma'am.

391
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:16,655
How are you?

392
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm fine.

393
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:21,241
So Mr. Morant, you
said in your testimony

394
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:24,310
that you found Michelle Raymond
standing next to Cori's body.

395
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,034
Can you pick it up from that
particular situation for me?

396
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:28,965
Sure.

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,517
Cori wasn't feeling
too well that day.

398
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:35,724
I remember she texted me,
asking me if I could hurry home.

399
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,758
I left work, drove
straight home.

400
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:41,379
When I walked into the house,
I searched all over for her.

401
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:44,793
I couldn't find which
room she was in.

402
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,586
I walked into our
bedroom, and that's when

403
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,379
I saw Michelle standing there.

404
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:56,413
She was just hovering over Cori
with this look in her eyes,

405
00:20:56,724 --> 00:21:02,655
this sinister look of pure evil.

406
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:04,689
And that's when I knew.

407
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:17,655
So I started trying
to resuscitate her.

408
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,000
And I just happened to look up.

409
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:22,034
And I see Michelle trying
to hide these pills.

410
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:25,068
So she was trying to
hide the pills, actually?

411
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,068
Yes, sir.

412
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,631
Then when I confronted
her about the pills,

413
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:29,517
that's when she attacked me.

414
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:34,965
And I'll be honest with you, I
wanted to retaliate because I

415
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,827
just couldn't figure
out how she could

416
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,344
do this to her own daughter.

417
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,379
Listen, I know this
is tough, but trust

418
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,655
and believe we're going
to resolve this situation.

419
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:51,482
Thank you for your time.

420
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:52,724
Detective?

421
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes?

422
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,379
I don't know how much
weight this carries,

423
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,620
but Michelle does not
deserve to be a free woman.

424
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:01,517
She worked at the pharmacy,
which means she had access

425
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,896
to those pills, the same
pills that the police

426
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,517
found at her house.

427
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:09,551
So in my opinion, this
is an open and shut case.

428
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:12,793
Well, if the facts are as you
stated, it sounds like it is.

429
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:13,793
Thank you for your time.

430
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:14,872
I won't bother you guys no more.

431
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:15,827
Enjoy the rest of your day.

432
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,586
Thank you.

433
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:42,206
Managing my mother

434
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,965
and my relationship
is wearing me down.

435
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,793
Thanks, mom.

436
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:47,000
Mm-hmm.

437
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,517
I just hate seeing you this way.

438
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:50,517
I know.

439
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:51,896
I'm OK.

440
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:52,689
I'm going to go
back to work soon.

441
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,137
Mm, no, no, no, no.

442
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:55,803
I think you should
really think about that.

443
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,000
Don't rush back to work.

444
00:24:57,034 --> 00:25:00,206
You need time to
heal, emotionally.

445
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:04,034
Yeah, well, the
bills have to get paid.

446
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:05,620
What about Derrick?

447
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:06,793
Isn't he working?

448
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:10,275
The gym is just a
little slow right now.

449
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,724
That gym tends to
be slow all the time.

450
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:14,620
Don't you think?

451
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:15,620
Ma...

452
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,137
A man is supposed to
take care of his woman,

453
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:19,344
not the other way around.

454
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:19,793
He's trying.

455
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:20,827
I just don't...

456
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:22,827
Ma, please, OK?

457
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:25,217
I'm just not in the mood for one
of your life/boyfriend lessons

458
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,689
right now, all right?

459
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:27,793
I get it.

460
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:28,758
You don't like Derrick.

461
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,275
All right.

462
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,000
He's not as ambitious
as you want him to be.

463
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,724
He doesn't make enough money.

464
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:33,586
Blah, blah, blah.

465
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,931
I get it.

466
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:38,620
Hey, look.

467
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:39,586
You know I love you.

468
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,103
I know.

469
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:43,241
I just want what's
best for my daughter,

470
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,896
and you've worked so hard
to get where you are.

471
00:25:45,931 --> 00:25:46,896
I just don't know if he...

472
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:47,931
If he what?

473
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:57,620
It's funny, right, Lisa?

474
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:00,034
The people that fail
in relationships

475
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:01,079
always have the most advice.

476
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,931
Derrick, stop.

477
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:04,689
It's true.

478
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:06,034
Right, Angela?

479
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:07,344
What are you trying to say?

480
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:10,310
I'm saying it's obvious
your husband left you.

481
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:11,482
Remember?

482
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:13,862
Yet you're here trying to
give your daughter advice

483
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,275
on what type of man she needs.

484
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,965
I know she needs
someone better than you,

485
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,689
someone with a better job.

486
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,379
Job?

487
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,793
Hmm.

488
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,689
You work at a
pharmacy as a cashier.

489
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:23,413
Stop.

490
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,827
All right, can you just stop?

491
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:26,068
This is every time now.

492
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:30,103
This shit is draining, listening
to you argue all the time!

493
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,137
And you wonder
why I'm depressed!

494
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:33,172
This is why!

495
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,344
Hmm.

496
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:43,758
Stop worrying
about my household.

497
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:45,034
I got this.

498
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:46,689
Let me tell you something.

499
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:51,137
As long as my daughter's
here paying all the bills,

500
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,310
I'm going to worry.

501
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:08,896
I'm so tired of you letting
your mother disrespect me!

502
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:13,793
You OK?

503
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:17,896
Yeah.

504
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:19,137
Yeah.

505
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,034
Why did you sleep out here?

506
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:26,413
Well, I just couldn't sleep,
and I came down here to read.

507
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,344
I... I... I must have just
fell asleep down here.

508
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:39,206
Yeah, OK.

509
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,241
What time is it?

510
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:45,758
It's time for Lennox
to go to daycare.

511
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, shit.

512
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:48,137
No worries.

513
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,034
I already got him ready.

514
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:53,103
OK, babe.

515
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:54,137
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,206
I... I'm sure I can change and...

517
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,448
Yeah. No, it's...

518
00:27:57,482 --> 00:27:58,275
- and take him.
- It's fine.

519
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,275
It's already done.

520
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,827
You're positive?

521
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:04,034
I'm positive.

522
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:05,965
It's OK.

523
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:10,103
I'll just see you later, OK?

524
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:11,297
Try to get yourself together.

525
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,206
Thank you.

526
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,459
I found these on the floor.

527
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:38,931
Wow.

528
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:42,551
Um, I'm sorry.

529
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,426
Babe, I... I don't even
know how they got there.

530
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:54,172
Hello?

531
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,068
Mom?

532
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:55,931
Hey.

533
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:57,103
What's going on?

534
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,896
I'm not feeling too well.

535
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:01,896
Really?

536
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:03,448
What's wrong?

537
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:04,482
I don't know.

538
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:08,551
I just... I feel groggy and weak.

539
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:09,448
Aw.

540
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,344
Do you need anything?

541
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:12,172
No, Ma.

542
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,862
I should be fine.

543
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:16,034
Do you mind covering
for me today?

544
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,448
Yeah, no problem.

545
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,103
Are you sure you're OK?

546
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:20,620
Yeah.

547
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,586
I think I'm just going
to relax for a bit.

548
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,275
DAWN'S MOM: OK, honey.

549
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,620
Have some tea, and burn some
of those oils I gave you.

550
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:29,482
Oh, that's what I
meant to tell you.

551
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,206
You remember the woman
at the restaurant

552
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,206
that bumped my chair?

553
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

554
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,275
Well, she took the wrong
bag, so she's probably enjoying

555
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,517
those oils that you bought me.

556
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:40,862
Really?

557
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:42,379
That sucks.

558
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,551
Well, I actually have her book.

559
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:49,551
And it's good, but
weird at the same time.

560
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:50,517
Hmm.

561
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:53,965
Sounds interesting, I think.

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,965
Yeah.

563
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,689
I don't know.

564
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,482
It's just something about it.

565
00:29:57,517 --> 00:30:01,034
It's, um... I don't know.

566
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:02,413
Something familiar about it.

567
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:04,206
But, um, I don't know.

568
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,206
I'll call you back later, Ma.

569
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,103
OK.

570
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,103
Feel better, honey.

571
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:08,034
OK, I will. I love you.

572
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:08,620
OK.

573
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:09,655
Bye, bye.

574
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:16,275
All right.

575
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,344
Let's make you beautiful.

576
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,068
Put the offer together.

577
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:29,103
It's a solid one.

578
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:34,965
I don't have the check yet.

579
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,517
What do you mean you
don't got the check yet?

580
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:48,068
She got the money, but we're
just trying to figure it out.

581
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:57,034
You'll figure it out.

582
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,172
To be all the way
honest, I ain't even

583
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:01,275
trying to hear all that shit.

584
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,206
If she's got the money, then
why you ain't got the check?

585
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:05,379
Yo, just calm down, man.

586
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,551
Look, I ain't calming shit down.

587
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:10,344
You must not understand
what's going on here,

588
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,586
so let me refresh your memory.

589
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,172
I know everything, Alex.

590
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,965
This is not a partnership.

591
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,206
You owe me.

592
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,172
Yeah, I know.

593
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:23,379
Just... I'ma figure it out.

594
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,586
Well, you got a couple days.

595
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,689
And after that, I got
to do what I got to do.

596
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:31,413
If I got to expose you,
believe me, I will.

597
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:59,965
This is one of the things
that I struggle with on a daily.

598
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,068
Some days, I think it
was the right thing

599
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:06,344
to do because
Lennox is so happy,

600
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:09,000
and I know no one would take
care of him the way I can.

601
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:19,620
Other days, my sister,
I feel like I betrayed

602
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:23,172
you because I know
that this is the life

603
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:24,206
that you always wanted.

604
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,586
Cori, I love you.

605
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:36,413
And I... I need you
to know that I never

606
00:32:36,448 --> 00:32:39,034
wanted to take your place.

607
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:42,655
I never wanted to
be with your man.

608
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:47,965
When you died, a
piece of me died.

609
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:57,068
And being Lennox's adoptive
mother is the only piece of you

610
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:58,620
that I have left.

611
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:02,551
It's the only thing
that gives me life.

612
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,379
If it wasn't for my best friend,

613
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:28,613
I don't know where I would be.

614
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:34,482
Surprise.

615
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:37,034
Oh, my goodness.

616
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:39,689
I can not believe you're here.

617
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:40,448
Aw.

618
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:41,724
I... I finally came. I'm sorry.

619
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:42,724
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.

620
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,241
Wait. My room is a mess.

621
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:46,206
Oh, my goodness.

622
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,137
Let me just...

623
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:47,965
I can help you.

624
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,068
I mean, it looks
like you need it.

625
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,838
You know I would sleep with
you in a dumpster if I had to.

626
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:52,517
Yeah.

627
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,482
Well, this is pretty close.

628
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:57,241
Um... hey.

629
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,724
So how's my sis?

630
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:02,275
Girl, I don't even
recognize myself anymore, OK?

631
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,655
Look at me.

632
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:05,241
With everything
you've been through?

633
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:07,448
Your energy and your
soul is glowing.

634
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:08,448
Enough about me.

635
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,620
What's going on with you?

636
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:11,655
Um, nothing much.

637
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:14,103
Well, today, I was at
the lawyer's office,

638
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,103
going over the details
of my trust fund.

639
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,758
I thought you did that already.

640
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:20,551
I did, but my dad
structured it so that money

641
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:21,827
would be released over time.

642
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,482
And then every time
money is released,

643
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:25,310
I have to go sign for it.

644
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:26,379
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

645
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:27,344
That's boring.

646
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,413
I want juicy.

647
00:34:28,448 --> 00:34:29,586
Come on.

648
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,482
Tell me what's
going on with Larry.

649
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,482
I mean, nothing much.

650
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:35,379
I need to hear.

651
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:36,655
You know I love Larry.

652
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:37,379
You're going to be disappointed.

653
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:39,551
Why?

654
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:40,862
Because there's no more Larry.

655
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:42,793
What?

656
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,241
No.

657
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:46,206
I'm sorry, but
I know you liked him.

658
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:47,620
Yeah.

659
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:49,551
I just couldn't do it anymore.

660
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:51,689
Yeah, his name is Steven.

661
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,182
I think you'll like
him more than Larry.

662
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:56,103
More?

663
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:56,551
Well...

664
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:57,620
I'll try.

665
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,586
We just can't do all for
the bullshit, you know?

666
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,275
Girl, don't I know.

667
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,551
Is everything OK?

668
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:29,620
It's not the same.

669
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,965
And honestly, I'm not the same.

670
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,862
I'm sorry I haven't been
here every single day.

671
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,586
I would not
forgive myself if you

672
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,827
were here every single day, OK?

673
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:44,310
You have a life and a business.

674
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:46,310
I understand.

675
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:52,275
I know, but I should have
been here more than I have.

676
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,206
You're here now.

677
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:55,689
That I am.

678
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:56,931
I have good news though.

679
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,379
What?

680
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,241
I met someone else.

681
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,275
That was fast.

682
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,896
Oh, my... you scared me.

683
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,413
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

684
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:29,724
Thinking.

685
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:32,413
You're thinking in the dark?

686
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:33,448
OK.

687
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:39,275
How you doing?

688
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:39,862
I'm all right.

689
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:41,448
I'm just tired.

690
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:44,517
I don't know what's
going on with my body.

691
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,758
I just feel weak.

692
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:50,000
You need to eat.

693
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:52,034
I can make you something.

694
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:52,689
All right.

695
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:53,931
Thank you.

696
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:55,405
I'm just going to
go to the bathroom.

697
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:34,448
Being blinded by love

698
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:35,941
blocked me from seeing
what was happening

699
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,793
right in front of my eyes.

700
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:38,862
Thanks, babe.

701
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,482
Oh, this is good.

702
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,310
You want a bite?

703
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:50,344
Nah.

704
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:50,931
I'm good.

705
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:52,034
I'm not hungry.

706
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,068
You OK?

707
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,000
When did you decide
to get a policy?

708
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,655
I mean, when I lost
the baby, and I heard

709
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,724
the doctor say I
could have died,

710
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,758
I got a life insurance policy.

711
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,482
You should get one, too.

712
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,068
I will.

713
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:19,793
I might have you as the
beneficiary, unlike yours.

714
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,413
It's not even like that.

715
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:24,137
Then how is it?

716
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,896
We both know your
mother would love

717
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:30,034
a couple 100,000 if something
happened to you and Kelly.

718
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,758
Her family's got money.

719
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:33,655
She don't even need it.

720
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,655
And then there's me.

721
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,137
I'm left out in the cold.

722
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,758
But anyway, I had a
couple of thoughts

723
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:50,517
about this whole
adopting a baby thing.

724
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,862
OK.

725
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,896
Have you thought of a surrogate?

726
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,620
Nah, it's too expensive.

727
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:58,034
Yeah.

728
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,827
But what if it wasn't expensive?

729
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:05,620
Like what if I can
get it for free?

730
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,172
How, Derrick?

731
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:08,068
Kelly.

732
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:09,206
What?

733
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:10,620
Think about it.

734
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:12,103
She's like a sister.

735
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,827
You know she'll do
anything for you.

736
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,044
You put her as a
second beneficiary

737
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,551
on your life insurance policy.

738
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:20,793
That says a lot.

739
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:22,793
She's the perfect candidate.

740
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,482
No.

741
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:26,182
I would feel crazy asking her
to do something like that.

742
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,448
Uhn-uhn.

743
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,482
I...

744
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:33,206
You think she likes
seeing you like this?

745
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:36,482
Do you think she enjoys
knowing you're depressed?

746
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:45,827
This is the best
thing for you and us.

747
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:48,206
The least you can do is try!

748
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:48,862
OK. OK.

749
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:49,689
Right?

750
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:50,724
OK.

751
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,965
All right, OK.

752
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Let me just...

753
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,172
Uh, Lisa?

754
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:22,172
Oh, my god.

755
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,965
Hey.

756
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,655
Girl, I almost hit you.

757
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,206
Oh, I'm sorry for popping
up on you like this.

758
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,172
No, it's OK.

759
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:30,562
I was just going to
go run some errands.

760
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:31,172
Are you OK?

761
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:32,655
Yeah.

762
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,551
Um, can we just take
a walk for a minute?

763
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:37,862
Sure, sure.

764
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:38,896
You look cute.

765
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:39,724
Thank you.

766
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:42,000
You look good, too.

767
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:44,689
You know I know when
you're lying, right?

768
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:46,655
So what's going on?

769
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:47,620
Talk to me.

770
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,482
I don't know.

771
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:51,527
It's like, I don't know
what's going on with Derrick.

772
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,620
One minute, he's trying to get
me to join this pyramid scheme,

773
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:57,206
and then the next he's
having these crazy thoughts

774
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:58,724
about adopting.

775
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:01,206
Really?

776
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:05,275
But then last night, we
talked about a surrogate.

777
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,034
Hmm.

778
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,724
I mean, a surrogate
is a good option.

779
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, but he mentioned you.

780
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:15,862
Me?

781
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,137
I know.

782
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:19,034
I looked exactly how
you do right now, right?

783
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,251
I'm like, that's crazy, right?

784
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:21,103
But...

785
00:41:21,137 --> 00:41:22,793
Mm.

786
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,172
I don't know.

787
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:26,137
It's like, the more I
sat and thought about it,

788
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:28,137
the less crazy it
kind of sounded.

789
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,793
I mean, look, you've been
my sister since day one.

790
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,793
I have always considered
you as that, right?

791
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,172
And I don't know.

792
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,137
When I think about
somebody to share

793
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:44,724
such a precious,
life-changing moment with,

794
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:46,965
you're the only person
that I could think of.

795
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:54,896
You know, when the doctor
said that they had to decide

796
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:56,655
between saving me or my baby...

797
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:04,758
I was ready to die.

798
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,965
Knowing that I can't have
children, it just, like...

799
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
It just, like, killed my soul.

800
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,758
And I know...

801
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:22,034
I know that I cannot fathom,
you know, what I'm asking you.

802
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:22,931
Like, I get it,
'cause it's a lot.

803
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:25,310
Sis, sis, sis.

804
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,000
Stop.

805
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:28,758
Stop.

806
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:29,793
I'll do it.

807
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,586
I'll do it.

808
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,758
I can't even imagine the type
of pain you have endured.

809
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,034
You are so strong.

810
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:43,034
You know that?

811
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:44,620
And I know if the
roles were reversed,

812
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:46,793
and I was sitting
on this bench asking

813
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:49,758
you to do the same thing,
you would do it for me.

814
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:50,655
Of course.

815
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:51,655
I know.

816
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:52,793
I know.

817
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:53,620
It's going to be OK.

818
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,862
I love you.

819
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,620
It's going to be OK.

820
00:42:57,655 --> 00:42:59,275
Best friend, you're

821
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,000
the light to my darkness,
the strength to my weakness,

822
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:05,000
the peanut butter to my jelly.

823
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:10,068
Ay.

824
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:11,758
I'm rolling my ace today.

825
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:12,379
Ay, y'all.

826
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,310
What's up?

827
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:14,862
We're two peas in a pod.

828
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:15,931
That's right.

829
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:16,931
And I'm the peanut butter.

830
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:18,344
And I'm the jelly.

831
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:20,413
And you can't
have one without the other.

832
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:25,275
Oh, shit.

833
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,862
You scared the hell out of me.

834
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,689
What are you doing?

835
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:32,010
I'm wondering why
you haven't picked

836
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:34,827
up our son like you agree to.

837
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,655
Shit.

838
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:36,689
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:37,379
I forgot.

840
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,758
Yeah.

841
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:42,758
I see why.

842
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:43,965
I'll go get him.

843
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,793
I'll come with you.

844
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:45,344
It's fine.

845
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:47,862
Can I have my book?

846
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:49,931
Maybe you should
give this book a break.

847
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:51,310
You're becoming obsessed.

848
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:52,793
What?

849
00:43:52,827 --> 00:43:54,241
I'm fine.

850
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:56,000
And you don't have to
take it away from me

851
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:58,000
like a toy from a child.

852
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:00,206
Can you stop, please?

853
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:03,310
Will you look at yourself?

854
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:07,172
You're acting like this
over a little book.

855
00:44:07,206 --> 00:44:08,862
You haven't worked.

856
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,827
You haven't cooked.

857
00:44:09,862 --> 00:44:10,907
You ain't even cleaned
up the damn place.

858
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:12,724
Excuse you.

859
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:13,758
Give me my book.

860
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:19,862
I don't know what's
going on with you,

861
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:23,827
Dawn, but this little obsession
that you have with this book?

862
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:24,862
It ain't healthy.

863
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:34,827
You got my money?

864
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:36,379
Almost.

865
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,034
So why are you on my phone?

866
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,241
I need more pills.

867
00:44:40,275 --> 00:44:41,448
These games you playing,

868
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:42,896
I don't got time for them.

869
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,896
I'm not playing
any games, all right?

870
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:47,448
You said you want
the money, right?

871
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:48,862
Yeah.

872
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:52,758
Well, I need more
pills, like ASAP.

873
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:55,344
Meet me
at the spot, and hurry up.

874
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:58,034
Yeah.

875
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:02,103
Hello?

876
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:03,206
Ma?

877
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,103
Hey.

878
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:07,103
How are you feeling?

879
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm losing my shit.

880
00:45:09,034 --> 00:45:10,034
What?

881
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:12,551
What's wrong with you?

882
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:14,965
You remember that book
that I've been reading?

883
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,551
Mm, the weird and good one?

884
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:18,379
Yeah.

885
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:20,103
It's... I don't know.

886
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,551
It's weird.

887
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:24,413
It... It's like it's... it's
connected to me somehow.

888
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:27,103
What?

889
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,448
I'm serious, Ma.

890
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:33,413
It's like everything that
I'm reading in the book

891
00:45:33,448 --> 00:45:35,551
is happening in my real life.

892
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:39,206
Dawn, baby,

893
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,793
have you been
getting enough rest?

894
00:45:40,827 --> 00:45:41,310
Yes.

895
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:42,827
All I do is sleep.

896
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:46,034
And no, I'm not overreacting,
so don't say that.

897
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:47,793
OK, OK.

898
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:50,034
Calm down.

899
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:52,551
Well, I don't know.

900
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,931
Maybe you need to get out
of the house for a while.

901
00:45:54,965 --> 00:45:56,413
Come here.

902
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:58,328
The customers have been
asking about you anyway.

903
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:04,586
Yeah.

904
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:08,137
Um, I don't kn...

905
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:09,212
Mom, let me call you back.

906
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:22,034
Your call has been

907
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:23,424
forwarded to an automatic
voice message system.

908
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,482
Hello.

909
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:27,034
You have reached
Books and Books.

910
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,448
We are currently closed.

911
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:29,586
Please leave a message.

912
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:39,482
Hey.

913
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:40,620
Hey.

914
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:41,965
You busy?

915
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,103
Uh, just returning some emails.

916
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,275
All right.

917
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,103
Um, I owe you an apology.

918
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:53,068
I was being an asshole
earlier because I...

919
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,206
I really miss you.

920
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:59,034
I feel like you've been
a little distant lately,

921
00:46:59,068 --> 00:47:00,965
but that's no excuse.

922
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm sorry.

923
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:07,137
Aw.

924
00:47:11,724 --> 00:47:12,275
Yeah.

925
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,620
I've, um... I don't know.

926
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:19,241
I just... I've just been trying
to figure everything out.

927
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:25,068
And I'm sorry, too.

928
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,517
It's all good.

929
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,103
I brought us back a
nice bottle of wine,

930
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:32,172
and I dropped Lennox off
at your mother's house

931
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:36,689
because I figured we
needed some adult time.

932
00:47:36,724 --> 00:47:38,206
OK.

933
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:39,586
Yeah?

934
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,379
Yeah.

935
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:41,448
All right.

936
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:57,034
He is so precious.

937
00:47:57,068 --> 00:47:58,137
He is.

938
00:47:58,172 --> 00:48:02,620
He is just like Cori.

939
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,517
Her twin, literally.

940
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:09,517
I can't believe he's two.

941
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:15,586
Time just flies by.

942
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:20,758
Babe, listen.

943
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:23,034
I know at times you might
question all of this

944
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:30,275
or beat yourself up over us
being married, and I get it.

945
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,620
I promise, I understand.

946
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:38,413
But I also know how much
Cori loved you and me.

947
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,517
And deep in my
heart, I believe she

948
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,137
would have been OK
with this, especially

949
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,103
for the sake of Lennox.

950
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:51,517
If I didn't believe that, I
wouldn't be here with you.

951
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:55,482
But Dawn, I need you
to start believing it,

952
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:59,586
too, because it's the truth.

953
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:14,206
Shit.

954
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:15,310
What's wrong?

955
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:16,482
It's my mom.

956
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:18,241
She texted me.

957
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:23,344
I forgot about this client
picking up this painting.

958
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:24,655
She can't handle that?

959
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:29,137
Um, it's one of my
father's old friends.

960
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:33,724
He likes to sit and talk, and he
spends a lot of money with us.

961
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:36,724
So usually, I just
sit and listen.

962
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:42,137
You don't mind if I...

963
00:49:42,172 --> 00:49:44,517
No, it's fine.

964
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:45,586
I'll just see you later.

965
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:58,517
Um, given some more thought
about your investment property.

966
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,689
Maybe, um, we can
work something out.

967
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:05,862
OK.

968
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,413
I see you judging me,
and I'm not surprised.

969
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,034
Remind me of your damn mama.

970
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,241
Cori?

971
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:13,275
Where are you?

972
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:18,172
I got your text.

973
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,310
Cori?

974
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,482
Cori?

975
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:35,103
Cori!

976
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:36,137
Cori!

977
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,206
She's dead.

978
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,448
She's dead!

979
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:44,620
What did you do?

980
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:47,448
What are you talking about?

981
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49,448
What did you do to my daughter?

982
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,206
What'd you do to her?

983
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,448
911.

984
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:17,413
What is your emergency?

985
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,551
Send help.

986
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:24,551
My girlfriend is laying here,
and she's not breathing.

987
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:26,655
I'm at 553 Copperas Cove Lane.

988
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:29,344
Please, help me!

989
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,379
Please!

990
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,655
Now, everybody's going
to know about those pills

991
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:53,655
you were giving her.

992
00:52:58,724 --> 00:52:59,862
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

993
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:00,896
Yes.

994
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:06,931
Daddy, what you doing?

995
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:15,413
Come here.

996
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,551
Uh, uh, uh.

997
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,620
Hey.

998
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,000
Best friend, when

999
00:53:26,034 --> 00:53:29,724
you agreed to have the baby,
the smoke started to fade,

1000
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:33,275
and the agenda was
becoming more clear.

1001
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,551
Hi.

1002
00:53:35,586 --> 00:53:37,275
Need any help?

1003
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,413
No, I'm OK.

1004
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:42,586
OK, cool.

1005
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,551
What kind is that?

1006
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:46,620
This is Gorgonzola.

1007
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:52,586
Interesting taste.

1008
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:58,931
Does that mean
you don't like it?

1009
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:03,655
Listen, I just want
to say thank you.

1010
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:06,517
You have a beautiful soul.

1011
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,586
You don't know how
much this means to me.

1012
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,068
I can't wait till the
day I can repay you.

1013
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,517
Wow.

1014
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:20,413
Well, you're welcome.

1015
00:54:20,448 --> 00:54:22,413
You know I would do
anything for her.

1016
00:54:22,448 --> 00:54:23,655
I know.

1017
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:25,586
May I?

1018
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,689
Sure.

1019
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:50,931
The red flags were there.

1020
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:53,517
I just didn't want
to believe it.

1021
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:56,310
Betrayal is worst when it
comes from someone you love.

1022
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:25,103
Babe, want some tea?

1023
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:26,137
Sure.

1024
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:38,965
Baby, you OK?

1025
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,586
- I'll be OK.
- Uh-uh.

1026
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Something's wrong.

1027
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:53,034
I want to get you in with
the doctor tomorrow, OK?

1028
00:55:53,068 --> 00:55:54,620
Yeah.

1029
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,448
I'll go.

1030
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:56,482
All right.

1031
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:19,034
I have a client I have to train.

1032
00:56:19,068 --> 00:56:20,827
I won't be gone long.

1033
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:33,827
Uh, so I have a
question because it wasn't

1034
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:35,517
stated here in your paperwork.

1035
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:38,448
Are you taking any medication
for pain or injury?

1036
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,448
No, I'm not taking anything.

1037
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,482
OK.

1038
00:56:43,517 --> 00:56:45,827
Listen, I don't want you to
feel a certain kind of way

1039
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:49,172
because I have to ask this,
but are you using any drugs

1040
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,965
you haven't told me about?

1041
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,517
No, I'm not taking
any drugs, Dr. Ryan.

1042
00:56:53,551 --> 00:56:54,827
I'm confused.

1043
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,931
Well, your labs
came back positive.

1044
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,068
Positive?

1045
00:56:58,103 --> 00:57:00,517
You tested positive
for oxycodone.

1046
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,724
What?

1047
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:02,896
Wait, what?

1048
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:04,103
There must be a mistake.

1049
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:06,724
We ran your urine
twice, and your blood came

1050
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:07,838
back with the same results.

1051
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,172
Listen, here.

1052
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:13,758
Th... Th... That's not necessary.

1053
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:14,896
No.

1054
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,620
OK, I understand.

1055
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:17,034
I understand.

1056
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:20,689
But I have to give
this to you, OK?

1057
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:23,000
This is the first step in
getting past your denial.

1058
00:57:33,655 --> 00:57:35,103
I should be able to trust you,

1059
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:37,137
and you should be
honest with me.

1060
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:38,620
Does Derrick know?

1061
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,862
Mom, please,
I'm not on drugs, OK?

1062
00:57:40,896 --> 00:57:43,113
I don't know what's going on,
and I know that it seems crazy,

1063
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:44,103
but you have to trust me.

1064
00:57:44,137 --> 00:57:45,034
- But how?
- I don't know.

1065
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:45,862
I mean, really?

1066
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,103
OK, look.

1067
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:48,562
I just need space
right now, all right?

1068
00:57:48,586 --> 00:57:49,068
I need space.

1069
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:51,000
I... I can't.

1070
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,103
This is... this is cra...

1071
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:53,862
I'm fine, all right?

1072
00:57:53,896 --> 00:57:56,758
I'm fine.

1073
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:23,034
Oh, man.

1074
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:25,724
It's open.

1075
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,034
Hey.

1076
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,137
Hey.

1077
00:59:29,172 --> 00:59:32,413
I was coming by
to check on Dawn.

1078
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:34,896
Dawn said she was coming to
the store to help a customer.

1079
00:59:34,931 --> 00:59:36,724
Oh.

1080
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:41,068
Um, I thought that she
might have been back by now.

1081
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:42,931
Maybe she's still there.

1082
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:46,793
Yeah, maybe.

1083
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:48,389
You know, she's been
a little off lately.

1084
00:59:48,413 --> 00:59:49,448
Hmm.

1085
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:51,827
She's increasingly become
obsessed with this book

1086
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,068
she's been reading.

1087
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,034
Has she mentioned it to you?

1088
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:56,758
She has.

1089
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,482
It's silly.

1090
00:59:57,517 --> 00:59:58,758
I don't think it's a big deal.

1091
00:59:58,793 --> 00:59:59,241
It's really silly.

1092
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:01,137
Yeah, I hope not.

1093
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:04,827
You know, this is crazy, man.

1094
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:07,310
It's like, she and
Cori are a lot alike

1095
01:00:07,344 --> 01:00:08,689
in so many different ways.

1096
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:15,068
Cori would get to these points
where she would become so...

1097
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:19,068
So distant at times, you know,
and just really secretive

1098
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:20,310
about every little thing.

1099
01:00:20,344 --> 01:00:22,758
That's when I found out she
was addicted to those pills

1100
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:24,896
her mom was giving her.

1101
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:29,413
You know, I think that she's
just going through a tough time

1102
01:00:29,448 --> 01:00:31,068
right now.

1103
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,758
She'll snap out of it soon.

1104
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:34,827
Oh, I'm sure she will.

1105
01:00:34,862 --> 01:00:36,103
Hmm.

1106
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:40,000
Well, I didn't mean to intrude.

1107
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:41,827
I'll give her a shout later, OK?

1108
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:42,862
OK.

1109
01:00:48,689 --> 01:00:50,241
I never thought my life would

1110
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,896
have this sharp of a turn.

1111
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,344
Hello?

1112
01:01:01,379 --> 01:01:03,379
Dawn, where are you?

1113
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:04,206
Shit.

1114
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,482
I lost track of time.

1115
01:01:06,517 --> 01:01:08,344
Uh, yeah, you did.

1116
01:01:08,379 --> 01:01:10,724
And you didn't inform
me of the little lie.

1117
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:12,068
Wait.

1118
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:14,000
You went to my house?

1119
01:01:14,034 --> 01:01:15,413
Yes.

1120
01:01:15,448 --> 01:01:17,137
Why?

1121
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:18,034
What?

1122
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:20,448
I went to check on you.

1123
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:24,241
What did you say?

1124
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:26,310
I didn't say anything.

1125
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:27,827
He mentioned you
went to the store,

1126
01:01:27,862 --> 01:01:29,827
and I said you were
probably still there.

1127
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:31,344
OK, good.

1128
01:01:31,379 --> 01:01:32,000
I don't like this, Dawn.

1129
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:34,344
What's going on with you?

1130
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:37,413
Mom, I have so much
to talk to you about,

1131
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:39,724
but I really can't even
talk to you right now.

1132
01:01:39,758 --> 01:01:41,482
Is it about that damn book?

1133
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:48,034
Yes, it is, but, Ma, I
really think it's real.

1134
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:48,896
Dawn...

1135
01:01:48,931 --> 01:01:50,379
No.

1136
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:52,206
I... I know that it
sounds crazy, but you

1137
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,448
have to trust me on this, OK?

1138
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:55,482
OK.

1139
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,068
All right.

1140
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:01,137
I'll... I'll call you back later.

1141
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:02,172
OK.

1142
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,068
How was your meeting?

1143
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:30,896
It was good.

1144
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:33,103
It... It went on a little
longer than expected.

1145
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:35,310
He ended up taking me
to meet another buyer.

1146
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,034
I... I should have called.

1147
01:03:39,068 --> 01:03:40,034
I'm... I'm sorry.

1148
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:41,034
I left my phone in the car.

1149
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,344
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1150
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:48,310
It's OK.

1151
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,275
I love you.

1152
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,413
The time has

1153
01:04:43,448 --> 01:04:45,137
come for my appeal to be heard.

1154
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:48,689
And I can't lie, the butterflies
are multiplying in my stomach.

1155
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:51,241
I can't wait until
the truth is revealed,

1156
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:53,551
and I can be a free woman again.

1157
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:56,379
As I've said in all the
letters I've written to you,

1158
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:58,172
I love Cori.

1159
01:04:58,206 --> 01:05:01,758
I would have never done anything
to hurt my one and only child.

1160
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:04,241
I think in your
heart you know that.

1161
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,068
He is very dangerous.

1162
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,172
Oh.

1163
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:13,034
Here he is.

1164
01:05:13,068 --> 01:05:14,137
There's my boy.

1165
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:16,137
Daddy.

1166
01:05:16,172 --> 01:05:18,448
All right.

1167
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,103
It's time for school.

1168
01:05:20,137 --> 01:05:21,620
No, no, no.

1169
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:23,310
I think we're going
to skip school today.

1170
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:24,448
He can stay home with me.

1171
01:05:27,034 --> 01:05:28,620
Why?

1172
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:30,458
Because I miss him, and
I want to spend some time

1173
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:33,413
with my son and my wife.

1174
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,655
Uh, I... I just have a few
errands that I need to run,

1175
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:39,103
so...

1176
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:41,310
Really?

1177
01:05:41,344 --> 01:05:42,241
Yeah.

1178
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:44,413
What kind of errands?

1179
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:45,689
A doctor's appointment.

1180
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:46,724
For?

1181
01:05:50,517 --> 01:05:52,482
Female stuff.

1182
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:54,034
Just a checkup.

1183
01:05:54,068 --> 01:05:57,965
Yeah, a doctor's
appointment for a checkup.

1184
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:02,758
OK.

1185
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,206
OK.

1186
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:08,034
All right, baby.

1187
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:09,344
Mommy loves you.

1188
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:12,310
See you later.

1189
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,655
Hey?

1190
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:15,889
We'll be here waiting for you.

1191
01:06:35,137 --> 01:06:36,482
Women's Detention Center.

1192
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:37,724
- Officer Jolly speaking.
- Hi.

1193
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:38,931
Yeah.

1194
01:06:38,965 --> 01:06:41,724
Um, I wanted to know how I
could visit an inmate there.

1195
01:06:41,758 --> 01:06:43,206
What's the inmate's name?

1196
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:44,827
Michelle Raymond.

1197
01:06:44,862 --> 01:06:46,482
And what is your name?

1198
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:49,068
I'm Dawn Goldie.

1199
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,620
Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am.

1200
01:06:50,655 --> 01:06:51,734
You're not on the visiting list.

1201
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,241
So she has to put
you on the list,

1202
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,034
and it has to be approved.

1203
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:56,379
OK.

1204
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,103
H... How long does
that usually take?

1205
01:06:58,137 --> 01:06:59,413
Uh, that... that can take weeks.

1206
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:03,620
Look, sir, um, if there's
any way that you could

1207
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:04,769
just make something
happen for me,

1208
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:06,793
it's... it's... it's an emergency.

1209
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:08,310
OFFICER JOLLY: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1210
01:07:08,344 --> 01:07:09,344
This is protocol, ma'am.

1211
01:07:21,172 --> 01:07:22,344
I hope I get time for that.

1212
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:23,275
You feel me?

1213
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,379
Oh, my god.

1214
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:25,379
Do you remember that?

1215
01:07:25,413 --> 01:07:26,310
It was just like that.

1216
01:07:26,344 --> 01:07:29,103
That was hilarious.

1217
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:30,137
Surprise.

1218
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:35,655
Well, hello to you, too.

1219
01:07:35,689 --> 01:07:37,172
I didn't know we
were having company.

1220
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:38,275
Yeah.

1221
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:39,551
I invited them over.

1222
01:07:39,586 --> 01:07:42,310
You know, it's been a while
since we all sat down together.

1223
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:43,724
Figured why not, right?

1224
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:47,413
And look, we brought your
favorite bottle of wine.

1225
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:48,517
We did.

1226
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:50,448
Great.

1227
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:53,206
Uh, I'll go freshen up.

1228
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:08,517
Yes?

1229
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,931
It's me, honey.

1230
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:11,310
Are you OK?

1231
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:12,931
Yeah.

1232
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:16,965
I just didn't know we were
having a family dinner.

1233
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,206
I mean, I would like to
know those kinds of things.

1234
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:22,206
Is it a big deal?

1235
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:25,379
Stop being a grouch, and
come eat with your family.

1236
01:08:25,413 --> 01:08:29,689
Alex prepared this nice dinner
and has cooked for everyone.

1237
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:32,310
Be grateful that you
have a good husband.

1238
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:51,931
I made your favorite.

1239
01:09:06,758 --> 01:09:07,862
- Hi.
- Hello.

1240
01:09:07,896 --> 01:09:08,896
- How are you?
- Come on in.

1241
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:10,275
Thank you very much.

1242
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:10,793
Good.

1243
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:11,758
Is... Is Alex here?

1244
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:13,241
- And what's your name?
- Jamie.

1245
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:14,137
Jamie.

1246
01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:15,034
Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

1247
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,275
OK. Alex!

1248
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:16,724
Let me get this.

1249
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:18,758
Oh, excuse me.

1250
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:20,275
- Beautiful home.
- Thank you so much.

1251
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:21,310
Yeah, of course.

1252
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,931
What are you doing here?

1253
01:09:26,965 --> 01:09:28,758
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

1254
01:09:28,793 --> 01:09:30,620
It's kind of funny
you just went MIA,

1255
01:09:30,655 --> 01:09:33,413
so I figured I'd come by and
see what's going on with you.

1256
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:34,862
All right.

1257
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:36,448
Well, can we talk
about this later?

1258
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:38,551
Alex, is your
friend staying for dinner?

1259
01:09:38,586 --> 01:09:40,413
- Oh...
- No.

1260
01:09:40,448 --> 01:09:41,907
I definitely wouldn't
want to intrude, but I'm very

1261
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,827
hungry, so thank you very much.

1262
01:09:43,862 --> 01:09:44,931
Come on in.

1263
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:46,275
Plus, it smells amazing.

1264
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:54,241
It's been a while since
I've had a home-cooked meal.

1265
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,862
Mm.

1266
01:09:56,896 --> 01:10:00,275
I must say, it's very good.

1267
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:04,000
So Dawn, I hear
you're a painter.

1268
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,103
Yeah.

1269
01:10:05,137 --> 01:10:08,275
Dawn's father
was a famous painter.

1270
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,793
That's where she
gets her talent from.

1271
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:11,458
Oh, you should come
check out the gallery.

1272
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:12,448
Oh, amazing.

1273
01:10:12,482 --> 01:10:13,448
I would love to.

1274
01:10:13,482 --> 01:10:14,758
I'm very fascinated by art.

1275
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,000
So what do you do?

1276
01:10:16,034 --> 01:10:18,241
I'm an investment broker.

1277
01:10:18,275 --> 01:10:20,413
I started a gym on the
West Side Alex works at.

1278
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:21,103
Oh, OK.

1279
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:22,413
So is that how you guys met?

1280
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:23,724
Oh, no.

1281
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:25,379
We went to college together.

1282
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:27,034
Oh, the good old days.

1283
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:29,344
College was some of the
best times of my life.

1284
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:30,517
Tell me about it.

1285
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:32,034
I think it's those drugs.

1286
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:33,872
I don't remember my freshman
year, my sophomore years.

1287
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,551
Oh, spare me the details.

1288
01:10:35,586 --> 01:10:36,586
Trust me, it was wild.

1289
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,379
It's funny you say that.

1290
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,724
Me and Alex were the same exact
way, always laughing and joking

1291
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:45,034
about our drinking alter egos.

1292
01:10:45,068 --> 01:10:48,931
I was Justin, and what was it?

1293
01:10:48,965 --> 01:10:49,482
Derrick.

1294
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:50,758
Yeah, that's right.

1295
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:51,793
You were Derrick.

1296
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,689
What did you say?

1297
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,344
His drinking alter ego name.

1298
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,586
It was Derrick.

1299
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,620
Yeah.

1300
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,344
Please excuse me.

1301
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:15,413
Is everything all
right with your lady?

1302
01:11:15,448 --> 01:11:16,965
Yeah.

1303
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,620
She, uh... she ain't been
feeling too good lately.

1304
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:20,655
Oh.

1305
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:21,793
That's too bad.

1306
01:11:33,965 --> 01:11:35,517
Honey, are you OK in there?

1307
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:36,586
Uh, yeah.

1308
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,068
Um, just give me a few minutes.

1309
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:38,620
OK.

1310
01:11:38,655 --> 01:11:39,758
Just call me later.

1311
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:41,010
We're getting ready to head out.

1312
01:11:41,034 --> 01:11:42,034
OK.

1313
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:51,827
Well, I hate to eat and run,
but I got a very important

1314
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,689
meeting I got to head to.

1315
01:11:53,724 --> 01:11:54,838
Thank you so much for having me.

1316
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:55,862
Oh, no problem.

1317
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:08,000
Don't make these
little drop-bys a habit.

1318
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,034
That's a nice little
family you got in there.

1319
01:12:10,068 --> 01:12:14,586
Listen, I'ma be
ready real soon, aight?

1320
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,034
It's not soon enough.

1321
01:12:16,068 --> 01:12:19,379
You better hurry up and
do whatever it takes.

1322
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:21,482
Or?

1323
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,413
They're all going to be
really interested in who

1324
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:25,034
Derrick really is.

1325
01:12:25,068 --> 01:12:26,586
I told you, I'ma handle it.

1326
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,931
Yeah, you better.

1327
01:12:39,413 --> 01:12:40,413
Book.

1328
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:52,689
Holy shit.

1329
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:53,931
Holy shit.

1330
01:13:55,827 --> 01:13:56,827
Jackpot.

1331
01:14:06,068 --> 01:14:07,137
Detective Russo?

1332
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,275
That part of
our lives feels so long ago.

1333
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,827
Managing my mother
and my relationship

1334
01:14:22,862 --> 01:14:24,655
is wearing me down.

1335
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:28,724
If it wasn't for my best friend,
I don't know where I would be.

1336
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:33,034
Betrayal is worst when it
comes from someone you love.

1337
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:36,000
I never thought my life would
have this sharp of a turn.

1338
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,758
Hey.

1339
01:15:59,793 --> 01:16:00,793
Hey.

1340
01:16:05,137 --> 01:16:06,689
Thank you for coming
to watch Lennox.

1341
01:16:06,724 --> 01:16:07,275
Yeah.

1342
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,379
Have you heard from her?

1343
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:09,413
Nah.

1344
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:10,517
Oh.

1345
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:12,896
I called her a few times,
but she ain't answer.

1346
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:15,689
What?

1347
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:17,758
All right, so he's
upstairs playing.

1348
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,838
I already fed him and bathed
him, so he should be good.

1349
01:16:19,862 --> 01:16:20,724
OK.

1350
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:22,182
If you hear from
her, can you text me?

1351
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem.

1352
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:24,320
All right.
I shouldn't be too long.

1353
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:25,931
- Mm.
- Thank you again.

1354
01:16:25,965 --> 01:16:26,965
Yeah.

1355
01:16:29,896 --> 01:16:31,275
Dawn, where are you?

1356
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,379
Just driving. Why?

1357
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:33,413
What's up?

1358
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:34,965
Honey, you know how much

1359
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,931
I love and respect you, right?

1360
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:38,689
OK?

1361
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,068
I need you to tell me the truth.

1362
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:42,965
Tell you the truth?

1363
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,758
The truth about what, Mom?

1364
01:16:44,793 --> 01:16:47,068
DAWN'S MOM: Your drug use.

1365
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:48,689
My what?

1366
01:16:48,724 --> 01:16:50,034
Dawn, let's do this together.

1367
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,931
Ma, what are you talking about?

1368
01:16:51,965 --> 01:16:52,965
Who told you this?

1369
01:16:54,793 --> 01:16:56,010
With the
way you've been acting lately,

1370
01:16:56,034 --> 01:16:58,413
we're both really worried.

1371
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,413
We?

1372
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:03,137
Dawn, Alex found your pills.

1373
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:24,965
- I - know you're wondering

1374
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,344
why I never came to you.

1375
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:29,275
I'm too embarrassed to say but...

1376
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,482
But I will.

1377
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:35,724
The truth is I was jealous
that he wanted you and not me...

1378
01:17:35,758 --> 01:17:38,379
The twinkle in his eyes
when he looked at you, how

1379
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:40,206
joyful he looked when
he rubbed your stomach.

1380
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,241
I even made myself believe
that you enjoyed it, too.

1381
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:48,068
I was so focused on
what my mind created

1382
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:52,103
that I didn't even pay attention
to what actually was happening.

1383
01:17:52,137 --> 01:17:54,793
And now it's too late.

1384
01:17:54,827 --> 01:17:59,931
So as I write this to you, I
want you to know I apologize.

1385
01:17:59,965 --> 01:18:03,965
I apologize for being jealous,
I apologize for being insecure,

1386
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,137
and I apologize for
not being the sister

1387
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:09,482
that you expected me to be.

1388
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:11,448
So if these are the
last words to you,

1389
01:18:11,482 --> 01:18:15,034
just know you will
be proud of me.

1390
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:17,551
I won't go without a fight.

1391
01:18:17,586 --> 01:18:18,965
We're sisters.

1392
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,103
We're best friends.

1393
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:22,965
We're connected to the end.

1394
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,965
That special day in the bathroom
is where our journey began.

1395
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,551
Hi.

1396
01:18:50,586 --> 01:18:53,793
Are you OK?

1397
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:55,000
No.

1398
01:18:55,034 --> 01:18:56,965
I think I just got my period.

1399
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,068
Me too.

1400
01:18:58,103 --> 01:19:01,034
Do you have a pad?

1401
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:03,034
No.

1402
01:19:03,068 --> 01:19:04,068
Here.

1403
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:08,965
Thank you.

1404
01:19:12,655 --> 01:19:14,310
Are you OK?

1405
01:19:14,344 --> 01:19:16,068
Yeah, I'm OK.

1406
01:19:16,103 --> 01:19:17,241
I'm Dawn.

1407
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:18,310
I'm Cori.

1408
01:20:17,137 --> 01:20:18,344
Hi.

1409
01:20:18,379 --> 01:20:19,172
May I help you with something?

1410
01:20:19,206 --> 01:20:22,068
Um, is the owner
of the store here?

1411
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,172
You're looking at her.

1412
01:20:23,206 --> 01:20:24,413
Oh, OK.

1413
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:26,586
Um, I have a question
about a book.

1414
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,241
Sure.

1415
01:20:27,275 --> 01:20:29,517
Which one?

1416
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:33,586
I think it was published
here or maybe sold here.

1417
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,448
Yes.

1418
01:20:34,482 --> 01:20:36,034
We are a local
publishing company.

1419
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:38,517
We try to publish the
books of local writers

1420
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:40,424
to help them build a fan
base through our bookstore.

1421
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,896
She did such an amazing
job with this one

1422
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:45,172
that we decided to
publish it for her.

1423
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:46,620
Have you read it?

1424
01:20:46,655 --> 01:20:52,344
Yeah, but the author isn't
Caitlin Charles though.

1425
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:54,000
So you're the best friend?

1426
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,103
Yeah, I am.

1427
01:20:58,137 --> 01:21:01,103
I've been waiting for
you for some time now.

1428
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:03,655
She described you perfectly.

1429
01:21:06,586 --> 01:21:07,655
Cori?

1430
01:21:07,689 --> 01:21:09,517
Yes.

1431
01:21:09,551 --> 01:21:11,931
So here I have
something for you.

1432
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:12,965
OK.

1433
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:22,103
Here is the original manuscript

1434
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:23,310
written by Cori Raymond.

1435
01:21:23,344 --> 01:21:25,551
She only wanted you to have it.

1436
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:33,655
It's a tragedy what
happened to her.

1437
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:36,482
But before she
passed, she mentioned

1438
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,586
there might be
more to the story,

1439
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,689
but only you would
know where to find it.

1440
01:21:40,724 --> 01:21:42,448
Do you have any
idea what she meant?

1441
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:03,448
We're sisters.

1442
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:04,655
We're best friends.

1443
01:22:04,689 --> 01:22:06,413
We're connected to the end.

1444
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:27,034
If you're watching this
video, I'm probably dead.

1445
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,734
The phone you have is
connected to this camera,

1446
01:23:28,758 --> 01:23:33,379
and you will see
everything he's done to me.

1447
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:36,724
He's been tracking my every
move, but he didn't get this.

1448
01:23:36,758 --> 01:23:38,517
So if I end up missing,
I know you know

1449
01:23:38,551 --> 01:23:40,137
what to do with this, Dawn.

1450
01:23:40,172 --> 01:23:41,551
I love you so much.

1451
01:23:44,241 --> 01:23:45,241
Yeah, I'm here.

1452
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:46,275
Come to the house.

1453
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:55,344
What are you doing?

1454
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:56,206
Get out!

1455
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:57,793
Whoa.

1456
01:23:57,827 --> 01:24:00,517
Just tell me what's
wrong with you.

1457
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:03,620
What's wrong with me?

1458
01:24:03,655 --> 01:24:05,793
Maybe it's the drugs
you've been giving me.

1459
01:24:05,827 --> 01:24:09,275
What are you talking about?

1460
01:24:10,482 --> 01:24:11,275
Hey, easy.

1461
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:12,103
Get out.

1462
01:24:12,137 --> 01:24:12,827
OK, relax.

1463
01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:13,724
OK?

1464
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,620
Just put the knife down.

1465
01:24:15,655 --> 01:24:16,734
You really thought you was going

1466
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:18,586
to get away with this, huh?

1467
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,586
You think you so
smart, but you not.

1468
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:25,310
OK.

1469
01:24:25,344 --> 01:24:27,620
Listen, all right?

1470
01:24:27,655 --> 01:24:29,310
I don't know what
you think you saw,

1471
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:31,206
but I promise you, that's
not what's going on.

1472
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:32,206
I got everything.

1473
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:33,310
I got it all.

1474
01:24:33,344 --> 01:24:34,827
You're going to prison!

1475
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:39,137
Cori, baby, OK, just listen
to yourself for a minute.

1476
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:40,137
Uh-uh.

1477
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:41,103
All right?

1478
01:24:41,137 --> 01:24:43,448
It's me.

1479
01:24:43,482 --> 01:24:44,862
You know how much I love you.

1480
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:46,103
OK, easy.

1481
01:24:46,137 --> 01:24:47,275
Get out.

1482
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,896
I will kill you.

1483
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:52,517
Get out.

1484
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:53,896
All right.

1485
01:24:53,931 --> 01:24:54,586
Grab my bags.

1486
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,551
Get out.

1487
01:24:57,586 --> 01:24:59,586
You never was good
enough for me.

1488
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,517
My mom told me not to trust you!

1489
01:25:02,551 --> 01:25:04,517
I hate you!

1490
01:25:04,551 --> 01:25:07,689
Get your broke ass out!

1491
01:26:45,965 --> 01:26:47,517
Come on.

1492
01:26:47,551 --> 01:26:48,344
Come on.

1493
01:26:48,379 --> 01:26:49,379
Come on.

1494
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:15,379
It's all right.

1495
01:27:15,413 --> 01:27:16,413
No worries.

1496
01:27:18,862 --> 01:27:21,344
Come on, I got you.

1497
01:27:21,379 --> 01:27:23,655
Come on.

1498
01:27:23,689 --> 01:27:24,827
Come on, let's go.

1499
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:34,620
Oh.

1500
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:37,793
Who's there?

1501
01:28:58,758 --> 01:28:59,758
Alex?

1502
01:29:02,655 --> 01:29:04,931
Baby, please.

1503
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:09,551
Baby, what are you doing?

1504
01:29:09,586 --> 01:29:11,482
Please, don't.

1505
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:14,931
Please... what are you doing?

1506
01:29:38,827 --> 01:29:40,137
No!

1507
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:41,758
No!

1508
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,758
No!

1509
01:29:46,758 --> 01:29:48,724
No!

1510
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:51,482
No.

1511
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:53,034
Oh!

1512
01:29:53,068 --> 01:29:54,068
No!

1513
01:30:13,482 --> 01:30:14,827
Stop moving.

1514
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,172
You're a wiggly little thing.

1515
01:30:50,137 --> 01:30:53,724
We could have had our
perfect little family,

1516
01:30:53,758 --> 01:30:58,068
the house, a few businesses.

1517
01:30:58,103 --> 01:31:03,586
But, of course, you
just couldn't let it go,

1518
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,034
now could you?

1519
01:31:06,068 --> 01:31:07,896
That is so Dawn of you.

1520
01:31:22,586 --> 01:31:25,137
I thought I had it
all figured out,

1521
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:26,896
but what I didn't
factor in was the fact

1522
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:34,689
that, uh, you never loved me,
and you couldn't even fake it.

1523
01:31:34,724 --> 01:31:36,241
Huh?

1524
01:31:36,275 --> 01:31:38,103
I mean, that's the least
you could have done.

1525
01:31:42,034 --> 01:31:46,655
Oh, how could I forget this?

1526
01:31:49,793 --> 01:31:54,620
This is a letter confessing your
obsession that you had with me,

1527
01:31:54,655 --> 01:32:00,206
and that obsession
led to your addiction.

1528
01:32:00,241 --> 01:32:01,862
Yeah.

1529
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:04,896
I mean, logically, that's the
only way you could explain

1530
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:10,206
stealing Cori's husband and
her baby, which ultimately

1531
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:14,034
led to you killing yourself.

1532
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:15,758
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1533
01:32:15,793 --> 01:32:18,689
Mm-hmm.

1534
01:32:19,689 --> 01:32:20,689
What?

1535
01:32:20,724 --> 01:32:22,068
What's that?

1536
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:26,620
Oh, you... you want
to say something?

1537
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:27,655
What'd you say?

1538
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:30,689
You're sick.

1539
01:32:33,034 --> 01:32:34,620
You're right.

1540
01:32:34,655 --> 01:32:35,655
I am sick!

1541
01:32:37,827 --> 01:32:41,965
Sick of tired ass women
like you, Cori, and Michelle

1542
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,241
always running your mouth.

1543
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:46,896
You didn't have to kill her.

1544
01:32:46,931 --> 01:32:49,068
You could have just left.

1545
01:32:49,103 --> 01:32:52,586
I could have just left?

1546
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:57,068
And passed up on all of this,
including the $2 million

1547
01:32:57,103 --> 01:33:00,137
of trust fund money
you got for my baby?

1548
01:33:04,068 --> 01:33:07,896
No, I couldn't just leave.

1549
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:08,896
So all of this...

1550
01:33:08,931 --> 01:33:11,379
All of this is about m...

1551
01:33:11,413 --> 01:33:12,965
Money?

1552
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yes.

1553
01:33:15,034 --> 01:33:21,793
All of this is all about money.

1554
01:33:21,827 --> 01:33:24,275
I could have just
gave you the money.

1555
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:28,137
Oh, now you could have
just given me the money?

1556
01:33:28,172 --> 01:33:29,689
It's too late for all that.

1557
01:33:32,068 --> 01:33:34,862
Babe, don't cry.

1558
01:33:34,896 --> 01:33:36,862
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

1559
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,413
Look at me.

1560
01:33:37,448 --> 01:33:39,310
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1561
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:45,655
I got some good news for you.

1562
01:33:45,689 --> 01:33:50,931
Lennox and I will be well
taken care of, thanks to you.

1563
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:52,689
We appreciate that.

1564
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:00,068
Don't you fucking move.

1565
01:35:00,931 --> 01:35:01,931
Will you give it a rest?

1566
01:35:12,034 --> 01:35:16,379
Now, where were we?

1567
01:35:16,413 --> 01:35:19,793
Oh, that's right, about
the whole money situation.

1568
01:35:22,068 --> 01:35:23,034
It's OK, baby.

1569
01:35:23,068 --> 01:35:23,896
Mommy's here.

1570
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:24,965
It's OK.

1571
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,517
Baby, mommy's here.

1572
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:26,344
It's OK.

1573
01:35:26,379 --> 01:35:27,379
Mom... Mommy's here.

1574
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:28,424
Mommy's here, baby. It's OK.

1575
01:35:28,448 --> 01:35:29,448
It's OK.

1576
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:42,241
This is like deja vu.

1577
01:35:42,275 --> 01:35:45,413
No, you're going to die tonight.

1578
01:35:59,103 --> 01:36:00,103
Hold it.

1579
01:36:27,931 --> 01:36:29,448
On many nights,

1580
01:36:29,482 --> 01:36:33,034
I pray for this day to
come not for my freedom.

1581
01:36:33,068 --> 01:36:34,931
I knew that was inevitable.

1582
01:36:34,965 --> 01:36:39,413
But I prayed that monster,
Alex, got what he deserved.

1583
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:41,137
It hurts my heart
that my daughter

1584
01:36:41,172 --> 01:36:43,862
suffered the way she did.

1585
01:36:43,896 --> 01:36:48,103
All I can do now is be the
best grandmother I can be.

1586
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:51,620
Grandma Chelly.

1587
01:36:51,655 --> 01:36:52,655
Grandma Chelly.

1588
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:04,241
Oh, hey, baby.

1589
01:37:04,275 --> 01:37:05,448
Hey, bubba.

1590
01:37:27,068 --> 01:37:28,034
Beautiful as ever.

1591
01:37:28,068 --> 01:37:29,068
Thank you.

1592
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:29,965
We're best friends.

1593
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,827
We're sisters.

1594
01:37:30,862 --> 01:37:32,379
We're connected to the end.

1595
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:33,631
And that first time
in the bathroom...

1596
01:37:33,655 --> 01:37:34,775
is where our journey began.

1597
01:37:59,724 --> 01:38:01,034
Dear best friend.

1598
01:38:01,068 --> 01:38:02,275
Yeah.

1599
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,172
Tell your friend that she fine.

1600
01:38:03,206 --> 01:38:04,172
Tell her where I'm at.

1601
01:38:04,206 --> 01:38:05,620
Tell her, hit me on my line.

1602
01:38:05,655 --> 01:38:07,655
If you with her now, tell
her that I'm outside.

1603
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:10,068
Bring it to your door
like it's Amazon Prime.

1604
01:38:10,103 --> 01:38:12,137
Dear best friend, tell
your friend I want to talk.

1605
01:38:12,172 --> 01:38:13,758
Yeah.

1606
01:38:13,793 --> 01:38:15,182
Take it to the park 'cause
I love it when she walk.

1607
01:38:15,206 --> 01:38:16,000
Take her to the store.

1608
01:38:16,034 --> 01:38:17,217
She gonna tell you
what she bought.

1609
01:38:17,241 --> 01:38:18,758
Yeah.

1610
01:38:18,793 --> 01:38:20,044
Player certified, they
should give me an award.

1611
01:38:20,068 --> 01:38:22,482
Dear best friend, tell your
friend I'm more than average.

1612
01:38:22,517 --> 01:38:24,517
Take her on a date
in a carriage.

1613
01:38:24,551 --> 01:38:26,517
Girl, don't let that
horse eat your carrots.

1614
01:38:26,551 --> 01:38:28,172
Take you to the shows
and the pageants.

1615
01:38:28,206 --> 01:38:30,148
Take you by the hand, have
you feeling different fabrics.

1616
01:38:30,172 --> 01:38:31,344
Hold up.

1617
01:38:31,379 --> 01:38:32,103
They waiting at the party.

1618
01:38:32,137 --> 01:38:33,689
I don't show up.

1619
01:38:33,724 --> 01:38:35,320
One look at the Gram, know
a nigga finna blow up.

1620
01:38:35,344 --> 01:38:36,379
Go and get your friend.

1621
01:38:36,413 --> 01:38:37,586
We can have a little pow wow.

1622
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:38,724
Shorty feeling on me, man.

1623
01:38:38,758 --> 01:38:40,137
I think she need some more.

1624
01:38:40,172 --> 01:38:40,827
Best friend.

1625
01:38:40,862 --> 01:38:41,758
And I see you got a friend.

1626
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:42,931
Yeah.

1627
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:45,044
And I see that you got a
friend that got a thing for me.

1628
01:38:45,068 --> 01:38:46,310
Uh-huh.

1629
01:38:46,344 --> 01:38:48,596
And they can't stop looking my
way, so I really got to say,

1630
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,034
I know you're my best friend.

1631
01:38:50,068 --> 01:38:50,724
Best friend.

1632
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,068
And I see you got a friend.

1633
01:38:52,103 --> 01:38:53,241
