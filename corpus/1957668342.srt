It's okay.

When I first saw you,
I said to myself,

"This is a man that knows
what he wants."

42
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,087
He's just, uh, afraid.

Well, I'm not afraid,
it's just that I...

I know, I know,
It... it is just the way...

things are.

46
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,097
But a man must pay
to get what he wants.

47
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,464

Yeah.

Go talk to her.

You wanna show me

Okay?

00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,115
You don't want to waste
time with talking.

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,074
It's okay.

73
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,809
H... how old are you?

00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,077
How old do you like?

75
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,612
No, that's not what I meant.

76
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,580
I just want to get to know you,

77
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,891

Nobody said anything
about going back.

You've lied! You all lied!

You don't want to hurt her, man.
She's your daughter.

- Okay? She needs you.
- You don't know shit.

I know you don't want this.

None of us wants this, okay?

Come on, you're a father.

Hold on, Serra, I wanna
make sure I'm clear on this.

116

The lynchpin, the key
to your whole investigation

117
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,197
is laying in a meat wagon
with his brains smashed in?

The fucker was going out messy.

I don't care, Amistead.

120
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,861
What I care about,
is an eleven month investigation

121
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,663

Ah, Pinches horses... expensive.

147
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,395

- Yeah!

[laughs]

149
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,301
Nice work in Guadalajara.

150
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,037
That city is a fucking shithole.

151
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,338
Same as here.

152
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,007
I hate cities, the crowds,

- No of fence.
- None taken.

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,282
Country's better now,
don't you think?

156
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,317
Remember Tamalpais?

Crazy days. Fun though, huh?

159
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,458
Uh, not exactly my idea
of fun, Mauricio.

160
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,727
[laughs] Right...

161
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,130
You're sensitive. An <i>artist a.</i>

163
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,334
Life is good now. It's calmer.

164
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,969
More money, less blood.

165
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,773
Our friends got you
something nice.

166
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,377
Mauri, you want someone else.

167
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,446
I'm not up for it right now.

Mauricio: Get up for it.

169
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,083
Job's in El Paso.
You're from there, right?

170
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,485
Alex: Another reason to say no.

171
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,121
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm getting out.

You drunk?

178
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,085
U... uh, no, no, just tired.

179
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:35,523
Alex. I need you on this.

180
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,157
You know the town.

181
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,263
It's too much.

182
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,031
The job is for two.

183
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,334
Don't you have
a brother in El Paso?

184
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,174
[laughs] Mauri...

185
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,545
Are you spying on me?

186
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,913
Mauricio: It's our job
to know things, Alex.

187
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,883
So stop talking this
retirement shit.

188
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,754
Men like us don't retire.

196
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,518
Receptionist: Here you go
Mr. Marshall, you're all set.

197
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,153
Anything else I can do for you?

198
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,188
Mr. Marshall?

199
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,359
[indistinct chatter]

200
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,861
No, no, thank you. I'm fine.

201
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,230
The room number again?

202
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,466
11-0-6. It's on the key holder.

203
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,268
Ah, yes. Thank you.

204
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,207

207
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,039
Vodka Martini, please.

208
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:11,412
So, too early in the day
for a glass of wine?

209
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,681
Or too late for a Bloody Mary?

210
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,583
Guess that depends
on what kind of day

211
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:17,017
you wanna have.

212
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,653
That's up to you, isn't it?

213
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:20,187
[door opens]

214
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,560
Are you alone?

215
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,294
Not right now.

216
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,630
Excuse me.

217
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,999
[indistinct chatter]

218
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,304

[phone rings]

220
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,311
Uh, yes, he's here.

221
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:48,382
He looks like what you'd expect.

222
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,083
I'm sure he'll be fine.

223
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,953
Alright. Bye now.

Your people said
this will be done quickly.

227
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,032
And it will.

228
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,002
I'm gonna need a little more
specificity than that.

229
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,705
No, you won't.

230
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:12,507
The less you know, the better.

231
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,346

241
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:22,677
I was trying to save him.

242
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,411
You are a liar.

243
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,581
Look, Beatriz,
what happened to you.

244
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:29,216
What Papa did, it ain't right.

245
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,518
Now, it's not your fault.

246
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,095
- No child should be treated...
- Papa said...

247
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,656
"It is how you pay to be free."

248
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,624
It was better than here.

249
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,599
- I brought you these.
- I don't want them!

250
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:48,702
[Vincent sighs]

251
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,371
Vincent: Listen, there is, uh,

252
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,174
a special visa for...
people like you

253
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,886
to stay in the US,
while we're working on your...

254
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,277
You want me to tell.

255
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,313
It's wrong that you're
locked up here

256
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,315
while the men who did
things to you are out there.

257
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,817
Papa said to never tell.

258
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,620
[children sob]

259
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,290
I'm gonna have you transferred

260
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,160
to Child Protective Services,
okay?

261
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,597
They'll put you in a group home.
Not lock you up.

262
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,865
Now, I don't expect anything
in return.

263
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,433
Okay, if you wanna talk,
you can talk.

264
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,234
If you don't wanna,
you don't have to.

Looks like I'm going solo
tonight.

268
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:41,421
Ellis: I gotta get this done.

269
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,157
I've got a permit filing
downtown.

270
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,426
- Downtown?
- Yeah, I work, Wendy.

271
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,896
Contracts don't just
jump in the boat.

272
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,899
- Ellis: Don't wait up for me.
- Ellis?

273
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:55,637
- Yeah?
- Her perfume fucking stinks.

274
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,606
Wash it off before you
come home, will you?

275
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,609

[gasps] Please!

279
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,334
- Please!
- You know why I'm here!

280
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,836
It's... it's all
a misunderstanding.

281
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,605
It's always a misunderstanding.

282
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:31,839
- M... Please!
- Where?

283
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,608
[breathes heavily]

284
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:36,276
It's... it's in the safe.
Upstairs. Please!

285
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,645
Don't do this!

286
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,248
[gasps] I didn't, I didn't
say anything, alright?

287
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,960
It wasn't, it wasn't
supposed to go this far.

288
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,385
If I'm here, it's gone too far.

289
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:48,221
Ellis: It's here, alright! Okay!

290
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,824
- Okay.
- Open it!

291
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,893
Alright, I just... Okay.

00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:55,262
[beeping]

293
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,736
Look, if I give it to you...

294
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,403
- Come on!
- Alright.

295
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:05,840

[gasps]

298
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,978
I'm going over to Annabelle's.

[chokes]

300
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,583
I'll probably stay over, okay?

[chokes]

302
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,286
Girl 1: Just letting you know.

[speaking in foreign language]

311
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,943
Maybe you want to do that later.

312
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,477
Uh-huh, I'm multi-tasking.

313
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,412
[speaking in foreign language]

314
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,048
Yeah, well I just
don't wanna die today.

[speaking in foreign language]

316
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,097
How can you live in Texas
and not speak Spanish?

317
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,422
[speaking in foreign language]

318
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,592

00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,138
Hey, Danny. Where is he?

325
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,439
Besides stomping
all over my crime scene?

326
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,541
He's out there.

327
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:23,678
[indistinct radio chatter]

328
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:34,622
Agent Serra, Agent Amistead,
this is Mrs. Van Camp.

329
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,096
Wendy, I guarantee
these are two of my best.

330
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:44,431
Just tell them what you told me.

331
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,768
Ellis was...

332
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,872
It was a robbery.

333
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:52,607
The safe was opened.

334
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,576
And you've told this
to Detective Mora?

335
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,879
I haven't talked to the police.

336
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,780
I called Gerald first.

337
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,920
Well, I'm... I'm sure
Special Agent Nussbaum

338
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:07,889
has made it clear to you,
the more people we have

339
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,590
working on this early on...

340
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:11,158
the better our chances
of solving it.

341
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:13,460
Uh, so, I'm gonna go get
Detective Mora,

342
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,863
just so you don't have
to repeat yourself.

343
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:16,898
Excuse me.

344
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,902
[indistinct chatter]

345
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,503
[camera beeps]

346
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,538
You wanna come outside
and take her statement?

347
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,975
So...

348
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,511
your boss trying to get some
or is he already getting it?

349
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:31,779
That's real nice, Mora.

350
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:34,015
Sexualizing the wife
of a murder victim.

351
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,149
No one asked for you guys.

352
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,617
He just parachuted in on this.

353
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,928
Yeah, couldn't agree
with you more.

354
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,452
This is your investigation.

355
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:40,731
But let's just do this, together

356
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:42,657
and then I'll get Nussbaum
off your back.

357
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,959
I don't need to cut a deal.

358
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:48,029
Can you just not be an asshole
all the time?

359
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:50,064
Just say "yes", Danny.

360
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,966
- Yes, Danny.
- Okay, let's go.

361
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:00,641
Vincent: Mrs. Van Camp,
this is Detective Danny Mora.

362
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,477
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

363
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,514
When's the last time
you saw your husband alive?

364
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,482
Last night... around 9:00.

365
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,652
I... I was going
to an art opening.

366
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,956
And Ellis was...

367
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,792
He was going to file permits.

368
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:21,494
Sounds like your husband
had something on the side.

369
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,233
I assumed that he was,
um, meeting a friend.

370
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,869
- You have her number, or his...
- Gerald: Linda.

371
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:32,073
Let's have Agent Serra
continue the interview.

372
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,041
I can get you her number.

373
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:35,843
Thank you, ma'am.

374
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,678
You have any business dealings

375
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:40,715
that went bad, anyone you know
might wanna hurt him?

376
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,750
Wendy: Uh, I... I... I don't know.

377
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,487
[sobs] Please help me!

378
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,491
What am I gonna say to Em?

379
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,296
[birds chirp]

380
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,632
[indistinct chatter]

381
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,672
Don't expect too much.

382
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,640
When the onset of Alzheimer's
is this sudden...

383
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,709
I know how it starts.

384
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:16,751
[clatters]

385
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,619
Hey, pal.

386
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:22,023
It's me, Alex, your brother.

387
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,724
You're looking good.

388
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,628
Guess what?

389
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,830
I found this the other day.

390
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:33,601
1969. Made me think of you.

391
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:37,071
You remember that year?
Huh? The draft?

392
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,773
The Suns and the Bucks.

393
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:41,942
Both tied
for the First Round Pick.

394
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:45,646
Down to a coin flip...
Phoenix calls heads.

395
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,114
[coin clinks]

396
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,649
[taps hand]

397
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,885
Yeah, it was tails.

398
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,754
And the goddamn Bucks
get Lew Alcindor.

399
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,961
Yeah, I don't watch
basketball much anymore.

400
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,767
Can't say I remember
the last time I did.

401
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,773
[mellow music]

402
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,837
[music continues]

403
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,012
[door opens]

404
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:54,815
[telephone rings]

405
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,984
Hugo: My Captain
called this morning.

406
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:58,819
Apparently,
I'm no longer needed.

407
00:26:58,853 --> 00:27:00,754
Good, I'm glad everybody's here.

408
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,657
So... in light of what happened
with the Papa Leon raid

409
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,960
the Task Force
is being reorganized.

410
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,229
Detective Marquez will be
heading back to Mexico.

411
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,396
We're not done, sir.

412
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,007
Cooperation with
the Mexican Police has...

413
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,267
We're done, Serra,
I've spent the last three days

414
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,170
getting an earful from
Washington, facts are facts.

415
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:18,672
This has been a wide reaching
international investigation

416
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,374
and we got nothing
to show for it.

417
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,443
[speaking in foreign language]

418
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,054
You have something
you wanna say, Marquez?

419
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:25,880
It's not nothing, sir.

420
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,281
We've gotten plenty in Mexico.

421
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,183
[speaking in foreign language]

422
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:33,020
Hugo: But as soon as we come
into the US, things get, uh...

423
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,156
I don't know, maybe your ears
in Washington

424
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:37,158
just don't wanna hear.

425
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,959
[speaking in foreign language]

426
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:41,262
It's pretty obvious
the appetite for big fish,

427
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:42,763
ends at the border.

428
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,074
I don't like what
you're insinuating, Marquez.

429
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:46,901
I don't think I was
insinuating anything.

430
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,302
Was saying it pretty flat out.

431
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,037
Hugo has a point, sir.

432
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,182
We've never gotten anywhere
with the US-based <i>Padrote.</i>

433
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:53,774
If there even is such a thing.

434
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:57,077
The word was Papa Leon served
rich men. White men.

435
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,746
"The Word," is that
what you people

436
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,181
build cases on in Juarez?

437
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:01,415
We have Papa Leon on tape

438
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:02,850
bragging about his clientele.

439
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:05,186
Look, I know you take
this personally.

440
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,021
But the well's gone dry.

441
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,469
I know you don't want to believe
there's a white <i>Padrote,</i>

442
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,104
but shutting down a case
don't make it so.

443
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,063
- Watch yourself, Serra.
- We have a witness.

444
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,765
What we have...

445
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,109
is an undocumented minor
in detention.

446
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,068
What we have
is a severely traumatized,

447
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,170
undocumented minor in detention.

448
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,072
And she's the only
valuable witness we have.

449
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,449
Gerald: When were you gonna
tell me you offered.

450
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,709
Beatriz Leon a T-1 visa?

451
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,411
I was coming to that.

452
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,445
To notify me of the deal

453
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:33,080
you're not authorized to make?

454
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:34,882
With a witness in
a case you haven't made?

455
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,518
I thought helping kids
like Beatriz Leon

456
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:38,085
was part of our job.

457
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,854
- She's eligible.
- Gerald: The Task Force is done.

458
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,057
And that is straight
from Washington.

459
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,826
As for Beatriz, we can T-1 her
and move her to a group home,

460
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,229
but you need to focus
on the Van Camp murder.

461
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,030
That's El Paso PD, every day.

462
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,766
You want to help a kid
like Beatriz?

463
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,268
You play ball on the homicide.

464
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,241
Yeah, okay.

465
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:03,244
[indistinct chatter]

466
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:04,378
Thank you, sir.

467
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,247
Good.

468
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,881
Coleman, Howe.

469
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,950
You'll have new
duty assignments this week.

470
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,852
Detective Marquez,
on behalf of the Bureau

471
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,321
and the United States,
I thank you for your service.

[speaking in foreign language]

480
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:40,074
I saw the paperwork,
is she a witness or victim?

481
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,175
Both.

482
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,943
I'll reach out
to Social Services,

483
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:45,346
see what we can do
about counseling and school.

484
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,880
That would be great.

485
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,091
Is there any family
on either side

486
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,983
of the border
I should know about?

487
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,486
No, the father was a trafficker.

488
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,088
- Hm.
- I'm gonna say goodbye.

489
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,856
I'll keep you posted.

490
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:59,426
[footsteps approach]

491
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,198
I think you're
gonna be okay here.

492
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,235
You asked me before, at Papa's,

493
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,937
what I was drawing.

494
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,941
It is a desert.

495
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,976
I draw deserts.

496
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,646
So you do, look at that.

497
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,381
[chuckles]

498
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:21,415
Keep it.

499
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,924
I'll come back
to see you soon, okay?

500
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,493
I promise you.

- And that's a problem?
- I won't do it.

524
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,102
Your people knew
who the contract was for.

525
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:57,572
I fucking won't do it.
Are you deaf?

526
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:59,373
William: Well, maybe
I'll call Mexico City,

527
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:00,684
see what they
have to say about that.

528
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,276
Alex: No, no.

529
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,280
No, you're gonna call
the contract off.

530
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,282
[laughs] The fuck I am.

531
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,552

534
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:22,630
You call the contract off.

535

You really don't know
what you're playing with.

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,182
Yes, you are correct.

550
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:17,351
That is the amount
I'm prepared to give,

551
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,621
however any construction funding

552
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:22,389
by this donation cannot be named.

553
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,224
"The Davana Sealman Wing."

554
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,894
It must be simply,
"The Sealman Wing."

555
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,896
I'm sure you understand.

556
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,465
Giving like this
is generational.

00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,206
Is he still on the line?

559
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,241
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Myers?

560
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:43,243
Assistant: He cleared security
three minutes ago.

561
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:45,647
Have him wait,
until I'm done with this.

562
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,247
Thank you.

563
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,256

William on speaker: He knows.

569
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,335
That's a bit vague.

570
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:09,937
He knows my name, where I live,

571
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,339
and he won't do the job,
and he's got...

572
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,542
He's got Van Camp's
flash drives.

573
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,944
You said he wasn't
going to be a problem.

574
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:19,212
[sighs] I'm going to call
Mexico City.

575
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,214
That's one solution.

576
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:23,518
An obvious and unsubtle one.

577
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,253
What does he want?

578
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,831
To have the contract on the girl
called off.

579
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,489
We do that, he turns
over the info.

580
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,358
There's something
to be said for that.

581
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,994
William on speaker:
You can't trust him.

582
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,228
I didn't say I trusted him.

583
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:36,931
I said, I see his point of view.

584
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,701
Look, I know
what's on that drive.

585
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,302
Randy's pretty obvious
about his quirks.

586
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,638
This is not a conversation

587
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,573
I'm comfortable
having with you, William.

588
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:47,842

Oh, Jesus Christ, he knows!

589

About the girl, about me.

590
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,812

591
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:52,479
And don't call me again.

595
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,855
if you want my opinion,
is this the truth?

596
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,724
Mm-hmm.

597
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,859
Thank you kind, sir.

00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,394
Okay, as I was saying,
the truth...

599

Well, well, wait. My bad.

Cheers, again. [Chuckles]

601
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,434
So, maybe we
should just go upstairs,

602
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:16,671
make some sort of a deal,
'cause at the end of the day,

603
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:17,772
all I want is a blowie.

604
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:19,741
Keep your voice down.

605
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,642
Shh, we got a deal.

606
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:22,744
I'll keep my voice down,

607
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,478

this ain't no lady.

am I right. Babe?

No, you're drunk. Go to bed.

please

615

I'm sorry. It's embarrassing.

665
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:23,224

that no one knew

667

670
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:33,200
Pontilla liked to party
with the Narcos.

I followed him.

672
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,671
I built the case quietly.

673
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:38,205
But since Pontilla was military,

674
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,508
the indictment had to go
to his commander first

675
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,643
and they just fucking
transfer him to Sinaloa.

730
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:25,706
- A long while!
- Okay.

731
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,175
- Do you hear me?
- Yes!

732
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:31,112
Do not answer that door
for anyone. Anyone!

733
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:33,013
[breathing heavily]

734
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:35,749
[horn honks]

735
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,988
Woman on TV: Well executed,
it is worth noting

736
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,823
that violence against children,

737
00:43:42,857 --> 00:43:44,358
is a calling card of the cartels

738
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,826
across the border.

739
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,696
Called on for comment,
the Mayor had none.

745
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,380
Maya: Hey! You forgot them,
you forgot your pills...

746
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,173
Get back! Get back!

747
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:33,474
[silenced gunshot]

748
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,946

When did you go soft, Alex?

767
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,810
They'll end you for this.

768
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:19,046
Happy retirement, Maury!

769
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,218
Alex!

00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,155
Alex!

[explosion]

00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:37,031
[door opens]

775
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:42,903
Goodness, you got the
heart of a 35-year-old.

776
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:45,573
At this rate,
you'll live to be 130.

777
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:49,343
I'll give you
five million to make it 135.

778
00:46:52,514 --> 00:46:53,981
[chuckles]

779
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,016
If you said, "Yes,"
I'd fire you.

780
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,919
You know if I said yes,
I'd want you to.

781
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:02,624
My grandfather is a Abruzzese.
He lived to be 104.

782
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:05,859
Yeah? Lucky guy.

783
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,162
You know, that all region,
along the Adriatic,

784
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:12,433
and Okinawa, Japan,
they call those blue zones.

785
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,601
Places that generally have

786
00:47:13,635 --> 00:47:15,603
a higher percentage
of centenarians.

787
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:18,138
I'm aware, Joseph. But why?

788
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,241
Nutrition? Lack of
pollutants in the air?

789
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:24,178
There is no reason
we have to age, to decay.

790
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:27,047
Some medical professionals
might actually argue that.

791
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:30,150
Everything can be
reprogrammed, modded.

792
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,252
Why shouldn't human health
be the same?

793
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,054
DNA's an algorithm.

794
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,666
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
how to spend your money.

795
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,024
[chuckles]

796
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:38,959
Especially when so much of it

797
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,061
ends up in your pocket.

798
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,265

[indistinct chatter]

800
00:47:57,177 --> 00:47:58,979
I appreciate you
giving me a call.

801
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,558
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this town.

802
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:03,450
Swear to God, it's getting
more like Afghanistan every day.

803
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:06,086
[siren blaring in distance]

804
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,488
- Who are they?
- Matched set.

805
00:48:07,522 --> 00:48:08,989
Mora: Jane and Joe Doe.

806
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:10,668
He was in the driver's seat,
blown the fuck up.

807
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:12,126
She was in the trunk.

808
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,927
.32 caliber bullet to the neck,

809
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:15,396
jacketed with
suppressor markings.

810
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,600
Just like we pulled out
of Beatriz Leon.

811
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:21,135
Car's registered to a
David Marshall.

812
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:22,670
Rented at the airport.

813
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:25,272
Some expat businessman
out of San Diego.

814
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,107
Probably the corpse in the car.

815
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,076
We're running teeth
on them both.

816
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,453
Okay, this guy is drunk
as a skunk.

817
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:33,147
He, uh, pulled a .24
three times over the limit.

818
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,024
So I need you to sign off
on the report before you go.

819
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,518
Mora: You got it.

820
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,118
[indistinct chatter]

821
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:40,688
- What's that?
- Found them on the floor.

822
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,956
It didn't match anything
on our database,

823
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,693
so the lab is running chem-test.

824
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,203
If that's a prescription,
it might help...

825
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:49,096
The lab's on it,
we might not be fancy,

826
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,632
Vincent, but we ain't dumb.

827

[indistinct chatter]

828
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,711
I'll run the Marshall name
through VICAP,

829
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:55,102
see if anything comes up.

830
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:56,413
I'll hit you up
with the ballistics

831
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:58,939
as soon as they come back.
Same with the pill.

832
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:03,143
Hey!

833
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:06,947
Sorry about the girl, man.
It was fucked up.

[instrumental music on speakers]

836
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,729
I couldn't go back.

837
00:49:21,763 --> 00:49:24,398
They don't love you
in Mexico anymore?

838
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,366
[laughs]

839
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,603
You're not asking for
my permission to stay, are you?

840
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:32,105
- Linda said I had to.
- Oh, well, in that case...

841
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,209
Come on, you know
what she's like.

842
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:36,443
Yeah.

843
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:39,581
Nobody gives a fuck about
that girl, Vincent.

844
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:42,216
Except you, me and Linda.

845
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:47,522
I can do things
you and her can't. You know?

846
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:49,691
As a concerned citizen.

847
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:51,759
From Mexico?

848
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:54,194
Okay, concerned Mexican citizen.

849
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:55,730
With questionable investigative

850
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:57,264
authority in the United States.

[both laugh]

852
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,768
Yeah, Nussbaum is
really gonna go for that.

853
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:04,071
Fuck Nussbaum.
I don't work for him.

854
00:50:10,578 --> 00:50:12,580

864
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:20,340
Ellis: Look, I promise
you I had no reason

865
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:22,710
to say anything unless
you give me one.

866
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:26,380
Sealman: What you're doing right
now is incredibly stupid, Ellis.

867
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,782
I hope you understand that.

868
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:31,886
Ellis: You've left me no choice.
I won't be cut out.

869
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,487
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

870
00:52:33,521 --> 00:52:35,322
Sealman: Blackmail
is already ugly.

871
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,792
Ellis: Look, all...
Sealman: Mr. Van Camp!

872
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,459
Sealman: We are not negotiating.

873
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:42,697
You've crossed a line
from which there is no return.

874

[siren wailing]

880
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,019
Looks like another .32 caliber.

881
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:14,055
And I'm guessing
it's also gonna be jacketed

882
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:15,890
with suppressor markings.

883
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,658
I'm gonna go talk to the wife.

884
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,360
See you there.

885
00:54:20,393 --> 00:54:21,963
Do you think he's right?

886
00:54:21,996 --> 00:54:23,631
I'd put money on it.

887
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:25,533
This is a problem, no question.

888
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:28,503
Maybe a hitter
cleaning up some shit.

889
00:54:28,536 --> 00:54:30,470
[indistinct radio chatter]

890
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,510
I'll catch you guys later.

891
00:54:35,543 --> 00:54:36,878
Good idea.

892
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,027
Nussbaum:
Last time I checked, Serra,

893
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,720
you were working the
Van Camp murder.

894
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,722
Last time I checked, sir,
I work for the FBI.

895
00:54:47,755 --> 00:54:49,456
Was that Hugo Marquez
I just saw?

896
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:52,359
Listen... I think
there's a connection

897
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:54,461
between Beatriz Leon,
the Jane Doe found

898
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:56,840
in the trunk of the car downtown
and this guy, William Borden.

899
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:59,399
If this does turn out
to be a jacket of .32,

900
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:01,410
that's three people likely
killed with the same weapon.

901
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:03,805
Look, I get it, the girl.
She's under your skin.

902
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:04,948
Maybe you're a little obsessed...

903
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,073
I'm just doing my job.

904
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:08,709
Hugo thinks it's a pro,
settling scores.

905
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:11,946
We think it could be a
hitter from across the fence.

906
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:13,548
But you can't be sure.

907
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:15,716
We can't, but if the
ballistics match, and there

908
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,694
really is a Mexican killer
tearing ass through town,

909
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,386
we might want to get
ahead of that.

910
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,522
And we're gonna need Marquez.

911
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,093
Alright, do what you have to do.

912
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:27,962
But I want updates twice a day.

913
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,530
Vincent: Yeah.

914
00:55:29,564 --> 00:55:32,432
[indistinct radio chatter]

915
00:55:32,465 --> 00:55:34,669
Lab just came back
on those pills.

916
00:55:34,702 --> 00:55:35,770
Diffadyl.

917
00:55:35,803 --> 00:55:39,574
Alzheimer's drug. Your
shooter is loosing his shit.

918
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:42,543
- Okay. Is the wife inside?
- Yeah.

919
00:55:42,577 --> 00:55:43,987
Keep your hands away
from the cage on that one.

920
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,081
I don't know if it's medicine
or just plain crazy.

921
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:49,550
- Wanna sit in on this?
- Sure.

922
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,590
[footsteps]

923
00:55:57,024 --> 00:56:01,896
Mrs. Borden, I'm Agent Serra.
This is Detective Marquez.

924
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,865
I'm sorry for what's happened.

925
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:06,067
Borden: Part of life, right?

926
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,902
It's what they say...

927
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:11,839
Hasn't really sunk in.

928
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:15,643
Hmm, FBI. Fancy.

929
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:18,478
- You an agent, too?
- Liaison from Mexico.

930
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,480
What's Mexico have to do
with William?

931
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:21,849
He hated the place.

932
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:25,152
Well, that's what
we're... hoping to find out.

933
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:27,121
Have you noticed
anything unusual

934
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,856
happen in the past few weeks,

935
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,459
where your husband's behavior
has changed at all?

936
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:36,097
Will's behavior
hasn't changed in 20 years.

937
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,766
No. Nothing.

938
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,168
- What kind of law did he do?
- Real Estate.

939
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:43,571
Marquez: Sorry to ask
this, Mrs. Borden.

940
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:45,039
But do you know
if your husband had

941
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:46,641
any ties to prostitution?

942
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:49,810
I have no idea. Sit down.

943
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,048
Bill paying for it?

944
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,517
Doesn't seem like him.

945
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,786
Did your husband know
Ellis Van Camp?

946
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,823
I know Wendy.
I see her at the same events.

947
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:06,928
It's all one big
cocktail party up here.

948
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:09,864
You like cocktails, Detective?

949
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:13,701
Margaritas? Pina Coladas?

950
00:57:15,236 --> 00:57:17,505
Vincent: Thanks for your help,
Mrs. Borden.

951
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:19,907
If you need anything,
just give us a call.

952
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,713
[elevator beeps]

953
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:28,992
I'm afraid
she can't be disturbed...

954
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:30,785
Don't even fucking start.

955
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,521
I've been calling you
all morning.

956
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:36,223
Borden's dead.
Someone executed him.

957
00:57:36,257 --> 00:57:39,492
And if he got to Borden,
then he's close.

958
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,962
Jesus, mum...

959
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,830
[speaking in foreign language]

960
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:48,269
[speaking in foreign language]

961
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,571
Just take a breath.

962
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:52,239
[inhales deeply]

963
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:53,674
<i>Bravo.</i>

964
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:58,579
You need to leave El Paso.
Immediately.

965
00:57:58,612 --> 00:57:59,981
Take the company plane.

966
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:01,792
What about tomorrow night,
it's all been arranged...

967
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:03,818
Listen to me.

968
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,688
Tomorrow, after the party,
you'll fly to Geneva.

969
00:58:07,722 --> 00:58:10,224
Stay at the house
and make arrangements

970
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:11,926
for you to check
into rehab there.

971
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:13,127
Rehab?

972
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,795
If things connect to you,

973
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:17,264
and we have a problem,
you will be working

974
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:19,867
on your issues,
which will buy us time

975
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,604
to quietly hire
very good lawyers.

976
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:27,108
Besides... you need help, Randy.

977
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,112
I'm sorry.

978
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:34,015
I'm so sorry.

979
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:36,584
Sealman: I know you are, baby.

980
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:38,753
I know you are.

981
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,924
Full ballistics came back.

982
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,794
Same gun killed Beatriz
and the Jane Doe in the car,

983
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:50,765
but not Borden.
Two .32s, two shooters.

984
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,233
Trafficking, Vincent Serra.

985
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:55,169
Alex: You're the one who took
the girl to the group home.

986
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,638
- Weren't you?
- Who is this?

987
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:00,107
Alex: Marshall. David Marshall.

988
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,976
Tap and trace.

989
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:05,046
Ah, David Marshall
burned up a car downtown.

990
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,247
Is that your doing?

991
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,016
Alex: I can't keep doing
your job for you.

992
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,117
Vincent: What job is that?

993
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:13,320
Alex: Borden, Van Camp.
What they did to children.

994
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:15,056
You're not doing
anything about it.

995
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:17,191
Are you saying
you killed William Borden?

996
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:20,861
And Ellis Van Camp? Alex: Yes.

997
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:24,198
And what about the girl?
Beatriz Leon.

998
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:26,600
Not the girl. That was Mauricio.

999
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:28,803
The man in the car.

1000
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:32,673
You're too slow to make
them pay. They're too rich.

1001
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:37,011
- Who's too rich?
- Alex: The lawyer, the client.

1002
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,612
Who's the client?

1003
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:40,948
[intense music]

1004
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:43,617
- Alex: Did you know her?
- Who?

1005
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:47,955
The... the... the girl.
B... Beatriz.

1006
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:51,092
A little. Alex: Did you care?

1007
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,960
Fifteen seconds.

1008
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,628
I certainly did.

1009
00:59:54,662 --> 00:59:57,665
I want to believe that you
are a good man, Vincent.

1010
00:59:57,698 --> 01:00:00,768
I'm the bad man.
Have been for a long time.

1011
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:02,369
But they have to be punished.

1012
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:04,638
Alex: If I can't finish this...

1013
01:00:04,672 --> 01:00:06,640
you have to.

1014
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,142
[line disconnects]

1015
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:12,046
He's downstairs in the park.

1017
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:23,991
Woman 1: Hey, move!

1018
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:25,392
What is this?

1019
01:00:25,426 --> 01:00:28,095
[both panting]

1020
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:32,700
He's fucking with us.

1021
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,768
He's just telling us
we're way too slow.

1022
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,280
We've got an asshole
exploiting a kid

1023
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:39,907
and how long is it taking us
to bring him to trial?

1024
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,909
Two to three years, right?

1025
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,014
[panting]

1026
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,853
He said they're too rich.

1027
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:54,731
Now, we've been getting
push back on the trafficking

1028
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,423
every step of the way.

1029
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,692
No, I think
he's, he's taking out

1030
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:01,729
the traffickers
that we couldn't.

1031
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,330
Leaving us breadcrumbs.

1032
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:05,766
Proving a point.

1033
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,868
[splashing]

1034
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:25,186
Well... Detective Marquez.

1035
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,921
How long were you watching me?

1036
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:28,889
Hugo: I just got here,
Mrs. Borden.

1037
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:30,925
You shouldn't leave
the gate open.

1038
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,427
Whatever will be will be.

1039
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,863
And if you're
watching over me...

1040
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:38,199
nothing to worry about, right?

1041
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:40,201
You're a strong swimmer.

1042
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:42,169
I'm out of shape.

1043
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,708
[water splashing]

1044
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:57,351
I was an alternate
for the '92 Olympic team.

1045
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,921
I was 17. Best time of my life.

1046
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:03,424
By '96, I'd lost a second.

1047
01:02:03,457 --> 01:02:05,926
That was it.

1048
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,428
Done.

1049
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:08,929
So instead of a Wheaties Box

1050
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:11,198
and a dashing husband in LA,

1051
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:13,200
I ended up here.

1052
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:15,503
In Texas.

1053
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:17,104
Could you pass me that glass?

1054
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:19,974
Hugo: Sure.

1055
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:27,214
So, what do you want, Detective?

1056
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:31,519
Well...

1057
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:34,021
I'm not here to clean your pool.

1058
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,890
You are not a real
cop here, are you?

1059
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:39,527
That's why I'm here.

1060
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:42,196
What? To not arrest me?

1061
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:43,998
Have you ever heard your
husband talk about

1062
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,533
a man named David Marshall?

1063
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:49,870
You didn't come here
to ask me questions.

1064
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:52,172
I didn't come here
for that either.

1065
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:56,410
I stayed out of
William's business.

1066
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,145
Wives know.

1067
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:01,282
I never knew the name,

1068
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:02,850
but I heard him on the phone.

1069
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:06,020
He was nervous.
He didn't want me to hear.

1070
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:09,557
He was talking about a man
from Mexico City.

1071
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:11,191
Why didn't you say
something before?

1072
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:14,161
Because of who
he was talking to.

1073
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:15,896
Davana Sealman.

1074
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,432
That's why I didn't
say anything.

1075
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,067
He was being used.

1076
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,368
How?

1077
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:23,203
You should go.

1078
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:27,207
Thank you, <i>Senora</i> Borden.

1079
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,044
Don't ever come back,
Detective Marquez.

1080
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:35,883
Davana Sealman? You sure?

1081
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,585
That's the name she said.

1082
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,920
Borden was probably one
of her attorneys.

1083
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:41,889
Nope, Borden's name isn't listed

1084
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:43,324
on any of the filings

to Sealman on the phone

Okay. Well, it's not her
first time there.

1112
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:47,297
She was there last year
for three weeks

1113
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:49,089

and then they were deported.

Van Camp was CPF's builder.

01:15:32,933 --> 01:15:35,136
He and his father died in the
fire at the family bakery

1264
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:36,637
forty years ago.

1265
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,673
Investigators thought
Alex set the fire.

1266
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,175
Brother's still in town though.

1267
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,577
Care facility on the parkway.

1268
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:45,646
Advanced Alzheimer's.

1269
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,715
Man's a vegetable.

1270
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:49,784
I also came up
with medical records.

1271
01:15:49,817 --> 01:15:51,986
Alex and his brother
were well known at the ER.

1272
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:55,623
Always a "fall down the stairs"
or an "accidental burn."

1273
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,059
Other things
were harder to hide.

1274
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:00,161
Father was never charged
with the abuse.

1275
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:02,296
Sexual or physical.

1276
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:04,065
Want me to warrant the bakery?

1277
01:16:04,098 --> 01:16:05,166
Definitely.

[gun clatters]

1295
01:17:35,823 --> 01:17:37,324
This guy from Mexico City,

1296
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:40,161
the one Borden was talking to
Davana Sealman about.

1297
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:42,963
What if she hired him?

1298
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:44,437
'Cause I'm thinking
if Alex is not up

1299
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:46,867
to killing Sealman himself,

1300
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,435
he wants us to bring her in.

1301
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:50,271
Catch is, the only person
who can connect.

1302
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:51,372
Sealman to any of this...

1303
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:52,907
Is Alex.

1304
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,442
She's harder to get
to than any of the others.

1305
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:58,445
He reached out to you
to cover his bets.

1306
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:00,181
The only address
from Paul and Alex's

1307
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:01,448
medical records is the bakery.

1308
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:03,851
Oh, forget about it,
that place is a wreck.

1309
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,886
Unless you're looking
for a pigeon.

1310
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:08,489
What did you say?

1311
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:10,724
Pigeons.

1312
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:13,060
<i>Palomas.</i>
The place is full of them.

1313
01:18:13,093 --> 01:18:14,929
The lab report on the Bronco...

1314
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:17,064
the one where the
patrolman got killed,

1315
01:18:17,097 --> 01:18:19,233
the floor had traces
of pigeon shit on it.

1328
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:41,583
Anything you need?

1329
01:19:41,616 --> 01:19:43,350

No. I want to see you
go to Yuma.

Where I will make sure they
fuck you to death, old man.

I'll talk to FBI Agent
V... V... Vincent Serra.

I've got all day, and
by the end, I swear to God,

1423
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:36,336
I'll have me a
written confession.

1424
01:25:38,673 --> 01:25:40,842
If he went after Sealman
with a broken gun,

1425
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,577
we'd have heard something.

1426
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:44,454
I just think he's at the end.
He ain't remembering things.

really want to be on?

01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:00,755
[car door shuts]

1447
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:08,462
What the fuck did you do to him?

1448
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:10,998
- He resisted arrest.
- So you had to bust him up?

1449
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:12,567
He's a cop killer
for fuck's sake.

1450
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,769
You like being on
Davana Sealman's payroll?

1451
01:27:14,802 --> 01:27:16,571
Hey!

1452
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:18,305
Cool off!

1453
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:21,843
[intense music]

1454
01:27:22,877 --> 01:27:24,277
[door opens]

1455
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:27,380
[heart monitor beeping]

1456
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:31,519
Well, well.

1457
01:27:33,654 --> 01:27:35,455
The FBI.

1458
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:37,658
Huh.

1459
01:27:38,826 --> 01:27:40,628
You are the one that shot me.

1460
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:43,363
I'm not going to offer
an apology.

1461
01:27:43,396 --> 01:27:45,533
I'm not asking for one.

1462
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:48,335
[pills rattle]

1463
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,840
Thank you.

1464
01:28:04,384 --> 01:28:06,754
These aren't going to help
for much longer.

1465
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:11,993
I understand you want
to clear this up.

1466
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:13,561
Alex: Clear this up?

1467
01:28:13,594 --> 01:28:14,896
No.

1468
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:16,631
I want Sealman dead.

1469
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:18,833
Well, she's not officially
tied to any crime.

1470
01:28:18,866 --> 01:28:20,802
You know that's not true.

1471
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:22,670
She sanctioned the hit.

1472
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:25,673
She hired me to kill...
two people.

1473
01:28:25,706 --> 01:28:29,577
Ellis Van Camp and
the second was that child.

1474
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:32,680
Girl of thirteen.
Be... Be... Beatriz.

1475
01:28:34,081 --> 01:28:35,917
I won't do that.

1476
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:37,450
Vincent: No.

1477
01:28:38,418 --> 01:28:40,555
No. You don't touch children.

1478
01:28:42,455 --> 01:28:45,392
Dr. Myers: Okay, press down.
Sealman: Thank you.

1479
01:28:45,425 --> 01:28:47,962
I really appreciate you
being here for me.

1480
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:49,931
During all this.

1481
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:52,133
You're not just a client,
you know.

1482
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:54,535
Is that true, Joseph?

1483
01:28:54,569 --> 01:28:57,138
You know, the hardest thing
is never really trusting

1484
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:59,140
those people close to you.

1485
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:00,708
Besides Randy...

1486
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:03,978
I will never really
know why someone is with me.

1487
01:29:04,011 --> 01:29:07,048
Come on.
I'm your friend, Davana.

1488
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:08,883
I'm here for you.

1489
01:29:15,156 --> 01:29:18,826
The retainer for your services
is $10 million.

1490
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,564
I can't.

1491
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:26,399
Do you realize what
you're asking me to do?

1492
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:28,135
I'm sorry. No.

1493
01:29:28,169 --> 01:29:30,738
- I took an oath.
- An oath?

1494
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:32,506
Like a marriage vow?

1495
01:29:33,908 --> 01:29:36,476
You were at Randy's parties.

1496
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:38,411
You think I didn't know?

1497
01:29:38,445 --> 01:29:40,615
So, let's make this simple.

1498
01:29:40,648 --> 01:29:43,416
$10 million or prosecution

1499
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:45,186
and prison for sex with minors.

1500
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:46,554
Davana...

1501
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:48,155
You need to understand
something.

1502
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:49,824
Randy was weak.

1503
01:29:49,857 --> 01:29:51,893
But he was my son.

1504
01:29:51,926 --> 01:29:53,928
You are not.

1505
01:29:55,796 --> 01:30:00,768
Vincent: Murder for hire.
Murder for revenge. Child abuse.

1506
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:02,803
It's all here.

1507
01:30:02,837 --> 01:30:04,205
It's not over.

1508
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:05,907
Everybody's dead, Alex.

1509
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:11,679
Even if you do make it to trial,
you get life, my friend,

1510
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:13,648
which from what
the doctors tell me

1511
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:15,549
is maybe three to six months.

1512
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:17,919
So, what are we doing here?

1513
01:30:17,952 --> 01:30:21,822
- Why are we here?
- Alex: Davana Sealman.

1514
01:30:21,856 --> 01:30:23,190
Justice.

1515
01:30:23,224 --> 01:30:25,526
Justice?

1516
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:29,030
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll testify to all that...

1517
01:30:29,063 --> 01:30:30,731
You're a contract killer.

1518
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:33,067
You think your testimony's
going to stand up in court?

1519
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:36,737
- She hired me to kill a child.
- Did you get that in writing?

1520
01:30:36,771 --> 01:30:38,239
We're gonna need that evidence.

1521
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:40,574
[heart monitor beeping]

1522
01:30:42,243 --> 01:30:44,946
You really expect
we're gonna find justice?

1523
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:46,847
I expect you to try.

1524
01:30:48,716 --> 01:30:50,551
Listen...

1525
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:52,086
Let me tell you something...

1526
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:53,921
about justice.

1527
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:55,623
Twelve months ago,

1528
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:58,491
a drunk driver
was flying down the I-8

1529
01:30:58,526 --> 01:30:59,560
in a stolen car.

1530
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,561
He's high on meth.

1531
01:31:00,594 --> 01:31:02,830
He hasn't seen another car

1532
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:04,207
that's pulled over
on the shoulder.

1533
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:05,866
A mom and her ten-year-old son.

1534
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,669
Coming home from Legoland.
They got a flat tire.

1535
01:31:08,703 --> 01:31:10,213
But Colvey, he doesn't
see that the woman

1536
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:11,973
is out there changing the tire.

1537
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:14,875
He just plows right into her.
Kills her.

1538
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:16,644
Now, he stops his car

1539
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:18,980
and he sees behind him
the boy's jumped out.

1540
01:31:19,013 --> 01:31:20,581
He's obviously screaming.

1541
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:24,085
Seeing his mom, dead
on the road, crying for help.

1542
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:25,953
But Colvey doesn't help.

1543
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:29,256
He puts his car in reverse
and backs over the boy.

1544
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,993
Making sure
there's no witnesses.

1545
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:34,795
Then he torches his car
two miles down the road.

1546
01:31:34,829 --> 01:31:37,098
But a 15-year-old girl,
she sees him.

1547
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:40,801
She sees a man walking away
from a big fire with a gas can.

1548
01:31:40,835 --> 01:31:42,203
Now, it ain't much,
but it's enough

1549
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:44,205
to put Colvey on trial.

1550
01:31:44,238 --> 01:31:46,107
You know what happened?

1551
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,675
They do a photo line-up.

1552
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:50,144
But the girl,
she doesn't pick Colvey.

1553
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:51,545
So they do an in-person,

1554
01:31:51,579 --> 01:31:53,280
and again
she doesn't pick Colvey,

1555
01:31:53,314 --> 01:31:56,017
even though everybody
knows it's him.

1556
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,618
Three times, three line-ups.

1557
01:31:57,651 --> 01:31:59,887
Each time she picks
a different guy.

1558
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,756
And Colvey walks.

1559
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:03,691
And he's still out there.

1560
01:32:05,326 --> 01:32:06,894
So...

1561
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:10,631
memory's a motherfucker.

1562
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:12,133
And as for justice...

1563
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,902
[exhales]

1564
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:18,072
It ain't guaranteed.

1565
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:22,676
Your wife.

1566
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:28,082
Your son.

1567
01:32:33,254 --> 01:32:36,557
[dramatic music]

1568
01:32:37,992 --> 01:32:40,561
I have evidence.

1569
01:32:42,963 --> 01:32:45,633
Yeah? What evidence do you got?

1570
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:49,670
Alex: A phone call.
Davana Sealman.

1571
01:32:49,703 --> 01:32:51,872
[stammering] Threatening...

1572
01:32:51,906 --> 01:32:55,076
Threatening the first man
I killed.

1573
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:56,677
Ellis Van Camp?

1574
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:01,715
Yes. I have that call
on a... flip...

1575
01:33:01,749 --> 01:33:02,950
- Flash?
- Flash.

1576
01:33:02,983 --> 01:33:05,052
- Flash drive?
- Flash drive.

1577
01:33:05,086 --> 01:33:06,787
Where is it?

1578
01:33:09,023 --> 01:33:11,258
I don't know.

1579
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:13,060
Help, help me...

1580
01:33:14,228 --> 01:33:15,996
Help me remember.

1581
01:33:17,331 --> 01:33:19,133
Please.

1582
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:20,734
We will.

1583
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:23,604
We will.

1584
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,142
That makes me sick
to my stomach.

1585
01:33:29,877 --> 01:33:32,246
I'm glad that bastard is dead.

1586
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:35,182
His mother was covering for him.

1587
01:33:35,216 --> 01:33:37,251
Davana Sealman? Vincent: Yeah.

1588
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:39,887
That woman hasn't had
a parking ticket in her life.

1589
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,090
She knew that her son
was raping minors.

1590
01:33:43,124 --> 01:33:45,426
She also paid for the hit
on Ellis Van Camp.

1591
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:47,161
Based on what evidence?

1592
01:33:47,194 --> 01:33:50,030
The man she hired, Alex Lewis.
He made it very clear to me...

1593
01:33:50,064 --> 01:33:52,299
Oh, the testimony
of a professional killer?

1594
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,368
Alex Lewis was hired
by William Borden

1595
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:55,703
for Davana Sealman.

1596
01:33:55,736 --> 01:33:56,704
Isn't this the same man

1597
01:33:56,737 --> 01:33:57,814
who has some kind of dementia?

1598
01:33:57,838 --> 01:33:59,006
Advanced Alzheimer's.

1599
01:33:59,039 --> 01:33:59,673
Yeah, yeah.

1600
01:33:59,707 --> 01:34:01,308
Look, I need real evidence.

1601
01:34:01,342 --> 01:34:03,010
Alright, not just
the fucking testimony

1602
01:34:03,043 --> 01:34:06,180
of some murderer who's
cognitively impaired. Jesus.

1603
01:34:06,213 --> 01:34:08,415
Any decent lawyer would
annihilate him on the stand.

1604
01:34:08,449 --> 01:34:10,384
Listen, apparently,
there's a recording

1605
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:12,153
of Davana Sealman
on a phone call

1606
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:14,822
explicitly threatening Van Camp.

1607
01:34:14,855 --> 01:34:18,058
- Well, that I can use.
- I'm working on it.

1608
01:34:18,092 --> 01:34:20,161
Well, you bring me the audio,
and if it's solid,

1609
01:34:20,194 --> 01:34:22,029
I'll make the case.

1610
01:34:22,062 --> 01:34:23,797
Thank you, sir.

[door closing]

Are you sure you're up for this?

1614
01:34:31,172 --> 01:34:34,808
No, Gerald. I'm definitely
fucking not up for this.

Alex.

1616
01:34:50,424 --> 01:34:53,227
Listen. We need to find
that recording.

1617
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,797
Without that,
they... they can't bring charges.

1618
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:58,732
Do you remember where it is?

1619
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:02,236
I... I've been trying
to remember.

1620
01:35:02,269 --> 01:35:04,104
Okay.

1621
01:35:04,138 --> 01:35:06,307
I can't.

1622
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,776
[stammering] It's lost.

1623
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:13,080
I... I used to make notes. Here.

1624
01:35:13,113 --> 01:35:16,283
- Mm-hm.
- There's no more notes.

1625
01:35:17,785 --> 01:35:20,087
I'm sorry. Really. I'm sorry.

1626
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,456
Listen. Without that recording,

1627
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:24,225
there's no case against Sealman.

1628
01:35:24,258 --> 01:35:25,859
[stammering]

1629
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:28,262
And there's nothing that I
or anybody can do about it.

1630
01:35:28,295 --> 01:35:29,830
Do you understand that?

1631
01:35:29,863 --> 01:35:32,266
[dramatic music]

1632
01:35:32,299 --> 01:35:34,735
I need you to remember.

1633
01:35:36,504 --> 01:35:38,839
[dramatic music]

1634
01:35:46,413 --> 01:35:48,816
Dr. Myers. I have a writ...

1635
01:35:48,849 --> 01:35:51,252
I know, we got a call
you were coming.

1636
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:02,963
[music continues]

[intense music]

1638
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:29,490
No alcohol swab?

1639
01:36:29,524 --> 01:36:31,158
[Myers groans]

1640
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:34,161

[indistinct radio chatter]

1642
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:50,110
Hey, hold up.

1643
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,584
Your SAC said,
he doesn't go through.

1644
01:36:51,613 --> 01:36:53,213
- He's with us.
- Can't do it.

1645
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:55,049
He said for you
to head right in.

1646
01:36:55,082 --> 01:36:58,520
It's okay, man. Just take care.

1647
01:36:58,553 --> 01:37:00,888
[indistinct radio chatter]

1648

[indistinct chatter]

1649
01:37:07,562 --> 01:37:09,363
He's got a hostage.

1650
01:37:09,396 --> 01:37:11,832
This is a fucking mess, Serra.

1651
01:37:19,373 --> 01:37:21,442
His only demand...

1652
01:37:21,475 --> 01:37:23,344
is to talk to you.

1653
01:37:36,056 --> 01:37:38,192
Hey.

1654
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:40,060
Watch your ass.

1655
01:37:41,395 --> 01:37:43,263

Man on radio:
They're coming out.

1659
01:38:16,698 --> 01:38:18,465
Hold fire.

1660
01:38:22,704 --> 01:38:24,539
That's Myers.

1661
01:38:24,572 --> 01:38:27,908
Sniper two, do you have a shot
on the subject on the right?

1662
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:31,044
Man on radio: Affirmative.

1663
01:38:32,614 --> 01:38:34,214
[gunshot]

1664
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:35,717
Man on radio:
Agent Serra, status?

1665
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,719
You killed the hostage.
Stand down. Stand down!

1666
01:38:37,752 --> 01:38:39,687
Listen to me, Agent Serra,
tactical...

1667
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:41,556
[gunshots]

1668
01:38:41,589 --> 01:38:43,157
They sent that man to kill me.

1669
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:45,292
He walked right past the cops.

1670
01:38:45,325 --> 01:38:47,562
That bitch owns the whole game.

1671
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:49,296
She doesn't own the FBI.

1672
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:52,099
[gunshots]

1673
01:38:52,132 --> 01:38:53,611
- Are you sure about that?
- Listen to me.

1674
01:38:53,635 --> 01:38:55,603
Maybe they'll kill you, too.
Just to...

1675
01:38:55,637 --> 01:38:57,539
Just to b... b... Bury this.

1676
01:38:57,572 --> 01:39:00,007
Yeah, maybe. Alex. Listen...

1677
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:05,145
Bery. That's spelled B-E-R-Y.

1678
01:39:05,179 --> 01:39:08,215
- No. Alex.
- Right? Yes. Yes. Bery.

1679
01:39:08,248 --> 01:39:10,317
B-E-R-Y.

1680
01:39:11,653 --> 01:39:14,622
You said justice
can't be guaranteed.

1681
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:16,223
No.

1682
01:39:16,256 --> 01:39:19,293
We owe it to that child,
Vincent.

1683
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:24,064
Alex.

1684
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:26,668
Alex! Alex!

1685
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:29,036

[indistinct chatter]

1690
01:40:10,377 --> 01:40:12,279
They won't let Hugo
in the building.

1691
01:40:12,312 --> 01:40:14,114
God, I bet Nussbaum deports him.

1692
01:40:14,147 --> 01:40:17,017
Yeah. Nothing would surprise me.

1693
01:40:18,352 --> 01:40:19,754
Where are they sending you?

1694
01:40:19,787 --> 01:40:21,723
Crimes against Children.

1695
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:24,391
- You?
- Unassigned.

1696
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:27,294
Linda: Vincent, your heart
was in the right place.

1697
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:37,304
[dramatic music]

1698
01:40:41,609 --> 01:40:43,745
He fucking remembered.

1699
01:40:43,778 --> 01:40:45,613
He fucking remembered!

Ellis: You've left me no choice.

1703
01:41:13,173 --> 01:41:15,175
I won't be cut out.

1704
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:16,452
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

1705
01:41:16,476 --> 01:41:18,345
Sealman: Blackmail
is already ugly.

1706
01:41:18,378 --> 01:41:20,715
Ellis: Look, all...
Sealman: Mr. Van Camp!

1707
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:22,584
Sealman: We are not negotiating.

1708
01:41:22,617 --> 01:41:25,452
You've crossed the line
from which there is no return.

1709
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:28,656
That's it.

1710
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,758
It's not enough.

1711
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,259
What are you talking about?

1712
01:41:32,292 --> 01:41:33,528
Well, Alex Lewis is dead.

1713
01:41:33,561 --> 01:41:35,262
Without him,
I don't have corroboration.

1714
01:41:35,295 --> 01:41:36,607
You said, if I bring you
this recording...

1715
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:40,167
No, no, no, no. The recording
is a threat. Yes.

1716
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,736
Without the hit man,
it's not enough.

1717
01:41:41,769 --> 01:41:43,605
Come on, man, this is a case.

1718
01:41:43,638 --> 01:41:45,607
It's not a case I can win.

1719
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,609
I'm very sorry, Vincent.

1720
01:41:53,881 --> 01:41:55,349
You're kidding me?

1721
01:41:55,382 --> 01:41:58,452
Look, when you're dealing
with that kind of money,

1722
01:41:58,485 --> 01:42:00,822
even if I had her
handing the gun to Alex

1723
01:42:00,855 --> 01:42:03,725
and paying him,
she'd probably still win.

1724
01:42:04,726 --> 01:42:07,160
Okay. Okay.

1725
01:42:07,194 --> 01:42:10,130
Yeah, the sooner you
realize that, the better.

1726
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:12,667
Listen, you tell me something.

1727
01:42:13,868 --> 01:42:16,336
Beatriz Leon.

1728
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,271
What does she mean to you, huh?

1729
01:42:18,305 --> 01:42:20,374
Just some lowlife Mexican kid,

1730
01:42:20,407 --> 01:42:21,909
who's probably gonna die anyway?

1731
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:23,276
No, not at all.

1732
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:24,646
Randy Sealman
would take children

1733
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:25,780
out of his Detention Centre

1734
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:27,314
and use them
as his fucking sex toys.

1735
01:42:27,347 --> 01:42:28,816
Problem is, we can't prove it.

1736
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:31,451
You know what's going on.
We all know what's going on.

1737
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:32,319
Serra!

1738
01:42:32,352 --> 01:42:33,788
You're nothing
but a fucking coward.

1739
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:35,355
Okay, that's it, Serra!

1740
01:42:35,389 --> 01:42:37,792
A lot of people,
myself included, are fed up!

1741
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:39,292
Yeah.

1742
01:42:39,326 --> 01:42:41,294
Time to take a leave, Serra.

1743
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:43,397
Make it a long one.

1744
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:45,967
And then let's re-evaluate.

1745
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,102

- Yo.
- Hey.

1750
01:43:08,656 --> 01:43:10,892
We should celebrate
your suspension.

1751
01:43:10,925 --> 01:43:12,694
I'm not really up for it.

1752
01:43:12,727 --> 01:43:14,696
I wasn't asking, dipshit.

1753
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:16,698

been so social?

I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

1759
01:43:46,493 --> 01:43:48,996
I mean, you can't be an
asshole forever, right?

Anymore and I'm fucking
toast tomorrow.

Don't be a pussy.

It's not like you've got a job.

I'm good.

01:44:46,554 --> 01:44:47,722
Alright.

Oh, shit. I spaced my wallet.
