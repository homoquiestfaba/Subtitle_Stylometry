that every comedian

1210
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,751
You know, it took me a long time
to get to it, where the person

1211
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:25,876
that you are offstage
is who you are onstage.

1212
00:51:28,876 --> 00:51:31,500
I understand you've got
a new image now, George,

besides a new beard.

1214
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,667
Well, it comes out
as a new image.

1215
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:36,709
Actually, I just have kind
of relaxed a little bit.

1216
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:42,000

and instead of doing
little bits, and hunks,

1223
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,250
and characters,
I'm just doing a monologue,

1224

1236

I liked him, you know?

He was really good,
he was funny,

1238

I had a lot of fun with him,
he did some nice things for me.

1239

But there was nothing
behind him, you know?

1240
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,167
He was just kind
of just superficial.

1241
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,834
I was always doing ladies
on quiz shows,

1242
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:30,876
or newsmen, or disc jockeys,

1243
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:32,334
and I was hiding
behind these things.

1244
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:35,584
I didn't know it consciously,
but television rewarded that.

1245
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:38,000
See, that's one facet
of my comedy is I am a mimic.

1246
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,334
Was there a lot of pressure,

1247
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,417
I mean,
just to become yourself, and...

1248
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,000
Oh. Well, I was ready for that.
That was one thing,

1249
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,876
is I wasn't in my act anymore.

1250
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:46,959
That was not--

1251
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,334
The reason I went into this,
as anyone knows,

1252
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,709
you go into this
as a self-expression.

1253
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,209
-Of course.
-And once you're not doing that,

1254
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:52,709
forget it.
So, I discovered that.

1255
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:54,375
I was free then,
I was free to change.

spiritual transformation.

1826
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:17,417
In 1972, I happened to go
to my very first Summerfest

1827
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,584
in Milwaukee.
Huge crowds and performance.

1828
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:22,751
And I was there
when George Carlin

1829
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:25,083
performed his routine.

1830
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:29,209
The next morning, got up
for my Saturday rotation of duty

1831
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:33,459

He says, "Was there disorder?
Was he saying this to people?

01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:42,334
Was he mad? Was he disorderly?
Were the people disorderly?"

He said, "I dunno," he said...

1837
01:16:44,417 --> 01:16:47,209
So he turned to his assistant

01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:49,417
"You were there.
What did the audience do?"

1839
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,000

There was no dispute
that he said the words.

1846
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:12,709
The issue was,
did it tend to cause

1847
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:15,125

And, of course,

1848

They do that all the time.

1938
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:24,000
Some of the times,
the show you're watching,

1939
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:26,751
two people are probably fucking
in the other room.

1940
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:29,375
Fucking is all right.
Fucking is part of the plot.

1941
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:31,000
A lot of plots
are based on fucking.

1942
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,292
Will they fuck?
Should they fuck?

1943
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,959
Have they fucked? Did they fuck?
Will they fuck again?

1944
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,500
Will they get sick from fucking?
Are they fucking too much?

1945
01:21:36,584 --> 01:21:37,918
Will they fuck
each other's friends?

1946
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,334
Will they have a baby
from fucking?

1947
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:42,250
Will they be sorry they fucked?
Will they be glad they fucked?

1948
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:43,250
All fuck stories.

1949
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:45,709
Every honeymoon joke
is a fuck joke.

1950
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:47,542
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

1951
01:21:49,959 --> 01:21:52,751

such a bad reputation?

1952
01:21:54,667 --> 01:21:57,542
-We fucked it up.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1953
01:21:58,292 --> 01:21:59,292
Yeah.

1954
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,792
I mean, shit, piss, fuck, cunt,
cocksucker,

1955
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,500
motherfucker, and tits,
in a way,

1956
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:04,751
he's talking about it's bullshit

1957
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,667
that there are 400,000 words
in the English language,

1958
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:08,751
and these seven "bad words."

1959
01:22:08,834 --> 01:22:13,125
Like the fact you can isolate.
They must be outrageous...

1960
01:22:13,209 --> 01:22:15,459
for them to be isolated
from a group that large.

1961
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:16,626
And it made you think about,

1962
01:22:16,709 --> 01:22:18,000
"Oh, why do we accept
some things as acceptable

1963
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,626
and not... and other things
not as acceptable?"

1964
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:22,918
And the whole point was

1965
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,751
"What's going to happen?
You heard the word.

1966
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:26,292
Did you go out
and murder someone?

1967
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:30,292
Did you go shoot up heroin?
No, you heard a word."

1968
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,792
It's not about the word,
it's about the context.

1969
01:22:32,876 --> 01:22:35,500
Words, he always said,
Carlin always said,

1970
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,584
"It's not the word.
It's the context

1971
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:39,584
in which you use that word."

1972
01:22:39,667 --> 01:22:42,292
And when you eliminate context,
you eliminate nuance,

1973
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,334
you eliminate intent,

1974
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:47,375
there's no comedy,
there's no satire,

1975
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:49,292
there's no free speech.

1976
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:52,083
One-thirty on
an autumn afternoon
back in 1973,

1977
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:55,209
a man named John Douglas,
the head of an electronics firm

1978
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:56,375
and father of six children,

1979
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:58,959
was driving
with his 15-year-old son

1980
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,250
up in Connecticut.

1981
01:23:00,334 --> 01:23:04,876
The car radio was turned on
to a station in New York, WBAI.

1982
01:23:04,959 --> 01:23:06,667
Well, suddenly, they heard

1983
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:10,417
comedian George Carlin's record
called<i> Filthy Words.</i>

1984
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,000
It's an assault on my senses.
I don't seek it.

1985
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't desire it.

1986
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:17,334
It might be his freedom
of expression,

1987
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:19,000
but perhaps he should give up

1988
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:20,834
that particular freedom
of expression

1989
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,167
for the good of the community.

1990
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,542
REPORTER:<i> Well, the FCC,</i>
<i>acting on Douglas's complaint,</i>

1991
01:23:24,626 --> 01:23:26,417
<i>imposed a ban on words like
the ones used</i>

1992
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,167
<i>in the Carlin record.
Not necessarily obscene,</i>

1993
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:32,000
<i>but words that, to many people,
might be offensive.</i>

1994
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:35,584
It was played in the context
of language

1995
01:23:35,667 --> 01:23:37,792
and how we consider language.

1996
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:41,125
<i>But it set off a chain reaction
of events</i>

1997
01:23:41,209 --> 01:23:42,584
<i>where the case
went through the courts</i>

1998
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,918
<i>and the FCC was trying to use it
as a test case like,</i>

1999
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,876
<i>"Where are we gonna draw
the line?"</i>

2000
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:48,584
INTERVIEWER: How can you defend
the use of words

2001
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,959
like this
on broadcasting stations?

2002
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:55,334
Well, you don't have
to defend them, I don't think.

2003
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,876
They are protected
by the First Amendment,

2004
01:23:57,959 --> 01:24:00,209
by free speech. Just as
in newspapers, in books...

2005
01:24:00,292 --> 01:24:02,083
(CLEARS THROAT) ...and in films,

2006
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,417
the broadcast media
should be no different.

2007
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,417
<i>My defense would be that there
are two knobs on these sets.</i>

2008
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,459
<i>A person can choose
not to listen.</i>

2009
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,500
<i>A person can change the station
if they like. The question is,</i>

2010
01:24:12,584 --> 01:24:14,626
<i>can the Federal Communications
Commission</i>

2011
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:16,417
<i>abridge freedom of speech?</i>

2012
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,167
<i>How did they get the power
to do that?</i>

2013
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,709
<i>And that's what the case
is about.</i>

2014
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:21,542
I think
Mr. Carlin's a very funny man,

2015
01:24:21,626 --> 01:24:23,500
probably the funniest comedian
around today.

2016
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:25,834
In a nightclub situation,
it would be perfectly in order

2017
01:24:25,918 --> 01:24:27,751
because for one thing,
I probably couldn't bring

2018
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,083
anybody in under 18.

2019
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:31,584
Well, there was just the point
of the fact

2020
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:35,292
that there's no prior restraint.
Even though that's true,

2021
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,834
the fact that you can
be punished for something

2022
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:41,042
is a form of subtle
unspoken prior restraint.

2023
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:43,375
There is a de facto censorship
here

2024
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:45,542
whereby stations
will be afraid to make

2025
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:48,000
a decision
because of the possibility.

2026
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,334
<i>Philosophically,
I do not buy the assumption</i>

2027
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,667
<i>that these words
are somehow immoral</i>

2028
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:54,709
<i>or indecent
in and of themselves.</i>

2029
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:58,334
<i>Words are only symbols, and they
do not possess those qualities.</i>

2030
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,209
<i>People can be immoral
or indecent.</i>

2031
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:02,375
<i>The words themselves
cannot harm us.</i>

2032
01:25:02,459 --> 01:25:04,167
The United States Supreme Court
says that

2033
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,751
the public airwaves,
television, radio,

2034
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:08,542
and other forms of broadcasting

2035
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:11,584
are not the place
for what it calls "dirty words."
