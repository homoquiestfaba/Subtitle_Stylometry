       how tall you are?

        You know, David,        
          I gotta say,          

25
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,544
        weÕre both huge         
     "Little genius" fans.

         Ah, man, huge.         
      we love it, love it.      

27
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,681
          Cool, guys.           
        yes, thank you.         

28
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,449
    It was a long time ago,     
         but, you know.         

29
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,852
         How did it go,         
     it was like, he's a...     

31
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,623           
     -Oh, wow, wait.            
      And the catchphrase--     

32
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,358
      -"Does not compute."      
      -Oh, yeah, yeah.          

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,228
   -"That does not compute."    
   - Okay.              

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,830
     No, that was the, um,      
  the robot-- "Little genius"   

35
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,565
        -who said that.         
        -Oh.                    

36
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,868
         But I was like         
       the straight man,        
          like, ãawe.Ó          

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,336
           You know?            

38
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,371
   Um, I don't remember that.   

39
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,706
           Hey, well,           
     should we get started?     

40
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,740
            Surely.             

41
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:25,477      
       Pacific. Pacific.        

44
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,166
          Meriwether?           

45
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,537
          Meriwether,           
      Stop paddling. Yon.       

46
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,841
       It's the Pacific!        

47
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,812
   It's the Pacific at last!    

50
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,377        
       Hi, this is David.       

51
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,679
        I can't come to         
      the phone right now       

52
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,480
        Because I am on         
         my honeymoon.          

53
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,882
       Call you in a week       
        when I get back.        

54
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,884                
     -Hi David, it's Fula,     

55
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,352
       Your BFF forever.        

56
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,254
   I hope you're doing okay.    

57
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,690
        I know probably         
   the answer is "Not okay,"    

58
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,225
        but don't worry.        

59
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,360
         your best man          
   is coming to cheer you up.   

60
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:52,598
      Get ready for a nice      
          gassy ball.           

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,766
       It will make sense       
     in just some seconds.      

62
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,768
            Bye-bye.            

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,481       
      Good morning, David.      

67
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,550
              Hey.              

68
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,986
             Okay.                 

69
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,392
        Look who's here         
     to brighten your day.      

70
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,632
              No?               

71
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,467
           These rays           
        have no effect?         

72
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,404
      Here, have a bottle.      

73
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,873
           Ooh, rosÉ.           
           I like it.           

74
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,341
  Frankie cancels the wedding.  

75
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,676
           She takes            
     all of the furniture,      

76
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,311
    but on the bright side,     

77
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,880
            I have a            
        lifetime supply         
            of rosÉ.            

78
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,482
     Things are looking up.     

79
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,787
     -What are you wearing?      
     -What am I wearing?        

80
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,989
             David,             
     what are you wearing?      

81
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,692
    You look like kangaroo.     

82
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,060
      You know marsupials       

83
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,695
        actually travel         
       in pairs, though.        

84
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,870  
"From the pen of William Clark. 

85
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,608
      Every great journey,      
      like a giant redwood      

86
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,445
       begins, initially,       
        as a small seed.        

87
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,715
   On the day my old friend,    
Meriwether Lewis came to visit, 

88
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,583
     I was entirely unaware     
        that he had come        

89
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,619
    to plant this very seed     

90
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,987
         into my life."         

91
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,357
             David,             
         we need to get         
          you outside.          

92
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,392
 You've been in here for like,  
         what, a week?          

93
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,361
       You need some sun        
          on your face          

94
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,363
         and your body,         
       your legs, torso.        

95
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,032
      We were gonna start       
      our honeymoon today.      

96
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,536
         One week hike          
  wouldÕve been very romantic.  

97
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,872
         It's too late          
    to return all this gear.    

98
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,975
      -Did you cancel it?       
      -No.                      

99
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,645
        You're outside,         
are you like just in the forest 

100
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,114
    and nature with someone     
    you like and care about?    

101
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,949
         Yeah, it just          
         wouldÕve been          

102
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,517
         Me and Frankie         
           out there.           

103
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,820
         But FrankieÕs          
         not available.         

104
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,355
        Yeah, I'm aware         
        of that, Flula.         

105
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,689
     -Thank you.                
     -No, I'm just saying,      

106
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,458
       sounds like a trip       
     that is not cancelled      

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,761
   and that it would be nice    
  to maybe have companionship   

108
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,130
   on this wonderful journey.   

109
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,799
              Mm.               
       It would've been.        

110
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,468
             David.             

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,902
        What did Rudy do        

112
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,738
       when he could not        
         make the sack?         

113
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,142
            "Rudy,"             
      the football movie?       

114
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,778
        Exactly. "Rudy."        
         You are Rudy.          

115
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,648
      And these opponents,      
the enemy team, and the people. 

116
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,984
      This is like Frankie      
     and the wedding cancel     

117
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,786
     and all the sad times      
         in your life.          

118
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,788
   You are there on the field   
        and you're like,        

119
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,424
       "What the-- help!        
      I would like to make      
       a sack, perhaps."        

120
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,993
      Nobody can see you.       
         You are tiny.          

121
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,995
   But do not worry, DavidÑ    
         I mean, Rudy,          

122
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,030
       You have friends.        

123
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,732
            You have            
       the other players        
          on the team,          

124
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,868
      The tall boyfriends       
 with the jerseys and numbers.  

125
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,536
          This is me.           

126
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,704
         And the crowd          
       who cheer for you?       

127
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,706
          Rudy! Rudy!           

128
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,776
             Rudy!              
       This is me, also.        

129
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,878
      And I'm the grasses       
          and the sky.          

130
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,080
         I'm-- I'm all          
    of these things, David.     
      I'm helping you out.      

131
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,848
  You'll win the championship.  

132
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,550
   And I will help you, Rudy.   

133
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,851
          Let's do it.          

134
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,489
        Yeah, so, wait.         
 You want-- what're you saying? 

135
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,125
       We are going to go       
  on your honeymoon together.   

136
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,929
   -No, no.                     
   -N, this is great, David.   

137
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,198
     -Awful.                    
     -No, we're doing this.     

138
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,501
       Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!        

139
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,769     
             Rudy.              

140
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,440     
       Rudy. Rudy. Rudy.        

141
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,774
             -What?             
             -Rudy.             

142
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,109
             -Rudy.             
             -Rudy.                   

144
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,230
      Okay, David.      
 So this is my first honeymoon. 

145
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,765
            Tell me,            
        what will we do?        

146
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:47,933   
      Well, it's gonna be       

147
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,202
          Seven days,           
         seven nights,          

148
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:51,803
          hike through          
        the wilderness,         

149
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,872
        gorgeous vistas,        
       rugged overlooks.        

150
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,740  
  That sounds amazing, David.   

151
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,243
      And on the last day,      
    thereÕs a special treat.    

152
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,612
           One night            
        in the big piney        

153
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,947
       wilderness lodge.        

154
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,616
   Ooh, sounds very romantic.   

155
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,085
        Yeah, that's...         

156
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,087
     kinda the weird thing      
          about this.           

157
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,622
         How many beds?         

158
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,190         
            One bed.            

159
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,893
  But I'm sure they will bring  
     a cot in or something.     

160
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,161
          Uh! Got you!          

161
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,063
        Okay, so we will        
     ãcotÓ the bed in half      

162
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,899
       -To make two beds?       
       -NoÑ god, no, no!       

163
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,902
         A cot is like          
         a smaller bed          

164
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,705
     that they can lend us      
  in addition to the one bed.   

165
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,673
   So we'll have three beds?    

166
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,175
          Fair enough.                   

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,627         
  David, I've heard there are   
       magical creatures        

172
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,228
      -In this forest?          
      -No, there are not.       

173
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,598
        Yeah, like yetis        
  and leprechauns, werewolves.  

174
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,567
         The sasquatch.         

175
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,769          
 Okay, I'll tell you right now  
      that does not exist.      

176
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,771
        I've seen photos        
         of sasquatch.          

177
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,173
     Well, I've seen photos     
          of godzilla.          

178
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,010
         Have you seen          
         "Die hard 2"?          

179
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,312
        I have not seen         
         "Die hard 2."          

180
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,315
       So maybe the film        
         doesnÕt exist.         

181
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,616
             Yeah.              

188
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,836
      Shh, shh, shh, shh.       
             Hello?             

189
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,073
            Shut up.            
       You're kidding me.       

190
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,175
     You know, I will have      
    my phone on me all week.    

191
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,177
         I'm reachable.         
           Okay, bye.           

192
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,112
          Woo hoo hoo!          
       That was my agent.       

193
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,114
        -Yeah?                  
        -Okay, I went in        

194
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,250
    For this Lewis and Clark    
   bio pic for William Clark.   

195
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,786
      They really like me,      
     and I'm gonna find out     

196
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,655
  -in the next couple of days.  
  -Oh, david, I'm so happy.     

197
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,193
        You-- you think         
   I'll get reception, right?   

198
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,062
      -Oh, in the forest?       
      -Yeah.                    

199
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,863
             N-no.              
            No, no.             

200
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,133
   We're in the boonie-docks    
           right now.           

201
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,875
          -You ready?           
          -Yeah.                

202
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,777
          I entered us          
    in the registry, David.     

203
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,146
    This way, if a sasquatch    
     or something eats us,      

204
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,048
     our parents will find      
        our limbs okay.         

205
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,884 
      That's a good idea.       

206
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,320
     -Haha! Let's do this!      
     -Oh, yeah.         

207
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,155
        Bound it, David.        
           Bound it.                 

209
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,329        
            Ho-hoo!             

210
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,864
-Are you looking at this, Flula?
-I see it, David.               

211
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,065
     -What did I tell you?      
     -I love it.                

212
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,267
     Exactly what I needed.     

213
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,804
      This is my therapy.       
       my antidepressant.       

214
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,306          
       Suck it in, David,       
          Suck it in.           

215
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,008     
   What does it bring to mind   
            for you?            

216
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,777
       It's like heaven,        
      but with real trees.      

217
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,013          
  This is the greatest thing.   

218
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,727  
      "The wooded country,      

219
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,729
         through which          
          we now pass           

220
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,098
       is the most rugged       
       and most beautiful       

221
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,333
       I have ever seen.        

222
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,072
 But this beauty belies surely  
  belies some unknown danger.   

223
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,840
        I am no coward,         
           but I fear           

224
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,177
          that not all          
      will make it across       
         the continent.         

225
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,080
          But for now,          
    all are in good spirits.    

226
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,150
  Not a whisper of discontent   
  can be heard among the men.   

227
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,118
        We act in unison        

228
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
         with the most          
       perfect harmony."           

230
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,825         
             Okay.              

231
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,994    
     David, can we increase     
        our pace a bit?         

232
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,162            
            Oh, god.            

234
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,198
          Hey, David,           
      We're slowing down.       

235
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,167              
      Move those tiny legs.     

236
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,105
           Good god.            

237
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,242
             Whoa.              
   What's the altitude here?              

239
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,252
        Wow, these, uh--        

240
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,821
          These packs           
        Are heavy, huh?         

241
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,156
        -No, not really.        
        -Pretty light.          

242
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,326
  -Are you okay?                
  -Yeah, I just, uh--

243
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,362
           Think that           
     morning bottle of rosÉ     
     is catching up to me.      

244
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,331
      That was a bad idea.           

245
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,867
      Let's sweat it out.       
             Come.              

246
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,036
    Just push out that rosÉ,    

247
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,872
          Push it out           
       your pores, David.       

248
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,207
          -David?               
          -Oh, my god.               

250
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,082
 -Oh, my god.                   
 -DonÕt let the trail hike you. 

251
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,383
         You must hike          
       the trail, david.        

252
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,152
             Come.              

253
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,853
           Haha-hah!            

254
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,121
             Yeah!               

256
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,196
           Feel it in           
       your lungs, david.       

257
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,366           
     My legs are tingling.      

259
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,238
          Oh, nature.           
     You're so refreshing.      

260
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,940
          You're like           
       an Arnold Palmer.        

261
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,075      
    You're like a cigarette.    

262
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,345
 But not filled with nicotine,  
     youÕre filled with...      

263
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,548
            Nature.             
            Woo ahh!            

264
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,249
     I can't feel my butt.      

265
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,886        
          Ah haha hah!          

266
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,355       
     Nature, I suck you in.          

268
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,433
          Oh, my god.           

270
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,064          
     I can't feel my toes,      
      which I understand,       

271
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,467
  But I can't feel my fingers,  
        which scares me.        

272
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,439
            How far             
   did we walk today, david?    

273
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,246
     We walked two point--      

274
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,483
       just two miles.         

275
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,254
      How many more miles       
            remain?             

276
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,588
              84.               

277
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,228         
        I think we need         
        to walk faster.         

280
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,295
          Yeah, okay.           

281
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,997
       All right, David.        

282
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,398
    We are ready for a hike.    

283
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,404
           Oh, David,           
  Do you know how like, when--  

284
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,173
       When small things        
        you carry them,         

285
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,642
   They help you move faster    
  more nimble like a leopard?   

286
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,310
    Let me show you a trick     
         from my father         

287
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,746
   I learned on a volksmarch.   

288
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,114
             -Here.             
             -Okay.             

289
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,616
       Yeah, here we go.        

290
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,353                
     -Ugh. Yeah. Siest du?      

291
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,188
        You've beheaded         
         my toothbrush.         

292
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,590
  Now it's six grams lighter,   
          approximate.          

293
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,159
  What do I do with the other   
       95 percent of it?        

294
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,762
       Oh, you will carry       
   that in your pocket until    
      we find a trashcan.       

295
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,197
   -Yeah, yeah, that's, uh...   
   -Excellent.                  

296
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,699
         Then you will          
       move faster, yes?        

297
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,268
        Going on a hike         
     with my friend David.      

298
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,270
     Who is right behind me     
           for sure.            

299
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,306
      Oh, look, I found--       
       I found a pyramid        

300
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,208
   -Or something interesting.   
   -Okay, wait up.              

301
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,377
       You should see it.       
    itÕs disappearing quick.            

303
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,152
     There's so many great      
      Sounds here, David.       

304
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,354   
    "One of our great tasks     

305
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,722
          is to record          
        native specimens        

306
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,725
        in this new part        
       of the continent."       

307
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,262 
    Note, record leaf slaps.    

308
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,265
     "Meriwether has taken      
    a keen interest in this.    

309
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,169
         Even employing         
      a special apparatus       
      in these pursuits."       

310
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,606      
    It's photosynthesizing.     
           Right now.           

311
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,042
 "I too have joined Meriwether  
       in this endeavor."       

312
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,476
          -ItÕs gross.          
          -Ah.                  

313
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,379
   Record more photosynthesis   
      for my synthesizer.       

314
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,581      
   "And I am eager to assist    
        in the process."        

315
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,283
    What're you doing, man?     

316
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,518
      I'm recording sounds      
         for this song.         

317
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,253
           What song?           

318
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,622
     It's the greatest song     
    that I've ever written.     

319
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,490
   Uh, I see it has not been    
          written yet.          

320
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,626
      Well, that's what's       
          now is for.           

321
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,431
       Wait, stop, stop,        
          stop, stop.           

322
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,132
      -Do that again. No.       
      -What?                    

323
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,634
          -Back, back.          
          -What?                

324
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,803
     Like, shh, like this,      
       just go like this.       

325
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,571
   -Why don't you just do it?   
   -You do it.                  

326
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,341
             Again.             
             More.              

327
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,776
      -What is happening?       
      -Shh!                     

328
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,612      
    "Though his methodology     

329
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,747
 is sometimes perplexing"...   

331
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,221           
       "Wind tree blow."        
        record tomorrow.        

332
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,723     
     "I have no doubt that      
         the president          

333
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:16,494
    -and future generations     
     of scholars"...            
    -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.      

334
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,830   
   ..."Will be much delighted   
   with our new discoveries."   

336
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,569
   -This is perfect c-minor.    
   -Mm.                         

337
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,170
           -You know?           
           -Yeah.               

338
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,139
        I pee in the key        
          of c-minor.           

339
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,440
            You do?             

340
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,876
     In a standard toilet,      
           or course.           

341
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,578
    We'll record that later.    

345
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,632
   Can you pass me the gorp?    

346
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,602
         -Sorry, what?          
         -The gorp.             

347
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,204
           -The gorp?           
           -The gorp.           

348
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,238
           -Gorp?               
           -The gorp.           

349
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,573
           -The gorp?           
           -Gorp.               

350
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,409
     -WhatÕs this?              
     -It stands for, um...      

351
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,513
            It's...             

352
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,681
   Can I have the trail mix?    

353
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,716
        -Oh, yeah, sure.        
        -Thank you.             

354
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,485
     That was right there.      

355
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,657
        You know, Flula,        

356
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,259
        Lewis and Clark         
    hiked through here over     
         200 years ago.         

357
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,362
           Coulda...            
       slept right here.        

358
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,433
 This is gonna be good research 
       if I get the part.       

359
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,735   
       Do you think Lewis       
     urinated on that tree?     

360
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,970
           That tree?           

361
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,638
            -Mm-hmm.            
            -No.                

362
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,774
    But if they camped here,    
  you know, to leave the tent   

363
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:10,908
    -And then--                 
    -Allow me for a second.     

364
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,843
       Clark had a slave        
           Named York           

365
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,213
            Who did             
       the entire journey       
           with them.           

366
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,849
York actually saved Meriweather 
  Lewis from a grizzly attack,  

367
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,453
   He was revered as a brave    
    andÑ and giant of a man    

368
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,655
  by the local indian tribes.   

369
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,558
   At the end of the journey,   
       Clark whipped York       

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,661
            For not             
       wanting to go back       
          as a slave.           

371
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,863
            -What?              
            -Awful.             

372
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,665
     -ThatÕs terrible.          
     -Yeah, it's depressing     
      part of the script,       

373
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,734
  And I'm trying to have them   
       tweak the ending.        

374
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,370
        I have an idea.         
   Doing some work on Clark,    
    Clark wouldn't say that.    

375
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,505
Clark would say something like, 
        uh, I love you.         

376
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,776
      You did it with us.       
        I set you free.         

377
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,812
        -Go have a life.        
        -Go, be free.           

378
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,647
        That's my take.         
            Just go.            

379
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,516
      -I like that, David.      
      -Thank you.               

380
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,386
     -Do you know               
      another thing I like?     
     -WhatÕs that?              

381
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,954
          Fast lunches          
        and hard hikes.         

382
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,422
        Oh, you're done.        

383
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,725
   David, I'm fighting time.    

384
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,928
          In 60 years,          
  I'll be dust and molecules.   

385
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,496          
           -Wow.                

386
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,998
       So, suck it, time.       

387
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,566
         I'm gonna hike         
      on your face. Right?      

388
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,002
       I'll take my break       
         when we hike.          

389
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,572
   The young bird gets, uh--    
      gets all the worms.       

390
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,974
       Means a tardy bird       
          justÑ ugh,           

391
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,043
          Eats gravel           
         or, you know,          

392
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,845
             sand.              

393
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,914
   Other worms that are dead    
         and smell bad.                 

395
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,319
        Come on, David!           

397
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,976        
     Look, David, a human.      

398
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,445
          -Hey, there!          
          -Uh! Jeez.            

399
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,580       
           God! Jeez!

         just scared me         
            so much.            

401
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,485
    I haven't seen somebody     
        in a long time.         

402
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,020
     Hey, what're you guys      
        doing out here?

00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,556
  -Oh, we are on a honeymoon.   
  -Oh.                          

404
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,325

        congratulations.

     a beautiful family.

        I'm really happy        
         for you guys.          

414
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,010
           Seriously.           

415
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,645
       Did you hear that?       

416
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,714       
          What is it?           

417
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,784
     I can't hear anything.     

418
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,088
      What're you hearing?      

419
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,759
           It's gone.                    

420
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,894
        Is it sasquatch?        

421
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,430
       -AhÉ                   
       -Is it a minotaur?       

422
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,599
         -UmÉ                 
         -ItÕs a yeti.          

423
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:53,003
    We have two in Germany.     

424
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,540
        Well, um, not--         
   not to freak you guys out    
          or anything,          

425
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,876
           But enjoy            
      your time together.       

426
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,812
        -Okay.                  
        -âCause there's         
         these, um--            

427
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,547
        thereÕs wolves.                    

429
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,986
        Was that a wolf?        

430
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,557
             Yeah.              
       They're government       
       experiment wolves.       

431
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,727
      Yeah, they're pumped      
           with GMOs,           

432
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,397
     and they are massive,      
         huge animals.          

433
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,566
     They kill for pleasure     
  and their fangs are huge.   

434
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,735
  And they leave their kill   
      so that you see it,       

435
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:29,106
        so that you know        
      that you are the one      
     that is being hunted.      

436
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,943
  They've got these huge giant  
      velociraptor claws.       

439
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,850
          But, listen.          

440
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,519
    Have a great honeymoon,     

441
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,521
   Enjoy your time together.    

442
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,424
      Just be cool, okay?       

443
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,925
         Don't sweat...         

444
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,494
       Because they smell       
           the sweat.           

445
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,496
        And, um, listen,        
   I'm gonna give you a-- a--   

446
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:56,133
      a honeymoon present       
    because I like you guys.    

447
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,735
      They're really good.      

448
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,437          
       I grew 'em myself.       

449
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,739
        I'm taking this         
     little family with me      

450
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,741
       Because I watched        
           them grow.           

451
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:07,945
        There's Norberto        
          and Regina.           

452
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,782
         And, uh, Raul,         
        and SebastianÑ         

453
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,051
     heÕs the youngest one      
         of the family.         

454
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,788
       And they are-- mm.       

455
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,624
          So, listen.           

456
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,493
     Enjoy your honeymoon.      
        Enjoy the hike.         

457
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,829
      Enjoy mother nature.      

458
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,101
      Hey, wait a second.       

459
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,238
        "Little genius."        
    Jesus Christ, that's it.    

460
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
   With the little robot guy.   

461
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,174
   That was my favorite part.   

462
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,009  
      "Does not compute."       

463
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,579  
       "Does not compute.       
     It does not compute."      

464
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,081
  -That was the robot's line.   
  -It does not compute.         

465
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,716
         I was the boy          
       next to the robot.       

466
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,686
     He was the most human      
    part of that whole show.    

467
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,922
      Yeah, everybody else      
     was more like robots.      

468
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,058
        Thanks for being        
        part of my life.        

469
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,366
           All right.           

470
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,633
       That's terrifying        
    about the wolves, David.    

471
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,069
       Oh, don't believe        
          the wolves.           

472
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,791
    David, I have a question    
       about your movie.        

473
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,994
       I don't understand       
  what you were saying earlier  

474
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,563
         about Superman         
        owning a slave.         

475
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,998
             -What?             
             -Well,             

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,967
   We have Lewis and ClarkÑ    
       Lewis loves Clark        

477
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,136
          of course--           
        theyÕre lovers,         

478
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,305
        Clark is always         
      in the phone booth,       

479
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:44,308
    and then he's superman,     
        so, why is he--         

480
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,143
          Whoa, whoa,           
            back up.            

481
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:50,948
    Um, Lois and Clark Kent     
   are fictitious characters.   

482
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,684
        Lewis and Clark         
      are actual explorers      

483
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,554
     who explored this area.     

484
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,156
           Okay, I--            
       I don't understand       
          who is who,           

485
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,592
           But I want           
      to go on the record       
          and tell you          

486
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,627
           That I am            
        against slavery.        

487
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:04,828
             So...              

488
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,330
      if you get the role,      

489
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,766
           I may not            
      go to the premiere.       

490
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,635
       I don't even know        
        where to start.         

491
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,304
       How is he like--?        
     heÕs like super fast.      

492
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,838
         Faster than a          
        speeding bullet,        

493
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,307
           more power           
      than a "Locomotion."      

494
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,875
            Oh, yes,            
      and he owns a slave,      

495
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,644
        'cause he cannot        
      carry his knapsack?       

496
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,112
         That's wrong,          
           Superman.            

497
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,623   
       "My dearest love.        

498
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:36,894
         I write to you         
      from the other side       
        of the continent        

499
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,030
       with no knowledge        
         of when or if          

500
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,865
         you will ever          
     receive these words."      

501
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,203
       "I know that when        
     we last saw each other     

502
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,305
     our hearts were heavy.     

503
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,174
   and I pray this finds you    
       in better spirits        

504
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,875
    living a life fulfilled.    

505
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,849
            For me,             
       this new endeavor        

506
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,818
        has been a work         
    of staggering difficulty    

507
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,253
           and, yet,            
     the rewards are many,      

508
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,656
          and we make           
        great progress.         

509
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,693
           I am lucky           
      to travel with a man      

510
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,196
     such as MeriwetherÉ      

511
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,931
       Uniquely qualified       

512
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,699
    to lead this expedition.    

513
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,819
         I was thinking         
          this morning          

514
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,788
          of the days           
          we first met          
          in Kentucky           

515
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,224
     and what a joyous time     
           that was."           

516
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,361            
           Ugh                

517
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,664
     -Brilliant.                
      That was a good one.      
     -Great.                    

518
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,998
    -That was a good one.       
    -Oh, good. I felt really    
     good about it.             

519
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,134
      You fooled the biker      
          over there.           

520
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,036
         -Yes.                  
         -Play acting.          

521
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,871
          So watch me           
        do this to you.         

522
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,239
          -Okay.                
          -Oh, craig.           

523
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,274
              Oh!               
      How did that-- yeah?      

524
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,342
          -OhÑ boom!           
          -Oh!                  

525
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,943
             -Oh!               
             -Hah!              

526
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,779
      Again. Don't do this      
       in a street fight.       

527
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,781
       -Okay.                   
       -Cause you won't        
        make contact.           

528
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,315
  -But this isn't good, right?  
  -No, it's just terrible.      

529
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,751
 You don't want to telegraph it 
       in a street fight.       

530
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,087
    You want to telegraph it    
    for the American viewer.    

531
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,156
       -Right.                  
       -Yeah, or whoever        
        gets it abroad.         

532
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:15,159
      You don't need that.      
        You need-- boom!        

533
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,261
      -Okay, I'm gonna          
       do one more, okay?       
      -Okay, go for it.         

534
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,029
          -Ow!                  
          -Oh, my god!          

535
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,265
    -Oh god, are you okay?      
    -Yeah, yeah, I'm faking.    

536
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,966
         -Oh, my god.           
          I'm so sorry.         
         -Wow!                  

537
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,368
         -ThatÕs okay.          
         -I'm so sorry.         

538
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,203
       You came so close        
   that you actually hit me.    

539
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,105
  -ThatÕs how close you came.   
  -Yeah, it was pretty good.    

540
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,240
 -I really felt it that time.   
 -By the way, it doesn't hurt.  

541
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,909
     -Oh, god.                  
     -ItÕs fine. It's fine.     

542
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,243
   My eyes are only watering    
       'cause of my nose        

543
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,912
     -is really sensitive.      
     -Oh, right.                

544
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,151
      "I hope that someday      
   you will read this letter.   

545
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,488
         and if somehow         
      I return home again,      

546
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,890
         that our eyes          
      will meet once more.      

547
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,395
     yours, william clark."     

548
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,998   
           Ah! David!           

549
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
          Help, David!          
          I'm trapped!          

550
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,770
         Ah! Oh, David!         

551
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,171
          David, help!          

552
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,742
          Help, David!          

553
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,112
            Oh, god!            

554
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,882
             David!             
          David, help!          

555
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,417
         -Oh, my god!           
         -Rock hit me!          

556
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,918
        -Oh, david!             
        -What happened?         

557
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,455
    The rocks! The rocks!       
    I was recording a tone!     

558
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,524
    Oh, my god! Oh, my god!     
          Oh, my god!           

559
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,359     
           Ah!                 

560
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,228
 Dude, I'm getting no service.  
       We can't call out.       

561
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,530
-I don't know what to do.       
-Pretend I'm like James Franco. 

562
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,132
   I'll do-- no, no, no, no!    
       I cannot cut you!        

563
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,900
   -We have to cut it, David.   
   -Oh, no, no, no...           

564
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,236
-No, David, you have to cut it. 
-I didn't want to do this.      

565
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:35,205
 -This is my honeymoon!         
 -Cut it, David! I'm gonna die! 

566
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,875
             David,             
      you have to cut it.       

567
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,943
          -Take it.             
          -Oh, my god.          

568
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,479
If we don't make it out, David, 
     send my arm to my dad.     

569
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,181
           My father            
       would like my arm.       

570
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,351
     -DonÕt do the tendons.     
     -All right.                

571
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,019
      -The tendons first.       
      -I need a countdown.      

572
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,121
    -Three, two--               
    -No, no, but then what?     

573
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,824
       -What?                   
       -David! If anybody       
        would cut my arm,       

574
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,026
        I would want it         
       to be you, David.        

575
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,895
   Oh man, I'm sorry, buddy.    
     Let's do this, ready?      

576
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,163
            -OneÉ             
            -TwoÉ             

577
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:02,332
           -Three!                      

578
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,871
       -David, a snack.         
       -Is that ketchup?        

579
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,374
    -Do you have some fries?                  

580
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:13,177
  -Perhaps some hash browns.    
  -That was really elaborate.   

581
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,045
        -Did I get you?         
        -You did get me.        

582
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:18,348
  That is so bizarre that you   
    would go to that length.    

583
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,818
  -You are a six-year-old-boy.  
  -Maybe seven.                 

584
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,020
   -ItÕs going to be coming.    
   -I'm ready.                  

585
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,922
        That's my knife,        
          by the way.           

586
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,056
      Do you have a towel?      

588
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,443
        I got reception!        

589
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,153
       Reception's gone.        

590
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,988
        David! Put down         
          your phone,           

591
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,456
          And join me           
        in these waters.        

592
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,463
      Come take a freezing      
   cold bath with me, David.    
       You will love it.        

593
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,600
          Just ignore           
         the shrinkage.         

594
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:11,602
             David,             
       I have goose skin        
           right now.           

595
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,871
       It feels so good.        

596
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,874
         Oh, hi, ducks.         

597
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,180            
      Hopin' for a signal.      

598
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,082
         I need to know         
      if I got this part.       

599
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,884   
          Come, David.          

600
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,219
         Increase your          
      hip-moving velocity.      
           Let's go.            

601
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,555
       And I have to talk       
          To Frankie.           

602
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,358
      Oh, David, stop it.       
Focus your face on this nature. 

603
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:41,398
  "It seems we are now beyond   
   reach of the known world.    

604
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
    I think of those at home    
     who have no knowledge      

605
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,534
      Of our well being."       

606
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,403
            Nothing.            

607
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,505
   "If we are alive or dead."   

608
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,429
        Why do you think        
     Frankie contacted me?      

609
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,632
      I mean, do you think      
     that she wants to move     
        back in with me?        

610
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,035
      I don't know, David.      

611
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,704
        Okay, according         
          to this map,          

612
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,706
       We should go onto        
 the other side of this ridge,  

613
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,574
           and there            
        could be a tower        
          over there.           

614
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,576
        We're surrounded        
     only by nature, david.     

615
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,946
     I don't think beavers      
  can build cell phone towers.  

616
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,314
        Well, the phone         
        says otherwise.              

618
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:45,028         
         Nothing still.         

619
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,664
          David, here.          
      I'm slightly taller.      
          Let me try.           

620
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,101
             Okay.              

622
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,440
      Uh! A little higher.      

623
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,975
        Yep. Here we go.        

624
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,211
    All right, cell towers.     
       Smell this phone.        

625
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,546    
       Ha! We got it!          

626
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,647
           -We got--            
           -Ah!                 

627
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,615
           Oh, god!                 

628
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,284
              Ugh!              

629
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,989
         -Oh, no, no!           
         -Oh, scheiße.                

631
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,598
    Yeah,                       
    itÕs completely fucked.     

632
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,167
       I'm sorry, David.        
            Scheiße.            

633
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,169
             Here.              
      Get your phone out.       

634
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,704
       I didn't bring it.       
        It's in the car.        

635
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,373
       I-- I didn't think       
     we would have service.                 

637
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,144
 -The maps were in this phone.  
 -Uh, no, that's okay.          

638
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,579
        Before it broke,        
           I checked.           

639
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,115
 We have to go to like a place  
        called Red Fox.         

640
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,616
             Yeah.              

641
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,119
          Well, do you          
      know where that is?       

642
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,788
    We'll find it for sure.     

643
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,225
       How many Red Foxes       
    Are there, David? Right?    

644
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,268
          Uh, I think           
      itÕs Red Fox Hills.       

645
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,370
        Oh, yeah, yeah.         
    Why-- why-- why is that?    

646
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,706
      -ItÕs in my guts.         
      -Uh, we're going          
       with your guts now?      

647
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,708
    That's how we're hiking?    

648
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,677
        Well, what would        
      Lewis and Clark do?       

649
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,480
      They would have used      
    a native american guide     

650
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,649
         or a compass.          

651
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,317
        Compass? Great.         
        Let's use that.         

652
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,320
        Oh, good, yeah.         
   Uh, that was on my phone.    

653
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,589
    So, do you have a guide?    

654
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,224
     I don't have a guide.      

655
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,296
      -LetÕs go that way.       
      -LetÕs do it.             

656
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,597
         It's probably          
         all the same.          

657
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,444
        Come on, David.                   

658
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,115
      "When I first viewed      
        these mountains,        

659
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,684
   I felt a sudden pleasure.    

660
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,487
     But now, as I reflect      
      on the difficulties       

661
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,290
    which this snowy barrier    
       throws in our way,       

662
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:57,160
       and the sufferings       
  and hardships of our party,   

663
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,662
       it in some measure       
        counterbalances        

664
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,497
     those fond memories."      

665
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,870
     And what are your guts     
        telling you now?        

666
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,473
         I don't know.          
     My gps is down, David.     

667
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,374
      Oh, you have a gps?       

668
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,143
             Yeah.              
  My guts positioning system.   

669
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:16,146
        It's not working        
      because I'm hungry.       

670
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,115
        I think it needs        
          a sandwich.           

671
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:21,318   
    "After narrowly avoiding    
       ruiness injury"...        

673
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,489
         Come, David.                        

674
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,693    
   ..."We look to descending    
   from this retched mountain   

675
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,729
    which we have now named,    
     'wretched mountain.'"      

676
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:38,602
    Well, this was your idea    
      to do Red Fox Hills.      

677
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,270
      Red Fox is an idiot.      

678
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,772
    We call hills like this     
     in germany mountains.      

679
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,644      
  "But we take joy in knowing   
          that tonight          

680
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,515
          we shall bed          
      at the last outpost       
       of civilization."           

682
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,557
       I called my agent.       

683
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,925
        It's between me         
       and one other guy.       

684
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,493
       Oh, that's great.        

685
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,298
       I called Frankie.        
      There was no answer.      

686
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,167
             -Oh.               
             -But,              

687
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:11,601
   I did pick up another map,   

688
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,937
        and you are not         
       going to touch it.       

689
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,705
  I will treat it like a baby   
         if I touch it.         

690
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,542
     Listen, I mailed this      
         two weeks ago.         

691
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,278
     It was supposed to be      
    for me and Frankie, but     

692
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,580
   -Now it's for me and you.    
   -Ooh.                        

693
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,948
           Champagne.           

694
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,617
 -Hey, buddy.                   
 -Oh, yeah, oatmeal-raisin mix. 

695
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,452
     -Oh, condoms.              
     -We don't need those.      

696
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,888
 -But who knows, David?          
 -Those were not meant for us.          

698
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,458
     And it seems as though     
  you sent yourself a package.  

700
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,634
            It means            
        "Honeybuddies,"         

701
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,937
         but in German.               

703
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,707
          Oh, my god.           

704
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,475
         -ItÕs for you.         
         -ThatÉ               

705
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,511
    is a very orange shirt.     

706
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:55,812
             Yeah.              

707
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,681
      I selected the color      
          for safety.           

708
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,483
 You know, like if hunters are  
 looking for elks or reindeers, 

709
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,285
          who are we?           

710
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,887         
       Humans in shirts.        

711
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,355     
      This is ridiculous.       

712
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,524
       Look on the left.        
          That's you.           

713
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,359
  -Oh, slightly shorter.        
  -Well, it's accurate, yeah.   

714
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,261
      -Oh, man, thank you.      
      -Oh, great.               

715
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,831
          Look, okay.           
     I gotta be a grownup.      

716
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,733
         I'm gonna put          
    the whole phone incident    

717
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,867
           behind us.           

718
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,703
   Okay, it was an accident.    

719
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,905
         And honestly,          
    itÕs kind of a blessing     
          in disguise.          

720
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,707
    I-- I'd rather not have     
       the outside world        

721
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,809
      encroaching on this.      

722
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,644
       Well, sorry again        
          about that.           

723
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,778
              Oh.               

724
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,849
        This champagne's        
    not gonna drink itself.     

725
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:35,852
    No, we are gonna do it.     

726
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,987
     That's what you meant,     
             right?             

727
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,521
          -Yes.                 
          -Okay, then.            

729
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,628         
         Party pooper.              

737
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,385
      David, we're empty.       

738
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,753
  We need some more champagne.  

739
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,455
         Let me get it.         

740
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,924
              Ooh.                          

743
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,936  
          "Dear David.          

744
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,639
       I just found your        
   secret honeymoon package.    

745
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,642
  And even though I'm probably  
sitting right there next to you,

746
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,644
     I decided to write you     
         a little note.         

747
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,681
   I wanted to just tell you    
  that I'm the luckiest person  

748
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,817
         in the world          
    to have you in my life.     

749
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,787
         I know things          
   havenÕt been easy lately,    

750
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,790
          but I'm sure          
    it will all be worth it.    

751
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,761
     I can't wait to spend      
     the rest of our lives      
           together.            

752
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,497
      Love you like crazy.      

753
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,598
         Your new wife,         

754
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,633
           Frankie."            

756
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,505
   What are you doing, David?   

757
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,841
           Oh, ah...            

758
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:41,144
          Just getting          
        another bottle.               

760
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,454
       All right, David,        
    I'm going down the creek    

761
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,423
          To get some           
       cool river sounds.       

762
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,793
          -Be careful.          
          -Okay.                 

764
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,463
       Come here, sounds.       

767
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,009      
        This is perfect.        

768
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,111
    Take one of rock sounds.    

769
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,581
   "Meriwether has once again   

770
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,205
        left to capture         
        new specimens."         

771
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,856
       Sometimes I worry        
    what might happen to him    
       when he is alone."       

772
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,672
  - Ah, gottverdammt, scheiße.     

775
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,090
      This is what it is.       

776
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,129
          Wer sind da?          
          Who's here?           

777
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,871       
     Verdammt noch mal, du.        

780
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,107
            Oh, god.            

781
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,645
         Dude, it's me.         
       It's me. It's me.        

782
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,280
        -David.                 
        -I'm sorry, man.        

783
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,681
          -You got me.          
          -I know,              

784
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,550
         but the thing          
         with the arm.          

785
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,086
        So, we're even.         
        I'm so sorry.           

786
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,788
      -Dude, are you okay?      
      -No.                      

788
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,526
  -Oh, David.                   
  -Uh, we're even now, buddy.   

789
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,727
      We are even Steven.       

790
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,228
         Oh, I'm gonna          
        get you so hard.        

791
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,931
       Oh no, we're done.       
you got me, and I got you back. 

792
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,933
       No, it's my turn.        
      itÕs like a frisbee.      

793
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,568
      No, we can be done.       

794
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:39,856     
     "What drives men to do     
          such things?          

795
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:44,160
    Are we full of courage?     

796
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,862
          Are we mad?           

797
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,967
      Or do we simply flee      
    what we've left behind?"    

798
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,943
          What do you           
        want me to say?         

799
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,615
       It's not my fault        
     I didn't get the job.      

800
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,119
   I'm actually okay with you   
 putting your career before me. 

801
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,058
   What I have a problem with   
is when you treat me like shit. 

802
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:34,077
     So after he pulled out     
      the heart, you know,      
         from that man,         

803
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,046
     That's when I decided      
  I'm never visiting Indiana.   

804
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,148
         Yeah, his name         
       is Indiana Jones.        

805
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,650
           That scene           
      took place in india,      

806
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,218
     and that was a movie.      

807
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,120
      Well, I'm not going.      
   I don't care where it is.    

808
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,154
          It's scary.           

809
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:48,658
          -Hey, guys.           
          -Hello.               

810
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,862
         Let me guess.          
    Uh, best friend forever,    
      David and dj Flula.       

811
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,397
             Yeah.              

812
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,399
    I've been stalking you.     

813
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,801          
         I'm kidding.          

814
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,837
        I saw your names        
    on the hiking registry.     

815
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,840
          Ah-hah-hah!           
    That's what you put down    
        in the registry?        

816
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,174
     -Yeah, it's the truth.     
     -Okay.                     

817
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,809
       I guess we must've       
        passed you guys         

818
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,012
           Yesterday            
       at Red Fox Trail?        

819
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:12,015
              Yes.              
      We actually ended up      
      doing Red Fox Hills,      

820
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,017
   Which was far less direct.   

821
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,918
         -Very scenic.          
         -Cool.                 

822
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,789
       Well, did you guys       
      wanna stay with our       
         group tonight?         

823
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,357
   -We have backpacker beer.    
   -You bet.                    

824
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,093
       Heck, yes, hello.        
   Do bears poop in forests?    

825
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,762
   -That sounds great. Sure.    
   -They do.                    

826
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:28,097
         Okay, awesome.         
     Um, well, there's a--      

827
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,266
thereÕs a great spot, actually, 
       right over there.        

828
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,902
   You guys wanna go grab it,   
    and I'll meet you there?    

829
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:35,071
           -Great.              
           -Awesome.            

830
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,739
            -Cool.              
            -Thanks.            

831
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,207
        -BFF.                   
        -ByeÑ bye-bye.         

832
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,047
             David,             
    she is very attractive.     

833
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,915
         Yeah, I guess.         
      If you're into that       
         sort of thing.         

834
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,184
           What? No.            
        She was looking         
         at you, David.         

835
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,719
      No, she was looking       
         at both of us.         

836
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,388
  No, she was looking at you.   

837
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,290
  Stop thinking about Frankie   
         all the time.          

838
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,359
      Start thinking about      
        hot new ladies.           

847
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,489      
             Okay.              

848
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,926
        Oh, yeah, David.        

849
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,895
         Yeah, get it.          
    Oh, yeah, looking good.     

850
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,397
       Okay, so, tonight,       
             justÑ             

851
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,232
    You do some good things,    
   and I'll be your wingman.    

852
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,901
    Oh, yeah, I do not need     
       a wingman tonight.       

853
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,137
      -Thank you.               
      -You don't think          
       you don't need one.      

854
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,972
          -Right.               
          -But you do.          

866
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,012
        Hello, everyone.        

867
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:25,181
           I'm Flula            
       and this is David.       

868
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,783
       -Hi.                     
       -I smell very bad,       

869
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,118
      uh, but David smells      
         really great.          

870
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,319
              So.               

871
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:34,891
    Do you guys wanna learn     
 how to make backpacking beer?  

872
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,559
         -OhÉ                 
         -Uh, yes, but,         

873
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,828
         if this is a          
        difficult task,         
           watch out.           

874
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,463
       I am very stupid.        

875
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,932
           But David,           
     heÕs like a scientist      
         of the world.          

876
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:44,433
       It's really easy.        

877
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,069
            I-- I--             
       I'm sure you both        
         will be fine.          

878
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,571
    Uh, this is some water--    

879
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,506
       naturally sourced,       
    that we then carbonated.    

880
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:51,908
           Step one.            

881
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,243
           And then,            
    here is the concentrate.    

882
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,946
  It's just a teaspoon of this  
    into what you guys have.    

883
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,214
        Just be careful         
        'cause it's like        

884
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,482
      70 percent alcohol.       

885
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,150
       -Ooh.                    
       -Just be careful.        

886
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,452
That sounds like too many steps 
      for my small brain.       

887
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:06,289
        I will probably         
      urinate everywhere.       

888
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:09,392
    Also, I'm very terrible     
    with sexual intercourse.    

889
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,860
           Just fyis.           

890
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,830
          Do you know           
        what that means?        

891
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,535
    Uh, where are you from?     

892
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,618
    That's the saddest thing    
        I've ever heard.        

893
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,621
         It was a, uh,          
          tough time,           

894
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,423
            But, uh,            

895
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,491
           You know,            
        whatever doesn't        
        kill you, right?        

896
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,460
              No.               
            I mean,             

897
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:48,631
       that is literally        
       the saddest thing        
       I have ever heard.       

898
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,900
          I don't know          
        how you're just         

899
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,870
      Keeping it together       
      like this right now.      

900
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,205
        Yes, last week,         
        David was crying        

901
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,274
        -all day,               
         just everyday.         
        -Tsk, oh.               

902
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:01,077
 This week DavidÕs only crying  
    a few minutes every day.    

903
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,378       
        Yeah,                  

904
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,146
          It's because          
         heÕs so manly.         

905
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,315
           Unlike me,           
         heÕs very good         
         at things like         

906
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,117
        French kissing.         

907
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,452
          Yeah, okay,           
           thank you.           

908
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,954
          Um, you sir,          
        are the greatest        

909
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,956
            best man            
      you could ever want.      

910
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,459
      He's also never done      
         a porno film.          

911
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:19,028
       But he's received        
          many offers.          

912
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,963
    That's very flattering.     

913
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:24,567
        Uh, well, Flula,        
     you were the best man.     

914
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,469
    -Did you write a speech?    
    -Yes, I have it here.       

915
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,070
            -You do?            
            -Yeah.              

916
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,039
        That's amazing.         
      You-- you have to--       

917
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,607
      you have to say it.       
  You have to give the speech.  

918
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,142
      -Yeah?                    
      -No, no, no, no, no,      
       no, no, not now.         

919
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,477
   -Yes. Yes.                   
   -How 'bout a little later?   

920
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,045
       -Speech, speech.         
       -No, don't start.        

921
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,680
-DonÕt start.                   
-Speech. Speech. 

922
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,516
 -Guys, no! It's stupid.        
 -Speech. Speech...  

923
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,252
       Yes! Hey!           

924
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,255
        "Hello everyone.        

925
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:50,126
   What a wonderful location    
   for a wedding like this--    

926
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:53,129
     this great golf course     
       weÕre on tonight.        

927
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:58,301
            You guys            
       are all such sexy        
        'motherputters.'        

928
00:48:58,303 --> 00:48:59,969
             Four!"             

929
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:04,974
             Okay.              

930
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,310
       "David, FrankieÑ        

931
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:09,645
   David, ladies, gentlemen,    

932
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,381
     and all the attenders      
      of this great event,      

933
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:15,151
          hello to you          
       and thank you for        
         your presence          

934
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,687
           and also,            
         your presents.         

935
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:21,090
      Oh, look at that one      
with the nice stripes and bows. 

936
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:23,559
        Oh, what is it?         
      Perhaps a crock pot?      

937
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,161
        Or a lawn mower?        

938
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,098
      A question for you.       

939
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,334
     Who is a lucky person?     

940
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:34,036
    Is it a small baby child    
          who is born           

941
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,671
      and can immediately       
           toot horns           

942
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,039
      like a jazz expert?       

943
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,242
   Yes, this is a lucky baby.   

944
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:43,379
        Or what if a man        
  who cannot speak with words   

945
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:47,750
   but only with loud screams   
      of agonizing terror?      

946
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:50,586
       No, he's actually        
           not lucky.           

947
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,621
            But now,            
           let us see           

948
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,725
  who is the most lucky person  
       in all the world.        

949
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,193
   My finger shall tell you.    

950
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,473
           It is me.            

951
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:13,142
 Because I have the best friend 
      in all of the world.      

952
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,212
             David.             

953
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:18,180
        -Aw.                    
        -Some years ago,        

954
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,249
      my life as a deejay       
        was, as you say,        

955
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,685
           a complete           
     and 'butter' failure.      

956
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,254
      Everyone in my town       
    was hating at my sound,     

957
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:28,057
       but then one night       
      everything changed.       

958
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:31,360
      When an American man      
    made a stop in the bar.     

959
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,230
          He was on a           
       'soul search' trip       
          he did say.           

960
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,598
    We talked for many hours    

961
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,733
         and had many,          
        many schnappses         

962
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,169
        speaking of our         
     frustrations in life.      

963
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,139
      We did hug and dance      
           and, yes,            

964
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:46,242
  cry some long and hard tears  
        like two pirates        

965
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,711
      searching for booty       
         for many years         

966
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,480
     but finding only dirt      
       and some coconuts.       

967
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,319
         In the morning         
    before David did leave,     
          he told me,           

968
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:01,390
    âFlula, anytime you are     
 in Los Angeles, look me up.'  

969
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,726
      And so the next day,      
      I purchased a ticket      

970
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,729
       -and flew                
        to Los Angeles.Ó        
       -Yep.                    

971
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,632
    "David was not yet home     
   from his soul search trip,   

972
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:12,835
  So I did sleep on his porch   
          for 16 days.          

973
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:15,504
     When he arrived home,      
      he called the police      

974
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,306
        And did pretend         
      not to remember me."      

975
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,275
     Which was very funny,      
       I must say, David.       

976
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:22,078
   Really, it's this acting.    
 Whoa, you are nail it, right?  

977
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,114
        Man, great work.        
            Talent.             

978
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,515
            Anyway.             

979
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:29,185
    "After the police left,     
    our friendship sprouted     

980
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,820
       like a fresh field       
         of asparagus.          

981
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:32,755
    Except unlike asparagus,    

982
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:36,258
         our friendship         
     did not make our urine     
        smell terrible."        

983
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,263
          And here's--          
    oh, and some nice things    
         about Fankie.         

984
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,400
          Some more--           
    no, it's not applicable.    
            Ah, ja.             

985
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,802
  "David, we have been friends  
     from when we were both     

986
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,537
    at the bottoms of life.     

987
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,340
        And this is when        
  friendships are made strong,  

988
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,675
      like two chandeliers      

989
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:55,211
        that have fallen        
       inside a volcano.        

990
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:58,280
     The chandeliers melt,      
 but then they stick together.  

991
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,282
            And then            
      when they cool down,      

992
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,618
   they are hugging forever.    

993
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,355
   Nothing can break this new   
    double chandelier apart.    

994
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:09,391
    Except if it falls back     
       into the volcano.        

995
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:12,495
    Or slips into a geyser."    

996
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,530
   I mean, or if you drop it    
      from a large height,      

997
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:15,865
           then it--            
        i will shatter.        

998
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,399
          But then...           

999
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,301
       "David, I love you       
           very much.           

1000
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:23,873
        Here is to you,         
     my best friend forever     
       and my honeybuddy.       

1001
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:26,442
   So, now let's have a toast   
    For David and FrankieÓÑ    

1002
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:29,578
       nope, just David,        
we are just toasting for David.  

1004
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,415
         Cheers, guys,          
           thank you.           

1005
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:36,452
       That was so sweet.       

1006
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,854
       -Oh, thanks.             
       -That really was.        

1007
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:42,158
    And, um, I'm just sorry     
    you didn't get to say it    
     at my actual wedding.      

1008
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,793
  -Next time.                   
  -YouÕre really good at that.  

1009
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,328
         You should be          
       a public speaker.        

1010
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,463
        -Oh, no.                
        -Professionally.        

1011
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,797
         -No, stop it.          
         -Yeah.                 

1012
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,733
       David is the real        
     master thespian here.      

1013
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,902
             -OhÉ             
             -Wait.             

1014
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:54,336
            I knew             
      you looked familiar.      

1015
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,272
             Uh-uh.             

1016
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,941
    -YouÕre a tv star,          
     arenÕt you?                
    -Well, not a tv ãstar.Ó     

1017
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:00,576
        I've-- I've done        
       some stuff on tv.        

1018
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:01,944
   -No big deal.                
   -No, you're, like, famous.   

1019
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:04,180
     You were on that show      
    "Portland steel," right?    

1020
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,348
       -Yeah.                   
       -Yeah, I was on          
        "Portland steel."       

1021
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,717
        I did that, uh,         
        pilot episode.          

1022
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,587
     I was-- the character      
     didnÕt make it, but...     

1023
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,289
         -You saw that?         
         -Oh, my god.           

1024
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,457
        I was so pissed         
      when they fired you.      

1025
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:16,792
         -Wow.                  
         -I loved you.          

1026
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:18,561
        -You were great.        
        -Thank you.             

1027
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:19,929
	Yeah.            

1028
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,931
     So, what else have you     
       been up to lately?       

1029
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:23,632
         I mean, any--          
   anything I would've seen?    

1030
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,668
           Uh, well,            

1031
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,370
      okay, just some, um,      
  little kind of indy things.   

1032
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,239
   -Yeah.                       
   -Did a couple indy dramas.   

1033
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,541
    -ThatÕs so cool.            
    -Some got a lot of buzz     
     on the circuit.            

1034
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,777
      Do not be so modest.      
   He's done so many things.    

1035
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,946
     -Uh, stop it.              
     -"Zombies vs. monkeys,     
      part three."              

1036
00:53:36,948 --> 00:53:38,681
-No one saw that movie.         
-I'm not really into sci-fi, so.

1037
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:40,316
        -That was just          
         for a paycheck.        
        -I'm just--             

1038
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,650
        I swear there's         
    something else, though.     

1039
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,320
     -What?                     
     -No, there's-- I can't     

1040
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:45,754
    -put my finger on it.       
    -ThatÕs pretty much it.     

1041
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,590
     -That is everything.       
     -I know there's-- no.      

1042
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,857
 Well, there's "Little genius." 
    There's "Little genius."    

1043
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,226
    -Oh, my god!        
    -Why would you say that?    

1044
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,894
     It's "Little genius."      

1045
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,562
          Oh, my god.           

1046
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,431
          You are like          
      a national treasure.      

1047
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,932
         That is the--          
     like, my favorite show     

1048
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,334
      -When I was little.       
      -Yeah?                    

1049
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,969
       You were so cute.        

1050
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:04,473
      You used to be like,      
 "But I'm the real boy." right? 

1051
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,642
    It had that song, too--     
      How did the song go?      

1052
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:08,244
  -Like, little...              
  -I know that song.   

1053
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,578
            -You do?            
            -Yeah.              

1054
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,513
   -Yes, you have to play it.   
   -NoÑ hey, no.               

1055
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,249
 -We you don't need to do that. 
 -Oh, my god, this is perfect.  

1056
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,550   
  Please, can we not do that?    

1058
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,426           
         It's so good.          

1059
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,335          
      Here's comes the...              

1066
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:06,435
     All right, big finish.      

1070
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:31,393
   -What, he doesn't like it?   
   -ItÕs a really good song.    

1071
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,895
      -ItÕs so good, yeah.      
      -ItÕs actually a          
       Really good song.        

1072
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:35,998
     May be bathroom break.     
         I don't know.              

1074
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,702
      He doesn't shut up.       

1077
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,831
              Ugh!              

1079
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:42,097    
   "Dearest Flula, thank you,   

1080
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:45,801
       Or, should I say,        
     danke for last night.      

1081
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,569
           Wow, wow.            

1082
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,939
        You are a master        
        at making love.         

1083
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:54,810
        You are probably        
     better at making love      
       Than making music.       

1084
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,845
       I would've thought       
      that was impossible,      

1085
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:59,748
        Since your music        
   is the best in the world,    

1086
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,818
      But, it is possible.      

1087
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,053
     I'll never forget you.     

1088
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:08,924
   Also, I'm glad I chose you   
       instead of David.        

1089
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,192
        Sincerely yours,        

1090
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:12,094
            Polly."             

1091
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,695
         "Ps: DavidÓÉ         

1092
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,164     
   ..."This is really Flula.    

1093
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,166
       I did not have any       
 intimate relations with Polly. 

1094
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:19,635
           That would           
       be inappropriate.        

1095
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,037
         Also, you just         
          got punked!"          

1098
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,518
  Oh, did I ruin your sounds?   

1099
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,187           
     You saw my love note.      

1100
00:57:38,189 --> 00:57:40,556
    Yeah, it was real funny.    

1101
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,224
             What?              

1102
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:45,060
    She was mine last night     
   and that's what I needed.    

1103
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,062
        And you came in         
and you cockblocked me so hard. 

1104
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,498
           I told you           
 I didn't need a wingman, okay? 

1105
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,166
         You don't know         
        when to shut up.        

1106
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,734
         Talking about          
        "Little genius"?        

1107
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,670
     She liked you because      
      of "Little genius."       

1108
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,839
       I brought this up,       
  immediately, she likes you.   

1109
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:00,108
 -They were singing the song--  
 -Enough with "Little genius."  

1110
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,077
  -YouÕre telling me            
   Enough of "Little genius"?   
  -Yeah.                        

1111
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,079
         That's all you         
      think about, David.       

1112
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,215
           I'm trying           
  to bring you here to nature,  
       but where are you?       

1113
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,050
      You are stuck inside      
      your cranium there.       

1114
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:10,752
            I'm here            
    to help you feel better     
       here on this trip.       

1115
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:13,856
         And all you do         
  is you're a little bitchier   
  and you're a little moaner.   

1116
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:16,625
 Well, I've had enough moaners  
  and enough bitchers, David.   

1117
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:18,093
      -Suck it up.              
      -Sorry I'm depressed      

1118
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,796
   after my fiancÉe left me.    

1119
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,831
    But you know what you do    
         all day long?          

1120
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,266
   Dude, you have no filter.    

1121
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:30,105
      Did you see the note      
that Frankie left me yesterday? 

1122
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:32,841
     Is that what this joke     
       is all about, man?       

1123
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,610
           What note?           
           David, no.           

1124
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:37,713
 You can't just laugh and dance 
    through real life shit.     

1125
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,549
    There are repercussions.    
  And you know another thing?   

1126
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:41,750
      -What?                    
      -Remember that night      

1127
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,519
     In Germany when we met     

1128
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,787
    and had that great time     
 got all drunk off of schnapps? 

1129
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,956
           -Yeah.               
           -I don't.            

1130
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,025
        I don't remember        
          meeting you.          

1131
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,861
      That is the genesis       
  of this relationship, okay?   

1132
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,197
      And I don't remember      
    inviting you to America.         

1134
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,676
         You know what?         

1135
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:10,546
        I'm going to go         
      to the next campsite      
          without you.          

1136
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,848
        Clearly you need        
          to be alone.          

1137
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:18,620
          Okay, yeah,           
      I hope you get there      
         without a map.            

1150
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,381       
       "Fatigue is high.        

1151
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:30,185
      Bad spirits abound.       

1152
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,787
    This is without a doubt     

1153
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,822
        the lowest point        
        of our journey."        

1155
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,480
         -What is this?         
         -Oh, my god.           

1156
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:00,248
        I can't believe         
    I forget to cancel them.    

1157
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:03,385
    They look like vikings.     

1158
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,754
         But friendly.          

1159
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:22,938
           Well, hi.            
       You must be David.       

1160
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,841
   -Yes.                        
   -And you must be Frankie.    

1161
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:27,843
      -UhÉ                    
      -WeÕre very pleased       

1162
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:30,011
   to be able to play for you   
   for this special occasion.   

1163
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:33,315
       This is the Organ        
       Renaissance Band,        

1164
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,117
    and we have just played     

1165
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,120
           a piece by           
    Anthony Holborne called,    
       "The nightwatch."        

1166
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:41,089
          And we have           
   a few more numbers to play   
     for you this evening,      

1167
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,493
          and we hope           
   that you enjoy what we've    
     put together for you.      

1168
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:47,295
      Two, three, four...             

1172
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,953
             What?              
     The vikings are here?      

1173
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:20,622
           Hey, man,            
    I know I've been a, uh,     

1174
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:22,457
          -Real dick.           
          -Yeah.                

1175
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:23,959
           And I want           
      to apologize to you.      

1176
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,594
         Uh, it's okay.         
     I forgive you, David.      

1177
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,562
      Don't give it to me       
           that easy.           

1178
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:29,631
     -I...                      
     -ItÕs fine, David,         
      weÕre friends again.      

1179
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:31,333
              Shh.              

1180
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:32,901
      I want to make it up      
            to you,             

1181
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:36,304
        and here's how.         

1182
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:38,240
             Yeah?              
        Remember these?         

1183
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:39,407
        Now, I've never         
       done these before,       

1184
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,877
         but I-- okay.          

1185
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,545
   I-- I think you have to be   
   in the right headspace...    

1186
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:47,282
         My god, stop.          
      That's way too much.      
        Give that to me.        

1187
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:49,551
              Wow.              

1188
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,152
           Go, David.           

1189
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,224
              Mm.               

1190
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,060
         This do this.          

1191
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,329
    -let's do this.             

1229
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:21,302
          Do you think          
   the wolf is gonna eat us?    

1230
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,805
    I don't think we should     
     Close our eyes, David.         

1232
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,446
       I think I know why       
        Frankie left me.        

1233
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:40,321
       If we make it out        
         of here alive,         

1234
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,490
        I'm gonna change        
         my priorities.         

1235
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,192
        I'm gonna change        
         my whole life.         

1236
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,269
      I dropped your phone      
          on purpose.           

1238
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,883
    Oh. Good morning, David.    

1239
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,384
           Good news.           

1240
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,286
      We did not get eaten      
          last night.           

1241
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,657
         Suck it, wolf!           

1243
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,660
   Let's go find that lodge.    

1244
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,564
            Aw, man,            
         I'm so hungry.         

1245
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,901
        Hungry like a--         
       a wolf, actually.               

1247
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:05,273
    "Great joy in the party.    

1248
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:09,277
        We have reached         
   the end of the continent.    

1249
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,412
       To my dear friend        
          Meriwether,           

1250
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:14,782
         No man exists          
     with whom I would have     
      preferred to endure       

1251
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,885
        such a journey.         

1252
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:19,888
        now let us enjoy        
     this celebrated day."      

1253
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:24,459         
          Wow, David.           

1254
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,461
         It looks like          
        a robots helmet.        

1255
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,829        
    Yeah, it's quite modern,    
           isnÕt it?            

1256
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,498
      David, are you ready      
      for all the snacks?       

1257
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,866
       I'm ready for 'em.       
        give 'em to me.         

1258
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,268
     Do you think they have     
      spaghetti bolognese.      

1259
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,402
    Oh, they got everything.    

1260
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:35,570
            -Steak?             
            -Yes.               

1261
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:37,405
    -Fries that are french?     
    -Yes.                       

1262
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,940
     -Croissants?               
     -Oh, I know                
      they got croissants.      

1263
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:40,808
    -Cabbage?                   
    -No, I don't want those.    

1264
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,544
         Well, I'll eat         
         your cabbage.          

1265
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:45,446
           Gentlemen,           
     welcome to big piney.      

1266
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:47,849
  -Thank you.             
  -Saw you coming up the walk.  

1267
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,785
     -Is one of you David?      
     -Yeah, that's me.          

1268
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:54,189
   Your agent's been calling    
     quite a bit, and, uh,      

1269
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:55,523
         he wanted you          
       to have this note.       

1270
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,326
        Something about         
        Lewis and Clark.        

1271
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,662           
       Wow, awesome, uh,        
       a quick question.        

1272
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,397
   Sir, would it be possible    
         to bring a cot         

1273
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,933
       -Into our room?          
       -Yeah, no problem.       

1274
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:07,368
 -WeÕll have one                
  brought up right away.        
 -You hear that, Flula? 

1275
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,704
        Nobody's cutting        
   any beds in half tonight.    

1276
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,239
        Okay, go on in.         

1277
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,608
      Breakfast is ready,       
      hot coffee is ready.      

1278
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,643
     -All set for you guys.     
     -Sounds wonderful.         

1279
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,979
       Have a great stay.       

1280
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:20,582
Ah, stop and look at me, David. 

1281
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:23,351
      -Is there a problem?      
      -I just remembered.       

1282
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:26,588
     -I'm allergic to cots.     
     -YouÕre not coming?        

1283
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,757
       I think we should        
     keep on hiking, David.     

1284
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,560
    Come on, this direction     
    looks like a fun place.     

1285
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,863
    We're just now learning     
  how to survive wolf attacks.  

1286
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,865
   I just want a hot shower.    
          You get it.           

1287
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,567
      No, no, you don't--       

1288
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,904
    This place looks dirty,     
has very low reviews on "Yelp." 

1289
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,639
         Let's go here          
  and hike and hike and hike.   

1290
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:46,608
     I gotta get some food.     

1291
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:55,383
          Hi, Frankie.          

1292
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,018
     Oh, look at that fog.      

1293
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,520
         It-- it badly          
     needs to be recorded.      

1294
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:00,688
          right away.           

1295
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,864
         I texted you,          
    but I never heard back.     

1296
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:11,532
    I was trying to tell you    
          I'd be here.          

1297
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:13,735
          That's what           
        you were trying         
          to tell me?           

1298
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,637
             Yeah.              

1299
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:16,871
              Why?              

1300
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,706
            Nothing.            

1301
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,542
            Just I--            

1302
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:24,279
          I don't know          
      what I was thinking.      

1303
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,981
    Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry.    

1304
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,784
         I wasn't ready         
        to get married.         

1305
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,886
         I-- I just...          

1306
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,056
      I wish I had done it      
         a lot earlier.         

1307
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:38,960
  I could've saved both of us   
      a lot of heartache.       

1308
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,598
          But I'm glad          
   you went on the honeymoon.   

1309
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,733
      You look different.       

1310
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:47,435
      You look like shit,       
           actually,            

1311
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:50,405
      But you look happy.       

1312
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,511
       So, how was hiking       
          With Flula?           

1313
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:59,047
      It was interesting.       

1314
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:01,582
         He is a, uh...                   

1316
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,886
         Human puzzle.          

1317
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:06,821           
       What is he doing?        

1318
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,856            
    He's a recording a song.    

1319
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:13,461
        And it's either         
    going to be the greatest    
   German work since Wagner,    

1320
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:16,931
      Or it's going to set      
all of humanity back 100 years.       

1322
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,603          
  It's been quite a honeymoon.  

1323
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:25,506
           How did--            
       did you hike here?       

1324
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,675
         -No, I drove.          
         -All the way?          

1325
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,911
    -Yeah, took 20 minutes.     
    -Wow. Yeah.                 

1326
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:31,512
       We shoulda drove.        

1327
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,716
      What's in the note?       

1328
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:38,052
            Oh, um,             
    this was from my agent.     

1329
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:41,022
           It's about           
  the "Lewis and clark" movie.  

1330
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,124
         Remember that?         

1331
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,726
         I'm not gonna          
        open it, though.        

1332
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:49,831
  You know, I think I'm gonna   
      start focusing more       

1333
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,833
   on what's in front of me.    

1334
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:04,112
           Good luck,           
       David and Frankie.             

1336
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,635
          Hey, Flula.           

1337
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,204
             -Hey.              
             -Hey.              

1338
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,740
      Hey, I just noticed       
      you were taking off,      

1339
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:07,442
    And I just wanted to say    
         this was fun.          

1340
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,043
             Yeah,              
     I figured you want to,     

1341
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:10,912
           you know,            
       figure things out        
       with Frankie, so.        

1342
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:14,882
        Yeah, I'm gonna         
    stick back with Frankie.    

1343
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,051
         But, hey, man,         
      it was a great trip.      

1344
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,886
       It's not finished.       
   I'm-- I'm gonna finish it.   

1345
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,087
             So...              

1346
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,191
             -Hey.              
             -Yeah.             

1347
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,564
            See you.            

1348
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:32,467
             Dude.              

1349
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:36,637
        You really think        
      I'm not gonna finish      
      this trip with you?       

1350
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,073
      -What are you, crazy?      
      -David.                   

1351
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:40,708
     I'm a little insulted.     

1352
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,144
    Look, the Frankie stuff     
   will figure itself later.    

1353
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,080
    -You got me.                
    -Well, I'm pretty good.     

1354
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:47,648
       Now it's my turn.        
     You know this, right?      

1355
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,951
       Well, trip's over.       
          weÕre even.           

1356
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,586
   -ThatÕs it.                  
   -Okay, David, no problem.    

1357
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:53,554
       -Fingers crossed.           

1358
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:55,690
      You know, you're not      
    actually supposed to say    

1359
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,558
       ãfingers crossed"        
         when you lie.          

1360
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,027
       Understood, David.       
        Fingers crossed.        

1361
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:02,096
          Hey, did you          
       get enough sounds        
         for your song?         

1362
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,664
        Oh, yes, David,         
        itÕs going to be        

1363
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,700
       The greatest song        
         of all times.          

1364
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:10,004
          It's called           
     "Honeybuddies forever,     
        Superman never"         

1365
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,772
           you know,            
 because of SupermanÕs blatant  

1366
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:13,641
    human rights violations,    
           of course.           

1367
01:15:13,643 --> 01:15:16,777
     Do you actually think      
  that Lois Lane and Superman   

1368
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:18,246
         Were the ones          
    who explored this area?     

1369
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:19,981
        What-- does he--        
        what I don't get        

1370
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:23,251
    Is why Superman and Lois    
   Had to take canoes at all.   

1371
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:25,086
           -You know?           
           -UhÉ               

1372
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:27,889    
  Couldn't Superman just carry  
        Lois in his arms        

1373
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,124
         and fly around         
   these beautiful mountains,   

1374
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:31,659
         And then tell          
      President Traveston       

1375
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,694
    and Lex Luthor about it     
       when he got back?        

1376
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,530
      Seems logical to me.      

1377
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:37,865         
   You are raising questions    
       that I promise you       

1378
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,634
           Historians           
       have never asked.        

1379
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:41,035           
           Thank you.           

1380
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,004
       One last question        
        for you, David.         

1381
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:45,006
            Do you--            
  Do you see that white furry,  
       dog-like creature        

1382
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:46,541
      -Running towards us?                  

1383
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,209
        It's 30 meters.         
      No, it's 20 meters.       

1384
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,911
           It's like            
       ten meters away...       
           Wait-- ah!           

1385
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:51,145         
             Uh...                  

1387
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:53,915
       Honeybuddy, yeah!        

1388
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:01,722
          Yeah! Boom!               

1390
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,147
         -Honeybuddies.                 

1391
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,848
        Do that again.         

1392
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,717
        -No, back, back.        
        -What?                  

1393
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:31,886
          Back-- shh!           
    -- Do that again.     
       No.       

1394
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,187
          -What?                
          -Back, back.          

1395
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,056
 -What?                         
 -BackÑ shh!-- Do that again.  

1396
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:36,924
        -No, back, back.        
        -What? What?            

1397
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,893
  -BackÑ shh! Do that again.                

1398
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,596
        No-- back, back.        
        Just go faster.             

1400
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:50,037
        Just go faster.         

1401
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,272
             Yeah!              

1402
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,711
      -What is happening?       
      -Shh!                     

1403
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:13,894
 "We are now about to penetrate 

1404
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:15,396
           a country            

1405
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:19,667
            on which            
   the foot of civilized man    
        has never trod.         

1406
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:23,671
       It was on the spot       
    where I saw a beautiful     
           white wolf           

1407
01:17:23,673 --> 01:17:26,307
          The largest           
       we had ever seen.        

1408
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:30,911
 But this beauty surely allies  
      some unknown danger.      

1409
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:33,247
        I am no coward,         
  but I fear that all will not  

1410
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:34,982
        Make it across          
        this continent."        

1411
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,785
   Just go, just go, just go,   
   just go, just go, just go,   

1412
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:40,388
   Just go, just go, just go,   
   just go, just go, just go,   

1413
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:43,257
     -Just go--                 
     -Danger. Danger.     

1414
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:45,259
        -Danger. Danger.                       

1415
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:48,763
        Danger. Danger.         
        Danger. Danger.         

1416
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:50,297                  
    -Danger. Danger. Danger.    

1417
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,166
    Danger. Danger. Danger.     
        Danger. Danger--        

1419
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,973     
      Honeybuddies, yeah!       

1420
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:31,238
    -Together: honeybuddies.
