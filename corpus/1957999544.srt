00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,840
[people chattering]

5
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:46,552
- [girl] Another one.
- [woman] Shh, honey.

6
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:47,865
Don't shout at her.

7
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,702
- Good girl.
- Push Anya, push.

8
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,720
That's right, Anya,
it's coming out.

9
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,156
Look at that little head.

10
00:00:57,187 --> 00:01:01,800
[Shoshonna] Oh, I know
it's hard, I know, I know.

11
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:04,457
- [man] The miracle of nature.
- [Shoshonna] Oh, so sweet.

12
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,244
What shall we name this one?

13
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,031
- Joseph.
- Joseph?

14
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:12,145
Can't you see that it's a girl?

15
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:13,139
Don't you even know
the difference

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,804
between a boy and a girl?

17
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:18,360
I said Josephine,
didn't I, Mama?

18
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:19,641
Yeah, perhaps you did.

19
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:20,666
There's another one in there.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,780
Are you sure, Papa?

21
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,959
[Rachel] Of course
he's sure, he's a doctor.

22
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:26,367
[Joshua] But not of dogs.

23
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:28,514
[Anya whimpering]

24
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,268
Anya, shh,
it's not easy, I know.

25
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,576
But soon you can rest,
good girl.

26
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:35,945
Oh, a little one.

27
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:40,462
- What shall we name...
- Him, see it's a him.

28
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,064
[Joshua] Yes,
I can see it's a him.

29
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,708
[puppy whimpering]

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,823
[Samuel] What about Kaleb?
It means dog in Hebrew.

31
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,641
Welcome to the world,
little Kaleb.

32
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:58,015
[singing in German on radio]

33
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,579
[puppies barking]

34
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,024
[Joshua] Come on, Kaleb, Kaleb.

35
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,181
[singing continues]

36
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,765
[puppies barking]

37
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:28,447
[Joshua] There you go,
little Kaleb, delicious.

38
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,855
[Shoshonna]
Please don't do that.

39
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:31,265
They're hungry.

40
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,348
Come here, Josephine.

41
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,492
Don't give
the puppies people food,

42
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,414
and stop calling their names.

43
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:38,408
It will make you too
attached to them.

44
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,676
Hello, little Kaleb.

45
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,893
[Samuel]
Your mother said no names.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,134
Hello, little puppy.

47
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,690
Mm, you can call them by
their numbers instead of names.

48
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,445
[Joshua] Hello, number four.

49
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,136
[Samuel] We must make
plans for the dogs.

50
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,250
What kind of plans?

51
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,524
Go ahead Shoshonna,
explain it to them.

52
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,577
We have to find homes for
them, they can't all live here.

53
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:05,892
We can't give them away.

54
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,094
Maybe not all of them,
we can keep one?

55
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,291
How can we pick out one?
We love them all.

56
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,342
We will find good
homes for them.

57
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,071
They can't be separated.

58
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,513
They're brothers and sisters.

59
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:21,171
What if someone told you
you had to pick Rachel or me?

60
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,932
Would you be able to do that?

61
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:25,015
I don't think that would
be a very difficult choice.

62
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:26,937
[Samuel] It's not the same.

63
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:28,570
Even if times were good,

64
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,524
we can't have five dogs,
including Anya.

65
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:31,902
We're not a kennel.

66
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:33,792
Eat your schnitzel.

67
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:37,187
[bright gentle music]

68
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,532

[puppies yelping]

70
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,617
[bright gentle music continues]

71
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,049
[man] Are these puppies
pure German Shepherd?

72
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,772
As far as we know.

73
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,397
What is the price for them?

74
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,762
We are not asking for money,
only good homes.

75
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,202
[man]
Do you have papers for them?

76
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:27,381
No I am sorry, we don't.

77
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,207
Then how do we know
if they're pure bred?

78
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:34,172
Karl Gustav here is
100 percent German Rottweiler.

79
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,606
Perfect pedigree
and pure lineage.

80
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,848
- How nice.
- There might be some

81
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,963
mixed terrier blood, or
something French in there.

82
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,582
- Of course.
- [girl] Mama, Mama,

83
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,344
look, puppies!

84
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,091
- I like this one.
- [puppies yelping]

85
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,469
We are not giving this one away.

86
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,966
But that's the one I want.

87
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:58,836
Some of the others are
just as nice and bigger.

88
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,086
Come, come, Kaleb.

89
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,161
There's something
wrong with this dog.

90
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,068
He's crazy,
and he bites little girls.

91
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:11,232
He's bitten my sister several
times, hasn't he, Rachel?

92
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,589
Yeah, he bit me in
the neck and the eye.

93
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,384
I had to go to the hospital.

94
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,337
- [girl whimpering]
- Come along, Harriet.

95
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:21,996
Thanks, Rachel.

96
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:29,011
[soft uneasy music]

97
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:49,959
- [Rachel] Poor Anya.
- [Anya whimpering]

98
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:54,124
[music continues]

99
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,645

[Shoshonna speaking German]

101
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:15,041
[townspeople chattering]

102
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,512
You stay, Anya.

103
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,426
You're not allowed
into the bakery.

104
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,437
[townspeople chattering]

105
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,480
[chattering fades]

106
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:50,468
[Samuel] <i>It's only the bakery.</i>

107
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,152
And tomorrow it
will be the florist,

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,324
then the seamstress,
then the food market.

109
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,302
There is danger
forming around us.

110
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,986
Just try to keep
this from the children.

111
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:04,883
Keep it from them?

112
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,656
They saw the sign in the window.

113
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,738
They understand what is
happening better than you do.

114
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:16,286
It will subside,
it will have to.

115
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,720
And these new Nuremberg Laws,

116
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,507
do you know what
is written there?

117
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,959
It says, "For the protection
of German blood

118
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,401
and German honor."

119
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:31,212
We are fifth-generation German,
our children sixth.

120
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,647
Yes, and all of a sudden
we are no longer

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,864
the right breed of Germans.

122
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,154
[gentle thoughtful music]

123
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,749
[doorbell ringing]

124
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:22,080
[door opens]

125
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:23,137
[Samuel]
Come in, please, everybody.

126
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,379
[Shoshonna]
Good evening, everybody.

127
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,654
[Mr. Komorsky] Happy to
see you both, we love it.

128
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,568
[Samuel] Hello, sir.

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,298
Everybody's fine, and welcome.

130
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,668
This is Baruch Zonnenfeld,

131
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,910
a doctor who went
to school with me,

132
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:38,256
and this is the Komorsky family.

133
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,267
[people speaking German]

134
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,534
[Shoshonna] Hello, how are you?

135
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,424
I'm fine, I hope you don't
mind that I brought Kugel.

136
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:47,801
Oh this is very nice of you,

137
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,596
but we don't eat
Kugel on Passover.

138
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:51,933
[chuckling] Uh, Kugel.

139
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:55,041
[hosts and guests laughing]

140
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:57,090
- Everybody, of course.
- Oh, of course, of course.

141
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,141
Every creature should celebrate
the Festival of Freedom.

142
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,358
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

143
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,479
- Come, come, come.
- Go on, Kugel.

144
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,793
Please, go with Mrs. Sherman.

145
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,138
Go to the table.

146
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,149
Come on, the table's
ready, please everybody.

147
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,815
[Mrs. Komorsky] Oh, what
a beautiful Seder table.

148
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:09,647
[Shoshonna] Thank you.

149
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,548
[speaking Hebrew]

150
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:18,360
The greens are a symbol
of spring,

151
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,642
and the miracle of nature,

152
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,396
and we dip it in the salt water

153
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,016
as a symbol to remind
us of the tears

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,066
shed by
the oppressed Israelites.

155
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,740
[all singing in Hebrew]

156
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,729

[all applauding]

158
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,650
[man] We cannot complete the
Seder without the middle matzah,

159
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,572
the afikomen.

160
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:02,981

[woman singing in Hebrew]

163
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,160
Where is it, Kaleb?

164
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:21,110
[music continues]

165
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,777
That's it boy, you found it?

166
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,991
- I got it.
- Oh no.

167
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:41,195
- You are amazing.
- [Rachel groaning]

168
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,757
[adults clapping]

169
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,864
[Mr. Komorsky] Come, Joshua,
come, I have something for you.

170
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,990
[coins clinking]
[adults applauding]

171
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,826
[sniffs]
Mm, this is interesting.

172
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:58,620
Is this is a new
flavor of matzah?

173
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:08,037
[all singing in Hebrew]

174
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,351
[townspeople chattering]

175
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:25,271
Come, Kaleb.

176
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,571
- Why aren't they in school?
- [Samuel] They were sent home.

177
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:43,401
It's Joshua's fault.

178
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:48,078
Joshua passed note to a girl
in his class, Lena Lingmeyer.

179
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,551
They said it was a love letter.

180
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,505
I wrote that
I thought she was pretty.

181
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:53,235
[Samuel] She's the daughter
of an SS officer,

182
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:55,188
and therefore it was
considered a travesty.

183
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,143
The teacher said that
Joshua and Rachel

184
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,648
will no longer be
welcome in the school.

185
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,282
I can no longer go to school

186
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:02,237
because Joshua got into trouble.

187
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,798
I did nothing, this is not fair.

188
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,706
It is time to
tell them the truth.

189
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:12,325
- There is no truth.
- [Rachel] What is happening?

190
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,280
It's just for the time being.

191
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,124
And when I go back,
will I be in the same class

192
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,245
as all my friends?

193
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:20,782
Yes, yes, of course you will.

194
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,185
But in the meantime,
we will study here.

195
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:25,972
Your father and
I will teach you.

196
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,496
[fist pounding]

197
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:44,423
- Mrs. Matilda Schreiver?
- [Matilda] Yeah.

198
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,920
Are you here by yourself?

199
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,202
[Matilda]
Only the children are home.

200
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,711
The Nuremberg Law
does not permit Jews

201
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,338
to employ domestics
under the age of 45.

202
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,435
The people are not <i>aus Juden.</i>

203
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,190
- They are good Jews.
- Good Jews?

204
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,791
The only good Jews
are in Dachau.

205
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:13,827
Listen, you are an Aryan.

206
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,749
You clean the floors of Jews.

207
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,864
Don't you think you
deserve better than this?

208
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,900
[Matilda] They treat me very
well and this is the work I do.

209
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:23,757
[man]
Earning a living is important,

210
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,223
but purity of the race
is more important.

211
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,280
You must leave immediately.

212
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:28,627
We will be back to check

213
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:30,163
that you are no
longer working here.

214
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:32,341
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

215
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:42,912
[soft somber music]

216
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:48,743
I am truly, truly sorry
that I'm not yet 45 years old.

217
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,081
I'm very, very sorry.

218
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,949
You have been very kind to me.

219
00:13:58,384 --> 00:13:59,857
Thank you for everything.

220
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,423
You have been a great
part of our family.

221
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,318
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Let's walk.

222
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,058
I'm saying goodbye.

223
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,350
Bought a ticket for
myself and my dog,

224
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,689
getting a train
to Italy tomorrow,

225
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:25,739
and from there
sailing to Palestine.

226
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,711
You of course heard of
the latest prohibition.

227
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,543
No.

228
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,933
Jews are no longer
able to own pets.

229
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:37,495
[sighing]

230
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:42,172
This dog is all I have,
I have no family.

231
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,887
What are you
waiting for, Samuel?

232
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,083
Get out before it's too late.

233
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:52,069
I don't think there's a
need to be overly dramatic.

234
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,639
This time there is.

235
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:59,340
We won't be able to find
someone to take both of them.

236
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,145
Perhaps Matilda can take Anya,

237
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:08,982
and we find someone
else for Kaleb.

238
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:21,539
[Shoshonna sighing]

239
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,318
It is so good to
see you, Matilda.

240
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,201
- Do you remember my husband?
- Yes, yes of course.

241
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:29,226
- Gabriel.
- Of course.

242
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,540
Nice-looking dog.

243
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:33,584
I told you so,
and she's very obedient.

244
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:35,761
Watch, sit.

245
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:40,822
Do you think you
can take Kaleb also?

246
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:42,648
[Gabriel] No, just one dog.

247
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:47,420
- You'd better be going.
- Yes.

248
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,863
This is her food and...

249
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:03,373
[crying]
this is her favorite blanket.

250
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,729
- Go on.
- Come, Anya.

251
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,426
- Go, go, go.
- [Kaleb whimpering]

252
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,412
No, stay Kaleb.

253
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,079
He misses his mother.

254
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:27,717
Why did Matilda take Anya?
I don't understand.

255
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,739
When bad people make
rules for other people,

256
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:36,879
no good can ever come out of it.

257
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,177
Is this also
because we are Jewish?

258
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:46,199
- Yes.
- Then let's not be Jewish.

259
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,500
Let's become Catholic, and we
can keep and have everything

260
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,261
that everybody else has.

261
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:54,656
[chuckling] We are Jewish,

262
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,827
and be grateful
you have a wonderful family,

263
00:16:58,724 --> 00:16:59,878
don't ever forget that.

264
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:08,495
[townspeople chattering]
[horns honking]

265
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:13,971
[man and woman speaking German]

266
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:15,349
Should we have some chocolates?

267
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,105
Really, Mama,
we can have chocolate?

268
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:20,027
Yes, one.

269
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,388
- Good afternoon, Dr. Sherman.
- Please, come in.

270
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,881
I'm Frank Heinz and was told
by your patient, Alda, that...

271
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,450
Yes, yes, yes, please.

272
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,732
Thank you, please.

273
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,459
- Will they still let us in?
- Yes, yes.

274
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:40,174
- One chocolate, please.
- Hello, hello.

275
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:41,903
Do you want some chocolate?

276
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,683
- Yes.
- Thank you.

277
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:49,079
You'll find that Kaleb is
an unusual dog, very smart.

278
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:51,930
But if everything's all right,

279
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:54,171
perhaps you should leave
before the children come home.

280
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,368
Are they not in school?

281
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,611
[soft poignant music]

282
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:05,095
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i>
our beloved little pup.

283
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,241
Frank and his wife will
take good care of you.

284
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,925
[music continues]

285
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,466
[speaking Hebrew]
May the Lord bless thee

286
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:19,349
and keep thee, and may
his grace shine upon thee,

287
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,039
and be gracious with thee
for all the days your life.

288
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:26,940
[music continues]

289
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,336
- Come Kaleb, Kaleb.
- [Kaleb whining]

290
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,187
Come on, come.

291
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:47,441
[engine rumbling]

292
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,211
- We had chocolate.
- I saved you a piece, Papa.

293
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,126
Kaleb, Kaleb.

294
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,112
Why wasn't Kaleb at the door?

295
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,204
[Rachel] What is it?

296
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:18,864
So Joshua,
you have to be strong.

297
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,292
We had to give Kaleb away.

298
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:27,065
We could do nothing, I'm sorry.

299
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,421
I'm sorry, he cannot come home.

300
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:34,720
No! [sobbing]

301
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:40,005
Why? No.

302
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:46,893
[hooves clopping]

303
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,883
Kaleb, Kaleb,
come out now, come on.

304
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,503
Now, it's all right.

305
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,089
Okay, come, come upstairs.

306
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,492
Here is your new
home, I'll show you.

307
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:05,408
Come, come.

308
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,893
I brought you a surprise.

309
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:23,698
Do you remember
what my father said

310
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,651
when I told him that we
were getting married?

311
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:29,014
I assume this is a
rhetorical question.

312
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:31,258
He said, "Frank is a nice man,

313
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,786
but he does things
without thinking."

314
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:36,222
When I brought Norbert,
you were not excited at first.

315
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:38,624
That's not true, I loved Norbert

316
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,906
from the minute I saw him.

317
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,411
Where did you get this dog?

318
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,686
[Frank] From the Sherman family.

319
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,600
How could you have
thought that a dog from Jews

320
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,722
could replace Norbert?

321
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,155
What in the world do
you call this thing?

322
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:54,224
- Kaleb.
- What a stupid name.

323
00:20:55,345 --> 00:21:00,791
A name can be changed,
how about we call him Norbert?

324
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,576
The water in Norbert's
bowl is still clear,

325
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,820
and you want to give his
name to a Jewish dog?

326
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,549
What's wrong with you?

327
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:08,959
Let me think of a new name.

328
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,642
How about Wilhelm,
it sounds good.

329
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,615
Greta, Frank, and
the Wilhelm Heinz.

330
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,824
I don't want this dog.

331
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,777
Either you return him
to where you got him,

332
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,829
or you take care of
him all by yourself.

333
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,894
[Kaleb yelping]
[soft somber music]

334
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,522
[Rachel and Joshua laughing]

335
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,815
[Greta] Frank, can you
hurry up, we're late.

336
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:04,981
Back in your place.

337
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,012
- [Frank] We'll return soon.
- What a dreadful dog.

338
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:11,998
I don't understand it.

339
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:15,041
He was so lively
at the Shermans'.

340
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,148
Perhaps he only likes Jews.

341
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:19,974
Let's go Frank.

342
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,704
[Frank] Look what I got for
you at the butcher.

343
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:25,836
Here you go boy,
it's all right. [chuckling]

344
00:22:26,476 --> 00:22:27,597
[Greta] Frank, let's go.

345
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:36,919
And whoever desires to
love life and see good days,

346
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,737
let him keep his
tongue from evil,

347
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,980
and his lips from
speaking deceit.

348
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:45,536
For the eyes of the Lord
are on the righteous.

349
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:49,860
[Kaleb panting]
[gentle whimsical music]

350
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,722
As Jesus said, "What
good is it for someone

351
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:08,951

355
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:32,846
Do you think that because
Jesus was so light of weight,

356
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,448
he was able to walk on water?

357
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,851
Not like me, where
there's my bowel.

You would've
drowned in a second.

[Frank] Well, the priest is a
good speaker, I think.

361
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:47,421
The priest was nice.

Boy, I can't imagine
why you returned.

You know how many times I've
thought of doing what you did?

373
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:56,290
My life is hell.

that's the way
I live out of hers.

376
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,032
I wasn't able to make much
of myself in this life.

That's okay, boy,
it'll be all right.

Careful.

381
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:31,557
Right there.

[woman] Where is he going?

396
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,008
He seems to know
his way around here.

397
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:38,628
Do you think it is possible
he used to live here?

398
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,749
Well, he does not live here now.

399

- Get out.

Can we take him home?

I don't really know.

up the good work with him,

00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,714
and I will promise
you a prime assignment

533
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:37,963
at the end of the course.

534
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:40,270
Thank you, sir,
thank you very much.

535
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:50,232
What an amazing
dog you are, Blitzie.

536
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:55,004
Even before I finish
teaching you something,

537
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:56,029
you already know it.

538
00:41:57,824 --> 00:41:59,457
Who was I up until now?

539
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:01,924
Just another trainer
in life, doggie.

540
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:06,183
But now, even Jurgen Klein
knows who I am.

541
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,590
Don't you worry, I haven't
forgotten for a moment

542
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:14,865
that at least half of
the achievement is yours.

543
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:18,740
- [group applauding]
- Ralph Gerstler.

544
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:22,872
On this day of September 13th,

545
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:25,884
Herr Ralph Gerstler has
completed the training course

546
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:27,068
to the satisfaction
of the Reich,

547
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,784
and becomes an official
trainer of the SS.

548
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:37,286
And to his dog, Blitz,
for his service as well.

549
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,130
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

550
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,821
[group laughing and applauding]

551
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,882
[train rattling]

552
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:01,343
All right.

553
00:43:22,772 --> 00:43:25,015
- Heil Hitler.
- [soldiers] Heil Hitler.

554
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,371
Things run beautifully
here at this work camp.

555
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:33,311
That means that each
person knows his job well,

556
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:36,866
so that all I have to do is
supervise from a distance.

557
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:38,981
At night I can sleep well,

558
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:41,735
because I have a good
staff that I can rely on.

559
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:46,636
I hope that all of you newcomers

560
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:49,519
will uphold the level
of our excellence.

561
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:55,349
Ralph, I want to talk
to you about something.

562
00:43:56,374 --> 00:43:59,705
Your dog against mine,
the stinking Ukrainians

563
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,467
would pay good money
to see a dog fight.

564
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,516
What do you say?

565
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:05,663
No, that's not what
I trained him for.

566
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:08,450
Blitz is not a dog
for dog fights,

567
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,076
and the money of the
Ukrainians doesn't interest me.

568
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:14,151
"The money of the Ukrainians
doesn't interest me."

569
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,330
Money interests all of us.

570
00:44:16,683 --> 00:44:19,308
Sometimes I think if we
compare the qualities of man

571
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:22,064
to the qualities of dogs,
the dogs would easily win.

572
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:23,953
What are you talking about?

573
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:26,933
We insist on making war even
after we sniffed each other.

574
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:29,623
We are not content with
pissing on someone's territory.

575
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:30,552
We have to conquer it.

576
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:33,531
But we don't crap in
the middle of the street.

577
00:44:33,563 --> 00:44:36,445
Ah yes, I guess for
that we can be admired.

578
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:47,721
Oh Blitzie, what would
I do here without you?

579
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,508
I swear you the most human
creature in this whole place.

580
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,601
[man speaking German over
loudspeaker]

581
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:58,901
[soldier] Out, out, hurry up.

582
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:00,117
[soldier 2] Come on,
keep moving.

583
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,334
[soldier] hurry up.

584
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,082
- Out. Silence.
- [whistle blasting]

585
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:07,293
[soft somber music]

586
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,713
You will be divided
into groups for work.

587
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,525
All males go to the right,
women to the left.

588
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:18,057
[crowd chattering]

589
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:20,907
[soldier] Women will be sent
a nearby work camp.

590
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,700
If you want to see
something, just let me know.

591
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:24,493
Don't dislocate
my shoulder, just ask.

592
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,940
- [child] Mommy, no, Mommy.
- [soldier] Let go, let go.

593
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:32,085
[soft tense music]
[whistles blaring]

594
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:44,867
[Ralph]
What's the matter, Blitz?

595
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:51,690
[Kaleb barking]
[soft somber music]

596
00:45:59,953 --> 00:46:03,222
[soldiers chattering]
[dogs barking]

597
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:06,519
[Joshua crying]

598
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,090
[soft somber music]

599
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:24,170
[man] Out of the depth, have
I cried onto thee, oh Lord,

600
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:27,084
I cried upon the
Lord in distress.

601
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:31,761
Rise up Lord and let thine
enemies be scattered.

602
00:46:31,793 --> 00:46:34,612
- So much praying.
- Let the man be.

603
00:46:36,406 --> 00:46:38,713
- Amen.
- Amen, Amen.

604
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:41,370
[man]
Look what I have fit in here.

605
00:46:47,777 --> 00:46:52,678
See, my beautiful wife and
my son and my daughter,

606
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:54,824
all of them gone.

607
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,348
[crying]

608
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:12,986
There is a guard who has a dog

609
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:16,638
who looks just like
the dog I used to have.

610
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:18,208
Go to sleep.

611
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,034
[Joshua]
When I look at that dog,

612
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:24,582
I remember when we
were all together,

613
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,259
my mother and father and sister.

614
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:34,064
One day, they came and
pulled us out of our house,

615
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:37,428
and they put us in
different trucks,

616
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:40,118
and I never saw them again.

617
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:44,762
Do you know how I can find them?

618
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:47,517
Try to fall asleep if you can.

619
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:58,055
[soldiers chattering in German]

620
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:10,387
What are you looking at,
you little filthy Jewish boy?

621
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,373
I wasn't looking at anything.

622
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:14,552
- Your liar.
- [Joshua choking]

623
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:18,427
[Kaleb barking]
[soldier shouting]

624
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:24,065
Your dog attacked me,
I will kill him.

625
00:48:24,097 --> 00:48:25,380
- [Joshua] No!
- No, no, please.

626
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:27,429
Blitz is one of the
best-trained dogs in the camp.

627
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:30,567
Please Dr. Schneider, I really
don't know what happened.

628
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,138
I will shoot this
dog through the head.

629
00:48:33,515 --> 00:48:35,372
Get back to work, all of you!

630
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:39,345
[soldiers shouting in German]

631
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,092
If you shoot the dog,
you will have to kill me too.

632
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:49,243
[soldiers shouting in German]

633
00:49:01,928 --> 00:49:02,729
Come.

634
00:49:06,636 --> 00:49:08,687
That bastard
almost broke your neck.

635
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:11,921
These people are animals.

636
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:16,789
[praying in Hebrew]

637
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:18,615
Why do you pray so much?

638
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:22,108
If there were a God,

639
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:24,030
he would not let this
be happening to us.

640
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:27,393
No one is listening to you.

641
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:32,582
The important thing is,
that I can hear the prayer.

642
00:49:34,215 --> 00:49:36,491
[speaking Hebrew]

643
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:44,754
[soldiers speaking German]

644
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:56,767
[soldier] Come here.

645
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,181
My dog has obviously taken
some kind of interest in you.

646
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:16,241
- What is your dog's name?
- [Ralph] Blitz.

647
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:19,894
May I pet him?

648
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,142
I'd rather that you didn't.

649
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:26,204
You see, he probably needs
the company of a child.

650
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:29,151
I used to have a dog like this.

651
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:31,937
Oh really, what was his name?

652
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,052
Kaleb.

653
00:50:35,013 --> 00:50:36,871
[Ralph] So you had a
dog and you like animals.

654
00:50:37,543 --> 00:50:38,665
Very much.

655
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:43,501
Follow me. [speaking German]

656
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:50,357
Perhaps you would like to work

657
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:52,279
feeding and cleaning
the animals' cages.

658
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:54,456
Your small size would
be good for that.

659
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,690
I would like that very much.

660
00:50:57,723 --> 00:50:58,877
Then I will arrange for it.

661
00:51:02,881 --> 00:51:04,739
[bird cawing]

662
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:08,870
[pigs snorting]

663
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:12,362
This is for the animals only.

664
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,884
He really does seem to like you.

665
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:32,349
Yes.

666
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,689
[Ralph] The bread crumbs are for
the chickens and ducks.

667
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:36,419
The peas and vegetables
for the pigs.

668
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:42,504
If you eat or steal one crumb
of food, you will be shot.

669
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:45,259
Do you understand that?

670
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,839
- Yes.
- Fine, then begin.

671
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:59,513
[soft poignant music]

672
00:52:08,034 --> 00:52:12,294
- It's you Kaleb, isn't it?
- [Kaleb whimpering]

673
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:18,861
Isn't it?

674
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,510
[fence sparking]

675
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,001
You can trust that boy?

676
00:52:31,321 --> 00:52:34,396
Yes, of course, but what
difference does it make?

677
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:37,630
He'll eventually wind up in
a pit with everyone else.

678
00:52:37,663 --> 00:52:39,616
[soldier] Well, I'm quite
impressed with your dog.

679
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:41,635
[Ralph] He's the
most intelligent dog

680
00:52:41,668 --> 00:52:43,909
that I've come across
in my entire life,

681
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:44,807
he understands everything.

682
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,284
So what do you intend to
do after the war is over?

683
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,761
I'd like to study engineering,
or religious studies.

684
00:52:57,235 --> 00:52:58,997
You don't want to
continue training animals?

685
00:53:00,726 --> 00:53:03,033
- Perhaps.
- All right.

686
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:06,684
Sorry to cut short
our little stroll,

687
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:07,966
but tomorrow is a busy day.

688
00:53:09,278 --> 00:53:10,753
We have a new train
load coming in.

689
00:53:25,007 --> 00:53:28,242
No, no, no. [crying]

690
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:31,092
- It's all right, Mr. Glavsky.
- [man] Wake up, wake up.

691
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,366
- [Joshua] It's all right.
- Wake up.

692
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:36,827
- [Joshua] Mr. Glavsky.
- Close your eyes.

693
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:44,194
I can't stop.

694
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:49,736
That day, I was a
priest in a small church

695
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:51,241
near the mountains.

696
00:53:52,715 --> 00:53:54,861
I spoke out against the
cruelty of this regime.

697
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,223
Some people from my
parish supported me,

698
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:02,484
and the soldiers
came and shot them,

699
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:05,143
right in front of my eyes.

700
00:54:07,897 --> 00:54:11,197
I wish they would
have shot me instead.

701
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:16,707
How much longer
can we survive this?

702
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:22,504
If we use everything we
know, all of us together,

703
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,227
we can escape from here.

704
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:28,110
How do you intend to get
past the electrified fence?

705
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:30,927
And how will you escape the
Ukrainians and the dogs?

706
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:38,809
[ducks quacking]

707
00:54:39,097 --> 00:54:43,005
Hello, Rivka, how are you today?

708
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:46,497
- [pigs grunting]
- Eat something, Shlomo.

709
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:48,675
You look too thin.

710
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:53,672
[gate squeaking]

711
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,270
There, Kaleb.

[Joshua grunting]

713
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:44,570
- Did you bring us any food?
- I can't.

714
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:47,517
They're watching me to make
sure I don't steal anything.

715
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:50,336
At night, we come there
and help you get some of it.

716
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,098
No, it is too dangerous.

717
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,860
Starving to death is dangerous.

718
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:59,561
[geese honking]

719
00:55:59,593 --> 00:56:02,380

[chickens clucking]

722
00:56:40,114 --> 00:56:41,619
Don't forget the small packages.

723
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:44,470
I won't forget, everything
will arrive on time.

724
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:53,535
That's all? Is that all?

725

[speaking Hebrew]

727
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:17,720
It's just a few breadcrumbs.

728
00:57:18,392 --> 00:57:20,153
It doesn't require
two blessings.

729
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:30,917
[rain pattering] [dogs barking]

730
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,800
Tell the dogs good night.

731
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:39,853
- Was it delicious then?
- Yes.

732
00:57:39,885 --> 00:57:42,512
[gate squeaking]

733
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,559
[Ralph] What is he doing?

734
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,403
Uh, that's his way of
telling me he wants more.

735
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:54,684
Well, he can't eat it all.

736
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:56,158
He has to give some
to the other dogs.

737
00:57:56,638 --> 00:57:57,951
Put him on a leash
and bring him to me.

738
00:57:58,624 --> 00:57:59,394
[Joshua] Yes sir.

739
00:58:00,098 --> 00:58:01,731
The boy knows what
would happen to him

740
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:03,781
if he would so much has touch
this food for himself, right?

741
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,383
Oh, yes.

742
00:58:09,162 --> 00:58:10,988

[dog barking]

750
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:54,296
What do we have here?

751
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:04,546
And this accidentally
fell into your pocket.

752
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,365
I told you what would
happen if you were caught

753
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:10,152
stealing food from
the animals, didn't I?

754
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:14,124
[tense uneasy music]
[Joshua panting]

755
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,487
Shame on you.

756
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:24,630
Before you kill me, there's
one thing you should know.

757
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:28,890
All this time that I took care
of Blitz, as you call him,

758
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,215
I was not taking care
of your dog, but my dog.

759
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:36,002
His name is Kaleb.

760
00:59:37,218 --> 00:59:38,948
What are you talking about?

761
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:43,690
He was born on a Tuesday
at 11:30 in the morning,

762
00:59:43,721 --> 00:59:46,444
and has three
brothers and sisters.

763
00:59:46,476 --> 00:59:49,391
So you see, Herr Gerstler,
your beloved Blitz

764
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:52,818
is really a Jewish dog.

765
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:57,879
That's most unfortunate
news, turn around.

766
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:04,574
[fist thudding] [dogs barking]

767
01:00:04,606 --> 01:00:06,399

Kaleb, come.

01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:29,079
Kaleb, come with me now, Kaleb.

776
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:30,936
- Kaleb, no.
- [sirens blaring]

777
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:32,666
No, no, Kaleb, Kaleb.

778
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,165
Kaleb come, come, come here.

779
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:36,638

[gasping] It hurts.

792
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:20,037
Oh my God.

793
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:22,888
You were hit.

794
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:26,252
[speaking Hebrew]

795
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,936
I think the bullet
might still be in you.

796
01:02:30,576 --> 01:02:32,819
If I had a knife, maybe
I could get it out,

797
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:34,933
but this wound has
to be disinfected.

798
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:38,295
Should I go get something?

799
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:41,531
The forest is crawling
with Germans and their dogs.

800
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:45,055
We'll wait until the sun rises.

801
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,884
It's your job to
guard us now, Kaleb,

802
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,018
with your good ears,
to make sure no one

803
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:56,075
is coming close to us.

804
01:02:58,925 --> 01:02:59,950
Am I going to die?

805
01:03:00,975 --> 01:03:01,904
[man] Try to lie still.

806
01:03:06,484 --> 01:03:07,380
I've been a good man.

807
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:10,167
Yes, you have.

808
01:03:11,897 --> 01:03:14,043
Maybe now I can see
my Getel in heaven.

809
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,573
My dear friend.

810
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:22,917
I'm grateful that
I will die a free man,

811
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:27,529
here in God's beautiful forest,

812
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:32,878
and not in that den of iniquity.

[leaves crunching]

814
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:59,785
Our fellow prisoners will
never even have a burial.

815
01:04:02,764 --> 01:04:03,789
Come, let's go.

816
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,270
I think Mr. Neuman would like it

817
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:14,616
if we say a prayer for him.

818
01:04:31,177 --> 01:04:35,628

[tense uneasy music]

820
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,447
Where are we going?

821
01:04:52,478 --> 01:04:56,130
We have to keep moving south,
maybe towards Yugoslavia.

822
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:58,949
And according to where the
sun is rising and setting,

823
01:04:58,981 --> 01:04:59,589
we are going south.

824
01:05:01,127 --> 01:05:03,336
But we must find food and water.

825
01:05:04,426 --> 01:05:07,084
[tense uneasy music]

826
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:26,016
[Joshua] What is it, Kaleb?
[gasping]

827
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:30,243
[man] Go down there.

828
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:31,686
You are small, it will
be easier for you.

829
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:34,952
I will watch you from here, go.

830
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,270
[soft tense music]

831
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:44,210

[rooster crowing]

838
01:06:51,414 --> 01:06:54,360
In case you are hungry.

839
01:06:59,037 --> 01:07:00,573
Let's go get it.

840
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:02,144
No, no, it could be an ambush.

841
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:12,362
Let's go.

842
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:38,372
Don't worry,
we will do you no harm.

843
01:07:40,294 --> 01:07:41,894
- Are you lost?
- [man] No.

844
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:48,174
My son and I, we, our
home was destroyed and my,

845
01:07:48,558 --> 01:07:49,839
my wife didn't make it.

846
01:07:50,128 --> 01:07:50,929
[man] I'm sorry to hear that.

847
01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:53,940
Beautiful dog.

848
01:07:54,996 --> 01:07:55,798
Thank you.

849
01:07:58,425 --> 01:07:59,224
Come on in.

850
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,692
- Come.
- Just come.

851
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:07,169
- It will be warm inside.
- Yeah, it'll be all right.

852
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:33,755
We can allow you to sleep
here, but only for one night.

853
01:08:35,261 --> 01:08:37,791
It's very dangerous these days,

854
01:08:37,824 --> 01:08:39,105
if you understand
what I'm saying.

855
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,621
And you would have
to sleep in the barn.

856
01:08:45,608 --> 01:08:47,208
That would be fine.

857
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,522
We very much appreciate it.

858
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,462
- Just one night.
- Yes.

Joshua, you and
Kaleb crawl under here now.

01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,912
No, no, we can't go without you.

864
01:09:19,946 --> 01:09:21,932
Now, right now,
before it's too late.

865
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:25,135
And remember to watch where
the sun rises and sets,

866
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,865
and keep running to the south.

867
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:27,922

It's just us now.

877
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:43,902
Do you think Mama
and Papa and Rachel

878
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,536
could also be somewhere
in the forest?

879
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:49,603
What would I do
without you, Kaleb?

880
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,324
I don't want that you
just listen to me,

881
01:10:57,355 --> 01:10:58,795
and never tell me your thoughts.

882
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,612
I will try to understand
your thoughts.

883
01:11:13,339 --> 01:11:15,837
[soft uneasy music]

884
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,088
Blitz will be your name.

885
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:41,335
[rain pattering]

886
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:43,161
[Joshua shouting]

887
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:51,842
[bells tolling in distance]

888
01:12:06,352 --> 01:12:07,505
[Joshua] It must be Palm Sunday.

889
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:11,285
I remember the people
across the way

890
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:13,015
used to carry these flowers.

891
01:12:19,229 --> 01:12:24,963
So that must mean
it's Passover too.

892
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:48,089
Papa.

893
01:12:58,949 --> 01:12:59,557
Mama.

894
01:13:08,142 --> 01:13:08,942
Rachel.

895
01:13:13,074 --> 01:13:16,246
Our guests, that you
always have at Seder...

896
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,140
and me.

897
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:31,878
[leaves rustling]

898
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:45,651
[Joshua singing in Hebrew]

899
01:13:58,304 --> 01:14:00,674
When we dip this
in the salt water,

900
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:06,600
it will remind us of the tears
that the Jewish people shed

901
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:08,298
when they were in
the land of Egypt.

902
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,184
[wolf howling in distance]

903
01:14:15,889 --> 01:14:17,748
Remember when you
were a little puppy,

904
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:20,341
and you found the afikomen?

905
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,146
Well, actually we...

906
01:14:27,389 --> 01:14:29,342
I cheated,

907
01:14:31,873 --> 01:14:33,795
because I put the smell
of meat on the matzah.

908
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:40,042
Sometimes I worry
that you miss Ralph.

909
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:45,903
It's hard for you to
understand who he really was.

910
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:50,740
He loved you and
really cared for you.

911
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,001
But I love you too.

912
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:12,106
[Kaleb panting]

913
01:15:19,793 --> 01:15:22,420
[bomb exploding]

914
01:15:24,502 --> 01:15:27,129
[soft tense music]

915
01:15:42,023 --> 01:15:44,682
[Kaleb sniffing]

916
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:52,498
[soft tense music continues]

917
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:57,014
[birds calling]

918
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,684
Don't move, who are you?

919
01:16:04,029 --> 01:16:05,023
Joshua.

920
01:16:07,457 --> 01:16:10,147
My name is Sasha Petrovich.

921
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,262
- Did Kaleb bring you?
- [Sasha] Who's Kaleb?

922
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,913
- My dog.
- No.

923
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,899
Kaleb?

924
01:16:17,931 --> 01:16:20,814
We can't take on the
responsibility of a child,

925
01:16:20,846 --> 01:16:21,872
and an injured one.

926
01:16:23,729 --> 01:16:26,740
We are Yugoslavian partisans,
you are safe with us.

927
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:28,662
We will protect you.

928
01:16:28,694 --> 01:16:30,072
We can't have a child with us.

929
01:16:31,705 --> 01:16:33,787
He's no longer a child
with what he's gone through.

930
01:16:35,165 --> 01:16:36,349
Pick him up and
take him with us.

931
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,072
I... I can't go without Kaleb.

932
01:16:39,105 --> 01:16:41,636
The most important
thing is your own life.

933
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:42,468
Pick him up.

934
01:16:43,494 --> 01:16:47,113
[Joshua crying]
[partisans chattering]

935
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:50,028
[somber music]

936
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:54,064
[Kaleb yelping, barking]

937
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:58,708
Trees and darkness at night
are your most loyal allies.

938
01:16:59,733 --> 01:17:01,303
The winter is your friend,

939
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:04,025
since the days are short
and the nights long.

940
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:06,012
Do you understand
everything I'm saying?

941
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:09,791
Otherwise,
you will never get out.

942
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:12,674
Always let your enemy
have the illusion

943
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:14,148
that he is chasing you.

944
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:19,336
Your real power lies in
the element of surprise.

945
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:22,315
- That's what Kaleb does.
- [Sasha] Kaleb?

946
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:24,430
My dog.

947
01:17:24,462 --> 01:17:26,063
Oh yes, you must
forget about this dog.

948
01:17:29,075 --> 01:17:31,349
Whatever you do,
don't actually shoot a gun.

949
01:17:31,989 --> 01:17:33,110
It will make too much noise.

950
01:17:34,872 --> 01:17:35,801
It's a fine gun, isn't it?

951
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,805
I don't really like guns.

952
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:41,599
These days, it will
be your best friend.

953
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:43,810
Kaleb is my best friend.

954
01:17:45,956 --> 01:17:47,397
It's quite beautifully made.

955
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:51,529
I took it myself from
the shoulder of a Nazi.

956
01:17:54,924 --> 01:17:55,853
Aim at the bottles.

957
01:17:58,064 --> 01:18:00,082
[gun blasting] [Kaleb whining]

958
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,951
I told you not to shoot the gun.

959
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:06,744
[tense music]

960
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:10,652
- You want Germans here?
- It was an accident.

961
01:18:10,684 --> 01:18:11,934
There's no room
for accidents here.

962
01:18:14,207 --> 01:18:15,328
- It was my fault.
- [leaves rustling]

963
01:18:15,361 --> 01:18:16,643
- Shh.
- She told me not to...

964
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:17,732
You see what you have done?

965
01:18:17,764 --> 01:18:19,109
[Joshua] No, no!

966
01:18:20,293 --> 01:18:22,984
Kaleb, no, don't shoot,
don't shoot.

967
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:27,020
- It's Kaleb. Kaleb.
- [Kaleb whining]

968
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:30,576
I knew you would find me.

969
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:38,681
We will divide
into three squads.

970
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:40,217
The first squad
will put an ambush

971
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,531
on the road to the village.

972
01:18:42,139 --> 01:18:43,260
The second will go into a house

973
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,440
to take the food and
clothing we need.

974
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,008
The third group will attack

975
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,444
the German soldiers
patrolling the area.

976
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:50,820
Any questions from anyone?

977
01:18:52,742 --> 01:18:53,543
Yes, Joshua?

978
01:18:55,114 --> 01:18:56,940
Am I going on
this assignment too?

979
01:18:58,732 --> 01:19:02,127
Perhaps, I'm not sure yet.

980
01:19:03,858 --> 01:19:06,452
[rooster crowing]
[tense uneasy music]

981
01:19:20,162 --> 01:19:21,956
Hello, is someone there?

982
01:19:22,372 --> 01:19:24,935
- Hello?
- [man] Come in.

983
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,437
Oh, no no, no.

984
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,295
No, don't hurt us.

985
01:19:34,031 --> 01:19:36,786
Oh my God, please, no.

986
01:19:38,004 --> 01:19:41,847
No, no, no, not the
animals, please.

987
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:45,980
- They keep us alive.
- [tense uneasy music]

988
01:19:54,403 --> 01:19:57,383

[partisans speaking
in foreign language]

992
01:20:34,957 --> 01:20:38,351
Joshua, you helped
us a lot today.

993
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:40,498
Thank you.

994
01:20:41,523 --> 01:20:45,975
But you cannot stay with us,
it's too difficult.

995
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,347
It's too dangerous
for us and for you.

996
01:20:48,378 --> 01:20:50,300
But where can I go?

997
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:53,823
We managed to borrow some
money from the farmers today,

998
01:20:53,855 --> 01:20:55,937
and we'll buy you a
passage to Palestine.

999
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:01,351
- Palestine?
- You will be safe there.

1000
01:21:04,747 --> 01:21:06,219
Please, let me stay with you.

1001
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:12,145
[insects chirping]

1002
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,580
Here's for the boy's passage,

1003
01:21:23,613 --> 01:21:24,863
and I've also
brought you the dog.

1004
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,180
Be brave little man,
you will have a better life.

1005
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:32,711
Come, we must hurry.

1006
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,041
You cannot take
the dog with you.

1007
01:21:36,073 --> 01:21:37,163
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1008
01:21:37,194 --> 01:21:38,540
Kaleb is coming with me.

1009
01:21:38,573 --> 01:21:40,334
We have no room for a dog.

1010
01:21:40,366 --> 01:21:42,735
He's part of the payment for
your passage, he's mine now.

1011
01:21:42,768 --> 01:21:44,915
No, Kaleb is coming with me.

1012
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,894
We are letting you go
because you are a child

1013
01:21:47,926 --> 01:21:49,591
and you are alone.

1014
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:54,235
This is why I have Kaleb,
so I don't have to be alone.

1015
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:55,645
He's staying here.

1016
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:57,504
No Kaleb, Kaleb.

1017
01:21:58,175 --> 01:22:02,820
- Kaleb, no, Kaleb!
- [Kaleb barking]

1018

Kaleb, Kaleb, come,
come, Kaleb, Kaleb.

1019
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:13,135
- No, no, Kaleb, Kaleb.
- Sit down, quiet.

1020
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:15,089
- Calm down.
- Kaleb.

Calm down, it'll be okay.

Dog! Hey dog, come here.

1029
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:56,282
Kaleb. No, no, no, go back.

1030
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:58,877
We have to rescue him,
he'll drown.

1031
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:01,183
- Please help, stop the boat.
- [man] Sit down.

1032
01:23:01,215 --> 01:23:03,778
Turn, turn the
boat around, please.

- [Joshua] Kaleb, go back.

Kaleb! [coughing]

1036
01:23:20,947 --> 01:23:23,636
Let's turn the boat around.
Let's turn, turn it.

1037
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:30,876
Kaleb, Kaleb.

1038

[music continues]

1040

[Joshua] Are we all that's
left of our family?

1045
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:31,225
What kind of life will we have?

1046
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:38,208
Thank you for keeping me warm.
