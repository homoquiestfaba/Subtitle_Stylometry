00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,120
for science and technology.

179
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,856
- Congratulations.
- Well, it's important, right?

180
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,192
But obviously not as
important as this.

181
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:09,396
Tell me something that grows
at a 2,300% annual growth rate.

182
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:12,032
Outside of petri
dishes, nothing.

183
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,369
Forget about it, keep
reading. Right there.

184
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,238
That's a month's
work, right there.

185
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,173
Jeff, if you don't
shut the fuck up

186
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,908
it's gonna take me
a month to read it.

187
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,077
Forget about it. Let
me bottom line it.

188
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:26,514
- Books.
- Books? That's your idea?

189
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:27,848
It's tomorrow's best idea.

190
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,551
The one you've been looking for.

191
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:32,086
Jeff, I haven't been
looking for books. In fact,

192
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,355
I don't even know what the
fuck you're talking about.

193
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,691
- Have you gotten any sleep?
- Let me explain it to you.

194
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,860
See, millions of copies of
books are published every year

195
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,363
and... and millions
more internationally,

196
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,933
but a physical store can only
carry several thousand books.

197
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,669
Well, that's true
of any retailer.

198
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,169
Right, take Barnes & Noble.

199
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,006
$1.6 billion a year in sales.

200
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,776
But any physical
Barnes & Noble store

201
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,078
only has thousands of copies.

202
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:02,383
Now, add several of
Barnes & Noble stores,

203
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,451
and you still have
thousands of copies.

204
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,121
But there's potentially
millions of copies

205
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,591
that could be sold, but
not in a physical store.

206
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,728
Now, imagine a virtual store

207
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:19,768
that was open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week,

208
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:24,639
and could carry an
infinite amount of books,

209
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,874
potentially every book
that ever existed.

210
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,076
Jeff, do me a favor.

211
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,078
Go wash up, shave,

212
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,647
and that sleeping
bag that you have?

213
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,481
Go take a little nap.

214
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,151
And I want you to meet me in
the park in an hour, okay?

215
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,919
[sighs]

216
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,829
[door closes]

217
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,767
[tranquil music
playing, birds chirping]

218
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,937
[bike bell ringing]

219
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,107
- You clean up nice.
- Thanks, David.

220
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,812
You know, it's a great
idea with a good plan.

221
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm so relieved
you... You liked it.

222
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,451
I mean, with 76...

223
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,520
Take a look at that
guy over there.

224
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,457
Now take a look at that guy.

225
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,028
Which one do you
think's happier?

226
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,643
- The one with the hotdog.
- Why do you say that?

227
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,836
He's living for the moment.

228
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,638
Does that mean that the
other guy's miserable? Right?

229
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,973
Maybe. Yeah.

230
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,976
Let's jump ahead
20 years to 2014.

231
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,878
Who do you think's
gonna be happier,

232
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,314
the guy eating hotdogs that
didn't plan for his future

233
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,216
or the guy who
worked his ass off

234
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,151
to get where he wanted to go?

235
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,121
People always make
the same mistake.

236
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,456
They focus on short-term
goals instead of planning

237
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,959
for the future, instead
of planning for the future

238
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,696
and using a short-term
strategy to execute it.

239
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,998
You're the youngest
vice president

240
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,467
of the fastest growing
hedge fund in America.

241
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,737
You make a six-figure salary.

242
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:05,673
Your coworkers respect you,

243
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,409
and you want to throw all of
that away to, what, sell books?

244
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:10,887
I thought you liked
the idea, David.

245
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,312
I do like the idea.

246
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,214
I actually think
it's a great idea,

247
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,417
but it's not for me,

248
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,186
and I definitely don't
think it's for you.

249
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:22,389
Jeff, you're brilliant
and you're ambitious

250
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:24,358
and I love that about you,

251
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,196
but, ultimately, you have
to think bigger, okay?

252
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,566
You have a career to grow,
and you have places to go

253
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,200
and you have a family
to take care of

254
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,769
and your wife wants
to move your...

255
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,370
Your whole family forward.

256
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,406
But I don't think that's
gonna happen with your plan.

257
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,913
Okay? Let's head out.

258
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,694
<i>WOMAN ON TV: Well, what
Alisson should know...</i>

259
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,554
<i>MAN ON TV: What is
internet, anyway?</i>

260
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,691
<i>WOMAN: Internet is that
massive computer network.</i>

261
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,893
<i>Starting your own business
is one of the most</i>

262
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,961
<i>challenging things you can do.</i>

263
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,197
<i>The risk often
outweighs the rewards,</i>

264
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,733
<i>but I'm telling you, if
you know what you're doing</i>

265
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,434
<i>and you got nothing to lose,</i>

266
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,537
<i>then why not, right?</i>

267
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:12,039
<i>That's because fear... fear
is what runs the human heart.</i>

268

269
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,219

guts to face what's ahead...</i>

270
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,781

- A little while ago.

271

<i>LEONARD: I didn't have two
pennies to rub together.</i>

272

273
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,587
<i>I'll tell you why.
When I was a kid,</i>

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,454
<i>I used to caddy at
this country club.</i>

275

276
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,095
Brought some take
out. You hungry?

277
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,502
Those biscuits will
ruin your dinner.

278
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,943
- What'd you get?
- Chinese.

[chair scraping]

280
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:12,834
So... you gonna tell me why
you left work early today?

281
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,038
No reason.

282
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,875
Oh, come on, I know you
had your pitch with David

283
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,310
and look at you, you're
wallowing in self-pity.

284
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,145
No, I'm not.

285
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,681
Jeff, you're a terrible liar.

286
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,151
He's not interested, okay?

287
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,721
Well, why not?

288
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:35,188
He said it was a great idea,

289
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,057
just not for the
company or for me.

290
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,727
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

291
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,362
It means I shouldn't be
taking risks like this.

292
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,166
And he asked me, would I risk
everything for this idea?

293
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,902
And, honestly, I wouldn't.

294
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,505
Well, why wouldn't
you risk it all?

295
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,409
I don't think the risk
is worth the opportunity.

296
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:00,180
I have a steady career,
we have a family.

297
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,817
What if we wanna
have kids one day?

298
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,852
I can't be living with
this kind of risk.

299
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,589
Whoa, whoa, hold
up there, cowboy.

300
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:12,860
Listen, if we wanna have kids,

301
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,862
we'll discuss that
in the future.

302
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,731
Later on down the line.

303
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,535
As for your job, you
can get another one.

304
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,538
You're Jeff Bezos,

305
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,708
the youngest VP in the
history of D.E. Shaw.

306
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,776
You really think this
is your only opportunity

307
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,210
for a good job in the future?

308
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,614
Hell no!

310
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,552
you're going to
be incredible at.

311
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,454
I know it.

312
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,224
And if this is something
that you wanna do,

313
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,094
then I believe in you.

314
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,797
And you need to
believe in yourself,

315
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,767
'cause you're not just someone
who takes unnecessary risks,

316
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,269
you're someone who... who
looks at the possibilities,

317
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,072
runs the numbers,

318
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,158
and then takes the chances
that are worth taking!

319
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,748
You said to think about
the future, right?

320
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:12,219
Is D.E. Shaw really
what you envision

321
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,055
for the rest of your life?

[pensive music playing]

323

Regret... minimization.

00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,947
What?

325
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,951
Regret minimization framework.

326
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,353
I need to minimize
the amount of regrets

327
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,789
that I'm gonna have by age 80.

328
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,291
Okay, that's... That's
one way to look at it.

329
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,963
See, I'm not gonna regret being
a part of this Internet thing,

330
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,433
but I will regret not trying,
and if it fails, who cares?

331
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,637
I'm not living my
life in regret.

332
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,806
So, you're gonna go for it?

333
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,206
Yeah, we're going for it!

334
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:10,111
All right, Internet man!
So, what's our next move?

335
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,612
We're quitting our jobs.

[chuckles softly]
I'm sorry. We?

337
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,486
Yeah. I'm not doing
this without you.

338
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,891
And we're not starting
a business venture here.

339
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:27,862
- I need you.
- But... But...

340
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,362
We can do this.

341
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,734
It's gonna be okay.

342
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,504
We have savings, we're
gonna be together.

343
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:39,707
You can have time to write.

344
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,214
It's gonna work out.

345
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:50,852
- Okay. Okay, I'm in.
- Okay? Doing it?

346
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,385
- We're doing it.
- We're doing it!

- I'm so excited for us.

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,595
This is gonna work.

349
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,231
- I'm scared, but I'm excited.
- I'm scared, too!

350
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,599
[chuckles]

351
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,067
Zander.

352
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,835
Hey, it's Jeff Bezos.

353
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:13,373
Yeah, MacKenzie's great.
I'm starting a new business.

354
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,710
We're gonna sell
on the Internet.

355
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:17,912
Yeah, Warren, Internet.

356
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,915
I-N-T-E-R-N-E-T.

357
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,019
Yeah. You have a modem, right?

358
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,190
Yeah, you're gonna
go online and buy.

359
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,559
You know how you said
if I ever had a big idea

360
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:33,895
to call you and...
and, um... This is it.

361
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,063
We're starting a website.

362
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,398
Website.

363
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,735
Yeah, Nancy. Okay.

364
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,472
Hmm. We don't have
a name for it yet.

365
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:46,908
Valuation?

366
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,244
A million dollars?

367
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,247
Yeah, Bill, the valuation
isn't determined yet.

368
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,083
We don't know what the
profit margins are gonna be.

369
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:58,953
No. I'm working on
the business plan.

370
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,956
No, I've never started
a business before.

371
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,992
That's the point,
it's called a startup.

372
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,095
How about instead of saying
it's a startup business,

373
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:13,634
why don't you tell them it's
an investment opportunity?

374
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:16,804
If you just invest $50,000...

375
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:21,441
Yeah. Listen, David.
It's going to be big.

376
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,910
We're still working on the plan,

377
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,330
but... but we'd
love to invite you

378
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,780
to be one of the
first investors.

379
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:27,849
What do you mean I'd
make a terrible CEO?

380
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,418
[tense music playing]

381
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,290
MACKENZIE: How much is it?

382
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,960
$50,000.

383
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,630
Can't even start a
business with that.

384
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,198
No, that can't be,

385
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,033
we must've called
over 60 people today.

386
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,702
And half of them said no.

387
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:51,539
Maybe we can get a loan?

388
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,343
No bank is gonna lend us
money. We're a startup.

389
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,012
What do we do, then?

390
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,648
I don't know.

391
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:08,990
[electronic beeping]

392
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:11,559
[gentle music playing]

393
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,129
Let's go.

394
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,497
[birds chirping]

395
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,070
- You sure about this?
- It's our only option.

396
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:25,706
But it's up to you.

397
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,043
All right.

398
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:39,387
There you are! Oh!

399
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,357
- Hey, Mom.
- You made it!

400
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,026
Why didn't you give
us some warning?

401
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,194
I... I would've rolled
out the red carpet.

402
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,863
You know me,
spontaneous to a fault.

403
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:50,564
[chuckles] Did you hear that?

404
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:53,701
He's about as spontaneous
as a stopwatch.

405
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,238
Oh, you look exhausted.
Well, come on in, come in.

406
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,042
- Oh, Mike, they're here!
- Oh, my God!

407
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,377
That's my boy. Oh, welcome!

408
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:07,682
So good to see you!
You look great!

409
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:09,342
So happy you guys
made it, look at this!

410
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,685
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome.

411
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,145
This is so great
you guys are here!

412
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:14,088
Feels so good when you're here,

413
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,199
thank you so much, you guys,
for coming. Gonna be great.

414
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,591
Okay, I've gotta ask,

415
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,060
is he still totally unorganized?

416
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,228
- Mom!
- Yes.

417
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,764
You know, when he was a kid,
he used to be just like that.

418
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,733
He had so many inventions,
remember, Mike,

419
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,369
up in his room that we finally
had to turn over the garage

420
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,072
- to make it your workshop!
- Thanks, Mom.

421
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,050
Oh, Mike, would you take the
luggage? Take their luggage.

422
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:35,076
We're gonna have a good
time, we're so happy.

423
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,553
- Thank you. All right.
- Thank you.

424
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,112
So...

425
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:39,613
[MacKenzie laughing softly]

426
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:44,418
- Oh, my gosh, is that you?
- JEFF: It's me.

427
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,153
MACKENZIE: That is
such a cute photo.

428
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,090
MIKE: A lot of memories, eh?

429
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:51,292
Ah! We're so happy
you guys are here.

430
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:53,260
- Let's sit, sit, come on.
- Let's go.

431
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:58,966
So, is it happening? Are
we gonna be grandparents?

432
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,434
[MacKenzie laughs]

433
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,436
- No.
- No.

434
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,472
- JACKLYN: Oh!
- Not yet.

435
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,607
This is a great time
for you, you are so busy

436
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:08,618
and you're doing so many
great things, it's better

437
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,778
to keep working now, have
the kid when you're ready.

438
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,146
How's work?

439
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:17,485
Actually... we quit our jobs.

440
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:20,287
- You quit?
- Yeah.

441
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:21,689
Both of you guys?

442
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,657
- Yep.
- Yep.

443
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:26,427
Did you have a fight with David?

444
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,462
No, things are fine
with David, you know,

445
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,469
I think he's one of the
smartest people I know,

446
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,867
and somebody that uses
both sides of his brain.

447
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,936
But, um, just, an
opportunity came up

448
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:37,605
that we just couldn't pass up.

449
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,640
So, you got another offer?

450
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,476
No, Mom, um...

451
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,680
We're actually starting
a business online.

452
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:48,482
On the Internet.
Selling books.

453
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,818
The Internet?

454
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,921
So, the Internet, it's a
vast network of computers

455
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:57,358
that communicate with each
other and transfer information,

456
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:01,195
so why couldn't this network
be used to conduct commerce?

457
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:05,399
And we've identified
the potential

458
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:09,670
of selling books through
the Internet as a business.

459
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,238
Well, why would you
want to do that?

460
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,973
Why wouldn't you
just go to the store?

461
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:16,043
A physical store can
never have every book

462
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,978
that ever existed.

463
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,681
And our virtual store could
potentially have every book

464
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,517
and we'll just ship it to you.

465
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,752
Mm-hmm.

466
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:28,055
And plus, the internet's
growing at 2,300% a year.

467
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,157
Well, how do you know that?

468
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:33,060
Well, we've found
several analyst reports

469
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,162
and we've been identifying
other businesses

470
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,832
that... that have seen that
kind of growth and we believe

471
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,733
we can achieve
that selling books.

472
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:43,104
I don't know, guys, I think
this seems really risky.

473
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,039
Couldn't you, like,
do this on nights

474
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,374
and weekends, and
keep your current job?

475
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:50,377
No.

476
00:26:50,878 --> 00:26:53,280
Mom, we... we already
quit our jobs.

477
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:57,885
And... we'll regret not
trying this business.

478
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,887
That's actually why we're here.

479
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,258
We were hoping that you both
would consider investing.

480
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,362
How much do you need?

481
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,397
Couple hundred thousand.

482
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,738
Three hundred would be great.

483
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,710
You each would get a couple
percentage points and ownership

484
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,079
in the business and,
if it's successful,

485
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,248
it could be millions
of dollars for you.

486
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:32,987
But I have to warn you, there's
a 70% chance it could fail.

487
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:37,825
I mean, that's the majority

488
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,760
of our retirement fund, honey.

489
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,162
When do you need it by?

490
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,167
Tomorrow.

491
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,769
Well, I've got an idea.

492
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,771
Dinner's almost ready.

493
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,107
Why don't we have a nice dinner

494
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,843
and we can just talk
about this later?

495
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:59,346
[crickets chirping]

496
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,449
[pensive music playing]

497
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:18,933
[soft music playing]

498
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:47,494
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

499
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,999
I just wanna tell you,

500
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,501
I don't invest in you and
I hope you understand that.

501
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:04,378
Why?

502
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:06,957
You know, it's an idea that
you have to understand,

503
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,382
it takes a lot of planning,

504
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:11,051
a lot of things, and
we don't have a lot.

505
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,053
But I'm not gonna tell you,

506
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,055
you know how much
you represent to me.

507
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:17,391
And I just want to
tell you something.

508
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,594
We live in a free country.
I believe in America

509
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,895
that every dreams can come true.

510
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,765
And the main thing that
I want you to know...

511
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,434
that I believe in you.

512
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,878
So, I'm going to
give you something.

513
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:30,204
These are life savings.

514
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:33,841
[sighs] Thanks, Dad.

515
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,876
- I love you.
- I love you.

516
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,685
I won't let you down.

517
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:46,253
I know that.
Absolutely, I know that.

518
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,729
Can I ask you for another favor?

519
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:56,731
Another favor now? [laughs]

520
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:59,133
Can I borrow the truck?

521
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,068
Oh, my God, you gonna kill me.

522
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,213
Your mom is gonna kill me,
too, because you know that...

523
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,105
Go ahead, enjoy yourself.
Today's a big day.

524
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:12,580
[upbeat music playing]

525
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:16,283
[keyboard clacking]

526
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:17,786
So, where are we heading?

527
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,555
Just keep heading west, babe.

528
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,758
Okay.

529
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:28,929
- I'll figure it out soon.
- I mean, take your time.

530
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:31,298
The movers are
only, I don't know,

531
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:33,100
18 hours behind us, I don't...

532
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,570
I'm sure they don't
mind driving aimlessly.

533
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,371
It's probably not the
first time they do.

534
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:44,945
[thunder rumbling]

535
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,614
You sure we're at
the right place?

536
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:48,750
MACKENZIE: Um, you picked it.

537
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,792
Thank you.

538
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,298
[faucet running,
MacKenzie spitting]

539
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,812
I think I figured out
where we're going.

540
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:22,116
Oh. I'm really starting to
like the nomad life, though.

541
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,652
[chuckles] Well, normally,
an analysis like this

542
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,054
would take several months,
but since we have 24 hours

543
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,623
to notify the movers,

544
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:30,290
I've narrowed it
down to one city.

545
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,193
It's a city with a
favorable tax structure,

546
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:36,664
a reasonable cost of living,
a highly qualified workforce,

547
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,332
and access to ports.

548
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:40,167
Ports?

549
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:42,871
'Cause we'll be getting
so many books from Asia?

550
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:46,808
You never know. So,
drumroll, please.

551
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,376
[MacKenzie drumming hands]

552
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:52,146
We're moving to...
Seattle, Washington.

553
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:54,883
[drumroll stops]

554
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,918
- Hmm.
- You're not excited.

555
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:02,923
I mean, the coffee's
good, right?

556
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,692
There's more than just
coffee in Seattle.

557
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,360
[MacKenzie chuckles]

558
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,596
I better call the movers.

559
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,765
Yeah, they're gonna
need an actual address.

560
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,033
At least they know where
to point the truck now.

561
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:30,184
[dreamy music playing]

562
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,198
[door closes]

563
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,639
I wanna show you something.

564
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,611
[sighs]

565
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:01,950
[door closes]

566
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,991
You're about to see
something beautiful.

567
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:18,933
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah. Cadabra.

568
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:24,171
- What?
- Cadabra.

569
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,273
That's the name of our company.

570
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:30,344
Like magic.

571
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,293
So, you're sure he's
gonna do it for a price?

572
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,495
Excellent.

573
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,164
He's a divorce
lawyer, of course!

574
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,335
How exactly is
opening a corporation

575
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,704
like dissolving a marriage?

576
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:59,172
All right, thank you.

577
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:01,543
Great, so you'll have a
draft for us by Wednesday.

578
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,812
I'll send you my address in
Seattle once we get there.

579
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,550
Yeah. Cadabra, Inc.

580
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,886
Like Abra Cadabra. Yeah.

581
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,823
No, no. Not a
cadaver. Cadabra.

582
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,361
Yep. No, no, we're not selling
any magic supplies, just books.

583
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:23,698
Thank you.

584
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,507
Hey, Shel. How are
you? Jeff Bezos.

585
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:35,475
Yep. Peter Leventhal's friend.

586
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:39,413
So, we're heading your way,

587
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:41,224
wanted to see if you're
available tomorrow.

588
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,483
Get some breakfast and
we can talk about a job.

589
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,655
Yep. San Francisco, perfect.

590
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,489
All right. Call
you in the morning.

591
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:54,662
[uplifting electronic
music playing]

592
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,537
GRANDPA: Okay,
here we go, Jeff.

593
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:05,707
Uh, with your left hand
take the nail like this,

594
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,611
and with your right hand hold
the hammer like that, okay?

595
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,879
Hold it, hold it
with strength, okay?

596
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:16,551
And then subtly tap on the
nail to seed it in place.

597
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:19,854
And then when you're ready,
hit it a little harder.

598
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,291
Then take your left hand
away and give it a whack.

599
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,894
- Okay.
- Okay? Try that.

600
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,537
- Did I do it good!
- Yeah, you did it!

601
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:40,240
All right, drink up! You
boys need to stay hydrated.

602
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,709
Oh, yeah.

603
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,312
Thanks, Grandma.

604
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,147
Supper's ready in 30 minutes.

605
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,983
Go inside and get cleaned up.

606
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,786
I'm making grandpa's
special dish today.

607
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,253
GRANDPA: Mm.

608
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,376
You know, you always
wanna have great people

609
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,759
in your life, Jeff.

610
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,596
It's the one way to stay happy.

611
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,263
[glasses clink]

612
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,194
JEFF: But make sure it has
at least three bedrooms

613
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,139
and an attached garage.

614
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,608
May I ask why?

615
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,308
I want us to be like

616
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,679
all the great American
suburb stories.

617
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,947
Apple. Dell. Disney.

618
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,617
They all started in a garage.

619
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:25,019
- You serious?
- Yeah.

620
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:27,622
But no more than 800 a month.

621
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:31,693
- Seems like kind of a lot.
- Seven hundred.

622
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,662
And we need the keys tomorrow.

623
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:37,473
I think the movers are
in Nebraska already.

624
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,800
Okay.

625
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,635
Oh, he's here.

626
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:44,939
Hi, Shel.

627
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,876
Jeff. My wife, MacKenzie.

628
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,611
MacKenzie. Nice to meet you.

629
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,780
- I'll leave you to it.
- Great.

630
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,949
So, Paul speaks
very highly of you.

631
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,627
Said he doesn't know
anybody that can build

632
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,285
a database as fast as you.

633
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,465
Yeah, I was part of the team
that wrote script decks.

634
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,355
- Oh, impressive stuff.
- It was.

635
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,526
You were also part of the
whole Earth catalogue, correct?

636
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,061
- Indeed.
- Yeah, great.

637
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:08,563
- You want a coffee?
- Sure.

638
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,090
I'll have a large coffee
and whatever he's having.

639
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,034
Cappuccino.

640
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:16,204
I'll pay 'cause we actually
have startup capital.

641
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:18,873
It's from my parents,
don't be overly impressed.

642
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:20,508
Here.

643
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,911
[keyboard clacking]

644
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:27,215
[tense music playing]

645
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,017
<i>This</i> is the whole business plan?

646
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:33,087
Mm, no, just what I
was able to get done

647
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,189
between Fort Worth and now.

648
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:37,725
Um, I'll have the rest done
by the time we get to Seattle.

649
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,662
- Books, huh? Nothing else?
- That's it.

650
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:45,566
You got a name yet?

651
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:49,871
- Cadabra.
- Cadaver? Like a dead body?

652
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:53,107
No. Cadabra. Like
a magic trick.

653
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,209
That's much better.

654
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:58,012
Now, based on your
qualifications,

655
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,615
why are you perfect for
this programming job?

656
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:04,351
I was under the impression
you were pitching me a job.

657
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,698
- Yeah, but...
- I didn't drive all the way up

658
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:09,724
from Santa Cruz
to be interviewed.

659
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:13,393
- I kinda thought it'd be both.
- It's not.

660
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,129
You'd be very lucky to have me.

661
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,565
Probably right.

662
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,299
- I am.
- Fine.

663
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,068
The job is yours if you want it.

664
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,770
I commend your good judgement.

665
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:25,273
Now, I must warn
you, the pay is shit,

666
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,241
you will be working
barbaric hours,

667
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:29,277
but you will receive
some stock options

668
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,009
and it will be the
most difficult project

669
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:32,445
you've ever worked on.

670
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:35,950
You know, most tech
startups never make it.

671
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,085
See, in the book business,

672
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,063
there's a huge disparity
between supply and demand

673
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:41,789
and it's virtually impossible

674
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:44,792
for a physical bookstore
to carry millions of books.

675
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,663
So, if you're able to build
us a website that can handle

676
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:52,767
a product category that
large, we will be successful.

677
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:54,836
Welcome aboard.

678
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:00,675
Okay, yeah. Yeah, those
dates are perfect.

679
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,111
Amazing. Yeah, great.

680
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,123
Thank you so much. I'll
call you when we arrive.

681
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,447
Okay.

682
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:10,952
- He's in.
- Well, that was easy.

683
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:13,453
How'd it go on your end?

684
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,141
You're not the only
one having success.

685
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:17,992
- Oh!
- Our new home.

686
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,462

[clattering]

693
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:53,405
Maybe we should've seen
it first before renting.

694

870
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:21,248
Hello. I'm Charles Allen Morrow
from Highland Park, Illinois.

871
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:26,054
My shop, Marrow's Antiquaria,
opening in August,

872
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:29,256
is going to be
specializing in rare books

873
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,859
and autographs in all fields.

874
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:34,996
- [applause]
- Okay, anybody else?

875
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:37,197
Oh, please!

876
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:39,867
Hi. How are you?

877
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:42,904
Um, my name is Jeff, Jeff
Bezos from Seattle, Washington,

878
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:45,607
and I'm mainly here to learn
more about the book business

879
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,241
because this summer
we'll be launching

880
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:51,378
the world's largest
bookstore, relentless.com.

881
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:53,213
[applause]

882
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,825
HOST: A bit overzealous
for a bookstore.

883
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:56,216
Don't you think?

884
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,452
Well, I can... I can
explain, actually.

885
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:01,254
The reason why it'll be the
world's largest bookstore

886
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,423
is because its vast library

887
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:06,259
is gonna exist exclusively
on the Internet.

888
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,531
- [applause]
- HOST: Okay, well...

889
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:13,735
Let's move on to the
other topics, then.

890
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:18,039
Um, excuse me one second.

891
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,942
- Hey. Internet guy.
- Who, me?

892
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,310
- Yes, you.
- Hi, how're you doing, sir?

893
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,813
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course. Mr. Leonard Riggio.

894
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:28,148
- And you are?
- Jeff. Jeff Bezos.

895
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:31,552
Care to have a
drink with me, Jeff?

896
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,292
See, since books are
a true commodity,

897
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:41,929
it seemed like the ideal
first product to sell online,

898
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:43,931
being that books in
every physical...

899
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:45,818
- Can I get you anything else?
- We're fine.

900
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:49,103
Books in all your physical
locations are identical.

901
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:50,838
So, customers should
be comfortable

902
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:52,472
purchasing them online.

903
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:56,309
Hmm. Seems like an interesting
idea you have there.

904
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:58,946
Well, it's more
than just an idea.

905
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,348
- [scoffs] Is it, though?
- Yeah.

906
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,226
I mean, we have programmers
working on it now,

907
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,786
we'll be live this summer.

908
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:06,988
But until it actually
comes to fruition,

909
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:09,624
and more than anything,
actually proves to be viable,

910
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,626
it's... just an idea.

911
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:13,594
What did you say you're
calling it again?

912
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:14,962
Relentless.

913
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,932
Huh. Peculiar name.

914
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,247
Doesn't quite fit the book
industry, though, does it?

915
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,502
How so?

916
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,840
"Relentless," I mean,
it's aggressive.

917
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:27,374
You're trying to
lure bookworms in,

918
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,188
you're not trying to
ready them for battle.

919
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,179
See, I never looked
at it that way.

920
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,014
I always thought our competitors

921
00:53:33,147 --> 00:53:35,650
would see us a certain way,
not... not the consumer.

922
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:38,052
And that right there is why
Relentless will never be

923
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:39,987
anything more than just an idea.

924
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:43,256
But, you see, we're
open to an investment

925
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,660
and maybe a partnership
with Barnes & Noble

926
00:53:45,827 --> 00:53:47,562
where we are your
Internet fulfillment wing.

927
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:50,198
No, I... I'm sorry,
James. [chuckles]

928
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:53,167
- Uh, Jeff.
- Right. Jeff, uh...

929
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:55,368
We don't do that.

930
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:57,337
You see, we're not just gonna be

931
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:59,006
another independent bookseller.

932
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,908
Okay. Stop right there.

933
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:03,511
Right. Do you... Do you
know who you're speaking to?

934
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:06,246
- Of course.
- But do you really?

935
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:07,779
Because I'm not
just Leonard Riggio.

936
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:09,917
I am Barnes & Noble, Inc.

937
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:13,087
Biggest book retailer in the
entire industry, all right?

938
00:54:13,221 --> 00:54:15,422
And we just had an
87% gain in revenue

939
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,824
over the last quarter alone.

940
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:18,391
I'm well aware of your success.

941
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,327
Oh, well, then you
should also be aware

942
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,338
that we're about to open
100 more stores this year.

943
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,098
And then it's only a
matter of time before

944
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:26,768
independent booksellers such
as yourself become obsolete.

945
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:29,203
I have no interest in
investing in anything

946
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,205
other than my own company.

947
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:34,008
But it's more about the future.

948
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:35,710
Would you like some advice?

949
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:38,012
- It's Jeff, right?
- Yeah.

950
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:40,280
Um, I think you should
go find another business

951
00:54:40,413 --> 00:54:41,949
to look at.

952
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,761
Take whatever money you
have and put it into

953
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:45,620
the manufacturing
sector or something.

954
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:48,153
I... It's... You know, they're
having a lot of growth lately.

955
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:50,758
But you will never find
success in the book industry,

956
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:52,560
I can guarantee you that.

957
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,063
I'd like to say that it
was good chatting with you,

958
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:58,032
but, frankly, it
was a waste of time.

959
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:01,235
That is for the drinks.

960
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:03,436
And whatever is leftover,
you can consider

961
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,472
it seed money for a
new business venture.

962
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:19,120
[somber music playing]

963
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:40,908
[footsteps]

964
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:48,649
[keys clinking]

965
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:00,795
MACKENZIE: You don't
have to be quiet.

966
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:02,163
I waited up.

967
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:09,136
- [Jeff sighs]
- How'd it go?

968
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,641
- Terrible.
- Why? What happened?

969
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:15,475
I don't wanna talk about it.

970
00:56:15,643 --> 00:56:18,312
Oh, come on. I'm just
asking about your day.

971
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,282
MacKenzie, I don't
wanna talk about it.

972
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,052
It was a complete waste of time.

973
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:26,621
Nobody's interested
in our company.

974
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,122
Is that what you wanna hear?

975
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,193
[door closes]

976
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:35,162
Is this how it's
gonna be from now on?

977
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,797
Like what?

978
00:56:38,498 --> 00:56:40,835
- Like what?
- Like this!

979
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:43,337
We barely talk, and when
we do talk, you just yell.

980
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,740
- I'm not yelling.
- Yes, you are!

981
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,541
You're yelling.

982
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:49,543
No, ever since we got
here I can't talk to you

983
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:52,179
without you getting upset at
me or telling me to shut up.

984
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:54,582
In case you haven't
realized, I have a company

985
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,550
that I'm trying to
get off the ground.

986
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,587
So, excuse me if I don't give
you 100% of my attention...

987
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,589
I don't want 100%
of your attention,

988
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,724
I just want a fraction of it.

989
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,030
Please.

990
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:15,202
This is my life, MacKenzie,

991
00:57:15,336 --> 00:57:17,571
and I have everything
in the world invested

992
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:20,274
in this business
and I will not fail.

993
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:23,844
I will work 24 hours a day
to make sure that I succeed.

994
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:26,514
And I'm sorry if I don't
make you a priority.

995
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,850
- We.
- What're you talking about?

996
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:32,119
<i>We</i> put everything
we had into this.

997
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:35,389
In case you forgot, I quit my
job and moved here for you!

998
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,391
Give me a break.

999
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:39,961
Jeff.

1000
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:43,965
You're a really smart guy.

1001
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,434
Hell, the smartest
guy I've ever met,

1002
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,402
but you've been acting
like a complete dick

1003
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,804
since we've gotten here.

1004
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,574
How can you not see
how you're acting?

1005
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:01,415
We have a business
that has taken hundreds

1006
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:04,085
of thousands of dollars
of investor funds,

1007
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:08,422
that is days away from
potentially closing.

1008
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:11,258
We have the shittiest
fucking name on the planet,

1009
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:14,762
relentless.com,
that doesn't appeal

1010
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,597
to any of our customer base.

1011
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:19,333
So, we need to understand

1012
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:22,303
that Jeff may not have
time for MacKenzie.

1013
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:23,904
God.

1014
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,673
'Cause we have other priorities.

1015
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:28,109
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

1016
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,811
I get that you have
a lot going on.

1017
00:58:30,945 --> 00:58:32,980
I get that everything
is riding on this idea

1018
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:35,483
and I'm not asking you
to stop focusing on that.

1019
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:37,518
I'm asking you to be present.

1020
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:39,186
[tense music playing]

1021
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,831
Be a little more
human, for God's sake.

1022
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:42,215
You're so absorbed
in the computer,

1023
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:43,958
it's like you're not even here.

1024
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:48,629
Whoa, look at that!

1025
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,331
- Lot of smoke.
- Yeah.

1026
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:54,001
Okay. Mm-hmm.

1027
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:56,837
Okay. There's some
little coolant over here,

1028
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,706
so why don't you
hand me that, Jeff?

1029
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,377
There we go.

1030
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,484
Okay.

1031
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:15,222
All right, do you
wanna turn it on now?

1032
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,527
[engine starts]

1033
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,895
- Hey!
- Whoa, you fixed it!

1034
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:22,830
You should see a
mechanic, though.

1035
00:59:22,963 --> 00:59:24,665
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1036
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,033
You're a godsend.

1037
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,645
Okay, here we go.

1038
00:59:37,745 --> 00:59:40,515
You know, we really, really
did a good job here today.

1039
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:42,583

1211
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,942
Maybe I'll use a door.

1212
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:41,649
[door closes]

1213
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:45,352
Niko! How are you? It's Jeff.

1214
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:51,324
[laughs] We're in Seattle
working on a new startup.

1215
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:53,493
You wanna come over?

1216
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:57,031
The pay's shit.

1217
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:02,103
Sure, it probably
pays more than that.

1218
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:06,440
All right. I'll send
you some information.

1219
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:09,143
Bye.

1220
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:16,184
[phone ringing]

1221
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:19,721
Hello? Arthur!

1222
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:21,689
It's good to hear from you.

1223
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:23,524
How's the business coming?

1224
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,663
Yeah. That's what
I like to hear.

1225
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,165
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure today?

1226
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:39,874
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it,
the so-called online bookstore.

1227
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:46,214
Really?

1228
01:10:47,347 --> 01:10:50,918
Yeah, uh... I... Thanks, Arthur,
I appreciate you telling me.

1229
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:53,030
Oh, you better believe I'm
gonna take care of this.

1230
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:56,423
Yeah, thanks again.
Yeah, we'll talk soon.

1231
01:10:59,594 --> 01:11:01,028
This is where the magic happens.

1232
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:10,738
It's a dump.

1233
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:13,508
I know. Come on, that's
your desk right over there.

1234
01:11:20,413 --> 01:11:22,049
Is this a door?

1235
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:23,951
It's the best desk
money can buy.

1236
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,622
Now, here's the
rest of the team.

1237
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:30,057
Shel, Paul, MacKenzie you know.

1238
01:11:30,224 --> 01:11:31,893
NIKO: Of course.
Hey, MacKenzie.

1239
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:35,062
So, you've got your computer,
your full setup there.

1240
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:37,565
- SHEL: Hey, Jeff.
- Slight problem.

1241
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:39,100
JEFF: How slight?

1242
01:11:39,233 --> 01:11:40,968
One that threatens
our very existence.

1243
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:42,570
British drôlerie there?

1244
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,972
No, deadly serious, I'm afraid.

1245
01:11:45,773 --> 01:11:47,742
I went to run a
test on the checkout

1246
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:49,911
to see if we could
order an actual book

1247
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:52,146
and, to my horror, the
distributor requires

1248
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,447
a 10-book minimum
order on all retailers.

1249
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:55,917
What?

1250
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,418
Ten books per order,
no exceptions.

1251
01:11:58,586 --> 01:11:59,887
That makes no sense.

1252
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,156
I know. I told them that.

1253
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,050
But seeing as they're
the largest distributor

1254
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:05,960
with five million
titles and I'm a nobody,

1255
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:07,887
they weren't really
interested in my opinion.

1256
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:10,097
It's just how they've
always done business.

1257
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:11,966
Let's try a different
distributor.

1258
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:14,001
The only other
distributor that matters

1259
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:15,770
has the identical policy.

1260
01:12:15,937 --> 01:12:18,840
I humbled myself, begged
them to let our poor,

1261
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:21,275
fledgling company order
less than a minimum

1262
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:23,678
and they told me
to go fuck myself.

1263
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:27,480
Not in those words
exactly, but pretty close.

1264
01:12:28,983 --> 01:12:30,450
So, what's the bottom line?

1265
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:32,653
For every one book we order,

1266
01:12:32,787 --> 01:12:34,354
we're gonna have to pay for ten.

1267
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:36,127
We're gonna burn through
our cash reserves

1268
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:38,192
in less than three months.

1269
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,661
And then we'll be
swimming in inventory

1270
01:12:40,795 --> 01:12:42,630
we don't even need with
no place to put it.

1271
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:52,340
[tense soft music playing]

1272
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:55,142
How does the payment work?

1273
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:59,013
Do they charge you when
you order the book?

1274
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,883
Or when they ship it?

1275
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,151
Or when we actually get it?

1276
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:06,621
- When the books arrive.
- You're sure?

1277
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:08,122
Yeah.

1278
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:09,957
So, if we order ten books,

1279
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:11,659
but only seven arrive...

1280
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:13,393
We're only billed for the seven.

1281
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:15,329
- Niko!
- Yeah.

1282
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:16,898
You were a biology teacher.

1283
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:19,000
- Yeah.
- I need you to find me

1284
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:21,035
the most obscure
science book out there.

1285
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:23,137
Something that is
impossible to find.

1286
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:31,178
[keyboard clacking]

1287
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:38,352
Here's a hot title.

1288
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:41,222
<i>The Lichen-Flora of
Chicago and Vicinity</i>

1289
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:43,391
by William Wirt Calkins.

1290
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:48,896
Carver Press. 1896.
Definitely out of print.

1291
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:50,765
Perfect.

1292
01:13:50,898 --> 01:13:52,867
Now, what's the name of
the new Grisham book?

1293
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,702
<i>The Rainmaker.</i>

1294
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:56,869
Let's go ahead and order
one copy of <i>The Rainmaker,</i>

1295
01:13:57,538 --> 01:14:00,875
nine copies of
Niko's science book.

1296
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:04,111
And the distributor
should only charge us

1297
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:05,947
for the one copy
of <i>The Rainmaker.</i>

1298
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:08,783
Yeah. And if any of the
back ordered books arrive,

1299
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,217
we'll just return them.

1300
01:14:11,218 --> 01:14:12,620
Now what?

1301
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,255
We wait, I suppose.

1302
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:17,725
No. Full speed ahead.

1303
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:19,360
Even if it's off a cliff?

1304
01:14:19,492 --> 01:14:22,630
[chuckles] We've
done worse. Let's go!

1305
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:26,133
- Full steam.
- [phone rings]

1306
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:27,768
Hello?

1307
01:14:29,437 --> 01:14:30,738
Yeah, this is him.

1308
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:38,913
I'm available. Tomorrow?

1309
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:44,452
I'll be there. Thank you.

1310
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:51,993
That was Leonard Riggio
of Barnes & Noble.

1311
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,493
What did he want?

1312
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:54,996
He wants to meet tomorrow.

1313
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:58,065
Something about a
business opportunity.

1314
01:14:58,566 --> 01:15:00,101
Well, that's good.

1315
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:04,672
Yeah. That's good.

1316
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:08,809
[dramatic music playing]

1317
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:25,593
[epic tribal music playing]

1318
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:38,339
[tense music playing]

1319
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:41,475
- Jeff?
- Oh. Mr. Riggio.

1320
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,545
- Pleasure.
- Good to see you.

1321
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,682
What would you
like to talk about?

1322
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:51,852
[exhales] An old friend gave
me a call the other day.

1323
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,688
Told me about you, actually.

1324
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:57,191
Seems you didn't take my advice

1325
01:15:57,324 --> 01:16:00,628
and you're still going around
trying to get investments.

1326
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:02,663
Can you blame me?

1327
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:07,068
See, it's not that you're
pursuing this silly little idea

1328
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:09,336
that bothers me, it's
the fact that apparently

1329
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:10,738
you still are referring to it

1330
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:12,173
as the world's
biggest bookstore.

1331
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:15,209
I don't see a problem with it.

1332
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:17,211
You... You don't see
why that offends me?

1333
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:19,914
- No.
- Well, then, I'll tell you.

1334
01:16:21,682 --> 01:16:23,584
How old are you
Jeff? What, about 35?

1335
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:25,252
Thirty-one.

1336
01:16:25,386 --> 01:16:28,389
When you were a one-year-old,

1337
01:16:28,523 --> 01:16:32,860
I opened a little shop called,
uh, Student Book Exchange.

1338
01:16:33,528 --> 01:16:35,696
I was just a kid
at the time at NYU,

1339
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:39,366
but it turned into
be a major retailer.

1340
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:41,268
Coast to coast.

1341
01:16:41,402 --> 01:16:43,538
Well, I mean, that's amazing.

1342
01:16:43,671 --> 01:16:46,240
You should just listen,
you might learn something.

1343
01:16:47,374 --> 01:16:49,210
So, a little bit later,

1344
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:51,021
it was when you were
about seven years old,

1345
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:54,048
I acquired a little shop
called Barnes & Noble,

1346
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:56,250
and I liked its
name, so I used it

1347
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:58,219
after I picked up a
few hundred more shops.

1348
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,056
But Wall Street said,
"Well, there's no more room,

1349
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:04,425
my friend, to grow in
the book industry,"

1350
01:17:04,559 --> 01:17:09,230
and I said, "Fuck you.
I'm just getting started."

1351
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:12,601
And that's when I
invented the superstore.

1352
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:16,971
So, you don't understand
why you calling yourself

1353
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,906
the world's biggest
bookstore offends me?

1354
01:17:19,608 --> 01:17:22,309
Well, it's because
it's a goddamn lie.

1355
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:25,446
We hold that title and will
for many more years to come.

1356
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,748
And if we ever lose it,

1357
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:32,720
it'll be to Crown or, I
don't know, Kmart or Borders.

1358
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:36,591
Not to some dope who's
working out of a shit hole,

1359
01:17:36,757 --> 01:17:39,760
who hasn't sold one single
book in his entire life.

1360
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,061
I understand.

1361
01:17:41,162 --> 01:17:44,231
Yeah, I'm pretty articulate.

1362
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:48,570
You see, it's not meant
to be taken literally.

1363
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,238
It's just a way for our
customers to understand

1364
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:54,008
the vast extent and
potential of the Internet.

1365
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,177
See, I don't care what
your intentions are,

1366
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,279
just stop saying it.

1367
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,949
You don't and I'll sue your ass.

1368
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:05,085
But not right now, no.

1369
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:07,426
Not even after you've actually
sold a few thousand books.

1370
01:18:07,454 --> 01:18:09,658
I'm gonna wait for
just the right time,

1371
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,125
like the week that
you go public.

1372
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:13,827
And then you'll be
dead in the crib.

1373
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:17,965
Or I can make you a
proposal right now

1374
01:18:18,132 --> 01:18:21,035
so we can bury this idea five
feet, under where it belongs.

1375
01:18:22,637 --> 01:18:25,507
Barnes & Noble is willing
to acquire this idea

1376
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,342
from you for the gracious
sum of $1 million.

1377
01:18:29,511 --> 01:18:31,812
I mean, God knows that's
more than what it's worth.

1378
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:34,215
But, you know, it
should be enough for you

1379
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:35,816
