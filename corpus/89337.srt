1
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,421
- Sol.
- Sol.

2
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,258
- Sol Goode?
- I know Sol.

3
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,424
- Sol, Sol, Sol--
- I fucked him.

4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,330
I did.

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,460
- Sol Goode.
- Sol Goode.

6
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,097
- Yeah, I know Sol.
- I don't want to talk about Sol.

7
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,573
- He's an angel.
- My fucking hero.

8
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,803
- My motherfucking man.
- Sol changed my life.

9
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,607
You want to run up to him and
say, "Let me be in your life."

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,874
- He's...
- So...

11
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,348
- Bad, man!
-...dangerously cool.

12
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,908
- Charisma.
- Don't get any better than Goode.

13
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,079
- I think he's overrated.
- He's a great man.

14
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,419
- He's such--
- A fucking dick.

15
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,118
He's loyal
as a fucking dog.

16
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,491
- He was a gentleman.
- Sol's my dog.

17
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,995
If you don't know Sol,
you're in big trouble.

18
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,860
Kind of like this
Jack Kerouac...

19
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,162
I don't actually know him,
but I act like I do.

20
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,293
...come to life,
modern day.

21
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,768
He came up to me
and he said something to me.

22
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,237
I feel like
he knows so much.

23
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,173
And he said,
"Kid, we got a long way to go.

24
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,369
And a short time
to get there."

25
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,173
- But--
- And then I realized.

26
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,178
Fuckin' A.

27
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,238
Jack Kerouac and those people
in "On the Road"

28
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,840
are fucking assholes.

29
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,475
He was dating
somebody else at the time.

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,020
He calls me 2:00am,
drunk off his ass.

31
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:02,986
He says,
"What are you doing? "

32
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,854
- I didn't really know that.
- Completely self--

33
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,586
And every person
that I know that he's--

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,059
That son of a bitch.

35
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,427
--talked to. They're like,
"Oh yeah, I know him.

36
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,329
- I know him. He's really nice."
- He sucks!

37
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,866
And I'm like, "Yeah, how long
ya known him? "

38
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,698
- He's so fucking frustrating.
- What does Sol do?

39
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,034
- He's--
- He uh--

40
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,698
- Uh--
- He's retired.

41
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,765
- He's an entrepreneur.
- He's some kind of actor.

42
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,309
An actor.

43
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,504
- Actor.
- He is a writer.

44
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,639
- He's a Renaissance man.
- He baby sits sometimes.

45
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,708
He has no emotions whatsoever.
How can he be an actor?

46
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,719
- I don't know.
- I don't have a clue what he does.

47
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,982
- He does hot chicks.
- I think he just hangs out.

48
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,717
- Hangs out.
- I really don't know.

49
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,723
I know what he should do.

50
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,726
He needs to get a job
and go to work

51
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,820
- and stop harassing me.
- I had these two girls,

52
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,957
but I didn't know what to say.
You know Sol.

53
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,230
- Sol's a dog.
- He just fuckin', just--

54
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,396
- He's really cute.
- Me and Sol, back at their house.

55
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,702
- Yeah, he's cute.
- Fucking great.

56
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:55,570
Great eyes.

57
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,633
That bastard better
stay away from me.

58
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,337
- He's so--
- Hot.

59
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,344
Fucking hot.

60
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,847
I watch him bend down
as he picks up his hair products.

61
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,544
- If you've ever seen him dance.
- Things he can do with his tongue.

62
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,778
Just his tongue.

63
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,151
- Slobber thing.
- He's got some moves.

64
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,416
Oh my God!

65
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,653
I thought that this is it.
He is the one for me forever.

66
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,489
But--

67
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,928
- I still haven't heard from him.
-I haven't heard from the guy.

68
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,227
- He hasn't called, so--
- Never heard from him.

69
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,359
- He forgets to call you.
- He doesn't fucking call me.

70
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,367
He never called.

71
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,427
- Waiting and waiting and waiting--
- You're not going to call me?

72
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,267
And waiting and waiting--

73
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,806
- Fuck Sol.
- I think I still love him.

74
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,465
Poseur.

75
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,769
- I love him.
- Dick.

76
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,571
- I love him.
- Asshole.

77
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,544
- Sol's in.
- Sol's out.

78
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,682
( flatulence )

79
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,109
Happens to the best of us.
It's amazing what somebody will do

80
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,273
to get a person
out of their bed.

81
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,546
I, myself, have
mastered the art.

82
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,417
I have three go-tos
in this situation.

83
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,422
The first being
the old beeper trick.

84
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,685
My buddy Cooper
invented it.

85
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,624
Fucking genius.

86
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,697
- ( pager beeps )
- Uh-uuhhh.

87
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,037
Who has the nerve
to page me this early?

88
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,942
( grunts )
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,209
( phone beeps )
( dial tone )

90
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,840
Hello?

91
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,214
Where am I?
Where the fuck do you think I am?

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,617
It's 8:00am.

93
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,712
This is Tammie.

94
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,451
I don't know why
I keep doing this to myself.

95
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,892
This is what happens when
you drink and dial at 2:00am.

96
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,827
The only problem is,

97
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,798
once you get her in bed,
it's impossible to get her out.

98
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,564
Oh dude, that was today?
I totally forgot.

99
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,663
All right, I'll be
right there.

100
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,402
What's going on?

101
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,740
I have to go pick my brother
up at the airport.

102
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,372
- Oh, you want me to go?
- Actually... Iook,

103
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,177
a small car,
a lot of luggage...

104
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,411
Don't worry.
I'll just sit in the back.

105
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,476
Don't you think it's about time
I meet your family?

106
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,852
- ( snorts )
- Voices: Whoo-ooaa.

107
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,414
All right, that was pretty weak.

108
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,926
I know I'm much
better than that.

109
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,553
When I'm creatively stifled,

110
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,497
I can usually count
on Cooper to save the day.

111
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,831
« Oooooh, la, la... «

112
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,771
« Oooooh, la, la... «

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,072
« Oooooh, la, la... «

114
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:49,581
- « Oooooh, la, la... «
- ( phone rings)

115
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,177
- « Oooooh, la, la... «
- P.O.D.-- fucking Sol.

116
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,518
« Oooooh, la, la... «

117
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,252
Sol: Cooper and I go back
since the eighth grade.

118
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,988
Which is about the same time
he started shaving his chest.

119
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,893
There's only one thing
Cooper cares about--

120
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,489
his hair, otherwise known
as his salad.

121
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,449
- Yo!
- ( gasps )

122
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,144
What, did you forget
what today was?

123
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,413
What's today?

124
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,081
It's Bobe's funeral, dude.
We're supposed to be pallbearers.

125
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,487
- Who's Bobe?
- It's my grandmother.

126
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,388
- That was today?
- That was today.

127
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,724
Bobe's about to go six feet under,
dude, and you're--

128
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,696
You should be ashamed
of yourself man. Come on, let's go.

129
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,926
Tammie, I have to go.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,433
Don't worry, Sol.
I'm here for you.

131
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,403
It's a family affair,
I can't--

132
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,302
I won't let you go
through this alone.

133
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,603
Voices:
Whoo-ooaa.

134
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,133
That was poor execution.

135
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,941
But when all else fails,

136
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,881
you have no choice
but to go to old faithful.

137
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,180
( smoke alarm screams,
extinguisher blows )

138
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,351
Fuck! Let's go, people!
Let's go!

139
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,587
There's been
a fuel leak!

140
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,526
It's-- evacuate
the premises immediately!

141
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,223
Oh my God.
Wait, I have to get--

142
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,925
Do not leave
anything behind.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,935
- Do you have all your belongings?
- What about your earrings?

144
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,595
Fuck the earrings!

145
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,003
Let's go, people!
60 seconds!

146
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,042
( screams )
Go, go, go...!

147
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,079
( extinguisher blows,
screams )

148
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,374
I got it, I got it,
I got it...

149
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,109
( screams )

150
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,207
Get in your car.

151
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,947
Drive far.
Drive fast. Do not stop.

152
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,579
- Cooper: Hurry!
- I'll call you.

153
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,625
- Wait, you promise you'll call me?
-I promise I'll call. Go!

154
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,556
Cooper:
Nine!

155
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,290
Both:
Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four--

156
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,826
Shit. I ought to thank
the Academy for that.

157
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,131
Want to go eat?

158
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,196
No, man. I have to go
work on my salad.

159
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,264
You're welcome.

160
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,900
Thanks, Coop.

161
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,175
So, what's up, man?

162
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,245
All right, you know--
hey, don't drink out--

163
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,917
- Man, I hate that!
- What?

164
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,961
Don't you understand that your
backwash goes back into the carton,

165
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,861
which then goes on to my cereal
and I end up eating it?

166
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,092
That's fucking disgusting.

167
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,534
Just cut out the middle man
and spit in my mouth.

168
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,333
Oh fuck.

169
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,997
Sol:
This is my roommate, Justin.

170
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,564
Yeah, she's a little uptight.

171
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,701
But, you would too,
if you hated your job,

172
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,005
were about to get married,

173
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,741
and suffered from irritable
bowel syndrome.

174
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,978
- In English, that means--
- I have to take a shit.

175
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,417
- God damn it!
- What?

176
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,960
You pissed all over
the toilet seat.

177
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,188
Are you sure it's piss?

178
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,857
Yes, I'm sure it's piss.

179
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,265
Sol, look at you.
You can't even pay the rent.

180
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,360
Mr. Hockman
is looking for you.

181
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,904
He says he's going
to throw us out of here.

182
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,907
I don't have another $700.
I can't cover you this time.

183
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,738
Have I ever
let you down?

184
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,800
Yes.

185
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,372
Don't worry about it.
I've got a plan.

186
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,520
Uh-huh.
Look, man, I gotta go.

187
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,322
Look-- I gotta go.
I'm walking into a meeting.

188
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,125
Woman: Please,
what's taking so long?

189
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,927
Man: Come on already.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,798
Woman: Excuse me?
I've been waiting over an hour.

191
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,304
Man: I have a call back
in half an hour.

192
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,567
Woman: I have to get money
in my meter.

193
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,109
- Man: Let's move!
- Clerk: Next.

194
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,572
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it, Miss Jenkins?

195
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,083
The earrings.
I love the earrings.

196
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,588
- I love the--
- Social Security number.

197
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:55,593
It's 605...
24801 2.

198
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,160
- Sol Goode?
- Get to know me.

199
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,098
You come up with that
all by yourself?

200
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,865
Well...

201
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,304
I'm afraid it's not
all good, Sol Goode.

202
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,103
Your unemployment
benefits have run out.

203
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,371
What do you mean,
they've run out?

204
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,003
There's got to be some
sort of mistake, right?

205
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,947
- Mistake?
- Yeah, I'm still unemployed.

206
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,041
Mmm-hmm.

207
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,143
I tell you what.

208
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,656
Because I like you,
and only because I like you,

209
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,488
I'll give you some advice
that will help you out.

210
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,187
Come here, honey.

211
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,426
- Talk to me.
- What you need to do is,

212
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,435
get a J-O-B.

213
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,767
Next!

214
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,170
I said next!

215
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,274
I'm saying I could get George
Kennedy and Nipsy Russell.

216
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,442
Or we can have the next
48 hours is what we can have.

217
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,452
My mom wants me
out of the house.

218
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,613
Good morning, ladies.

219
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,820
Bernie Best's assistant
just got the axe.

220
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,986
Greenburg got the axe?
Who got the nod?

221
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,259
- You got the nod.
- I got the nod, really?

222
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,632
No, not really.
Sax, you got the nod.

223
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,832
Smells like minimum
wage in here.

224
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,967
Later, Krispy Kreme.

225
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,154
Don't drop the baby.

226
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,350
( mouthing )

227
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,917
Don't drop the baby!

228
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,190
Relax.

229
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,961
Don't drop the baby.

230
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,401
- Man: Sol Goode?
- Yes, it is.

231
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,371
You'll do just fine.

232
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,170
Sol?
You still going for it?

233
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,437
Good for you.
Come on in.

234
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,809
Now, let's change
our subject.

235
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,610
Let's change our subject.
Let's change the subject!

236
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,846
( sobs )

237
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,219
- ( sighs )
- Sol?

238
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,758
- Do you need a minute?
- No.

239
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,318
Yeah, no.
I'm okay.

240
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,921
Just-- it takes
so much out of you.

241
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,195
That was very moving.

242
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,701
You blew me away.

243
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,170
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

244
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,171
But...

245
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,437
were you aware
that this is a comedy?

246
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,303
A comedy?

247
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,972
Burns: All right, Sax,
here's the deal.

248
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,517
Bernie Best is the angriest bitch
in the business.

249
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,519
Average lifespan
of her assistant is three weeks.

250
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,919
She's fired four
this month alone.

251
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,854
What you're about to embark on
is fucking brutal.

252
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,619
But it's the quickest
way to the top.

253
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,652
One piece of advice, whatever you
do, make sure the "Fonz" is happy.

254
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,994
Where do you think you're going?
Come here and talk to me.

255
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,624
The "Fonz"?

256
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,552
Come on. I shouldn't have
to explain this to you.

257
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,153
Okay.

258
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,255
Where the fuck
were you?

259
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,390
I was just down the hall,

260
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,162
- I was just--
- Tahiti?

261
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,033
- Am I late?
- You lucky shit.

262
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,131
I want to see pictures.

263
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,540
Sidney, who's
your favorite agent?

264
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,341
That's right, I am.
Do you want to know why?

265
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,712
Oh gee, I don't know, maybe
because I just finagled

266
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,251
Derivative Pictures to hire you
for their next family film.

267
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,685
Who gives a shit
what the story's about?

268
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,057
I don't know, they said something
about a penguin playing shortstop.

269
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,322
You're not responding
to that story?

270
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,797
No, Sid, you're responding
to the paycheck.

271
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,197
How's that?

272
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,462
Do you know
how lucky you are?

273
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,233
Sid, I'm only doing--
Rob Reiner gave me that.

274
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,968
No one likes you.

275
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,600
As a person.

276
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,272
I'm just doing this as a favor
to your wife, then you're gone.

277
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,612
Okay. All right.

278
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,381
Hey-- okay,
happy birthday.

279
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,887
Fucking hack!

280
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,917
Who are you?

281
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,055
I'm Justin Sax. I was sent here
to work on your desk.

282
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,658
Sax. What kind
of name is that?

283
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,225
You a Jew?

284
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,195
Half.

285
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,503
Oh no. Oh Christ, no.

286
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,202
- No, no.
- I'm on my mother's side.

287
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,077
No, Fonzie!
Not in the goddamn office!

288
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,713
( pants )

289
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,274
Oh, that's going
to stink.

290
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:51,084
Jimmy, would you be a lamb
and clean that up for me?

291
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,784
Okay. And give it a shot of
Fabreeze when you're done.

292
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,820
What's Fabreeze?

293
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,225
Dude, I can't believe,
two pints of blood

294
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,056
gets me $30
and a bearclaw.

295
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,967
I'm broke.
I need money. Coop?

296
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:10,065
- What the fuck are you doing?
- God damn, dude.

297
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,440
My salad's kind
of banging right now.

298
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,275
Oh fuck, Coop. I'm just saying,
I might need a loan.

299
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,646
Don't look at me, fool.
I don't got any extra cash.

300
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,116
You know how much I paid
for these highlights?

301
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,619
- $200.
- You're unbelievable.

302
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,121
Don't be jealous.

303
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,591
Woman: Miss?

304
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,534
Miss?

305
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,731
Excuse me, miss?

306
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,478
Yes?

307
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,742
I've been here for 10 minutes
and I don't have a menu.

308
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,477
Actually, I'm not your waitress,
but I will go get her.

309
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,042
Excuse me. Before you disappear
for another 1 0 minutes,

310
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,284
- can I just get something to drink?
- Sure, what can I get you?

311
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,950
An LA Skyline.

312
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,653
What's that?

313
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,289
Half iced tea, half lemonade.
The iced tea represents the smog,

314
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,855
the lemonade
is for the sun.

315
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,869
- That's called an Arnold Palmer.
- Whatever. I don't play tennis.

316
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,837
( whispering )
Bitch.

317
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,910
Sol: This is
my best friend, Chloe.

318
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,316
No, it's not like that at all,
were just friends.

319
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,876
It's always been
like that.

320
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,218
Probably because she doesn't
take any of my shit.

321
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,087
Or anybody else's.

322
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,432
Finally.

323
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,101
- What's up, guys?
- What's up? How you doing?

324
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,972
I just love
being a waitress.

325
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,842
Just to be given
the opportunity to... serve people.

326
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,905
It's really quite fulfilling.
It's a gift.

327
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,611
I personally love being unemployed
and living off my parents.

328
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,812
It's so rewarding--

329
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,345
- Can we cut that? I'm starving.
- What can I get you, Coop?

330
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,086
I'll go with Pam Anderson's
double-breasted chicken.

331
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,888
Well done.

332
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,828
I'll have the Ricky Martin
tossed salad.

333
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,424
- Two lemonades?
- Absolutely. Hold the lugies.

334
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,698
- Are you wearing eyeliner?
- Not in this lifetime.

335
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,768
What?

336
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,245
It looks like
you're wearing eyeliner.

337
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,942
Is it obvious?

338
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,167
He changed the locks.

339
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,584
( TV playing )

340
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,282
Announcer:
Henderson rounds first.

341
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,823
Man: Oo-oohh God.

342
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,256
Man: Oh God, I'm on second.

343
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,420
It's wrapped the wall.
He's headed to third.

344
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,158
- Man: I'm going to third.
- Yes, it looks like he's home.

345
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,700
- He slides head first--
- Man: I'm sliding into home.

346
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,429
Announcer: He scores!

347
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,505
Honey? You okay?

348
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,106
Yeah, I'm fine.

349
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,444
You sure?

350
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,148
- Oh, oh yes!
- No.

351
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,988
Sweetheart?

352
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,754
What's wrong?

353
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,320
Mom, I gotta
talk to you.

354
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,422
Yes?

355
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,833
Is there any way I could--
look, I'll pay you back,

356
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,736
I swear to God.
I'm just a little short on rent.

357
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,401
- How short?
- A midget.

358
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,468
I'm sure your father's
offer still stands.

359
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,276
Come on, Mom.
I can't be an umpire.

360
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,317
Why not?
Your father was an umpire.

361
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,375
Your grandfather
was an umpire.

362
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,182
You'd be great at it,
it's in your blood.

363
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,780
No way, Mom.
It's humiliating.

364
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,054
- I just need a little help.
- No.

365
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,719
Dad?

366
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,355
You don't even know
what we're talking about.

367
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,660
You don't think I became
an umpire by being stupid,

368
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,001
do you?

369
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,874
I think it's time
we had a sit down.

370
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,707
A sit down?

371
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,009
I don't have time
for a sit down.

372
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,412
I gotta be somewhere
soon, Dad.

373
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,814
Where do you
gotta be?

374
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,183
You don't have a job.
You don't have a woman.

375
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,350
You don't have squat.
We're having a sit down.

376
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,897
What are you doing
with yourself?

377
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,433
Dad, you know
what I'm doing.

378
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,469
Why do we always have
to have this talk?

379
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,470
Why do I pay
your rent every month?

380
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,563
You know, Sol,

381
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,870
this acting thing
has gone a little too far.

382
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,673
As a matter of fact,
it has gone nowhere.

383
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,508
But you gotta understand,

384
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,640
this sort of thing,
it doesn't happen overnight.

385
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
It takes time.

386
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,851
There comes a time
in every man's life,

387
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,080
when he has to give up
foolish fantasies,

388
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,214
and face certain realities.

389
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,451
The truth is...

390
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,585
...you're not
fucking Paul Newman!

391
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,292
And as far as that parental
scholarship you've been riding on,

392
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,394
it is now officially over.

393
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,598
You can't do this.
I just need a little time.

394
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,040
Honey. I've just had
a terrific idea.

395
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,409
You should get a part on "Friends."
You'd be great on that show.

396
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,005
Why didn't I
think of that?

397
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,574
Just go out and
get a part on "Friends."

398
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,916
- I'm going to go, guys.
- Before you leave,

399
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,980
there's something else
we wanted to say.

400
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,457
( sighs )

401
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,016
You know...

402
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,587
that your father and I
love you more than life itself.

403
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,931
And you know that you can talk
to us about anything.

404
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,493
Of course.

405
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,507
Well, your father and I
were wondering...

406
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,471
if you were a little--

407
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,706
curious.

408
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,081
Curious as to what the hell
you're talking about.

409
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,881
Son?

410
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,949
Do you sit down
when you pee?

411
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,049
Wait.

412
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,120
- Do you guys think I'm--
- No, no, no, honey.

413
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,994
No. I mean-- look--

414
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,863
we love you,
whatever you are.

415
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,232
Unconditional love.

416
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,740
It's just that we think
it's a little strange

417
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,707
that you've never
had a girlfriend.

418
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,176
I've been with
plenty of girls.

419
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,803
Just because I've never
had a girlfriend,

420
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,348
- doesn't mean I'm gay.
- That's not what I've heard.

421
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,644
Dad?

422
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,742
You were a George Michael fan.

423
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,553
He does have a point.

424
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,090
It was just a phase
I went through.

425
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,523
Will you hold it
against me forever?

426
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,253
All right,
it's not about the fact

427
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,852
that you were
into George Michael,

428
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,764
which is sad enough,
it's the fact that you're 27

429
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,131
and you haven't been
in a relationship

430
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,227
for more than 20 minutes.

431
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:22,796
- What do you think that is?
- You think I have a problem?

432
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,841
Slightly.

433
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,140
Okay, you're the psych major,
you think I have a problem.

434
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,375
- Enlighten me.
- All right. Happy to.

435
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,543
First of all, you have a fear
of any kind of commitment.

436
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,577
You're the biggest narcissist
I know, besides Cooper,

437
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,092
and you've built a barrier keeping
you from feeling anything intimate.

438
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,595
How do you think
you'll ever self-transcend?

439
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,827
"Self-transcend"?
Did you learn that in class today?

440
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,993
Actually, I did.

441
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,333
I think we should wait
till you graduate

442
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,532
before you start
psychoanalyzing my life.

443
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,633
When did you become so
knowledgeable in relationships?

444
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,109
When was the last one
you were in?

445
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,011
Functional one, that is.

446
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,812
I'll admit, I've had
my share of losers.

447
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,787
- At least, I'm not afraid to try.
- What are you trying to say?

448
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,292
I think you know
what I'm trying to say.

449
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,657
Really?

450
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:24,025
« There's no coming back
from where we've been «

451
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,970
« You're saying different
people change, get it «

452
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:34,171
« What's the point in
letting me find out like that? «

453
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,214
« Yeah «

454
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:46,649
« Well, this is something
that they don't advise «

455
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,092
« Communication
is the only relation «

456
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,858
« So why... «

457
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,391
« Did I find out
like that? «

458
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,130
« Yeah. «

459
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,376
Why does Brenda have a say
in everything you do?

460
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,574
Can't you get off lockdown
for one night?

461
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,049
Come on, Sol.
Turn the page.

462
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,517
No, it's ridiculous.

463
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,076
She won't even let you go out
with your friends.

464
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:19,180
She fuckin' owns you.
Where's your sack?

465
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,283
Dude, I don't even
know you anymore.

466
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,488
I mean, your woman,
she runs your show.

467
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,089
You gotta stop
talking shit, dude.

468
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:32,500
All right? I'm marrying
this girl in six months.

469
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,439
You're my best man.
She's my best girl.

470
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,942
Okay? Accept it.

471
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,948
All right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

472
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,712
It's just between
the job and Brenda,

473
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,276
we never get
to hang out anymore.

474
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,016
When was the last time we spent
some quality time together?

475
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,387
I don't know.

476
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,224

doing in town, man?

Well, me and my lady
decided to take a time out.

507
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,483
- You guys broke up?
- No, I didn't say we broke up.

508
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,016
- I said we took a time out.
- What's the difference?

509
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,656
See, a time out
is just a break.

510
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,723
It's a reevaluation process

511
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,133
with the hopes of
getting back together.

512
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,434
So you got a hall pass.
You going to use it?

513
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:52,169
Oh, I don't know.
I'm not planning on it.

514
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,007
What about you, Sol?
You got a lady yet?

515
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,049
No, no, no... not yet.

516
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,745
Yo, what's up?

517
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,788
Are you kidding me, Coop?
You're not going to wear that?

518
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,550
Yeah, I'm fucking
wearing this.

519
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,058
Let's see who gets all
the fucking pussy tonight.

520
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,823
- Where'd you get that? Baby Gap?
- Are you jealous, motherfucker?

521
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,488
I'm taking this shit
to the stage tonight.

522
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,624
Oh God. Cooper?

523
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,725
- Happy, what's up, dude?
- What's up?

524
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,600
Right there, dude.
Lay it on.

525
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,970
- How you been?
- I've been good, how you been?

526
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,305
Good. What's
with the blue hair?

527
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,403
Let's cut the small talk.
Let me see that thing.

528
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,879
What thing?

529
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,815
Heard you've got
a Duraflame. Let me see it.

530
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,618
You want to see my pecker?

531
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,885
I ain't gay, Hap.
I fuck models only. Okay?

532
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,324
I've been hearing about it
since high school.

533
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,329
I want to see
what I'm up against. Come on...

534
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,762
bust it out.

535
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,163
- Cooper: Come on.
- All right.

536
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,828
All right, sit down.

537
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,607
Now... don't get scared.

538
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,618
Fuck.

539
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,089
Who are you, dude?

540
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:19,127
Yeah, I'd be happy too, if
I was packing that kind of heat.

541
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,658
Holy shit!

542
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,369
« Fuck tha police, comin' straight
from the underground «

543
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,371
- « Young nigga got it bad «
- « All: 'Cuz I'm brown «

544
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,101
« And not the other color,
so police think «

545
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,405
- « They have the authority «
- « All: To kill a minority «

546
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,638
- « Fuck that shit «
- « All: 'Cuz I ain't the one «

547
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,704
« All: For a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun «

548
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,341
« To be beaten on,
and thrown in jail «

549
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,977
« We can go toe-to-toe
in the middle of a cell «

550
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,988
« Fuckin' with me,
'cuz I'm a teenager «

551
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,047
« With a little bit
of gold and a pager «

552
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,719
- « Searchin' in my car... «
- ( horn blows )

553
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,091
( brakes squeal )

554
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,153
- What the fuck, dude?
- What are you doing?

555
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,289
- That was Brenda.
- So?

556
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,196
- So what?
- I gotta go back and say hi.

557
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,929
No you don't, you saw her
an hour ago.

558
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,004
Hey, Poo-Poo.

559
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,601
Where are you going, Justin?
I'm on my way to your house.

560
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,943
I thought we were going
to rent "Titanic" tonight.

561
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,244
Is she fuckin' for real?

562
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,615
We might go catch
a drink or something.

563
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,244
Oh.

564
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,787
Well, I want to catch a drink.

565
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,723
That'll never happen.

566
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,433
Have fun with
your girlfriends, Justin.

567
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,525
( engine races )

568
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,467
No, Poo-Poo.
We're just going--

569
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,469
Uh-uuhh!

570
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,201
That's Brenda. I think
her face says it all.

571
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,708
No, Poo-Poo!
We're just going--

572
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,506
Iove you-- I--

573
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,341
Thanks, guys.

574
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,438
Please, dude. We just
did you a favor.

575
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,334
Your cousin's hat
is killing me right now.

576
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,532
Take a look at his boots,
you won't even notice the hat.

577
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,714
- Yee-haw.
- Hey, partner.

578
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,279
Howdy.

579
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,915
- Howdy.
- I like that.

580
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,823
Girl: You look like
a real cowboy.

581
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,919
Why don't you come with us?

582
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,624
And show us how
the West was hung.

583
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,066
- You've got a big head.
- Must be my lucky hat.

584
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,564
I don't even think
that was a good rap, did you?

585
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,335
Coop, he didn't even
open his mouth.

586
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,808
Poo-Poo, listen to me!

587
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,038
I didn't want to come.
No, they made me--

588
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,842
- of course I love you.
- Brenda: I don't believe you.

589
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,645
Together: Ready
for a blow job, cowboy?

590
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,380
No hands, girls.

591
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,922
I can't fit this
in my mouth.

592
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,686
- Uhm-mm.
- Uhm-mm.

593
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,819
Bam!

594
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,956
You need Therapy,
Thursday nights.

595
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,900
- Buh-bye.
- Bam!

596
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,768
Therapy, I know, got it.

597
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,204
Peace.

598
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,798
Man: I just want
to be taken seriously.

599
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,208
Like a cross between
Ricky Martin,

600
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,576
with that sensuality,
that bon-bon,

601
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,478
and Fred Durst
with a business sense.

602
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,347
The shit I'm doing-- we're called
"The Dirty Underwear Brothers."

603
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,787
My brother programs the beats.
I'm the "lyracalist."

604
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,257
You know, it's like--
it's like-- 'N-Sync

605
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,422
meets fucking Kid--
Kid Rock in a dark alley.

606
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,931
Oh dude. Dude.

607
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,695
Oh dude.

608
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,103
Fuck.

609
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,244
I think that's the chick
from the Diesel ads.

610
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,508
- Justin: I think your right.
- No dude. I know I'm right.

611
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,572
Fuck, she's hot.

612
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,574
Did you see that?

613
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,712
She was just peeping my shit
right there. Did you see that?

614
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,813
- She was peeping you.
- No way.

615
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,858
You ready to see
your dog dial that in?

616
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,087
- Sol: Do your business.
- Cooper: I will.

617
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,790
She's on, dude.

618
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,299
All right, come here.
Talk to me.

619
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,562
Pretend like we're having
a serious conversation.

620
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,104
- How's my salad?
- Banging. Are you kidding me?

621
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,639
- Banging?
- Yes.

622
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,073
- All right, I'm going.
- Go.

623
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:36,013
- You had me at hello.
- Did I say hello to you?

624
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,022
No, but you still had me.

625
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,253
Has anyone ever told you
you look like Brad Pitt?

626
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,454
No.

627
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,760
Good, 'cause you don't.

628
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,497
Girl #2:
Nice shirt. Love the hair.

629
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,806
I'll call you.

630
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,070
That's weird that
you bring up nightmares.

631
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,943
'Cause in my class, we were talking
about dreams and what they--

632
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:06,950
Oh shit. I didn't tell you
about my motherfucking dreams.

633
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,318
Oh my God. Oh God.
Oh fuck.

634
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,688
I get this one
recurring dream...

635
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,160
...that I'm being recruited
by a boy band.

636
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,222
Fuck.

637
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,290
And as initiation...

638
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,266
....they make me
sit on a block of ice.

639
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,738
Buck fucking naked.

640
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,903
My nuts are like two little
lonely fucking raisins.

641
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,411
And right before--

642
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,641
you know the-- the cute one,
the braids, who's like--

643
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,445
He's got that--
you know what I'm saying?

644
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,078
Right before he sticks
his finger in my butt,

645
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,920
I, uh-- God,
I wake up...

646
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,585
...with a hard-on.

647
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,423
Wow.

648
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,021
Man: I'm really confused,
you know?

649
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,498
Do you know what that means?

650
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,660
Chloe. I've been looking
all over for you.

651
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,795
The lady from the adoption
agency called.

652
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,807
They found your biological parents.
They're in Arizona.

653
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,866
Chloe: Oh my God.
Arizona.

654
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,968
I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

655
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,482
Oh shit. No, no, no.
I was adopted too.

656
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,177
That's sad. I really have
to go deal with this.

657
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,652
- I will call you.
- No, good luck.

658
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,789
Where'd you find
that winner?

659
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,882
I don't even want
to get into it.

660
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,584
Chloe: Why can't I find a guy
who isn't romantically retarded?

661
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,527
Someone who will charm
the pants off of me

662
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,693
instead of asking me
to take them off myself.

663
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,999
I thought you didn't want
to get into this.

664
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,199
I didn't,
but you asked.

665
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,936
I don't need a lot,
you know?

666
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,468
I don't need
a dozen roses.

667
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,176
I just need someone who will pick me
a daisy every once in a while.

668
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,081
And it wouldn't hurt
if he had a job.

669
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,279
I don't care if
he works at Taco Bell.

670
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,049
As long as he works.

671
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,622
And...

672
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,595
Iooks good in a suit.

673
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,225
And can ride a skateboard.

674
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,132
Make me laugh.

675
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:09,071
And when I look into
his eyes, I just want to--

676
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,734
I want that thing,
you know? I want to feel--

677
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,073
I want to become...

678
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,635
dreamy.

679
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,909
Dreamy? Wow.

680
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,316
You think after
the third fucking date,

681
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,549
this guy would know
the color of my eyes.

682
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,023
What color
are my eyes, Sol?

683
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,386
Depends on what time
of day it is.

684
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,761
In the day,
they're like this light...

685
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:39,394
blue with orange tint.

686
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,530
At night
they're like this...

687
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,407
...grayish blue-- depends
on what kind of mood you're in.

688
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,377
When you're mad...

689
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,414
...they're like these...

690
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,917
...cat eyes.
These weird cat eyes.

691
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,452
( sighs )

692
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,354
That's what
I'm talking about.

693
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,960
What?

694
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,531
What?

695
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,246
Come here, "Tiger."

696
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,685
Oh, this is comfortable.

697
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,355
Shit.

698
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,397
Hey, where's Justin?

699
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,295
He's in the back.

700
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,766
God.

701
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,736
I am going to kick his ass.

702
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,898
Hey. What are you doing?

703
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,499
Weren't you wondering
where I was?

704
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,477
Of course I was wondering
where you were.

705
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,877
- Where have you been?
- I want to go.

706
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,078
- Brenda, you just got here.
- I know. And now I want to go!

707
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,815
- But I'm having fun.
- Well, congratulations!

708
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,325
Justin, look.
I'm having my period.

709
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,383
Don't be difficult.

710
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,621
No, you can't do that.

711
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,960
- What?
- Last week you were PMS-ing,

712
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,225
this week you're on the rag.

713
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,325
You can't be a bitch
two weeks out of the month.

714
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,336
If you're using
your period card one week,

715
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,372
you can't use your PMS card
the next week.

716
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,238
It's not fair.
It's one or the other.

717
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,279
You're so cute.

718
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,214
I love it when you get mad.

719
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,080
I'll tell you what.

720
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,517
If we go right now,

721
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,782
I'll let you do anything
you want to me.

722
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,982
You said you were
on your period.

723
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,584
I know. Today
was my last day.

724
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,253
Anything?

725
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,730
Anything.

726
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,666
I feel like
I'm 1 0 years old.

727
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,107
( moans )

728
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,667
That's the point, baby.

729
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,078
You like sucking
on that lolly?

730
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,809
Yeah.

731
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,908
Now say it.

732
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,055
Daddy, I finished
all my homework.

733
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,655
Did you eat all
your vegetables today, baby?

734
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,794
Yes.

735
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,563
( moans )

736
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,763
And what's Daddy's
number-one rule?

737
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,238
Don't tell Mommy.

738
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,299
( moans )

739
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,469
Oh, good girl.

740
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,069
Good little girl.

741
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,547
- You're a pervert.
- I know.

742
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,220
Sweetie, did you
brush your teeth?

743
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,720
Of course.

744
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,860
Did you wash your hands?

745
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,902
Oh, come on, Brenda.

746
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:03,099
If you're going to touch me,
I need your hands to be clean.

747
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,084
- I'm going to come.
- Not in me.

748
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,025
- Come on, Brenda. Please?
- No. I said--

749
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,156
- Just this once.
- No, no.

750
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:32,225
Okay, baby. Okay.
All right, I'll pull out.

751
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,668
No, no, no-- not on me.

752
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,433
Come on, Brenda. Please?

753
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,530
- No.
- Just this once.

754
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,006
No.

755
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,441
Okay, baby.
I'll just put it--

756
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,773
Not near me.

757
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,576
Not in me, not on me,
not near me?

758
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,741
What do you want to do?

759
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,718
What if we don't come
at all, Poo-Poo?

760
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,277
Huh? Huh?

761
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,754
What?

762
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:53,915
Oh God.

763
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,186
- Oh God.
- Oh no.

764
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,626
( moans )

765
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,697
( machine beeps )

766
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,198
Sol, this is Mr. Hockman.

767
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,733
You owe money
very much for rent.

768
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,666
- If you do not pay--
- Oh fuck.

769
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,672
Angie.

770
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,835
( phone beeps )

771
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:18,280
Angie, Sol.
What are you doing?

772
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,783
So, I guess you're in
for the night?

773
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,480
Katy, Sol.
What are you doing?

774
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,749
Really?

775
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,656
China, it's Sol.
Pick up-- you there?

776
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,320
I know you're there.
Pick up.

777
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:35,024
Hey, Jenny. It's Sol.
What are you doing?

778
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,033
Oh he is?

779
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,001
Okay. Bye.

780
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,833
- Voice: Call her.
- Voice #2: Just call her. Why not?

781
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,568
- Come on. Call her.
- Tammie is not the option.

782
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,473
- Voices: No, no.
- Fuck it.

783
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,804
Tammie: Hello?

784
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,442
Hey, Tammie.
What are you doing?

785
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,679
Getting laid was the last thing
on my mind, all right?

786
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,587
I'm too tired. Jesus.

787
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,249
I just wanted to talk.

788
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,723
So what do you want
to talk about?

789
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,322
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

790
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,265
Don't stop, don't stop,
don't stop.

791
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,030
Don't stop. What?

792
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,731
I can't believe you, Sol.
You're never going to change.

793
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,398
What are you
talking about?

794
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,534
Sol, you just don't get it.

795
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,272
You've never taken me out.
You only call me at 2:00am.

796
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,144
I'm sick of it. You treat me
like some cheap hooker.

797
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,014
- I want to be taken out.
- I've taken you out.

798
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,212
You name one time
that you've taken me out.

799
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,653
We went to the movies once.

800
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,988
That doesn't count.
I ran into you at the movies.

801
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,994
Yeah, but we sat together.

802
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,361
Until you take me out on a proper
date, I don't want to know you.

803
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,024
Fine. If you want
to go out,

804
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,863
Iet's go, right now!

805
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,369
It's 3:00am.
Give me a break.

806
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,030
All right.

807
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,870
You want
to go out on a date.

808
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,911
- Let's do it.
- When?

809
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,039
Be here
tomorrow at 8:00.

810
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,875
You can not be seen
in public with her.

811
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,318
Don't you think
I know this?

812
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,551
I've got one word for you--
Schlomo's.

813
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,525
Schlomo's?

814
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,788
My grandparents
go to Schlomo's.

815
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,889
Exactly. Take her to the one
in the valley, then nobody sees you.

816
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:21,529
Right. See,
that's why I love you.

817
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,630
Sol: Oh, boy.

818
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:28,007
Cooper has arrived,
ladies and gentleman.

819
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,103
What do you got, Coop?

820
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,111
I've got such a bang over.

821
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,746
I fucked the hottest chick
on the planet last night.

822
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,756
Cooper: I might end up
marrying this girl.

823
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:44,157
You hit that shit the first night
and you think she's wife material?

824
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,594
Chloe, if you knew
the route I took,

825
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,291
it could have hit you too.

826
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,925
- Doubtful.
- Anyway,

827
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,868
I went with the "I was abused
as a child" route.

828
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,906
Shit works every time.

829
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:59,340
They see you're sensitive,
vulnerable...

830
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,174
and mysterious 'cause
you got a fucked up past.

831
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,010
I might have to marry
this chick,

832
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,915
just to wake up
to her name.

833
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,920
- Treasure.
- Treasure who?

834
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,822
Just Treasure.
She's a one-namer.

835
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,884
- The one on the Diesel billboards?
- That's right.

836
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,793
The chick that denied you
last night?

837
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,297
- They call me the comeback kid...
- You're right,

838
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:26,029
- they just don't call you at all.
- You don't believe me?

839
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,263
Smell that.

840
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,830
- Oh my God. That--
- What?

841
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,274
Cooper...

842
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,108
- you're claiming the Diesel chick.
- Yeah.

843
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,375
You'll need proof
of purchase on this one.

844
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,747
I'll get you proof
of purchase tonight.

845
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,577
Happy, what happened
to you last night?

846
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,520
Sol:
Look at fucking Diggler.

847
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,184
- How you hitting them, player?
- Hi.

848
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,557
Did you get what
you deserve last night?

849
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,462
- What?
- Did you kill it?

850
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,398
I think what he's trying to say is,
did you get any last night?

851
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,631
Oh. I don't really kiss
and tell.

852
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,229
Did you fucking
N-n-n-n-n last night?

853
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,275
A little bit of N-n-n-n right there?
A little N-n-n-n-n-n-n?

854
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,573
Cooper. What, you like 40?
Would you grow up already?

855
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,876
Happy. I'm sorry,
these guys...

856
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,779
they don't get any,
so when they do,

857
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,648
they don't kiss and tell,
they kiss and yell.

858
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,450
Shit, I get more ass than
a toilet seat at the Lilith Fair.

859
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:19,579
Bernie Best's office.
Can you please hold?

860
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,592
Bernie Best's office.
Can you please hold?

861
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,458
Bernie Best's office.
Can you please hold?

862
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,089
Sol, I'm working.
Why don't you try it sometime?

863
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,963
Call me later. Bernie Best's office,
thank you for holding.

864
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,503
Hey, Sid. Hold on, let me see
if I can get her.

865
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,505
- Sid on line one.
- Speak to Regina.

866
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,772
- Sid on line one.
- I said no.

867
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,008
Sid? She's stuck in the canyons,
can I take a message?

868
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,277
I'll have
my boy call you.

869
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,751
Okay, bye.
Thank you for holding.

870
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,617
Hey, Mr. Stone.
Hold on one second.

871
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,021
Oliver Stone on three.

872
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,321
I have to go.
I'll talk to you later.

873
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,827
Oliver. Hi.

874
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,888
What's the good word,
my friend?

875
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,058
Of course, I read your script.

876
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,134
Let me get my notes.

877
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,536
Okay? Hold on one sec.

878
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,575
- Jimmy? Jimmy?
- Yeah?

879
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,077
I need coverage on the script
I gave you to read last night.

880
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,351
It flowed really well.
Really memorable characters.

881
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,410
A definite actor's piece.
A fantastic read.

882
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,889
Oliver? First of all,
can I just tell you--

883
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,018
I can't remember the last time
I read a script

884
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,258
that flowed this smoothly.
It was brilliant, brilliant.

885
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:38,097
And the characters--
talk about memorable, please.

886
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,500
Yes.

887
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,937
And, I sobbed.

888
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,533
I sobb-- I know it's a comedy.
I sobbed from laughing.

889
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,407
Can we reschedule
for tomorrow?

890
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,277
Who do I think would
be good for the lead?

891
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,748
- Great question.
- Denzel's not available today.

892
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,479
- Can we reschedule for tomorrow?
- Denzel.

893
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,613
Denzel Washington needs
something like this, Oliver.

894
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,816
He would--

895
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,859
of course I know
the character is Vietnamese.

896
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,420
But, you know Denzel,
he's like a chameleon.

897
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,229
What do you think?

898
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,764
- Oliver? Hello?
- ( dial tone )

899
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,171
Oh fuck! Jimmy!

900
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:21,302
Why did you say Denzel when you knew
the character was a gook?

901
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,347
- No, I didn't say Denz--
- You made me look like an idiot!

902
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,575
I didn't say Denzel.
I said Denzel,

903
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,084
- but for rescheduling.
- Shut it, okay?

904
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,145
Shut it, don't speak.
Don't even breathe.

905
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,717
Which reminds me,

906
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:41,254
The Fonz has chronic halitosis
and it's making me nauseous, okay?

907
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:45,893
I won't smell either one of you
til the situation is taken care of.

908
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,496
I'm talking about you.
You've got a foul mouth.

909
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,335
Get it done.

910
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,449
Casting director:
Summer? You're up.

911
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,554
This is what you do
every day?

912
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,062
- I could get used to this.
- Happy, not right now.

913
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,225
I'm trying to concentrate.
I need to book this.

914
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:24,799
Buddy, relax.
It's just a commercial.

915
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,039
- Sol Goode, you're up.
- Yeah.

916
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,047
- Wish me luck.
- Happy: Good luck.

917
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:36,711
Sol, are you here
for the Mentos commercial?

918
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,311
Sure am.

919
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,892
I think
you might be too old.

920
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,019
Blakely Simms?

921
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,892
You're up.

922
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,762
We need a father.
You could be a father. Come on.

923
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,433
Okay.

924
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,167
Are you here
for the Levis commercial?

925
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,875
- Me?
- Casting director: No, you.

926
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,783
No, I'm here waiting
on my cousin, Sol.

927
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,822
Not anymore.
You're coming in on Levis.

928
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,188
Yippie ki yi yay.

929
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,057
There was dialogue?

930
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,325
What's it for?

931
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,998
Levis.

932
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,865
Fucking Levis commercial?

933
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,303
With dialogue?

934
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,536
How do you think you did?

935
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,908
I don't know.
He said I "bookered" it.

936
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,608
You fucking booked it?

937
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,277
- Apparently.
- Fuck!

938
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:46,118
- Are you mad?
- I'm not mad. I'm psyched for you.

939
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,384
You've been in this town
five fucking minutes,

940
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,120
you're booking commercials.
I'm fucking happy.

941
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,822
I think that's fucking great.

942
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:54,363
You know what?
He got lucky... it happens.

943
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,957
It doesn't happen,
all right? Not to me.

944
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,971
Maybe I suck. Chloe?

945
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,439
- Do I suck?
- No.

946
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,306
I haven't seen you in much,
but I'm sure you're great.

947
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:11,279
- You'd tell me if I sucked, though?
- Of course.

948
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,283
Maybe my dad's right. Maybe--

949
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,786
maybe I should give it up.

950
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,051
Have you ever thought
about doing anything else?

951
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,217
I don't know
what else I would do.

952
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,193
- ( cell phone rings )
- Hold on.

953
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,561
Hello? Yeah, I'll hold.

954
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,796
It's my agent. Maybe I booked.
Please, God, please.

955
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,736
Hey, George.

956
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,934
No, no, no. Listen,
I knew it was a comedy.

957
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,943
I wanted to go
the other way with it.

958
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,343
I wanted to show them
my range.

959
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,544
Come on, man. I know it's been
a few years. Give me a chance.

960
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,586
Okay.

961
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,420
- Chloe: What's up?
- I just got dropped by my agent.

962
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,757
- I'm losing my house.
- And there goes your car.

963
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,127
No! No!

964
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,826
No! Hey!

965
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,767
Hey! No!

966
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,304
Fuck!

967
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,911
- What's this?
- Nothing.

968
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,946
- Chloe: What are you doing?
- What?

969
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,382
Put down the bong.

970
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,818
I know you don't want
to hear it,

971
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,120
but you have to face it.
You just...

972
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,717
can't keep running
away from everything.

973
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:37,198
God, you have more potential
than anyone I know.

974
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,430
Everything you want
is right in front of you.

975
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,405
All you have to do
is go out and get it.

976
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
But you expect everything
to come to you.

977
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:49,334
- That is not how life works.
- Chloe, that is fucking bullshit.

978
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,211
- I'm out there busting my ass--
- Busting your ass.

979
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,274
Right, because your biggest
responsibility every day is--

980
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,287
is where to eat lunch? Or how
to get a girl out of your bed?

981
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:05,586
- I've gotta go.
- What do you mean, go?

982
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:08,096
We're having a discussion.
Let's finish.

983
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:13,700
I would love to finish this,
but I have to get to work.

984
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,623
What else could possibly
go wrong?

985
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,161
( knock on door )

986
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,300
This ride's
pretty sweet, huh?

987
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:56,271
A few promotional stops once
in a while and this baby-- whoo!

988
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:00,043
As good as mine. I might
be able to hook you up.

989
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,678
- No, I'm good.
- Cool.

990
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,282
Sol?

991
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,061
Hey, Sol!

992
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,159
Sol? Sol?

993
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,001
Sol, I think
that girl knows you.

994
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,267
Angie.

995
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,809
Whose car is that?

996
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,808
It's my friend Tammie's.

997
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,349
- Hi.
- Hey.

998
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,046
Call me.

999
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,856
Actually, I have
to make a quick stop.

1000
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:43,858
A stop?

1001
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,361
No, we don't have
time for a stop.

1002
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,922
It will only take two seconds.
It's right up here.

1003
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:02,171
What's up, everybody? This is
"Spider" and you're back in the web.

1004
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:05,043
We're here in Los Angeles at
yet another Red Bull Undercover.

1005
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,583
You know the dealio.
Any minute now a major rock band

1006
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,312
will hit the stage.
I don't know who it is.

1007
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:13,049
You don't know who it is. Maybe
some of these crazy people know.

1008
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,886
Anybody know?
Is that the band?

1009
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,687
No, that is Red Bull,

1010
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,661
supplying unneeded energy boost
to these rabid fans.

1011
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,697
Let's see what our little
sponsor knows.

1012
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,528
- Two seconds.
- What are you talking about?

1013
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,431
- We have to go.
- Spider: Excuse me? Excuse me?

1014
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,494
- What are you doing?
- Oh no! Red Bull!

1015
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,665
Come and get it!

1016
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,471
Here you go, Red Bull.
Here you go, Red Bull.

1017
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,069
Come on. Get your Red Bull.
You want the Red Bull?

1018
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,583
Want some of that?
Want some of that right there?

1019
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,643
- Want that right there?
- Spider: Excuse me, Mr. Red Bull?

1020
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,315
Excuse me, sir?
Do you know who the band is?

1021
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,551
- Or where the band is?
- I don't know anything.

1022
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,491
He's shy,
ladies and gentleman.

1023
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,223
Oh shit.

1024
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,231
Hey, Mom! Hey!

1025
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,462
- Hello?
- Why are you wearing my shirt?

1026
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,436
- What?
- You heard me.

1027
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,597
I thought you had dinner with
your grandparents tonight.

1028
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,834
I am. I'm with them
right now.

1029
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,742
Don't lie to me. You're going
public with Tammie right now.

1030
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,210
- How do you know?
- Cooper: How do I know?

1031
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,480
- I'm watching you on TV.
- What? No, no, no!

1032
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,021
And for all those people
that aren't watching,

1033
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,887
I just might have
to hit record.

1034
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,860
Proof of purchase. I've got
your proof of purchase, dog.

1035
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,864
- Bye bye.
- Wait. Wait.

1036
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,135
- Oh shit.
- Tammie: Red Bull!

1037
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:41,441
- There you are.
- Hey, Happy. What's up?

1038
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:46,710
- What are you studying?
- Freud's psychosexual stages.

1039
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,308
I won't even ask.

1040
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,187
I'll let you get back
to your studying.

1041
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,158
I've had enough studying
for one day.

1042
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,128
Do you want to grab
a drink or something?

1043
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,959
- Sure. Love a drink.
- Chloe: All right.

1044
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,771
Hi. Welcome to Schlomo's.

1045
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,209
Have you decided
what kind of-- hi.

1046
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,179
- Hi.
- Waiter: Hi.

1047
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,982
Dude.

1048
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,918
What can I get
for you, ma'am?

1049
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,054
What's the best thing
on the menu?

1050
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:35,626
I really like uh--
these--

1051
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,936
the-- the uh--
the gefilte fish.

1052
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,438
- Ugh, fish.
- You don't like fish.

1053
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,669
- I don't like fish either.
- Man, we're on a date.

1054
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,541
Yeah, exactly.
How about the chicken?

1055
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,671
- Waiter: You like chicken?
- Tammie: I don't do meat.

1056
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,376
- Chicken schnitzel.
- I don't do meat.

1057
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,215
- All right.
- Huh-huh.

1058
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,380
I'll just have--

1059
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,686
I'll have
a Long Island iced tea.

1060
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:02,884
Coming right up.

1061
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,657
Waiter:
And for you, sir?

1062
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:13,402
Dude. Sol? Sol Goode?

1063
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,371
Hey... Murphy, right?

1064
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,466
Yeah, man.
Man, you and Cooper, man,

1065
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,239
you fucked my sister
on the 50-yard line.

1066
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,407
You remember?

1067
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,951
Dude, "Nicole the Hole."

1068
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,652
Yeah, right.
How's she doing?

1069
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,384
She's rockin'. Rockin'.
She's on the scene.

1070
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,426
Looking clean.

1071
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:41,396
So, what are you doing
on this side of the hill?

1072
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,261
What are you doing
in the valley, Sol?

1073
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,460
Getting a bite to eat.

1074
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,273
Well, what--
what can I get for you?

1075
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,374
I think I'll have
the brisket.

1076
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,383
Brisket.
Cool, bro'. Brisket.

1077
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,478
And Long Island iced tea.
This guy is my hero, bro.

1078
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,716
Fucked my sister.

1079
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,593
« Oooooh, la, la... «

1080
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:17,759
« Oooooh, la, la... «

1081
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:21,429
« Oooooh, la, la... «

1082
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:25,235
« Oooooh, la, la... «

1083
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:30,211
« Oooooh, la, la... «

1084
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,612
Go ahead. You can touch it.

1085
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,242
God, your chest
is so smooth.

1086
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,651
You like that, don't you?
I bet you do.

1087
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,019
Don't be scared.
I'm not going to bite you.

1088
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:49,495
Oh shit. Go for it.
Touch it a little more.

1089
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,591
- Oh, baby.
- Touch my nipple.

1090
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,000
Seriously, I'm not fucking around.
Touch my nipple.

1091
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,597
- What? You're so forward.
- I know I am.

1092
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,343
What was that?

1093
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,145
Just a little party
in a pill, girl.

1094
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,482
It starts with a "V"
and ends with an "A."

1095
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,487
You do the math.

1096
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,250
Virginia?

1097
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,758
- No.
- Treasure's voice: V? V?

1098
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,153
Visa?

1099
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,493
Cooper's voice: How will I get
proof of purchase?

1100
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,623
- Vice versa?
- Sol's voice: Proof of purchase?

1101
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,600
- Viona?
- Proof of purchase?

1102
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,101
- Treasure's voice: Vagina!
- Proof of purchase.

1103
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,876
- What are you doing, you freak?
- What?

1104
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,973
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I was just fucking around.

1105
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,486
Oh God. You know what?
Just take me home.

1106
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,985
- Just take me home, all right?
- Fuck.

1107
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,959
To Sol.

1108
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,462
To Sol. Maybe he'll get
his shit together.

1109
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,590
Yeah.

1110
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,500
Whoo-oo!

1111
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,131
You feeling that?

1112
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,539
Yeah, you want more?

1113
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,668
- Why not?
- Let's go.

1114
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,179
( slurps )

1115
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,114
Listen, Sol,

1116
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,310
I really need to talk to you
about something.

1117
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,820
I think it's time that...

1118
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,448
we started re-evaluating
our relationship.

1119
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,118
Wait, Tammy, hold on,
before you say anything,

1120
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:29,221
- I have something I want to say.
- No, please. Just let me finish.

1121
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,358
I really think
that we should be--

1122
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,870
I mean, I think
I want us to be...

1123
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,271
...well...

1124
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,309
...fuck partners.

1125
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,444
Say what?

1126
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:46,414
You know, FTF,
Friends That Fuck.

1127
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,972
Wait a sec, Tammy,
I'm confused.

1128
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,985
- Last night you were--
- I know, I know, I know...

1129
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,112
Last night I gave you
an ultimatum,

1130
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,348
but I was just testing you.

1131
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,051
Wanted to see if you would show me
the respect of taking me out.

1132
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,923
Sol, you stepped up
to the plate.

1133
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:03,455
What do you think about
non-meaningful sexual relationship?

1134
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,864
( sighs )

1135
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,563
Wow. That's very flattering,

1136
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:12,165
but I got to be
honest with you.

1137
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,575
I don't want something
that isn't meaningful anymore.

1138
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,238
In fact...

1139
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:23,613
I want something
much deeper than that.

1140
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:27,178
That's great, Sol, but do you want
to hear about deeper?

1141
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,814
I'm going to get it
right now

1142
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,621
and I'm going into the handicap
stall in the women's bathroom.

1143
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,321
And if you know
what's good for you,

1144
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,387
you're going to be
right behind me.

1145
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,296
Give it to me, Sol.
Harder.

1146
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,872
Shut up and fuck me.

1147
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,706
Riot pump me.
Riot pump me!

1148
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,018
( cell phone rings )

1149
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,110
- Hello?
- I'll be right back.

1150
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:58,676
- Hey.
- Hey, Sol.

1151
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,052
I'm sorry if
I went hard on you today.

1152
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,924
No, no. Don't apologize.
Thank you. I needed it.

1153
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,758
You won't believe
what happened tonight.

1154
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,196
Sol: I took Tammie
out on a date, right?

1155
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,928
She starts saying how she wants
to take it to the next level.

1156
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,961
Then out of left field, she says
she just wants to be fuck partners.

1157
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,168
And Chloe, you're going
to be so proud of me.

1158
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:24,111
I turned her down.
Said I wasn't doing that anymore.

1159
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,444
All right. Baby steps.

1160
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,711
No, you don't understand.
I get it.

1161
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,753
I get what
you were saying today.

1162
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,653
I feel invigorated.
Like starting my life over.

1163
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:37,124
You'll see. Tomorrow is
the beginning of a brand new Sol.

1164
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,753
I like your enthusiasm,

1165
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:42,024
but can we continue
this conversation tomorrow?

1166
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,861
How come?

1167
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,663
I'm kind of
with somebody right now

1168
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,068
and it's a little rude
to be talking on the phone.

1169
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,902
Who are you with?

1170
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:57,536
- I'm with Happy.
- What are you doing with him?

1171
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,946
I'm just getting
a drink, man.

1172
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,009
When did you guys
start hanging out?

1173
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,020
Tomorrow, Sol.

1174
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:23,765
Radio:
Rise and shine, LA!

1175
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,831
It's 7:00am.

1176
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,138
Time to get a handle on it.
Get on up.

1177
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,509
We have a beautiful
day going.

1178
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,548
( alarm buzzes )

1179
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,551
Oh yeah.

1180
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,505
Okay. Did you bring along
your resume?

1181
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,047
Sure did.

1182
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:11,075
- What's this?
- The resume. It's on the back.

1183
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:17,025
"Return of
the Surf Nazis 4," huh?

1184
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:20,324
Besides that, do you have
any previous work experience?

1185
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,159
You mean, like a real job?

1186
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,324
No, like a pretend job.

1187
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,663
No.

1188
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:31,002
No? Nothing at all?

1189
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,836
Yeah.

1190
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,507
All right. Then what are you
qualified for?

1191
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,311
What aren't I qualified for?
I pretty much do anything.

1192
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,545
Are you proficient
in computer programming?

1193
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,146
You got me on that one.
That's the one thing I can't do.

1194
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,885
- How about clerical work?
- What's that exactly?

1195
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,053
- Typing.
- You got me on that one too.

1196
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:56,690
- I'm just not a great typer.
- Okay. You know what?

1197
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,825
We're not starting off
so good here.

1198
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:03,361
- Do you have any special skills?
- Yeah, it's on the resume.

1199
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,897
Besides Hackeysack
and accents?

1200
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,343
It says you're good at golf.
You like to golf?

1201
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,539
Love golf.

1202
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,447
Oh fuck.

1203
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,952
Okay!

1204
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,686
So what happened,
Mr. Goode?

1205
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,820
Oh just--
it just didn't work out.

1206
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,990
Too bad Bill Gates
is still running Microsoft

1207
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,897
or I would give him a call.

1208
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,993
What else do you have here
on your special skills?

1209
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,767
Okay, it says you're good
at cycling.

1210
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,240
I grew up on a bike,
I mean--

1211
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:44,177
1 0 speed, BMX, you name it,
I can ride anything.

1212
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,306
I'm the master cyclist.

1213
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:52,176
- ( glass breaks )
- ( cat hisses )

1214
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,588
( children laugh )

1215
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,753
Congratulations,
you win first prize.

1216
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,321
We've had more complaints about you
than any other person this month.

1217
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,391
We have a retarded man
named Andy

1218
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,269
who has worked here for 1 2 years
and not had one complaint.

1219
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:13,399
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Yeah.

1220
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,934
All right. Let's look on
the magic special skills thing

1221
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,174
and see what else we have.

1222
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,115
Character work. You're good
at character work, huh?

1223
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,345
Yeah, I mean--

1224
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,388
I don't want
to toot my own horn,

1225
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,582
but I'm sort
of a method actor.

1226
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,354
I can pretty much dive
in any character.

1227
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,420
Let's see one. Let's see a little
one called "I can keep a job."

1228
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:38,797
How about that character?
That's a character I'd like to see.

1229
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:42,599
Something came in and I'm going
to give it to you 'cause I like you.

1230
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,073
I've got a job on the set of
a movie. How does that sound?

1231
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,074
Yeah.

1232
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,441
Good. Do you have
your hepatitis shots?

1233
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,523
Sol?

1234
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,223
Did you book? I booked.
Did you book?

1235
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,832
Good job, man.

1236
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,364
Stop it.

1237
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,411
Stop it. Stop--
come on, that's disgusting.

1238
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,571
Stop it. Fonzie.

1239
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,616
Jimmy. Jimmy!

1240
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,207
Oh Jesus.

1241
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,820
- Were you talking to me?
- Yes, moron, I'm talking to you.

1242
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,756
I'm sorry. I usually
respond to Justin.

1243
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,785
"I usually respond to Justin."
No, asshole, you respond to me.

1244
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,626
Okay?

1245
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,599
Why don't you tell everybody
what you learned today?

1246
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,627
That I should check if the clients
would like something to drink.

1247
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,697
And did you do that?

1248
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:53,707
No.

1249
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,206
No.

1250
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,778
Ask them.

1251
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,876
Would you gentleman
like something to drink?

1252
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,783
H2O is fine.

1253
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,016
Is the water
coming in by itself?

1254
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,891
Now go get the water.

1255
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,056
And put down
the crack pipe.

1256
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,113
Cooper:
All right. Answer me this.

1257
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,847
Would you rather have Tammie
as your girlfriend,

1258
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,821
or knock two inches
off your penis?

1259
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,051
I can't afford
to loose two.

1260
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,061
Ties it up at 1 0 apiece.
The next bucket wins.

1261
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,029
( honking )

1262
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,725
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

1263
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,667
- There's one more point left.
- You're not going anywhere.

1264
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,966
There's money riding on this.
Let's go. Come on.

1265
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,271
Today, Justin!

1266
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:02,367
Oh my God. Today is the day
you should get rid of that bitch.

1267
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,675
( honks )

1268
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,341
- Okay!
- Brenda: Today, Justin!

1269
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,749
All right! Just hold on a sec.
I'll be back in a few.

1270
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,344
The ball, dude.

1271
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,886
Thank you. Softie.

1272
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,892
Where is his sack?

1273
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,860
I think it's hanging
off her muffler.

1274
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:25,857
- Hey, Boo-Boo.
- Get in, I have a surprise for you.

1275
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,769
- What kind of surprise?
- The one you've been waiting for.

1276
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,303
- Are you ready?
- Oh, I'm ready.

1277
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,403
Okay. Close your eyes.

1278
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,847
- We're going to do it right here?
- Right here.

1279
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,315
Oh my God.

1280
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,712
Okay.

1281
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,350
Open your eyes.

1282
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:57,088
- What does that mean?
- It means you're moving in with me.

1283
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,260
- I am?
- Don't you think it's time?

1284
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,304
Don't you think
you should have asked?

1285
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,735
I wanted to surprise you,
Poo-Poo.

1286
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,869
I don't think we should
rush into that just yet.

1287
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,807
Rush into it? Justin...

1288
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:16,647
we're getting married
in less than six months.

1289
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,882
We've been going out
for over 1 0 years.

1290
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:23,914
We'll be spending the rest
of our lives together.

1291
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,655
I just can't pack up
and leave Sol.

1292
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,257
There you go again.
Choosing your friends over me.

1293
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,301
You guys are
in love with each other.

1294
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,462
It makes me fucking sick!

1295
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,473
I'm not saying I'm in love
with them or choosing them.

1296
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,704
I don't think we should
move in together right now.

1297
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:45,406
You know what?
You have a decision to make.

1298
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,349
It's them... or me.

1299
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:52,854
Brenda, that's bullshit.
Don't put me in that position.

1300
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,483
Them or me, Justin!
I mean it!

1301
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:58,083
Now get out!

1302
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,220
- Go!
- I'm going, okay?

1303
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:02,924
- Don't push!
- Jerk!

1304
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,397
Pitch me the fucking rock.

1305
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,337
Cooper:
Come on, Justin!

1306
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,413
Dunk it! Dunk it!

1307
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:23,610
Yo, let's roll tonight.
Boys night out.

1308
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,286
- Can't, I have plans.
- What do you have, a hot date?

1309
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,349
- You guys down?
- I'm down.

1310
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,861
I'm not down.
I don't go out anymore.

1311
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,090
- What? Since when?
- Since right now.

1312
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,326
Besides, I have an appointment
in the morning.

1313
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,368
I'm just done
with this scene, man.

1314
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,666
- Don't be that guy.
- What guy?

1315
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,729
The guy that says
he never goes out,

1316
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,605
- but you see him out every night.
- You mean, like you?

1317
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,270
- Anyway.
- Seriously, I'm feeling it.

1318
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,405
I need to get my flirt on.

1319
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,939
Really? The Therapy is
supposed to be rockin'.

1320
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,679
I say we all take it
to Therapy tonight.

1321
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,381
Therapy sucks. I'm definitely
not going there.

1322
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:03,254
- Why not?
- Too many high-fives.

1323
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,734
It's the same old story.

1324
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,999
I can tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

1325
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:21,236
You'll do a few laps.
Peep some dreck.

1326
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,972
Then you'll get bombarded by
the Colonel promoting another club.

1327
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,276
Coop! Bam!

1328
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:29,613
You'll rush the go-go dancers
and bust the running man.

1329
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,746
Then finally, you'll get blind-sided
by Suzie Bench-press.

1330
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:37,724
Cooper! Hey! Guess what?
I maxed on the bench-press today.

1331
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,091
Sol: And you're going to tell her,
like you always do...

1332
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,653
Susie, that's really great.
But I've got news for you.

1333
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,358
You're cock-blocking me.

1334
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,958
Sol: She won't leave you alone
until you feel her tri.

1335
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,300
You like that, huh?

1336
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,669
Sol: At this point,
you're thinking about hitting it

1337
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,267
till I come into the picture and
bitch-slap you back to reality.

1338
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,446
Oh fuck.

1339
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,482
What are you thinking?

1340
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,449
I don't know.

1341
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,680
- Thank you.
- Now can we leave?

1342
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,587
Oh my God.
Look at lover boy.

1343
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,454
Cooper:
Getting his flirt on.

1344
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,051
- And you used to date that girl.
- Who?

1345
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,995
She never wore
the same outfit twice.

1346
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,364
- The uh-- Brenda.
- What was her name?

1347
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:23,337
Yes, Brenda.
She was such a bitch.

1348
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,533
Oh my God, yes.
Brenda.

1349
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,439
- Yeah, Brenda.
- Do you still see her?

1350
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,444
We're engaged.

1351
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,782
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

1352
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:41,812
- Justin, why would you do that?
- What?

1353
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,450
I love her.

1354
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,518
- I think-- I do.
- Sorry.

1355
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,325
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1356
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:51,525
- I didn't mean that.
- It's okay.

1357
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,966
A lot of people have said
that she's a bitch.

1358
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,061
She's a bitch.

1359
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,203
Jesus. Is everybody
getting some except us?

1360
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,145
I bet Hap drives
his truck through that.

1361
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,729
I don't mean to interrupt
this little love connection,

1362
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,792
but we're out
of here, man.

1363
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,964
You're fucking
cock-blocking right now.

1364
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,038
Just meet us outside,
all right?

1365
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,045
One more.

1366
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,081
Are you crazy?
I just did one.

1367
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,583
- One more.
- Jesus Christ.

1368
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,489
Cheers!
To fucking your face.

1369
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,491
Should we give Amber
a ride home?

1370
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,760
Where she live?

1371
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,860
Where do you live?

1372
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,928
Pasadena.

1373
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,837
Pasadena.

1374
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,468
Pasadena?

1375
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,774
I'm gonna pass
a dena on that.

1376
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,508
I've got a better idea.
Get in.

1377
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,489
Now, don't get scared.

1378
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,670
Oh my God. It's huge.

1379
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,764
Put it inside me.

1380
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,504
I want you to beg.

1381
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:47,379
Please, I need you
inside me, cowboy.

1382
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:51,146
Now that's a good girl.

1383
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,288
God!

1384
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,265
Oh...

1385
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,862
...good. Yes!

1386
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,578
Fuck.

1387
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,961
Morning, Sol.

1388
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,527
What are you doing up?

1389
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,835
When did you start smoking?

1390
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,836
Cat got your tongue?

1391
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,772
Did you fuck her?

1392
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,440
What?

1393
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,248
Did you fuck Chloe?

1394
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,786
We're just friends, Sol.

1395
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,985
Relax.

1396
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,324
Don't give me
that friends shit.

1397
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,388
You're a dog. We both know it.
Now answer the question.

1398
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,957
Jesus. Nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.

1399
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:18,234
I'm not. Just answer
the question. Did you?

1400
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:22,209
I didn't fuck her. I didn't do
anything with her.

1401
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,040
I don't want you guys
hanging out together.

1402
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,104
- Why not?
- Because.

1403
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:30,549
Because? Now there's
a valid reason.

1404
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:34,578
What I don't understand
is why you even care.

1405
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,419
I'm just protecting her,
all right?

1406
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,118
From what?

1407
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:41,492
- From getting hurt.
- Oh, I see.

1408
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,928
I see what this is
all about.

1409
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,695
What?

1410
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,271
You like her. You have
feelings for Chloe.

1411
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,773
Please.
She's like my sister.

1412
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,173
Yeah, I know.

1413
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

1414
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,418
Oh my God, Sol.
Have you seen Justin?

1415
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:10,254
He never called me last night.
He never misses our 11:00pm call.

1416
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,190
- Brenda, Brenda.
- Yeah?

1417
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,559
It's okay.
He's upstairs. Asleep.

1418
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,360
- Asleep?
- Yeah.

1419
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,001
Oh.

1420
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,710
What the fuck?

1421
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,618
Huh? Wha--?

1422
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,952
Ewe.

1423
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:45,323
Is that Amber Stevens?

1424
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:48,830
What is that skank
doing in your bed?

1425
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,388
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1426
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,900
There's a fucking slut
in your bed

1427
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,994
and you don't know
how she got there?

1428
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,732
Brenda, I swear to God.

1429
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,297
I don't know how this fucking
skank got in my bed.

1430
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,935
I was so fucked up
last night.

1431
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,479
- Fucked up?
- When I came home.

1432
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:11,051
- Did you fuck her?
- No! I mean--

1433
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,915
I don't know.

1434
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:19,120
No, no. Don't be a fucking
pussy right now, Justin.

1435
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,719
- You tell me the truth.
- I am telling you the truth.

1436
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:25,631
If you tell me the truth right now,
I promise that I won't be mad.

1437
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,601
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

1438
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,933
- Brenda: I don't believe you!
- I am telling you the truth.

1439
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,530
- Liar!
- Okay. All right.

1440
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,270
- You want to know the truth?
- Yeah!

1441
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,903
All right.

1442
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,419
It just happened.

1443
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:54,526
- Oh my God.
- I don't know what to say.

1444
01:18:55,964 --> 01:19:00,162
I gave you 1 0 years
of my fucking life!

1445
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,838
Fuck.

1446
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,204
Okay.

1447
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,470
You will never...

1448
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:13,036
find anyone
as good as me, Justin.

1449
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,583
Have a nice life,

1450
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:21,020
you small-dicked, hairy-assed,
fucking shit-face.

1451
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,727
I have to take a shit.

1452
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:39,903
Really?

1453
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,080
( cell phone rings )

1454
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,116
- Hello?
- Sol: It's me.

1455
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,549
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get out of here.

1456
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,587
When you get off, is there
any way you could

1457
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:55,555
- meet me at the Top of the World?
- Top of the World? Why?

1458
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,957
- I'll tell you when I see you.
- All right.

1459
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:09,101
What's with the suit?
Did somebody die?

1460
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,038
I was trying to tell you
the other night but...

1461
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:14,234
you were too busy.

1462
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:17,870
I-- I've been
interviewing for a job.

1463
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,006
- Impressive. And?
- And...

1464
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:23,915
it's tough.
But I'll find something.

1465
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:28,216
I must say, you look
pretty good in a suit.

1466
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,017
Do you remember the first time
we came up here?

1467
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:37,298
Barely.
How high did we get?

1468
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,060
Retarded.

1469
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:43,470
Here, this is for you.

1470
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,564
What's going on?
Why are you acting so weird?

1471
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,104
Chloe.

1472
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,179
I've--

1473
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,845
I've been thinking a lot.
Thinking about us.

1474
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,115
Is everything okay?

1475
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,426
I love you.

1476
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,519
There, I said it.

1477
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,156
That's really adorable.
I love you too. There, I said it.

1478
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,998
No, Chloe...

1479
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,403
I love you.

1480
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,268
Is this a joke?

1481
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,683
What are we doing?

1482
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:39,488
This isn't--
this isn't right. What--?

1483
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:43,019
- Why are you doing this?
- You don't understand.

1484
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,431
I do understand
because I was there.

1485
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,628
What do you mean,
you were there?

1486
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:54,005
Sol, you are so fucking blind.
Do you know that?

1487
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:58,374
I finally accept that
we're just going to be friends,

1488
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:00,880
and then you throw this
at me. It's not fair.

1489
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:03,747
You can't decide
you want to be with me

1490
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,615
just because you think
I'm with somebody else.

1491
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,951
This has nothing to do
with somebody else.

1492
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:11,686
This about you and me.
We're perfect together.

1493
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,897
What about...

1494
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,489
...when it doesn't work out?

1495
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,761
Have you thought about that?
About our friendship?

1496
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,235
Look, give me a chance.

1497
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,035
Give us a chance
and then we'll know.

1498
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:29,406
If it doesn't work out,
we'll never have to wonder.

1499
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,377
We deserve that, Chloe.

1500
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,644
Why me?

1501
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,207
Why?

1502
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:41,119
Because I can spend
all day with you

1503
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,056
and then actually want to spend
all night with you too.

1504
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:48,653
I like who I am with you. I can act
stupid and not feel stupid.

1505
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:51,893
Because you know every
Jimi Hendrix song.

1506
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:57,064
Because you don't try to look
beautiful, you just are.

1507
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,269
Because
you're my best friend.

1508
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,276
I can't.

1509
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:18,324
Chloe? I'm the guy
you're supposed to be with.

1510
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:21,988
« There's no coming back
from where we've been «

1511
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,965
« You're saying different
people change, get it «

1512
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:32,598
« What's the point in
letting me find out like that? «

1513
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,539
« Yeah «

1514
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:44,843
« Well, this is something
that they don't advise «

1515
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:48,411
« Communication
is the only relation «

1516
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:51,254
« So why «

1517
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:55,763
« Did I find out like that? «

1518
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,321
« Yeah. «

1519
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,672
Good morning, Burns.

1520
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,682
Not for you.

1521
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,053
Hey, Charlie.
How are you feeling?

1522
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,487
Stephanie.
Oh shit. Oh shit.

1523
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,492
Hey, Phil.
How's your stool, fool?

1524
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:30,088
( distant yelling )

1525
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,499
Fahim, much love, brother.
Keep fighting the good fight.

1526
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,231
Hey, Carrie.

1527
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,441
Bernie? Before you say anything,
I'm so sorry.

1528
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,977
I've worked here for two years
and I've never even been late.

1529
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,343
But this morning was
the craziest of my life.

1530
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,882
- My fiancée just broke up--
- You know what?

1531
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:51,544
Save it for someone
who cares, okay?

1532
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:54,053
The only thing
I care about right now

1533
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,091
is why the Fonz
isn't eating his food.

1534
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,922
What's the matter, baby?

1535
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:01,962
Yes, Momma's talking
about you.

1536
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,557
What's the matter?
You got a sour tummy?

1537
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:10,271
Maybe he caught your irritable
bowel syndrome thing.

1538
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,272
He only eats people food.

1539
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:16,139
Which is why we have
to trick him.

1540
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:19,374
Now, if he sees you eating
some of his kibble,

1541
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:23,110
he'll be all over it.
Jimmy...

1542
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,914
do me a solid.
Eat some of his kibble.

1543
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:28,387
Are you serious?

1544
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,319
Yes, I'm serious.

1545
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,327
- You want me to eat dog food?
- It's just kibble.

1546
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,722
He'd do it for you.

1547
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,170
No, no, no! What are you doing?
Not like that.

1548
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,433
You have to get on your hands
and knees like a dog.

1549
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:52,674
He won't eat it otherwise.
He's not stupid.

1550
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,908
I'm not getting
on my hands and knees.

1551
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:58,612
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1552
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,177
I'm going to give you
to the count of three.

1553
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,191
Okay? One, two...

1554
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,290
three.
Eat the fucking dog food!

1555
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:13,697
- You eat it.
- Listen, you little fuck!

1556
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:16,931
You work for me, okay?
You're my bitch.

1557
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,566
If I tell you to get on your hands
and knees, you better do it.

1558
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,872
Now eat the fucking
dog food.

1559
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:27,142
First of all,
I'm not your bitch!

1560
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:30,844
Second of all, I didn't spend
two fucking years in that mail room

1561
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:34,218
to eat your fucking
mutt's dog food. Okay?

1562
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:37,454
You know what?

1563
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,220
I quit.

1564
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:43,726
Yes! That's what
I'm talking about.

1565
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:47,962
Finally somebody found
some fucking balls around here!

1566
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,504
Now you're acting
like an agent, Jimmy!

1567
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:53,370
I almost find you
attractive.

1568
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:54,908
You know what?

1569
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,512
I'm making you
an agent by next week.

1570
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,243
How's that? You can tell
your buddies that on your way out.

1571
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,751
Now go find me
a new assistant.

1572
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:08,722
Find your own assistant,
Bernie.

1573
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:12,288
I'm out.

1574
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,258
Don't make me count again.

1575
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:21,098
Jimmy. One! Two!

1576
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,568
( phone rings )

1577
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,766
Can someone get my phones?

1578
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,398
« It's impossible «

1579
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,709
« I know what you're thinking «

1580
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:37,149
« 'Cause some things
you can't revise «

1581
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:39,015
« I don't know
where to go «

1582
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,181
« I only need
to feel something «

1583
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,885
- « Give me one more-- «
- I did it.

1584
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,519
I got my fucking balls back.

1585
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,723
I don't know where they'd been,
but I just got them back.

1586
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:53,562
- I just quit the agency.
- You did?

1587
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,227
Hell yeah, I did.

1588
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,601
Who was I kidding?
Trying to be somebody I'm not.

1589
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:01,438
I'm not like those people.
I fucking hate those people.

1590
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:04,273
Anyway, man. Thank you.

1591
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:07,246
For looking out for me.
I appreciate it.

1592
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:10,409
Oh, hey. This is for you.
It was on the front door.

1593
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:13,019
I have to take a shit.

1594
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,926
"Dear Cousin Sol, I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

1595
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:27,195
But more importantly, I didn't get
to say thank you for everything.

1596
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,998
But I think it's time
I handed in my hall pass.

1597
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,802
And I think it's time for you
to open your eyes.

1598
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:37,174
And when you do, you'll find
the gift you've always wanted.

1599
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,873
She's always been there
and she always will be.

1600
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,972
Say goodbye
to the boys for me.

1601
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,018
Take care. Happy.

1602
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:47,111
PS: They said I should be
receiving some residuals soon.

1603
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,850
I hope this helps you get
through the month."

1604
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,742
Hey.

1605
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,754
Hey.

1606
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,191
How are you doing?

1607
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,852
Fine.

1608
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:35,025
I'm sorry I made you feel
uncomfortable yesterday.

1609
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:38,129
It was selfish of me to think
that you'd drop everything

1610
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,766
and be with me just because
I wanted you to be.

1611
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:46,980
It's just that everything
in my life right now is wrong.

1612
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,073
You're the only thing
that's right.

1613
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,782
I don't even deserve you.

1614
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,452
But, I'm going to get it
together and I just hope

1615
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:01,358
that when the time's right,

1616
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,397
you'll be there.

1617
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:10,600
That's all I wanted to say.

1618
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,333
« Life is short enough «

1619
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,141
« Are you feeling lonely? «

1620
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,511
« Do you just want
to spend your time «

1621
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:24,176
« With someone that can
read your mind? «

1622
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:28,916
« There's no postcards when
you're floating out this far «

1623
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,618
« And for the last time «

1624
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:35,025
« I want to feel something «

1625
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,930
« Like a wave
on the ocean «

1626
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:44,265
« Wash away the old divide «

1627
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,568
« It's impossible «

1628
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:50,008
« I know what
you're thinking «

1629
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:54,013
« 'Cause some things
you can't revive «

1630
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,844
« Don't know where to go «

1631
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:59,353
« Only need
to feel something. «

1632
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,397
Announcer: And here we are
in the last inning, folks.

1633
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:18,735
Foothill trails
this ballgame, five to two.

1634
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:21,502
There are two outs
and the bases are loaded.

1635
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:24,739
A home run could win
this ballgame.

1636
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:27,914
Strike!

1637
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:31,577
Bullshit!
That was outside! You suck!

1638
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:35,088
I suck? You couldn't hit
your way out of a paper bag,

1639
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,522
- you little punk.
- You suck.

1640
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:40,322
Say it again. I dare you.

1641
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,261
That's what I thought.
Play ball!

1642
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,531
Yeah! Ha ha!

1643
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,267
That's for you, old man!

1644
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:58,307
- Foul ball!
- Announcer: Oh, foul ball!

1645
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:01,280
That brings the count
to zero and two.

1646
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:05,945
Calling this ball game,
third generation umpire, Sol Goode.

1647
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:15,562
Strike three! You're out!

1648
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,996
Announcer:
This ballgame is over, folks.

1649
01:32:18,065 --> 01:32:20,659
- Immortal wins, five to two.
- No!

1650
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,635
That's my dog right there.

1651
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:39,152
- Not bad for a rookie.
- I told you it was in your blood.

1652
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,314
Sol, I have something for you.

1653
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,416
This has been in our family
for three generations now.

1654
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:47,757
It's protected us well.

1655
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:57,461
Thanks, Dad.

1656
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:04,336
I'm proud of you, Sol.
I'm proud of you.

1657
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,772
Hey, Ump.

1658
01:33:08,182 --> 01:33:10,116
You called a good game.

1659
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:21,892
- You were right.
- About what?

1660
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,488
You are the man
I'm supposed to be with.

1661
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:53,492
« Dream away,
dream away, dreamer «

1662
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:56,826
« Fly away,
lifetime screamer «

1663
01:33:56,897 --> 01:34:01,391
« Satellite watching
from up above «

1664
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:07,235
« Late at night,
causing the streetlights «

1665
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:10,744
« Celebrate life
in the firefight «

1666
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:14,907
« Every night taking
all my love «

1667
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:21,046
« Dream away,
dream away, dreamer. «

1668
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,283
What are you doing?

1669
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:28,590
- Um-- I have to go to work.
- I thought you had the day off.

1670
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,155
I did, but I promised somebody
I'd cover their shift.

1671
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:36,226
- You have to go right now?
- Uh-huh. I do, but...

1672
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:40,000
thanks for last night.
And I'll call you.

1673
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:52,045
Did I just get POD'd?

1674
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,382
Gotcha.

1675
01:34:55,756 --> 01:35:00,523
« Satellite is always
watching over you «

1676
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:07,063
« Satellite is watching
everything you do. «

1677
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,650
( man clears throat )

1678
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,553
Thanks for
letting me crash, dude.

1679
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,317
It's cool.

1680
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:34,584
Don't tell anybody, okay?

1681
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:41,896
Don't tell anybody what?

1682
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:43,766
Nothing.

1683
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:51,501
Are you kidding me,
dude?

1684
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,177
Okay.

1699
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,759

01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:00,441
What's the best thing

1710
01:37:16,597 --> 01:37:18,588
Chloe: What is that?

1711
