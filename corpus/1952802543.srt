1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,954
<i>If you fall, you'll be fine...</i>

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,848
<i>I will put you back together...</i>

3
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,029
<i>If you thought you're alone...</i>

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,373
<i>Then you couldn't be
more wrong...</i>

5
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:38,854
<i>If you look to your side...</i>

6
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:42,540
<i>I'll be there, and we'll
just be fine...</i>

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,363
<i>If you thought you
were wrong...</i>

8
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:51,119
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,366
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,426
<i>If you fall, you'll be fine...</i>

11
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,255
<i>I will put you back together...</i>

12
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:21,676
<i>If you thought you're alone...</i>

13
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,352
<i>Then you couldn't be
more wrong...</i>

14
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,195
<i>If you look to your side...</i>

15
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:32,736
<i>I'll be there, and we'll
just be fine...</i>

16
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:38,453
<i>If you fall behind...</i>

17
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,408
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

18
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:48,373
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

19
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,963
<i>Nobody likes a sad song...</i>

20
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:57,971
<i>Everyone wants a
happy ending...</i>

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,263
<i>Nobody likes a sad song...</i>

22
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:07,190
<i>Everyone wants a
happy ending...</i>

23
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,896
Come on...

24
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,648
Oh, come on!

25
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,800
- Ethan?
- Catie... Where's Suzie?

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,374
She's not here.

27
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,388
- I know she doesn't want to see me, but if you just...
- No, Ethan...

28
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,383
...she's really not here.

29
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,180
Catie.

30
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,224
I love her.

31
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:44,767
Please.

32
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:48,606
She loves you too, but she has
already left for the airport.

33
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,024
You'll never gonna
make it in time!

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,798
Can I help you?

35
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,481
I thought you
were leaving.

36
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,640
I thought I would.

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,475
I love you.

38
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,022
You know Suzie, life doesn't give
you a lot of second chances.

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,009
And if I've learned anything, I've learned that
you've got to make the most of the moment...

40
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,990
No!

41
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,499
Honey, it just feels
'formulate' to me.

42
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,125
This is the kind of stuff that
happens in every love story...

43
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,925
...but this is not the kind of
stuff that happens in real life.

44
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:54,755
But it is not real.
It's a... story.

45
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,006
For someone who has never
published anything before...

46
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:02,430
If you want to break through, you've
got to do something with 'heart'.

47
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:07,394
Something with sincerity, something
that feels like you really mean it.

48
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:11,228
Even in a romance,
it has to feel realistic.

49
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:14,108
That's what I'm trying to do,
draw from real life...

50
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,404
...model the character after my
own experience.

51
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:18,283
That's another problem.

52
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:22,281
That's just not the kind
of 'reality' I'm talking about.

53
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,327
Don't get me wrong...

54
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,660
You seems like a
very nice kid.

55
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:32,789
But for your leading man, even...
you need a 'leading man'!

56
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:36,668
You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident...

57
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,047
...and charismatic,
and sexy.

58
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,384
No offense. In real life,
girls end up settling for...

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,220
...nice guys all the time but
you see, even this is my point.

60
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:52,767
This is why they go to the movies and
they need to read the romance novels.

61
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,193
They want to read them
because they want to see...

62
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:59,114
...girls like them fallin' in love
with guys who aren't like you!

63
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:04,703
Okay, so, you're telling me you wanted
to be realistic, but 'not' realistic.

64
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:05,997
Exactly.

65
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:07,788
I don't understand.

66
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,833
Ethan, your writing
is not bad.

67
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,831
It's pretty good, actually.
It's funny!

68
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:14,923
Thank you.

69
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:18,427
It's just not something
we can publish.

70
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,139
Ethan...

71
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,096
I've been watching you coming here
for a long time, trying to make...

72
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:29,688
...something happen, and I have to
tell you it's just not happening.

73
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,187
I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,647
Please... There's got to
be something else I can do.

75
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,733
Of course, there is so much
stuff that you can do.

76
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,285
You are young...

77
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:43,414
...and you have the whole future ahead
of you to figure out what to do...

78
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,123
...but just don't... don't
get hung up on writing.

79
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,370
Ethan, I'm so sorry.
I have somebody waiting.

80
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:55,509
Right, you're... uh...

81
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,472
Thank you for your time.

82
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:03,096
Hey, Ethan!

83
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,977
You know what I'm
gonna do?

84
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,773
I'm gonna have Allison
validate your parking.

85
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:10,973
You hold on.

86
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:14,071
Oh, it's... I didn't drive...
- Allison...

87
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:18,403
Allison, when this young man comes out,
would you validate his parking, please?

88
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,136
"Our Spry
is doing just that. "

89
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:41,383
"Which means that it
keeps your teeth clean. "

90
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,473
"It's sugar but
it's 'not' sugar... "

91
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,221
"And it's good for
your teeth. "

92
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,685
"Spry gum.
Stay free, less filling. "

93
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:55,733
"With gum so good, we don't
need a professional spokesman. "

94
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:00,095
Hello!

95
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:01,157
Hi!

96
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,071
What's it gonna be today?
- Just a black coffee to go.

97
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:05,745
Anything else?

98
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:08,412
Yeah! Dinner at my house.
Any Sunday, you name it!

99
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,620
I think I can make that happen.
- Excellent!

100
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,379
You've been playing
hard to get.

101
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,460
Should I bring dessert?
- I wouldn't have invited you, otherwise.

102
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,713
So, eh...
just you there?

103
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,671
...and David.

104
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,807
Well, David is always invited.

105
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:26,971
I just meant that you could always bring
someone who is not your brother, you know.

106
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,686
Uncle Logan...
- I just say...

107
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,001
Enough.

108
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,436
If don't ask, how am I supposed to know
if there's anyone worth asking about?

109
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,020
When you there is, you'll
be the first to know.

110
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,271
"When" or "if"?

111
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:40,613
Ouch!

112
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,861
I know it's scary.

113
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:46,701
But it gets less scary when
you put yourself back out there.

114
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,953
Sooner or later, you'll gonna
have to just take a leap.

115
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,498
'Later' is a lot harder
than 'sooner', believe me.

116
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:57,253
I know. I just don't
know if I'm ready yet.

117
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,047
You want to know a secret?
- Yeah?.

118
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:04,340
No one... is ever ready. That's
why they called it 'the leap'.

119
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,520
And if you wait 'till you're ready,
you're going to wait forever.

120
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:11,640
Oops!

121
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,229
Hospital?
- Naturally.

122
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,772
What is the damage?
- On the house. Doctor's discount.

123
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,445
I know you're thinking
about cops.

124
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,736
Doctors actually pay for
their drinks.

125
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,160
Get out of here before
I change my mind!

126
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,038
Call me!
- I will. 'Bye!

127
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,676
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

128
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,551
No, no, no, that's okay. I was
just writing out some thoughts.

129
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,256
Is that a diary?

130
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:47,719
No, it's a... journal.

131
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:50,563
Must be some pretty
deep stuff.

132
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,604
Not really.

133
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,818
Then it must be 'psycho-perverted'.
- What? No, nothing like that.

134
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:57,187
Well, if it's a journal, it has to be
one or the other.

135
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:02,701
I'll go with 'deep'.
- That is a good choice.

136
00:09:02,828 --> 00:09:05,117
The world has enough
perverts in it already.

137
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:24,891
Hi.
- Hi.

138
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,224
So, do I make it?

139
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:30,434
Did you go make it?

140
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:31,763
Yeah, in your journal.

141
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,605
How much impact does someone
has to have on your life...

142
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:37,772
...before you immortalized them
in your personal record?

143
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:41,863
Eh... well, like I said, it's just really
a bunch of thoughts. It's kinda random.

144
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,652
How much 'random' do I
have to be?

145
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:46,946
How much more
'random' can you be?

146
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,451
I tell you what? I can... name
a character after you some time.

147
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,918
So, you're really a writer?
Like for a living?

148
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,292
Well, that's what I tell
people to impress them.

149
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:03,640
No, I'm... I'm really a writer. I
just don't really make a living in it.

150
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,592
Have you ever tried to get published?
- Used to.

151
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,934
Used to get published?
- Used to 'try'.

152
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:11,220
Until when?

153
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,806
Eh... pretty recently,
actually.

154
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:19,771
You should keep
trying.

155
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,909
Too late. Gave up...
about an hour ago.

156
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:24,443
Well, that's a mistake.

157
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:27,248
I mean, if haven't had any luck,
it is because you're publishing...

158
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:30,416
...the wrong stuff. Maybe
you should try something new?

159
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,498
Like what?

160
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,789
Hmmm... there's this guy
who walks into a cafe.

161
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,544
He's nice...
but desperate.

162
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh! desperate?
- Yup! He is a total loser.

163
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:46,765
Ready to give
all up.

164
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,434
But then, he meets
this girl.

165
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,642
The single most amazing woman
he has ever met in his life.

166
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:56,402
And she inspires him.

167
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,230
Convinces him not to
give up hope.

168
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:04,865
And then what?

169
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:06,987
I don't know.

170
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,875
You're the writer.
I just provide the inspiration!

171
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,491
Hey, wait!

172
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:17,371
If I need some inspiration, Can
I, maybe, call you and get some?

173
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:24,051
Inspiration, I meant get
some inspiration.

174
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,057
Well... desperate!

175
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,184
Alright.

176
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:38,317
Okay.

177
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:41,698
But I just want
to warn you.

178
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,826
I do not inspire well
on an empty stomach.

179
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,613
Okay. Oh, wait, how is your name?

180
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,030
I'm Jesse.

181
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,167
Jesse...

182
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,763
Excuse me?

183
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,228
Hi, I called an order for
pick-up. My name is Troy.

184
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,185
I go check then.

185
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,687
Thank you.

186
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,573
"How important
is your vision to you?"

187
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,534
"Cataract specialist delay
the guess work. "

188
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,497
My brother and I die when that
commercial comes on.

189
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,581
So brilliant!

190
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,088
You think so?

191
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,838
Yeah, don't you?

192
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,925
Well I...

193
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:44,802
What?

194
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,556
- That's actually my commercial.
- Your commercial?

195
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,479
Well, That's what I do.
I make television commercials.

196
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,644
I don't even know you and
I've already called you brilliant.

197
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,440
Makes me feel slightly better
about being a sell-out...

198
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,026
...devoting my life to consumerism
that suppose to contribute...

199
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,149
...to something actually artistic
to society.

200
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,410
Well, commercials are the 'art'
of today's society.

201
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:10,907
My mom used to tell me that.
- And I reminded him of his mother.

202
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,491
I think she just thrilled that I'm
not starving after I told her...

203
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:16,415
...I wanted to be a writer rather
than going to school for a real career.

204
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,457
Well, I'm sure she's
very proud.

205
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,127
She's my mom.
She have to be.

206
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,215
Thank you.
- Sure.

207
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:28,349
As a general rule, I try
not to be one of these...

208
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,892
...crazy men who ask random girls he meets
in restaurants for their phone numbers.

209
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,145
But I have this strange feeling that if
I don't make an exception this one time...

210
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,645
...I'm really going
to regret it.

211
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,234
See, then, I'll have to come all the way
back here, order this stuff all over again...

212
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,403
Canned food is not very good
here anyway.

213
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:45,361
On top of everything else, I have to find
some way to strike up a conversation...

214
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:49,278
...with you and I will have to come
up with some witty clever remarks.

215
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,825
So, you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

216
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:58,040
So, the way I see it is... if you
actually gave me your phone number now...

217
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,380
You'll be helping me
out a great deal.

218
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,425
You make it sound like an
act of charity on my part.

219
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:07,093
I don't think there's any other way
you can possibly see it.

220
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:09,471
Okay, then.

221
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:19,359
Thank you, Jesse.
- Sure.

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,319
You've done
the right thing today.

223
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,072
Okay, 'bye.
- 'Bye.

224
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,374
Hi.
- Hi! I'm looking for Jesse.

225
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,926
Sure.
Come on in.

226
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,251
Thanks.

227
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:46,886
Wow.

228
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,507
I'm her brother, David.
- Hey, Ethan.

229
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,686
Jess!
Ethan is here!

230
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,399
Okay!
I'll be right out!

231
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,443
I'm sorry, you look familiar
to me. Have we met?

232
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,661
I don't think so. Probably just...
- The 'Gum Guy'!

233
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,287
You are the 'Gum Guy',
right?

234
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,373
That's it, right?

235
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,198
Jesse!

236
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:14,414
S...

237
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,084
Hi!
- Hi. You look great!

238
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,494
Thanks.
Are you ready?

239
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:21,342
Yeah. You didn't tell me
your brother is a 'big celebrity'.

240
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,385
I didn't want to brag.

241
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:25,512
'Bye.
- 'Bye.

242
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,676
Nice to meet you.

243
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,551
Nice to meet you,
Ethan.

244
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,471
Have fun!

245
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,348
Stay up late!

246
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:37,355
Did I ignore your brother?
I mean, I didn't mean to...

247
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,150
No, no, no, he's...

248
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,356
...just had a hard time dealing
with his 'celebrity'.

249
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,490
Those commercials are huge! He's
got to be awesome for an actor.

250
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:48,784
Yeah, but that's just it.
He is not an 'actor'.

251
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,111
What do you mean?

252
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:54,665
Well, like three years ago, Spry
chewing gum ran this big promotion...

253
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:58,494
...where people would win prizes
in packs of gum, right, mostly...

254
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:04,171
...small stuff like t-shirts,
and baseball hats, and... gum.

255
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:07,467
And It turns out that Spry
was looking for a regular guy...

256
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,638
...to be their new
spokesperson.

257
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,219
David... was that
regular guy.

258
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,811
Next thing we know, he signed a
contract to be in their commercial...

259
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,984
...for a lifetime supply
of chewing gum.

260
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,136
The only problem was,
my brother...

261
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:27,159
...doesn't exactly have
what you would call...

262
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:30,406
...'charisma'.
- Cut!

263
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,705
Spry gum. with a
hundred percent Tylon...

264
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:37,870
Xili-xil-xylitol?

265
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:40,704
With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.
- With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.

266
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,047
- Cut!
- Here? Or here?

267
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:44,920
That's fine. Right there!
- Or here?

268
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,096
Or there?
- That's fine!

269
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,927
It is hard when the words are
right there, and I'm suppose...

270
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,936
...to say, but I'm suppose to
look there? How do I say the words?

271
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,805
Smile!
- I am.

272
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,179
Smile bigger!

273
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,938
Like that?
'Xi-li-tol'!

274
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:00,433
Spry Gum...

275
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,609
...taste great, less filling.. s.

276
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:07,737
No! No! That's weird! Smile,
smile like a normal person.

277
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,744
I'm pretty sure you
can't actually say that.

278
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:13,541
That is someone else's slogan.
- Cut!

279
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,116
Spr...

280
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,493
Do you have something for my ears?
Because my ears are very hot?

281
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,829
Spry gum. It's like...

282
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:21,581
...mint.

283
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,427
But you chew 'em and they never go away.
- Cut!

284
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:27,719
I totally thought that he was acting.
But really? That's just him?

285
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,552
He's been on TV non-stop
for the past three years.

286
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,260
And 'YouTube', who knows
how many times.

287
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:35,886
How long can they run those things?
- As long as they want.

288
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,900
And all he's has to show
for it is free 'Spry'.

289
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,063
Oh, wow!

290
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,403
Wow, that's...

291
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,270
...'true' wow. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be...

292
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:49,073
No, it's okay. Pretty much
everyone find this funny, but David.

293
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,451
Sorry, looks like this is
gonna take a while.

294
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,127
Eh...

295
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:04,883
I think I know
a better place!

296
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,553
Oh, okay.

297
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,424
I haven't been here
for a long time.

298
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,888
Are you sure it's okay
for us to be here afterhours?

299
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:15,304
It's the best time to come.
- Until the SWAT team shows up.

300
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:18,808
We're not
bothering anyone.

301
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:24,147
When I was little, my dad usually
bring my brother and I here.

302
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:26,024
All the time we used
to watch games.

303
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,693
Hmmm... are you close
to your dad?

304
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:32,447
He died when I was twelve.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

305
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:33,994
It's okay.

306
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:38,200
It was a long time ago.
And yes, we were close.

307
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:42,955
But I'm just happy I got to spend the
time with him like I did, you know.

308
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,213
And my uncle Logan...

309
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,511
...his brother, kinda stepped in
and became like a second dad.

310
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,430
So that helped a lot.

311
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,928
How about you?
How about your family?

312
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,358
Eh, my parents have been
happily married for 40 years.

313
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,651
Wow!
That's impressive.

314
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,362
Well, they are.

315
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:08,569
What is their secret?
- Well, beats me.

316
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,239
My dad always said that they fell in
love the first night that they met.

317
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:16,120
I don't know. Do you think
that's even possible?

318
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,997
I think I felt like that once.
- Really?

319
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,243
What happened?

320
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:22,414
Well... we dated...

321
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:25,962
...and then we got engaged.
And then we got married.

322
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,256
And then we got
divorced.

323
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:34,092
The longer version of the story?
- The long and the short of it, yeah.

324
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,937
So what was it?
Was he just the wrong guy?

325
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,102
I just wasn't the
right girl.

326
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,025
Come on,
I doubt that.

327
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:48,151
Oh, I know. Shocking, isn't it?
- It is shocking.

328
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:55,952
Oh... I loved him.

329
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,577
We were married
over three years.

330
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:04,670
I tried...

331
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,002
I really tried to make
it work.

332
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,175
But?

333
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:15,601
But... eh... ultimately,
I wasn't what he wanted.

334
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,773
How's that for ruining
our first date?

335
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,030
Not even close.

336
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:29,697
Once I've got a girl who got back with
her boyfriend through a text message...

337
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:31,321
...while we were at dinner.

338
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,450
Oh, oh...

339
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,786
Yeah, you've got to
work a lot harder to beat that.

340
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:38,413
Oh... wow!

341
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:48,340
It's funny how life never turns
out the way you think it will.

342
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:49,466
Yeah...

343
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:52,802
When I was a little girl,
I thought I'd be married...

344
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,677
...and have four kids
by now.

345
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:59,394
Instead I'm divorced and...
don't even have a plant.

346
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:05,602
Come on, you've got lots of time.
I bet you will be a great mom.

347
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:09,855
When I was a kid I thought I
would be a Pulitzer Prize winner.

348
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,036
And instead, I spent most
of my days punching toilets.

349
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,200
Hobby of yours?

350
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,830
No, I managed
the building I live in.

351
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,994
Maintenance for
free rent. Can't beat it...

352
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,002
Hmmm... looks like
you're handy.

353
00:21:22,756 --> 00:21:25,294
Never met a radiator
I couldn't handle.

354
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,258
Like twelve when I'm old,
whatever.

355
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:33,966
So...
no first date regrets?

356
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,561
Absolutely not.

357
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:38,433
You?

358
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:41,315
Absolutely not...

359
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,765
...yet.

360
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,149
Great.

361
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,238
Oh! Shit!

362
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:54,828
Sorry.
- It's okay.

363
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,574
Sorry.

364
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,066
Here we go!

365
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,531
So, this is it...

366
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:38,655
Yeah, if by 'it' you mean all there
is, then, this is definitely 'it'.

367
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,460
Oh, that's my niece
and nephew.

368
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:45,544
Sweet!

369
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:51,763
That, that is just a thing...
it's like a good luck charm.

370
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,474
They say that everything we own
tells a story about who we are.

371
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:57,470
Yeah? Then, what does
that say?

372
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:02,395
That you're old school.
This isn't new. It's an original.

373
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,561
Pre-Hayden.

374
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:09,610
This is Kenner, gonna say
like... 1977.

375
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,073
Okay, that's the hardest thing
a girl ever said to me.

376
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,617
Don't be too impressed. I
have a brother, remember?

377
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,206
- 'My Little Pony' was more of my thing.
- Oh, yeah?

378
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,998
Yeah, and I have a favorite,
'Firefly'.

379
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,166
And she was pink,
with a turquoise mane...

380
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,677
And I brought her with me everywhere.
She was like a security blanket...

381
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,169
Oh, sorry!

382
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:35,257
You weren't big enough
to actually keep her.

383
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:38,228
Oh, I would have, but
sadly we lost...

384
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,596
...'Firefly' on a
family vacation.

385
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,649
I'm sure wherever she is,
she's very happy.

386
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:47,482
Just as long as she's a
well adjusted adult pony.

387
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:52,151
Yeah, I'm going to use the little boy's
room. Could I trust you to behave yourself?

388
00:23:52,368 --> 00:23:54,740
No. I'm gonna sniff around
everywhere.

389
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:55,861
Great.

390
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,906
So, you better hurry.
- Don't worry, I'm dope for speed.

391
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,162
That's hot!

392
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:04,538
I meant in the bathroom. That
sounds better. I'll be right back.

393
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,137
Okay...

394
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:30,604
Alright...

395
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:36,862
Hey!

396
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,155
Hi.

397
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:45,204
Oh... is this okay?

398
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,457
Yeah, yeah, no,
it's fine.

399
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:50,083
I just forgot that
I left it out.

400
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:54,388
It's really good.
- No, really? No.

401
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:55,506
Really?

402
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,177
Is all your stuff like this?

403
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:59,299
Eh... some of it.

404
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,017
It's mostly short stories,
really.

405
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,318
And some longer stories. That's a poetry,
a couple of screenplays nothing much.

406
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,611
You know, I really don't
let people read stuff.

407
00:25:10,782 --> 00:25:13,902
You said you tried to get published.
- I said I used to try.

408
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:19,205
I don't know, I thought that I was going
to make a living doing this, but I...

409
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:23,914
...discovered that it was
really hard...

410
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,543
...to get people to pay
your rent.

411
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:34,297
Maybe you just need
some more time.

412
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:37,089
Maybe.

413
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,310
Or maybe you sucked.

414
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:43,060
Maybe.

415
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:50,900
What I've read
seemed really good.

416
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,475
Ehmm... Ugh! Well...

417
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:22,721
I know.

418
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,686
Oh, it must have been...
some date.

419
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,148
Yeah, it was somethin'.

420
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:36,578
Are you too sleepy for breakfast?
- Never too sleepy for breakfast.

421
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,701
Good, because it's
'eggs' time!

422
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,158
And I've got some
coffee brewing too.

423
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:45,835
So, tell me...

424
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:49,133
Is there any future with this guy?
- Depends.

425
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,051
Depends on what?

426
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:57,130
Troy! It's good to see you! We've got you at the
back a table if you're going in to dine with her.

427
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,465
Thanks.
- Yeah.

428
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:03,516
Thanks, Cory.

429
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,024
I take it that you
come here a lot.

430
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:09,652
Well, I'm a creature of habit.
I work just down the street.

431
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:13,148
So, do you bring
all your dates here?

432
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,859
Just the ones I really
want to impress.

433
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:18,778
Well, I should tell you that
I'm not easily impressed...

434
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:22,746
...by a fancy place.
- Well, I have to work harder to impress you.

435
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,667
I'm waiting.
- Now?

436
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:30,132
Oh, okay, I can spell the
word 'Connecticut'.

437
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:31,963
Great, let's hear it!

438
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,429
Alright, you got me.

439
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:38,015
How long have you
been coming here?

440
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:41,304
Eh, about since we started the
agency. So, about four years.

441
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:44,438
Since 'we started the agency'?
- My partner and I.

442
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,650
Oh, you have a partner?
I thought it was your place.

443
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:49,642
Pretty lame!

444
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:55,030
But still, four years, that's...
that's impressive.

445
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:57,108
Oh!

446
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,111
Got it.

447
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,957
That is impressive too!

448
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,459
Ah...

449
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,835
Well, I had a...
really nice time.

450
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:15,464
I don't blame you.
- Well! Narcissism is hot.

451
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:18,556
So is sarcasm.
- Well, you can work on that next time.

452
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,971
So, you're assuming that there's
going to be a next time?

453
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:25,142
I hope so.

454
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,182
We'll see.

455
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:32,775
Good night.

456
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,654
Good night.

457
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:53,919
I can't even remember
the last time I did this.

458
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:56,135
You see, that is exactly
why you need to be doing it.

459
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:58,390
Really? That's why?

460
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,470
Well, and the fact that I need to assert
my manhood by challenging you to an...

461
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,518
...activity that I know
I can win.

462
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:05,639
I think most guy
would have picked bowling.

463
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,766
No, too risky
You might beat me.

464
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:09,725
And if I did?

465
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:12,821
Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere
near enough self-esteem to keep this up...

466
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,397
...a blow like that.
So...

467
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:20,280
Couldn't you just challenge me to something else?
- Not really good at a lot of things.

468
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:21,363
Dreamy...

469
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,224
Listen, is it safer for any...

470
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,950
...possible relationship
that we 'mini-golf'...

471
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:28,496
...'coz... baby, I'm great at this!

472
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:31,502
All right.
Show me what you've got.

473
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,885
That's right...

474
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:43,557
So, when was the last time you went
'golfing'? - Does 'miniature-golf' count?

475
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:44,767
I'm afraid not.

476
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,894
I love it out here, I try
to come as much as I can.

477
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:51,565
Alright... ladies first!

478
00:29:52,071 --> 00:29:54,064
Oh, really? Okay.

479
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:58,193
Okay, ready?
Okay.

480
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,079
Oh, promise me that you're not
going to tell anyone about that.

481
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,001
I try not to make promises that I
absolutely have no intention of keeping.

482
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,590
I'm old-fashioned,
that way.

483
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:15,756
I don't understand what is it with
this obsession guys have with golf?

484
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:18,712
I wouldn't call it an obsession.
Have I seen all the movies?

485
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,551
Yes. More than once? Yes.

486
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:23,299
If you ask me what planet Chewbacca's
from? I would say Kashyyyk.

487
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:25,180
But does that really cause
me to have an obsession?

488
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,559
I'm not saying that
they're not great movies.

489
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,018
They are. You know, how
many of them do we need?

490
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,858
I don't know. How many times did
they remake 'Pride and Prejudice'?

491
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:35,823
One a year, every year?

492
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:39,366
Mr. Darcy expressing
his undying devotion?

493
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,487
You can't see that
too many times.

494
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,537
You see, I feel the same way.
Just take up Mr. Darcy...

495
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,209
Instead of Princess Leia and replace the
look of undying devotion with a golf keen.

496
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:53,467
Okay, I can live with that, just as
long as your taste in music isn't lame.

497
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,676
What's your favourite kind?
Don't think, just answer.

498
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:56,799
Classic rock.

499
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,765
What do you consider 'classic'?
- Anything but 'country'.

500
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,934
What's the worst date you've ever been on?
- Besides this?

501
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,392
You know I have the keys
to the car, right?

502
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,188
Favorite president?

503
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,063
Rutherford B. Hayes.

504
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,231
You can't just
make up a name...

505
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:24,072
So, how's the writing going?
- Well, pretty well, actually.

506
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,167
Better than it's been
a long time, I think.

507
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,747
Starting something new.

508
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,961
Can I read it?
- It depends...

509
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:35,592
Can you be honest with me about what you
think or are you one of those girls...

510
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,679
...who's gonna be like, "Oh, I
love it"? Then, stop calling me.

511
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:41,596
I think I'm totally
incapable of false praise...

512
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:44,389
It's like... a natural
deficiency or something.

513
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:45,677
Then, you're on.

514
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,439
I love this building.
- Oh, me too.

515
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:56,155
The view from the
roof is amazing!

516
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,739
I've never seen it.

517
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,988
You're kidding?

518
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,318
You've never seen it?
- No!

519
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,124
Well, we gotta check this out.
- I'm sure it has been closed for hours.

520
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:10,910
Yeah, you're right, although
I wonder if this would...

521
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:15,503
...do anything.

522
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,928
Have you lived
in any place else?

523
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:26,011
Not yet.

524
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,685
You planning on movin'?
- I don't know. Maybe someday.

525
00:32:29,358 --> 00:32:31,018
Not me,
I like it here.

526
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:34,191
My sister is here, my niece
and nephews are here...

527
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:36,988
I know this town like
the back of...

528
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,030
I'm so...

529
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:44,198
Ouch... agile,
coordinated?

530
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,913
Yeah and...
really sorry.

531
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,456
Wow...

532
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,750
Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

533
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,157
Wow!

534
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:21,320
Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

535
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:30,543
Your aunt kicked me out of the dining
room... so that I should be helping you.

536
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:32,463
Here. Slice the bread.

537
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:37,375
She told me she wants you to help!
- Don't believe his lies!

538
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:38,757
I never do.

539
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:40,421
So...

540
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:45,095
How are things?
- My things are good.

541
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:50,187
David tells me your love-life has
taken a recent leap in activity.

542
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:53,066
Yeah, you could
say that.

543
00:33:53,987 --> 00:33:56,656
Well, you could say that
as if it's a bad thing.

544
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,109
I just want to be honest.

545
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:02,528
No one ever said that you
have to reveal everything...

546
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,702
...to any guy you date.

547
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,453
No, I know, I know
but still I just...

548
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:11,796
You just give yourself some time.
Nothing wrong with taking it slow.

549
00:34:12,131 --> 00:34:14,835
That's 'big' talk coming from a guy who
said he fell in love with aunt Linda...

550
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:17,292
...the second he laid
eyes on her.

551
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:18,590
That was different.

552
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:23,301
With me, one girl is all it took. I hit
the 'jackpot' first time I took the gamble.

553
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,683
How did you know
that she was the one?

554
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,221
She, eh...

555
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:36,231
She inspired me.

556
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:48,909
<i>Remember that rainy evening
I took you out</i>

557
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:52,709
<i>With nothing but
a fine-tuned comb...</i>

558
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:56,380
<i>I know no one's to blame
but then what a shame...</i>

559
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,377
<i>Hey baby, won't you please
come home!</i>

560
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:07,057
I can't believe you've never been here.
- Only because I've never wanted to come.

561
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,602
This place is all musicals.
That's all I need to hear.

562
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:12,436
How do you not like musicals?
- They don't make any sense.

563
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,438
Musicals make total sense.
- What's your favorite musical?

564
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,816
'West Side Story'.
- It makes no sense.

565
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:18,228
It's 'Romeo and Juliet'.

566
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,773
It's two gangs dancing
while they fight.

567
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,621
Okay, so next, you're going to
tell me you hate 'Sounds Of Music'.

568
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,703
Oh, please you askin'
me of the 'singing' nuns.

569
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,076
But you have to like 'Grease'.
- No, I have to do no such things.

570
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,582
Everyone likes 'Grease'.

571
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,832
The only nice thing I can say about
'Grease' is that there's not a 'Grease 2'.

572
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,836
I happen to love 'Grease 2'.
- 'Shut your mouth'.

573
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,886
I'm not going to apologize
for loving 'Grease 2'.

574
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,428
'Grease 2' should apologize
to 'Grease 2'.

575
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,930
Have you ever seen it?
- No, I've never seen it!

576
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,142
Okay, so how could you judge a movie
you've never seen?

577
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,142
I don't have to see 'Grease 2'
to know it's 'Grease 2'.

578
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,776
<i>I don't iron his shirts...</i>

579
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>I don't sew on his buttons...</i>

580
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,879
<i>I don't know of all
the jokes he tells...</i>

581
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,671
<i>...or the songs he hums.</i>

582
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:24,721
<i>But he says he loves me...</i>

583
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,889
<i>And I believe it's true...</i>

584
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:37,088
<i>Doesn't that makes someone...
belong to you?</i>

585
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:43,685
Subtitles: Maver. ikk

586
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:56,877
Okay, open 'em.

587
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,466
Wow!

588
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,884
What's the occasion?

589
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,297
It's Tuesday!

590
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,763
How did you arranged
all these?

591
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:15,517
Well, I think secrets are an important
part of every relationships.

592
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,438
Wouldn't you agree?

593
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,488
You've no idea.

594
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,117
This is the best place in
the city to look at the stars.

595
00:37:25,288 --> 00:37:27,245
Are you a man who knows
his constellations?

596
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:28,832
You mean 'the constellations' man?
- Yeah.

597
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,830
Yeah.

598
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,913
Alright, see those three near each other,
but they're branching off at the top...

599
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:36,082
...in different directions?
That's the 'eternal tree'.

600
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,420
What about that one?

601
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:41,131
Oh, that's my favorite.
That's the 'Lion's Triumph'.

602
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,045
Meaning?
- I have no idea. I just want to sound smart.

603
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:45,386
It almost works.

604
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,720
How about that one
over there?

605
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,100
Well, no clue.

606
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:54,184
Maybe we should name it.

607
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:57,607
Yeah, we can call it...
'Jesse'.

608
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,026
You want to name it after me?
- Well, Yeah, I really like you.

609
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:04,409
I really like you too.

610
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:06,986
No, no, no,
I like... 'LIKE' you.

611
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,162
Meaning, em...
I think I'm falling for you.

612
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,870
I know... I know I'm falling
for you.

613
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:20,833
I'm freaking you out right now.
Maybe I should just kiss you.

614
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:42,986
Hey.
- Hey.

615
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:47,366
Good date?

616
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:49,153
Yeah, great date.

617
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:54,749
What?

618
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:58,335
Nothing, just sounds like
it's getting serious.

619
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:00,796
Maybe.

620
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:06,470
What?

621
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:09,220
I didn't say anything.

622
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:14,475
Ethan has made it perfectly clear that
I don't have to tell him...

623
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,607
...anything until I'm ready.

624
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:21,864
I have to figure out how
I'm going to figure this out.

625
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,068
Sure... I mean take
your time.

626
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:30,495
Let me just...
lay it all out there.

627
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,875
Tell Ethan everything.

628
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:38,957
Am I making a mess?

629
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:40,838
No.

630
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,259
Maybe, I don't know.

631
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,768
I'm gonna tell him
the next time I see him.

632
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,360
And if he leaves me, then...
problem solved, right?

633
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:02,279
I mean, if he doesn't think
I'm worth it...

634
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:03,944
...then, he's an idiot.

635
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,737
Good night.

636
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:11,662
Good night.

637
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,588
Okay, I have to warn you. My
sister's house can be a little...

638
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,972
What?
- Intense... at first.

639
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:32,182
You'll be great!

640
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,097
Hello?

641
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:37,234
Hello?
- Uncle Ethan!

642
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:42,061
Hey, guys! This is my girlfriend, Jesse.
This is Hayley and Conner.

643
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,612
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

644
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:45,983
You're pretty.

645
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,661
No, you're pretty!

646
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:50,409
No, I think all girls are dumb.
- Hey!

647
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,742
Where are you goin'?
Get out of town, you monkey!

648
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,587
Alright, enough impressing
our guests.

649
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:57,372
Hey, Baggy.
- Hello, Baggy.

650
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:00,586
Jesse, my sister, Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah, nice to meet you.

651
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:03,429
Jesse, so good to meet you.
Welcome to the 'circus'.

652
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,339
Oh, that's Adam.
Our littlest.

653
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,845
Is he okay?
- Oh, a little fuzzy today, but he's alright.

654
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,844
Hey, Bill! This is my
brother-in-law, Bill. This is Jesse.

655
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:12,978
Hi!
- Hey! How are you? Bill Walters. Wow...

656
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:15,397
It's okay... it's okay.
- Sorry.

657
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:19,605
Clearly, you can see, we keep a little informal
around here... Please just make yourself at home.

658
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:23,029
Dinner is almost ready.
I've gotta go to deal with the baby.

659
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:24,942
Come on, let's go wash up!
Let's go... go!

660
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,867
We've got some serious barbecue
going on out back.

661
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:28,952
But Ethan told me that
you're a vegetarian...

662
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,907
So, I got you some 'pork'.

663
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,122
Great!
- For the others... not meat.

664
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:51,428
Get back here...

665
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:54,471
Hey.

666
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,939
Come on uncle Ethan!
Let's go play 'Spies Tag'!

667
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:02,070
You know what, buddy? I think we're
gonna stay here and relax a little bit.

668
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,155
No! Please, please!

669
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,489
Oh, how can you say
no to that?

670
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,785
Oh. Alright. I'll be right back.
I'm great at this game.

671
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:11,456
You better go,
I'll get you!

672
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:19,543
Hey, he really is good
at this game.

673
00:42:20,967 --> 00:42:24,336
Yeah, he should be. He has had enough practice.
- That's for sure.

674
00:42:25,305 --> 00:42:27,878
Your children are beautiful.
- Thank you.

675
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:32,349
They certainly love their uncle. It's
like having a 'on-call' babysitter.

676
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:33,969
If anything comes up...

677
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:37,682
Yeah, if we just wanna get away
for a couple of hours...

678
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,733
- Bill!
- Alright? It's true!

679
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:44,652
Oh, hello.
- Hello...

680
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:47,903
Are you and uncle Ethan going to
get married and have a baby?

681
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:52,700
Oh, okay, Hayley, I think that
uncle Ethan needs to be chased.

682
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,826
Why don't you go chase him?
- Okay.

683
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,618
Where are you gettin' off?
Where are you gettin' off?

684
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:02,030
Wahhh! I'm the 'Beast'!
Where? Where?...

685
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:24,440
Yes! I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

686
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,147
Thank you!

687
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:28,692
Nice meeting you, 'bye!

688
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:30,277
'Bye!

689
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:34,916
Okay, seriously I think I hurt something.
- Those kids are so crazy about you!

690
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,117
Big 'E'!
- And I'm crazy about them.

691
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,675
Thank you.
- Yeah!

692
00:43:48,348 --> 00:43:51,599
Oh... I almost forgot.
I found something of yours.

693
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:53,601
What?
- Close your eyes.

694
00:43:53,771 --> 00:43:54,719
Close!

695
00:43:55,064 --> 00:43:56,095
Okay?

696
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:58,348
Okay.

697
00:43:58,776 --> 00:43:59,890
Open.

698
00:44:02,822 --> 00:44:04,731
It's 'Firefly'.
- Yeah...

699
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,988
How did you...?
Where did you find...?

700
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,158
She just showed up on my doorstep
yesterday... in a box from ebay.

701
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,292
This is the nicest thing anyone
has ever given me.

702
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:20,206
Oh, come on,
I hope that's not true.

703
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:24,041
Thank you. - You're
welcome. - Thank you so much.

704
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:28,635
So, what did you
want to tell me?

705
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:31,054
What do you mean?

706
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:35,265
Oh, I hear you said you've something to tell
me but it could wait after my sister's house.

707
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,179
I, er...

708
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:40,183
What?

709
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:44,774
I just... wanted to tell
you how happy you make me.

710
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,566
Good. I like you happy.

711
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:54,363
Is that all you wanted to tell me?
- Yeah!

712
00:44:56,418 --> 00:44:58,826
You can talk to me about anything, you know that?
- I know, I know, yeah.

713
00:44:59,505 --> 00:45:01,747
Well, prove it.
You can talk to me right now.

714
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,294
There is nothing.

715
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:13,097
Okay.

716
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,072
Hi!.

717
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:37,292
- I can help you?
- I'm Jesse. I'm here to see Troy.

718
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:41,121
Troy, there is someone
here to see you.

719
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:42,287
Okay.

720
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:44,960
He'll be right out.
- Thanks.

721
00:45:50,224 --> 00:45:51,338
There she is!

722
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:52,715
Hi, T.

723
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:55,810
Alright, let me show
you around.

724
00:45:57,523 --> 00:45:59,432
You doing alright?
- Yeah, how's your day been?

725
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:00,646
Good, good.

726
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:03,935
Troy, I've got the Clear magazine
spread for you to look out.

727
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,397
Thanks, Mike, I'll stop by
your desk this afternoon.

728
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,486
Troy, can I get your opinion on this local survey?
- Can I come by a little later?

729
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:11,196
Sure.
- Thanks, Brandy.

730
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:14,445
Hey, Garrett!

731
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:17,411
I want you to meet Jesse.
- Yes, Jesse...

732
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:20,663
- Hi! I heard a lot about you.
- Oh, good things, I hope.

733
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:21,668
Oh, pretty good.

734
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,794
Oh, Troy usually sensed really horrific
stuff about other people.

735
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:26,919
That's not true,
just about you.

736
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:30,211
I'm gonna show her around.
- Well, you think you own the place?

737
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,593
No, Garrett, I think you own the place.
- That's right... don't forget it.

738
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:37,472
Actually, you know, Jesse, we get
most of our clients...

739
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:40,061
...based on Troy's
reputation alone.

740
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:43,350
Well, don't you forget that.
- I can't forget that.

741
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:45,071
We'll see you in a bit.
- Okay dokey.

742
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:47,984
Very nice meeting you. - Nice meeting
you too, take care. - Okay, 'bye.

743
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:52,449
So, this is your home
during the day.

744
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,824
And some nights.

745
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:56,245
I spend so much time here, I figure I
might as well make it as comfortable...

746
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:57,917
...as a place can be
as possible.

747
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:01,212
It's really big.

748
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,204
Yeah, well, over compensating
for something, obviously.

749
00:47:04,342 --> 00:47:06,085
I prefer not to
say what.

750
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:10,091
What are you
working on?

751
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:12,346
Oh... this is a
potential client.

752
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:15,221
I'm trying to come up with a
"slogan" for their nasal spray.

753
00:47:15,395 --> 00:47:18,016
You know, if I can dazzle them,
they'll definitely sign with us.

754
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:20,357
You're pretty
dazzling.

755
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:23,645
It's a lot easier if you have a specific
audience, this 'nasal spray' is for everybody.

756
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:25,605
Everybody with a nose.

757
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,779
Yeah, well said.

758
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:33,579
Woo... I'm starving.
Can we talk about that?

759
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:37,241
Absolutely, tell me what's on your mind?
- Wait! Come on!

760
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:54,799
<i>I see the sunbeam.
The perfect rain...</i>

761
00:47:55,436 --> 00:48:00,596
<i>I want to send out a
gazillion bouquet...</i>

762
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:06,602
<i>I hear the chords
that resonate...</i>

763
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:13,409
<i>It's just another
o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

764
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:30,252
<i>I look from your eyes
down to your lips...</i>

765
00:48:31,056 --> 00:48:36,216
<i>I feel it from my toes
down to my figertips...</i>

766
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:42,222
<i>I see the clouds change
a sweet array...</i>

767
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:48,904
<i>It's just another
o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

768
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:54,036
"NOW YOU HAVE A PLANT
LOVE, ETHAN"

769
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:13,133
<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

770
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:19,052
<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

771
00:49:20,982 --> 00:49:25,027
<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

772
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:27,488
"JESSE, I LOVE YOU!
- TROY"

773
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:30,906
<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

774
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:36,956
<i>o.. o.. o.. o.. ordinary day...</i>

775
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:42,620
Oh, come on, no way!

776
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:44,748
Yes-way.
Don't act surprised.

777
00:49:44,923 --> 00:49:48,292
No, look, something's wrong with this
controller. I press 'X' and nothing's happenin'.

778
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:50,467
Yeah, it's the
'controller's' fault.

779
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:52,677
Oh, shut up! I'm serious!
The thing is broken.

780
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,339
No, I think it's the guy who's using it, actually.
- You know what?

781
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:58,305
You play this game all the time and
you know that controller works better...

782
00:49:58,437 --> 00:50:00,145
Hi. Sorry.
- Hi, wow.

783
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,722
I didn't know you were here.
- I didn't know you were here!

784
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:05,432
Is everything okay?
- Yeah! Just fine. David invited me over.

785
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:06,856
Will you pause it
please?!

786
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:11,689
He called and we got to talking. Did
you know that his cousin is a lawyer?

787
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,865
No, I didn't know that.
- Yeah, he works in contracts, I...

788
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,363
...thought maybe he can help
him out with his 'gum' situation.

789
00:50:17,499 --> 00:50:19,041
I was talking to his cousin,
he said that...

790
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:21,194
ZZZZZZZ...

791
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,540
He said that he thinks he can get
me out of the contract or at least...

792
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:27,834
...renegotiate so that they have to
pay me for as long as it's running.

793
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:29,552
That's amazing.

794
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:32,513
Will you guys go to the store with me
so that I don't have to go by myself?

795
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,383
Of course,
we're almost done here.

796
00:50:34,516 --> 00:50:36,972
I bet you mean I
'destroyed' you.

797
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:38,133
Oh...

798
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:40,687
Okay, I'll be right back.

799
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:42,012
"Unpause. "

800
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:45,812
Hey, no way,
you'll a 'quitter' now!

801
00:50:52,034 --> 00:50:52,900
Excuse me!

802
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:54,695
Excuse me, sir!
- Hey, dude!

803
00:50:55,913 --> 00:50:58,072
You are awesome, man!
- Wow!

804
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:01,407
Could you take a picture?
- We actually have to go.

805
00:51:01,544 --> 00:51:04,296
No, are you kidding? Don't
be silly. He loves this stuff!

806
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:05,377
Alright, okay.

807
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:08,622
It's awesome!
- Breathe, man, breathe!

808
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:11,793
That was mean!
- It's good for him.

809
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,969
Hey, check it out!

810
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:15,923
Oh, look at this!

811
00:51:16,017 --> 00:51:18,259
I mean, honestly,
who writes those?

812
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:20,268
I don't know but I've been
thinking about it.

813
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:23,764
About what?
- About going into commercial advertising.

814
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,652
Seems like a writer could
actually make a living.

815
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:33,156
Yeah, but...
would you be happy doing that?

816
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:35,407
I don't know.

817
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:37,862
But if I don't make enough money
doing what makes me happy...

818
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,661
...then, I'm gonna have to
settle on something, right?.

819
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:46,579
I'm so serious.
That's not funny!

820
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:51,757
Erm... I don't mean to bother
you, but would you mind?

821
00:51:53,514 --> 00:51:55,305
Be nice. He is a kid.

822
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:58,886
That'll be five dollars.

823
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:00,935
Be nice!
- You can't do that...

824
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:03,770
Sorry, sorry about that.
- It's free this time.

825
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,058
Next time, you pay.
- Thank you!

826
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:11,865
So, did you mean what
you said before?

827
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,231
What... at the store?

828
00:52:13,368 --> 00:52:14,364
Yeah.

829
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:15,443
Yeah.

830
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:18,361
Maybe.

831
00:52:19,624 --> 00:52:24,619
Look, I just think that it might be time
for me to get a little more serious.

832
00:52:25,464 --> 00:52:28,998
Think about my future instead of
going after this whole 'writing' thing.

833
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,925
But it's your dream.
- Yes.

834
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,176
But it's definitely
not my 'reality'.

835
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:38,931
And I want to have a family
... someday.

836
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:43,435
So, I think I might need to settle for a
career that is a little more realistic.

837
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:48,017
You can't quit.

838
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:49,442
Why?

839
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:52,110
Besides the fact that I love it.
Why? Give me one good reason.

840
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:54,198
Because I know you're
going to make it.

841
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:56,660
Okay, That is
pretty good, but...

842
00:52:57,663 --> 00:53:00,333
Promise me...
you won't give up.

843
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:06,832
Promise me.
- Why are you so sure of me?

844
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:09,378
Because I know you, Ethan.
You are talented.

845
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:13,171
And you shouldn't settle. You can
have everything you want out of life.

846
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:15,969
And I...

847
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:20,930
I believe in you.

848
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:26,813
Thank you.

849
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,898
You're my 'Charlie Brown'.

850
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,233
I'm your what now?

851
00:53:33,408 --> 00:53:36,493
When I was a kid, there used
to be these 'Charlie Brown'...

852
00:53:36,662 --> 00:53:38,820
...Specials on TV.
- Yeah...

853
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:43,790
And there was one where Charlie
Brown had a crush...

854
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:46,001
...on this little girl.
- Oh, the redhead girl.

855
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,873
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah.

856
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:51,086
And through the whole cartoon,
he was totally smitten.

857
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:54,677
And then, finally...
the little girl kissed him.

858
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:58,599
And suddenly,
Charlie Brown was flying.

859
00:53:59,227 --> 00:54:04,387
And I mean... really flying...
like through the clouds, soaring.

860
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:07,146
And I just totally
didn't get it.

861
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:09,520
And so, I asked my mom
what was going on?

862
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:11,024
And she told me...

863
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,781
"That's exactly how I feel every
time I kiss your father. "

864
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:20,703
So, naturally, I thought my
dad had some kind of...

865
00:54:20,832 --> 00:54:23,121
...magical kissing power!

866
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:26,792
That whoever kisses him
gets to feel like they're fine.

867
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:27,959
Sure...

868
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:29,585
So, I tried it.

869
00:54:31,426 --> 00:54:34,178
I kissed him...
and I closed my eyes.

870
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,714
And I concentrated really,
really hard.

871
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,095
And absolutely nothing
happened.

872
00:54:43,022 --> 00:54:43,935
Nothing.

873
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:45,891
I was so bombed.

874
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:49,733
And I tried it a few more times
and eventually just gave up.

875
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:53,689
I actually forgot
all about it.

876
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,947
Until the first time
you kissed me.

877
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:01,327
And then I remembered
Charlie Brown.

878
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:06,998
Promise me.

879
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:14,386
I promise... for now.

880
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:37,744
Hi!
- Hi.

881
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,247
What are you doing here?
- Well, can't your boyfriend stop by?

882
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:45,334
Of course, I'm just...
surprised.

883
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:47,501
Well, I wanted to surprise
you. Come on, grab your coat!

884
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:48,626
All right.

885
00:55:51,842 --> 00:55:53,503
What are we doing here?
- Grab a seat.

886
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:01,716
"FOR EVERYBODY
WITH A NOSE."

887
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:03,477
We got it.
- You got it?

888
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:06,938
No, no, we got it. They loved
it! We're launching this fall.

889
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:08,312
Congratulations!

890
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:10,145
To you too!
- No.

891
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:12,401
That is your line. I would
have never come up with that.

892
00:56:12,572 --> 00:56:14,031
No, no.
- You're smarter than me.

893
00:56:14,157 --> 00:56:15,984
Nobody's denying that.

894
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:20,871
Did my superior intelligence
just emasculate you?

895
00:56:20,997 --> 00:56:23,535
Because that's bound to happen,
eventually.

896
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,211
There's... more.

897
00:56:29,423 --> 00:56:30,502
Okay.

898
00:56:31,216 --> 00:56:34,668
For a while now, Garrett
and I have been talking about...

899
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:37,804
...expanding the agency.
Opening another branch.

900
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:40,259
Well, this kinda put it
over the top for us.

901
00:56:40,434 --> 00:56:44,183
Since I developed the concept "Clear"
wants me to head up the design.

902
00:56:44,355 --> 00:56:48,602
Which I would do at our...
new branch... in Austin.

903
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:51,935
The one in the middle
of Texas?

904
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:54,741
That's the one, but it'll probably
for a few months.

905
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:56,942
Once, we're running smoothly...
- Then, you'll move back?

906
00:56:57,118 --> 00:57:00,202
I can commute back and forth.
But I'm gonna be here all the time.

907
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:05,033
When is this all going to happen?
- As soon as I say 'Yes'.

908
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,787
And when will that be?

909
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,876
As soon as you say
you will come with me.

910
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,422
Don't say anything,
Just think about it.

911
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:13,506
You, me...

912
00:57:13,635 --> 00:57:14,631
Austin...

913
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:17,919
Some apartment we
try really hard to make hip...

914
00:57:18,098 --> 00:57:20,470
...but it's pathetically unhip.
It will be great!

915
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:29,025
Wow... I don't know
really what to say...

916
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:32,441
Well... just think about it,
then.

917
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:37,114
Take as long as you want but just say
'Yes'. And by tomorrow night, if you can

918
00:57:43,374 --> 00:57:45,034
Run away with me.

919
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:50,829
When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

920
00:57:53,634 --> 00:57:55,129
It's been known
to have happened.

921
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:11,942
This is so amazing!
- Yeah!

922
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:15,614
My parents and I used
to hike up here a lot.

923
00:58:16,116 --> 00:58:17,824
Seems like a tough
hike for a kid.

924
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:19,532
I was a tough kid!

925
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,739
I know you're such a
cute little boy.

926
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:27,621
You know, when I was in 7th grade,
I brought home a progress report.

927
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,621
Except I was failing
in science.

928
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,170
My mother went ballistic!

929
00:58:32,758 --> 00:58:34,964
And the next day, my dad
brought me up here.

930
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,709
And he told me the reason that they
were so upset was because they know...

931
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,848
...how special I was, and that I
can do whatever I wanted in life...

932
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:43,305
...if I was just willing
to work for it.

933
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:47,387
And he really believed it.
He was so sure of me.

934
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:50,355
Were you not so
sure of 'you'?

935
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,733
What about you? Have you felt
totally sure about yourself?

936
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,198
I think so, yeah.
I mean when I was younger.

937
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,280
But I don't know, divorce has its weird
way of making you realize that...

938
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:05,118
...you can't really be sure
of anything.

939
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,707
Anything?
- Anything.

940
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,372
Come on,
I don't buy that.

941
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,164
Okay, has there ever been
anything that you've been...

942
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,583
...totally sure of?

943
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,765
Okay, I used to think, believe I
was going make it as a writer.

944
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,722
I have become significantly
less sure of that...

945
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:28,430
But... then I ran into
this girl at the cafe.

946
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,103
Gorgeous...

947
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,099
Funny...

948
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,563
Blonde...
- Hey!

949
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:35,067
I'm kidding... I'm kidding!
- That's not nice.

950
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:40,110
And... I was 'sure' that I wanted
to talk to her.

951
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,738
I wanted to get to
know her.

952
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,823
And the more I got to know her,
the more I became sure...

953
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,538
...that I've never met anyone
like her.

954
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:52,957
And that everything with her is
better that anything without her.

955
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:56,212
I'm better with her.

956
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,002
So...

957
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:02,677
I guess I've never really been sure
about anything except you.

958
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:05,935
I'm 'sure' about you.

959
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:10,478
I have fallen in love
with you, Jesse.

960
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:13,692
I love you too.

961
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:18,068
And I'm sure that...

962
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:20,440
I want to spend...

963
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,162
...the rest of my life
with you.

964
01:00:25,332 --> 01:00:27,289
Will you marry me?

965
01:00:32,006 --> 01:00:33,963
Ethan, you are
so amazing.

966
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:37,251
Amazing enough
to marry?

967
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:43,847
I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

968
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:46,182
Was it the speech?

969
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:49,017
I know the speech was
too much but... Jesse!

970
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:51,978
I know this is fast,
but I know that it's right.

971
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:55,771
But I guess it's just not right for you...
- It's just...

972
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:01,610
...a lot about me that
you still don't know.

973
01:01:01,786 --> 01:01:04,456
Okay, so tell me.
All of it and I'll marry you anyway.

974
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:07,416
There is nothing you can say that
will change how I feel about you.

975
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:08,864
I can't...

976
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:13,833
Do you love me?

977
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:17,210
Really, honestly love me?
- I love you so much.

978
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:20,007
Then, talk to me.
- I can't, I can't...

979
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:22,843
Jesse, I'm not blind. I know
you're not telling me something.

980
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,887
The only thing frustrating about that...
is that you still don't feel like you can!

981
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,178
I can't!
- You can't or you won't?!

982
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:29,689
I can't!

983
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:32,650
Okay? I can't be who
you want me to be!

984
01:02:16,196 --> 01:02:19,233
Jesse, all I want
is you.

985
01:05:00,073 --> 01:05:01,236
Yes.

986
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:50,349
Jesse, I don't know
what to do, eh...

987
01:06:51,563 --> 01:06:53,686
Confused...
I am really confused.

988
01:06:53,857 --> 01:06:57,937
And I'm hurt and I don't understand
what happened, so...

989
01:06:59,154 --> 01:07:01,941
I think I'm just going to keep
calling you... leaving messages.

990
01:07:03,575 --> 01:07:09,448
I don't know.
I just... I miss you.

991
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,875
I'm still here.

992
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:15,127
And I miss you.

993
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:22,208
Don't.

994
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,139
I didn't say anything.
- It's what you're thinking.

995
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,851
What am I thinking?
- That I made the wrong choice.

996
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,060
Are you sure that's not
what you're thinking?

997
01:07:36,234 --> 01:07:39,104
I just need to get out of here.
And things will be better.

998
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:41,113
For you or for him?

999
01:07:43,449 --> 01:07:45,442
You want to know what
I'm really thinking?

1000
01:07:46,745 --> 01:07:47,943
Do I have a choice?

1001
01:07:48,121 --> 01:07:51,455
I think... that
you are an amazing person.

1002
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,575
And you deserve
to be happy.

1003
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:58,796
And I think if you don't tell
Ethan the truth about everything...

1004
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:02,085
You'll never going to be
as happy as you could be.

1005
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:04,344
No matter what happens.

1006
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:47,511
Yeah!

1007
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,350
So, you've got it?

1008
01:08:50,518 --> 01:08:52,558
Yeah, I've got it!
Is this for real?

1009
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:56,728
Yes! What did I tell you, Ethan?
I've always said you've talent.

1010
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,735
But if I had known you
were capable of writing...

1011
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:03,355
...with so much pain!
With so much of thought!

1012
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:06,408
My God, I would have signed
you a long time ago.

1013
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:10,325
Congratulations, but you really
broke through on this one.

1014
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:17,119
Barbara. I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

1015
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:18,286
You go!

1016
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:22,254
Celebrate! You'll be seeing so much
each other that you'll be sick of me.

1017
01:09:24,887 --> 01:09:26,262
Okay, thank you.

1018
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,719
Jesse!

1019
01:09:40,195 --> 01:09:41,938
Oh, please pick up!

1020
01:09:42,322 --> 01:09:44,729
Hi, this is Jesse, please
leave a message.

1021
01:09:50,288 --> 01:09:52,198
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

1022
01:10:02,134 --> 01:10:03,414
Come on,
come on...

1023
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:20,271
Ethan?
- David... is she here?

1024
01:10:20,861 --> 01:10:22,771
No. She's not.

1025
01:10:24,448 --> 01:10:28,114
Look... I know she doesn't want
to see me... but if you just...

1026
01:10:28,286 --> 01:10:29,151
Ethan.

1027
01:10:29,454 --> 01:10:31,114
She is really
not here.

1028
01:10:32,373 --> 01:10:34,781
Okay, can you tell me where she is?
- Eh...

1029
01:10:36,085 --> 01:10:37,034
David.

1030
01:10:37,462 --> 01:10:38,541
I love her.

1031
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:40,209
Please.

1032
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:42,333
She loves you too.

1033
01:10:42,926 --> 01:10:44,337
But she's gone.

1034
01:10:45,136 --> 01:10:47,295
She already left
for the airport.

1035
01:10:48,682 --> 01:10:51,802
The airport?
- Ethan, run!

1036
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:55,855
All right. Thanks.

1037
01:10:58,525 --> 01:11:00,767
Delta Flight 1182!

1038
01:11:47,075 --> 01:11:48,356
Can I help you?

1039
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,074
Can I help you, sir?

1040
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,160
No, thank you.

1041
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:20,441
I thought you left?

1042
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:22,646
I thought I would.

1043
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,862
I have to tell you
something.

1044
01:12:29,327 --> 01:12:31,154
I need to tell
you something.

1045
01:12:44,718 --> 01:12:47,090
You finished your manuscript?
- Yeah.

1046
01:12:47,637 --> 01:12:48,586
And...

1047
01:12:53,977 --> 01:12:55,804
Ethan, this is amazing.

1048
01:12:58,273 --> 01:12:59,139
You did it.

1049
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,604
We did it.

1050
01:13:00,984 --> 01:13:03,476
What are you talking about?
- The day that I met you...

1051
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,488
...something happened in me.

1052
01:13:07,408 --> 01:13:08,783
You changed me.

1053
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,119
And this story...
this is us.

1054
01:13:13,289 --> 01:13:15,531
"TROY MEETS GIRL"

1055
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:18,958
My publisher tells me it has
'passion'... and 'heart'...

1056
01:13:22,507 --> 01:13:24,583
It's the best thing
I've ever written.

1057
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:31,590
So, how was the writing going?
- Pretty well, actually.

1058
01:13:31,766 --> 01:13:32,929
I started something new.

1059
01:13:33,059 --> 01:13:35,930
Ethan, you need a
leading man.

1060
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:39,639
You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident, and...

1061
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:41,892
...charismatic, and sexy.

1062
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,356
Excuse me?

1063
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:47,231
Hi, I called an order for pick-up.
My name is Troy.

1064
01:13:48,033 --> 01:13:50,440
But I have a strange feeling that if I
don't make an exception this one time...

1065
01:13:50,577 --> 01:13:52,119
I'm really going to
regret it.

1066
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:59,042
On top of everything else, not only will I have to find
some way to strike up another conversation with you...

1067
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,840
I will have to come up with some
witty clever remarks so..

1068
01:14:01,841 --> 01:14:04,680
...you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

1069
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:09,550
That's what I've been trying to do.
Draw from real life.

1070
01:14:09,722 --> 01:14:12,592
Model the character
after my own experience.

1071
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:18,302
That's right...

1072
01:14:22,902 --> 01:14:25,310
Oh, promise me you'll not
going to tell anyone about this!

1073
01:14:25,446 --> 01:14:28,650
I never make promises that I have
absolutely no intention of keeping.

1074
01:14:28,825 --> 01:14:30,652
I'm old fashioned that way.

1075
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:34,612
Until the first time
you kissed me.

1076
01:14:34,831 --> 01:14:36,907
Then, I remembered
Charlie Brown.

1077
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:40,499
When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

1078
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:53,719
This guy, Troy...
- Yeah?

1079
01:14:54,893 --> 01:14:56,637
He is nothing like you.

1080
01:14:56,812 --> 01:15:01,141
Well... I had to change that 'coz no one
likes to read a story about a guy like me.

1081
01:15:03,736 --> 01:15:05,479
And I changed the ending.

1082
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,734
Instead of leaving an envelope
on my doorstep, you showed up...

1083
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:12,781
Said, 'Yes' and we went
away together.

1084
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:17,411
Everybody loves
happy endings.

1085
01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:25,291
I eh...
wanted to tell you everything.

1086
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:29,380
And be more...
open with you.

1087
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:36,223
But... I didn't believe
that we can be together.

1088
01:15:37,437 --> 01:15:41,269
I mean, really...
really be together.

1089
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:44,147
Like...

1090
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,733
Happily ever after
with four kids?

1091
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:02,334
I can't have children.

1092
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,418
I just can't.

1093
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:13,798
And that's why my ex-husband
divorced me and eh...

1094
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:18,344
I don't really blame him,
you know... because I...

1095
01:16:20,982 --> 01:16:24,600
...couldn't give him
what he deserved, so...

1096
01:16:27,405 --> 01:16:29,481
Why didn't you
tell me this?

1097
01:16:30,742 --> 01:16:32,984
Because I was terrified.

1098
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:35,071
Jesse, I'm not him.

1099
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:38,162
And that's what
I was scared of.

1100
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:44,623
I mean, I was afraid that
you loved me enough that...

1101
01:16:44,624 --> 01:16:46,757
...you would give
that up and...

1102
01:16:50,762 --> 01:16:53,865
You know, I felt that if...

1103
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:58,288
...I really loved you, then I
couldnt ask you to give that up.

1104
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:03,597
To sacrifice that for me.

1105
01:17:04,026 --> 01:17:05,105
I don't need that.

1106
01:17:05,277 --> 01:17:06,309
No.

1107
01:17:07,029 --> 01:17:08,938
But you deserve it.

1108
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,233
You deserve to be
a father.

1109
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:18,116
And you deserve to be with someone
that can give that to you...

1110
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:24,711
Someone... whole
and complete.

1111
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:36,218
So, I couldn't leave without
telling you all of that.

1112
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:43,429
Where are you going?

1113
01:17:44,484 --> 01:17:46,940
I took a job in Portland.

1114
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:51,528
My best friend from High School lives
there and I'm going to live with her.

1115
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:58,283
This story has passion because
I'm passionate about you.

1116
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:01,743
I never could have written
it without you.

1117
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:06,044
Because I have never been this happy
as I am when I'm with you.

1118
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:12,299
Now you tell me that I deserve
someone whole and complete.

1119
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:16,802
I was never whole and complete
until I met you.

1120
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,223
I will never be a mother.

1121
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,526
Of course you will.

1122
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:29,274
We'll adopt. We can have
as many kids as you want.

1123
01:18:30,865 --> 01:18:33,570
I mean, we should
keep trying, though.

1124
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,234
We should try a lot.
We should try right now.

1125
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,793
On our first date, we were sitting
on that baseball field...

1126
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:50,836
And you said that life doesn't
always turn out the way you expect.

1127
01:18:52,388 --> 01:18:53,668
which is right...

1128
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:59,138
but... I think that if you stay...

1129
01:19:00,646 --> 01:19:06,811
...and maybe marry me, we can
still have that 'happily ever after'.

1130
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:12,026
Yeah.

1131
01:19:21,084 --> 01:19:23,456
Happily ever after? Really?

1132
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:26,285
Trust me, I am a writer...
soon to be published.

1133
01:19:27,215 --> 01:19:30,501
Yeah, but Troy... Can't you
come up with a better name?

1134
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:32,379
Everyone is a critic!

1135
01:19:35,098 --> 01:19:37,138
How come you
didn't change 'me'?

1136
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,388
I couldn't change you.

1137
01:19:40,187 --> 01:19:41,562
You're perfect.

1138
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:53,748
<i>Don't you worry there,
my honey...</i>

1139
01:19:53,784 --> 01:19:57,367
<i>We might not have any money...</i>

1140
01:19:57,496 --> 01:20:02,158
<i>But we've got our love
to pay your bills...</i>

1141
01:20:04,503 --> 01:20:07,837
<i>Maybe, I think you're
cute and funny...</i>

1142
01:20:07,924 --> 01:20:12,751
<i>Maybe I want to do what
bunnies do with you...</i>

1143
01:20:12,845 --> 01:20:16,345
<i>If you know what I mean...</i>

1144
01:20:18,142 --> 01:20:24,367
<i>Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents'
home in south of France...</i>

1145
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:27,943
<i>Let's get rich and gale,

1146
01:20:27,944 --> 01:20:31,030
<i>...and teach them how
to dance...</i>

<i>Let's get rich
and build a house...</i>

1148
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:38,037
<i>...on a mountain, makin' eveybody

1149
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:44,501
<i>From way up there,
you and I, you and I...</i>

1150
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:49,673
<i>Well, you might be
a bit confused...</i>

1151
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,335
<i>And you might be
a little bit bruised...</i>

1152
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:58,886
<i>But baby how we spoon
like no one knows...</i>

1153
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:04,434
<i>So, I will help you read
those books...</i>

1154
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:08,065
<i>If you will soothe my
worried look...</i>

1155
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:12,821
<i>And we will put the lonesome
on the shelf...</i>

1156
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:18,271
<i>Oh, let's get rich
and buy...</i>

1157
01:21:18,272 --> 01:21:21,383
