00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,370
And Christmas Eve.

362
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,572
Duchess!

363
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,006
Oh, breakfast? Sierra...

364
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:02,874
Oh.

365
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,579
She loves that cat.

366
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,681
Hey. Speaking of
the Christmas Eve gift,

367
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,051
I haven't quite nailed down
what I'm getting Sierra yet.

368
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,454
You didn't finish all of your
Christmas shopping, did you?

369
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,289
Is Christmas shopping
ever done?

370
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,958
Eh, not really.

371
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,025
[laughs]

372
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,361
Okay.

373
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,265
Uh-oh.

374
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,499
[mewing]

375
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,602
There are only seven kittens
here but we started with nine.

376
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,903
Did you count the orange
one twice?

377
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,071
There are two orange ones.

378
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,639
[meows]

379
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,140
Maybe three?

380
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,076
Where'd they go?
What are we going to do?

381
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,812
Um, just breathe.

382
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:41,813
Take it a step at a time.

383
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,882
First we gotta figure out
how old they are,

384
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,317
are they healthy, weaned?

385
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,719
That's a good idea.

386
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,987
Ambrose's vet is
just down the street,

387
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,455
maybe... maybe he can
fit 'em in.

388
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,123
[gasps]
Oh, good catch!

389
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,560
Uh, Zachary?

390
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,230
Oh. Thank goodness.

391
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,899
-Here.
-Oh, oh!

392
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,401
You're going to need
a bigger box.

393
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,036
[laughs]
Yeah.

394
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,306
Oh!

395
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,641
[laughs]

396
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:10,708
Oh, guys.

397
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,611
What are you saying?

398
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,314
That you don't want to go
to the benefit

399
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,985
or that you're not coming here
at all?

400
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,721
It's not me making
this decision, it's...

401
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,692
It's the new on-call vet.

402
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,594
The record system's
crashed twice.

403
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,995
Yeah, but it crashes on us
all the time.

404
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,164
I mean, he'll figure it out.

405
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,166
And what if he doesn't?

406
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:39,203
I'm not like you, I can't
just turn the work switch off.

407
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,039
Even for my family?

408
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:45,677
Look, I knew you'd be upset
so I have a solution.

409
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,312
President's Day.

410
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,947
<i> We fly out to Oregon</i>
<i> Friday night,</i>

411
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,048
<i> take the long weekend...</i>

412
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,717
President's Day
is not Christmas.

413
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,686
Okay.

414
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,021
I'm sensing that this is
a deal-breaker

415
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,123
so just forget
I said anything

416
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,659
and I'll fly out tomorrow
for the benefit party.

417
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,495
No. No, I don't want that.

418
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,197
I don't, I don't want
a concession.

419
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,533
I want you to want
to be here,

420
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,201
to want to spend time
with my family.

421
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,103
And I'm tired of...

422
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,707
[sighs]
...I don't know.

423
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,208
What are you saying?

424
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:21,179
Miles, I missed my
High School Reunion.

425
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,481
We had to prep for
our grand opening.

426
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,549
And the trip,

427
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,250
the cruise that we had planned
with your family,

428
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,218
we had to cancel that.

429
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,020
My family knows we're running
a business.

430
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,054
Yeah.

431
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:41,199
For the last two years,
Miles, all we have done

432
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,669
is just go, go, go, go, go.

433
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:48,773
It's always one thing
after the other.

434
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,308
I just, I...

435
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,147
I don't know. I...

436
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,650
What are we doing?

437
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,721
What are you saying?

438
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,190
That's it? That's all he had
to say?

439
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,959
Well, yeah...

440
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,628
I figured he would've fought
for me a little harder.

441
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,763
I don't know him that well,

442
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,364
I only know him through
video chats.

443
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,968
But I do know you and I know
when something's wrong.

444
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,536
And it may not feel like
this now

445
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,038
but I think you did
the right thing.

446
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,472
Yeah, at the wrong time.

447
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,775
I don't want to ruin Christmas
with my moping.

448
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,476
Hey, you spent two years
with Miles.

449
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,211
You are allowed to mope.

450
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,880
And besides it's more than
just a breakup.

451
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,049
I mean, you share a business.

452
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,817
I don't even want to think about
that right now.

453
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:33,785
No need.

454
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,120
You don't have to solve
everything in a day.

455
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,321
Uh...

456
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,157
Hi.

457
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,559
I figured you would've been
skiing by now.

458
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,327
Ah, well, these guys
thought differently.

459
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,063
Jaclyn & Marilee: Oh.

460
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,733
My goodness,
look at this face.

461
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,967
<i> Zachary: Yeah.</i>

462
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,102
What is this?

463
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,137
Somebody left them at the fire
station this morning.

464
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,272
I'm taking them over
to Doctor Roberts

465
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,306
to get them checked out.

466
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,441
-What?
-Doctor Roberts?

467
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,177
I hate to break it to you
but he retired last month.

468
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,678
He sent that email.

469
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,580
Right. I read the email.

470
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,949
But I thought that was next
year he was retiring.

471
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,417
Okay, hi.

472
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,554
I'm a vet!

473
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,425
You're a vet.

474
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,095
Oh, my gosh. Let's get these
checked out.

475
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,263
[meowing]

476
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,301
Well, I think by their teeth
and their paws

477
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,336
that they're about
10 weeks old.

478
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,270
Healthy like the others?

479
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,106
I'm assuming that they need
their shots

480
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,141
but I can get
those overnighted.

481
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,210
Well, then I just need like a,
like a big pen?

482
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,345
You know, with like a,
like a roof?

483
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,116
I guess I have heard of such
things, they're called houses.

484
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,818
I just... I'm not sure how
they'll do in my house.

485
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,321
I just bought it and I'm
renovating the kitchen so.

486
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,458
Oh. Well, uh,
what if we...

487
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,827
and, I mean, I don't want
to speak for you here,

488
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,963
but could keep them here.

489
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:52,997
No.

490
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,733
It's a very kind offer
but you have a whole family.

491
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,601
Who can help.

492
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,137
Trust me, this will make
Sierra's year.

493
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,404
Well, I wouldn't want
to be stepping

494
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,706
on your Christmas plans.

495
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,840
Oh well, when paws
are this cute

496
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,076
they can step all over
our plans.

497
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:05,743
Mm-hmm.

498
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,878
All right.

499
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,514
Well, it would give me more time
to help find them homes.

500
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,482
Oh. Well, you don't have to do
that by yourself.

501
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:12,683
Oh, no, no.

502
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,319
I found them so I should be
the one to find them homes.

503
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,155
Yeah, but what about
your ski trip?

504
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,657
I think we all agree that
that's indefinitely postponed.

505
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,759
So, you don't want
my help then?

506
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,362
Well, I wouldn't say no
if it was offered.

507
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,263
Great!

508
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,931
Then I guess you're
working together.

509
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,868
Okay. Well, I will let you two
sort this out.

510
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,070
Okay. Got nine kittens.

511

512
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,708
Okay, Well, here we go.

if you're blocking the shot.

Some traditions are sacred.

537
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,197
Yeah? What about the one
that I get a kiss every day.

538
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,399
Hmm, when did that start?

539
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,300
Today.

540
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,302
[laughs]

541
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,405
Where is all this confidence
coming from?

542
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,709
From a man who's about to spend
a lot more time with his wife.

543
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,311
Fire chiefs can't go
part-time, Sam.

544
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,348
Maybe it's time I stopped
being fire chief.

545
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,949
You mean retire?

546
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,388
[laughs]

547
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,658
You can't imagine how happy
this makes me.

548
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,226
So, when will you make
it official?

549
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,062
I'm giving the speech
at the benefit on Saturday.

550
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,398
It's as good a time as any.

551
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,701
But there's someone I need
to talk to first.

552
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,203
Hi Sam.
Hi Harriet.

553
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,404
-Hey.
-Hi.

554
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,305
Marilee.

555
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:20,911
Don't tell me you wrangled her
into Operation Kitten Rescue.

556
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,080
Well, uh... I needed a vet.

557
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,081
And I'm a vet.

558
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,049

559
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,551
Oh. We just did a photoshoot
with these guys.

560
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,786
You gotta see this.

561
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:29,920
Come on.

562
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,455
Who could say no
to those faces?

563
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,791
You didn't say they were
that cute.

564
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,593
Well, come on,
everyone looks cute

565

sitting in a wicker basket.

566
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,863
That's actually not true,
but...

567
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:46,037
Wait, wait. You, you want
to adopt a kitten?

568
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:49,073
Or you know. Two.

569
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,876
It's been a while since
we've had a cat in the house.

571
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,717
Can you guys give us a few days
to kitten proof?

[laughs]

573
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,421
Yeah, of course.

574
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,789
Now, can I get a kiss?

Okay, I think we have it
all set. Call her.

578
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,901
Okay.

579
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,103
Hey Sierra, come here
for a sec.

580
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,071
What?

581
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,074
We just want to show
you something.

582
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,611
Surprise!

584
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,283
So, you only get to keep them
for a few days?

585
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,652
Mm-hmm. Until we find them
a forever home.

586
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,188
Why can't it be here?
They're happy with Duchess.

587
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,758
Well, because they're going to
need an owner to buy them food

588
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,594
and keep them warm
and take them to the vet.

589
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,429
And the best Christmas present

Nine, well that's perfect.

598
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,449
And on that note,

599
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,219
I think it's time we talk about
not getting attached, okay?

600
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,621
Sure. As soon as I find
some old socks.

601
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,423
I'm making stockings for them.

602
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,193
Too late.

Yes, and you'll never ever
see it.

Show it to me.

-No.

-Yes.
-No.

we can use in there.

Well, you know what,

630
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,121
there's actually a little bit
of science to that.

631
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,857
Kittens often latch onto
a littermate.

632
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,627
They call it the "bonded pair."

00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:13,887
Can you blame me?

[meows]

893
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,025
Enough of the dramatics,
Ambrose.

894
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:21,528
You're just smelling
the kittens

895
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:24,097
and maybe a little bit
of Marilee.

896
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,165
[trills]

897
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:29,102
We were wrapping presents.
Don't get your hopes up, okay?

898
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:31,438
She made her mind up about me
a long time ago.

899
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:33,540
So, we're just going to get
the kittens adopted,

900
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:34,774
then we'll be done,

901
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,577
and you and I will have
a nice Christmas.

902
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,512
[phone chimes]

903
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,418
I guess I'll buy coffee.

904
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,522
The whole firehouse knows?

905
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:51,124
News travels fast.

906

[sighs]

907
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,261
I guess, I'd better make
an announcement soon.

908
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:57,464
I planned on doing it
at the benefit but...

909
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:59,599
What's stopping you?

910
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:04,537
Well, I can't really quit
unless I name my successor.

911
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:07,040
Yeah. That's a tough one.

912
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:10,076
I mean, you really transformed
the whole department.

913
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:13,813
The mentoring program,
the holiday outreach.

914
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:16,116
No one can fill your shoes.

915
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,019
How can you be so sure
if you never try them on?

916
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,889
Wait.

917
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,125
You want me to be chief?

918
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,728
I think the question is,
do you want to be?

919
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,768
[children giggling]

920
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:40,006
I feel like there's pictures
of us in that.

921
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:43,810
I feel like we have pictures
of our grandparents in that.

922
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,980
Yeah, we have deep roots
around here.

923
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,915
That's the beauty of Jamestown.

924
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,684
Imagine spending five years
of your life

925
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,021
just struggling to get a
foothold only to realize

926
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:58,525
the place you feel most at home
is the one that you left.

927
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,363
Well, if that's true then Miami
wasn't for nothing.

928
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,665
It helped you figure out
what you didn't want.

929
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,968
Now, it's time to figure out
what you do want.

930
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:12,205
Well, that's easy.
A practice with boundaries.

931
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,940
Getting to know
my clients' names.

932
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:18,311
Weekends, evenings to myself.
Vacations.

933
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:21,381
Preferably somewhere closer
to you guys.

934
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:25,352
Hmm. I'm liking this practice.
Keep talking.

935
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,120
So, the outdoor market's
too crowded,

936
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:29,022
the ice rink is too dangerous.

937
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,791
Same goes with the snow
play area.

938
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:36,830
Well, there aren't too many
events that are BYO kittens.

939
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,098
Yeah.

940
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,701
Unless we make our own event.

941
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,637
You're thinking
what I'm thinking?

942
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:46,806
I don't know.

943
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,876
You thinking cat cafe?

944
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,878
[laughs]

945
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,546
-Okay.
-Yeah.

946
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,816
Well, you think she's going
to let us do it here?

947
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:58,351
I don't see why not.

948
00:38:58,387 --> 00:39:00,420
You could introduce yourself,
play the vet card,

949
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,355
see if she's game.

950
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:03,656
Yeah, something tells me

951
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:05,825
it's going to go over better
if you ask.

952
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,529
Hi.

953
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,369
All right.
Bets in, you guys.

954

gets an extra pecan bun.

955

Hmm.

00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:21,674
A Santa hat?

957
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,776
Ooh.

958
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,411
Uh, harp.

00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,378
Angel.

960
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:26,679
Cheater!

961
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:28,415
You only said that
'cause I said harp.

962
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,584
Fine, bow. Uh, ribbon.

963
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,987
Okay. Let's see.

964
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,429
Ah, cheater wins.

965
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,463
What is it?

966
00:39:43,498 --> 00:39:44,764
A bow with no gift.

967
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,765
Yes.

968
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,100
What do you think it means?

969
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,401
Hmm... I don't know.

970
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:51,037
Wait a minute. You know what
these are from?

971
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:52,705
These are from Mom's
charm bracelet,

972
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:54,607
the one that she
used to wear.

973
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,408
Right, to church.

974
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:56,810
When she'd sing
on Christmas Eve.

975
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:58,011
Yeah, and then she would
take it off

976
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,280
when she was making sugar
cookies and put it by the sink.

977
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,581
And then we would fight over
wearing it.

978
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:02,615
Yeah.

979
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:07,320
Oh, it's like getting a little
piece of her back.

980
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:08,388
Yeah, it is.

take care of refreshments.

cat supplies and cat toys.

When we first met?

1002
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,876
You scolded me about giving
Ambrose milk

1003
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:06,179
and you called me a hero.

1004
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,649
I think, I even gave you
a double hero.

1005
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:10,450
That's right.

00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:16,222
And now you're like
a superhero.

there are a lot of cats now.

a bookstore cat.

Aren't bookstore cats usually
sleepy, chill, older?

What if I could guarantee you
two out of the three?

Well, she's a therapist
so I doubt that.

a really good bookstore kitty.

Dasher and Dancer
are going with Sam.

Uh, speaking of Sam.

1050
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:13,840
He's retiring and he asked me
to be chief.

Wow! Zach, that's amazing.

1052
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,278

the job?

Why wouldn't you want the job?
You're perfect for it.

you're qualified, you're...

Good. I'm good.

1056
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,655
You know, why sign up for more
drama when I'm good.

1057
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,657
Because what if you could be
better than good?

1058
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,593
Better than good?
What if it's worse?

1059
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:35,194
Then I'm not good anymore

1060
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,498
and that's why "good"
is good enough.

1061
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,367
Wow. Been here before.

1062
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:43,670
So, I'm just going to let you
work that one out,
