1
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,847
- Hiya.
- Hello.

2
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,781
Sure is pretty.

3
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,989
Sure is.

4
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,958
- What's your name?
- Why?

5
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,664
Just curious is all.

6
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,203
It's Lovely.

7
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,930
Is your real name Lovely?

8
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,267
That's the only one I got.

9
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,075
I'm Tom.

10
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,447
Is your real name Tom?

11
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,578
That's funny.

12
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,683
You from around here?

13
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,747
Why are you so curious?

14
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,525
I already told you my name after all.

15
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,221
I got a pretty good reason I suppose.

16
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,031
Oh, yeah? And what might that be?

17
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,158
Because you're just about the prettiest girl
I've ever seen in my entire life.

18
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,205
Oh, yeah? You think so?

19
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,695
I do.

20
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,969
- That's really sweet.
- Thanks.

21
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,741
So, are you from around here?

22
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,560
Oh, God. Pick up! Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!

23
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,257
Please pick up!

24
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,565
- Hello?
- Tom!

25
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,835
- Who is this?
- Tom, it's me!

26
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,802
Lovely, why are you calling here?

27
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,112
- I told you not...
- Listen to me!

28
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,453
Something happened.

29
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,016
It's bad. It's really bad.

30
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,222
Where are you?

31
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,106
<i>The sinner! The defilers!</i>

32
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,938
<i>He's sending them right back to us!</i>

33
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,613
<i>Why?</i>

34
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,207
<i>Because of you.</i>

35
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,720
<i>Because of the sins
that you perform each and every day.</i>

36
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,251
<i>You have sexual relations out of wedlock.</i>

37
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,621
<i>You kill and abort children.</i>

38
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,589
<i>You are a man lying with men.</i>

39
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,259
<i>Same sex marriages.</i>

40
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,497
<i>How do you think your God will judge you?</i>

41
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,340
<i>Well, my brothers and my sisters,
now we know.</i>

42
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,041
<i>Now we know.</i>

43
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:11,078
<i>When there is no more room in hell,
the dead will...</i>

44
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,245
<i>Hey, kids, welcome back to KZMV.</i>

45
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,290
<i>Hokey Halloween weekend nightmare.</i>

46
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,892
<i>We're rolling through
our annual terror-then.</i>

47
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:36,266
<i>We're about halfway through
Boris Karloff s 1945 radio play,</i>

48
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,434
The Wailing Wall.

49
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,943
<i>But first...</i>

50
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,009
<i>Still rushing to find
the perfect last minute costume</i>

51
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,678
<i>for your Halloweekend?</i>

52
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,718
<i>Well, why not
head down to Randall's Pennysave</i>

53
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,249
<i>on Jimble road just off
Route 1 in Macon County.</i>

54
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,694
<i>Choose from a wide array
of ghosts and ghouls...</i>

55
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,258
<i>Everything you need</i>

56
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:07,668
<i>to make this Halloween
the spookiest one yet.</i>

57
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,181
Hello?

58
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,751
It's me.

59
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,715
Tom?

60
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah.

61
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,064
Did you... Did you come alone?

62
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,163
What's going on?

63
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,130
Did you?

64
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,904
Lovely!

65
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,337
Tell me.

66
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,213
Yeah, <i>I</i> did.

67
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,543
You did what?

68
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,046
I came alone just like you asked.
Now open the door.

69
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,913
Hello?

70
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,827
I didn't... I didn't mean to call
you out of the blue like this.

71
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,759
Are you all right?

72
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,875
Tom, would you please
promise me that you'll help.

73
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,803
Tom.

74
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,778
Look, I don't much
like talking about these kinda things

75
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,444
through no door.

76
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,313
Okay.

77
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,015
I'm gonna...

78
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,188
I'm gonna open the door,
but I need you to make me a promise, okay?

79
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,453
What?

80
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,635
I need you to promise that you'll forget
who your brother works for.

81
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,670
- Why?
-'Cause I...

82
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,207
I don't want you calling the police just yet.

83
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,245
Just let me in.

84
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,477
Promise.

85
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,679
All right, fine, I promise.

86
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,103
Are you all right?

87
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,873
Are you hurt?

88
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,073
What is going on, then?

89
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,809
You're the only one I thought to call.

90
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,911
Is that so?

91
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,655
I knew you'd come.

92
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,222
You wanna tell me
why you called me all the way out

93
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,124
to some rat trap on Route 6,

94
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,686
or are we just gonna
stand out here all night?

95
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,593
I swear I wasn't gonna do it again.

96
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,408
You listen to me, all right.

97
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,284
You gotta tell me what's going on.

98
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,623
So you either open this door,
or I'm gonna turn right around and leave.

99
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,286
'Cause I told you
I was fed up with this shit the last time!

100
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,623
Don't yell at me!

101
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,926
Then you let me know
what you pulled me in to, all right?

102
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,555
What the fuck is that?

103
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,487
I think I hurt him really bad.

104
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,529
How did this happen?

105
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,064
- Answer me!
- How do you think it happened?

106
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,661
Would you keep your voice down?

107
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,365
How'd you get here?

108
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,670
Brenna picked me up and we went to a bar.

109
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,268
Okay, which bar?

110
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,810
Some dive in Madison County.

111
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,473
What was it called?

112
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,212
- I don't remember.
- Well, try to.

113
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,652
Silver Fox.

114
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,620
- The Silver Fox.
- Yeah.

115
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,629
Did Brennatake you here?

116
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,966
- No.
- Well, where is she?

117
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,203
She got really drunk
and called Louellen and they went home.

118
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,199
Who is this man?

119
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,074
Who is he?

120
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,173
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

121
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,289
Is he alive?

122
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,892
I don't know.

123
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,493
This is bad, Lovely.

124
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,726
This is real bad.

125
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,678
No!

126
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,413
- We have to call somebody!
- You can't!

127
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,684
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- I called you.

128
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,726
Well, I can't help you with this. No way.

129
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,022
You don't even know what happened!
You don't even know!

130
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,324
Get back!

131
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,592
They're gonna blame me for stabbing him!

132
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,997
They're gonna throw me into jail!

133
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,535
You should've thought of that
before you stuck that knife in him.

134
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,571
Is that what you want,
for the police to come down here

135
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,038
and take me away?

136
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,936
I didn't do this to you, you did it to yourself.

137
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,204
-It's not my fault!
- Certainly.

138
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,602
Fuck.

139
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,140
People are gonna say things,
terrible things about me, about us.

140
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,083
Well, your brother's probably
gonna be the one in charge of all this.

141
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,082
He hit me, Tom.

142
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,761
He got real angry and he hit me.

143
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,624
You said you were
gonna never let that happen to me again.

144
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,259
You promised me.

145
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,264
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

146
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,005
Don't you bring my brother
into this situation again.

147
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,785
It was never supposed to be like this.

148
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,216
This is so fucked.

149
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,462
I never meant to hurt anyone, Tom.
You know that I wouldn't do that.

150
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,623
What'd you just say?

151
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,394
I said I never meant to hurt anyone.

152
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,763
What, did you think
you were doing me a service

153
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,496
calling me down here? Huh?

154
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,834
- I don't know!
- Of course not.

155
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,570
-It wasn't my fault!
- Yeah, well, it's never your fault.

156
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,372
You don't know what happened.

157
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,537
- Oh, I don't?
- No.

158
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,108
Well I think
I'm pretty learned on the subject.

159
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,273
All right? Same story, different night.

160
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,509
Only this time
you have the audacity to take me here.

161
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,153
So what'd you think, huh?

162
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,914
You think I was just
gonna come down here to the rescue?

163
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,359
After everything that you put me through.

164
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,826
Tell you what. Not a problem here.

165
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,824
After all, it ain't your fault.

166
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,361
But if I don't you threaten to embarrass me.

167
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,468
I mean,
haven't you embarrassed me enough?

168
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,975
Just stop being mean to me, Tom!
You're the only one I called.

169
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,178
What makes you think
I'd do anything to help you?

170
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,078
Because that's what
a husband does for his wife.

171
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,944
You were some wife.
You were some fucking wife!

172
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,815
All right. Okay, listen to me, all right?

173
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,914
You gotta stop crying
and start answering my questions.

174
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,927
All right.
Does anybody know you're here right now?

175
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,557
- You sure?
- Nobody.

176
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,196
Did anybody see you leave the bar with him?

177
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,527
- No.
- Not Brenna? Not Louellen?

178
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,100
No, they left 'cause she was too drunk.
Tom, I already told you so.

179
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,842
And besides,
we didn't even know anybody at that place.

180
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,901
He just came up to me and asked me

181
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,744
if I wanted to go back to his place
and have a drink with him.

182
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,976
Did he check in here or did you?

183
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,713
He did, Tom, this is his room,
I've already told you so.

184
00:17:58,944 --> 00:17:59,945
Okay.

185
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,585
So nobody saw you leave the bar with him.

186
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,986
Right, he checked in here.

187
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,624
Did anybody see you walk up
when you got here?

188
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,927
No.

189
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,725
Okay.

190
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,495
Okay. Okay.

191
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,369
Fuck.

192
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,777
All right, who is he?

193
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,414
I don't know.

194
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,815
I hate it when you lie to me.

195
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,750
You know,
I don't even know why I'm here right now.

196
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,980
Because we care about each other, Tom.

197
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,856
Don't you do that, all right. Don't you dare.

198
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,949
That statement was rhetorical anyhow.

199
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,324
Because the only thing keeping me
from running out that door right now

200
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,260
is that I'm a fucking accomplice!

201
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,495
I mean I can't exactly leave you here
and pretend it didn't happen, can I?

202
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,233
How many times?

203
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,805
I swear, he was the only one.

204
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,314
How many times
did you stick that knife in him?

205
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,418
He dropped it when I kicked him.

206
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,032
Here you go. Drink up.

207
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,041
I don't know if I should, darling.

208
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,599
The room's all sorts of spinning.

209
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,076
Oh, come on.

210
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,210
There's always room for one more.

211
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,882
You see?

212
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,790
Maybe in a little bit.

213
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:50,129
It ain't polite
to turn down a gift from the host of a party.

214
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,035
You and me ain't much of a party, sugar.

215
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,376
Someone offers you a drink, you take it.

216
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,587
No whore is gonna
walk into my room and insult me.

217
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,361
Now drink the fucking cocktail.

218
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,267
That's a good girl.

219
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,015
Are you fucking kidding me?

220
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,958
We can do this dance the easy way.

221
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,195
But I prefer to tango just as well.

222
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,604
Come here.

223
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,916
Come here.

224
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,804
Calm the fuck down.

225
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,164
Calm down. Calm down.

226
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,542
- You're gonna like this.
- No!

227
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,150
Fuck!

228
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,138
Twice?

229
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,408
Yeah.

230
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,376
Fucking hell.

231
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,737
You think he's dead?

232
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,077
Certainly.

233
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,341
But I ain't a professional.

234
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,718
We gotta get rid of him.

235
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,885
Get rid of him?

236
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,452
Hide him somewhere,
bury him or something.

237
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,758
What, are you out of your fucking mind?

238
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,697
I can't do it myself, Tom.

239
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,201
You wanna tell me
how we're gonna carry a man's body

240
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,203
out that door, down those stairs,

241
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,103
past the manager's office and in my truck.
Just you and me.

242
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,335
We can't just leave him here!

243
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,704
Tom!

244
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,580
Tom.

245
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,859
So nobody knows nothing

246
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,488
involving anything
about this situation, right?

247
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,796
For the thousandth time, Tom, yes.

248
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,936
You swear to me?

249
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,466
I swear.

250
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,972
Can you explain the meaning of this?

251
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,338
I guess it never came up.

252
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,785
O key-d o key.

253
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,187
What're you doing?

254
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,693
I wanna know who I'm dealing with
before I make my final judgment call.

255
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:29,398
I don't wanna make a rash decision
and come to find you killed an undercover.

256
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,178
Well, at least he drives American.

257
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,740
Did you take a sip of this?

258
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,045
What is it?

259
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,180
Looks like your man
had a few party plans of his own.

260
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,172
Come here. We gotta get you cleaned up.

261
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,633
Thank you.

262
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,883
I think I'm gonna go
to hell for what I've done.

263
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,254
Tom...

264
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,796
Just stay here.

265
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,618
Well?

266
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,618
Oh, he's a man of mystery.

267
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,088
Found these, though.

268
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,602
There ain't no bowling ball in that bag.

269
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,971
Bowling seems like it'd be the better option.

270
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,304
No, instead you gotta run off

271
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,742
with a man who's
got a pocketful of sleeping pills

272
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,178
and a video camera in the trunk of his car.

273
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,715
Did he tell you he's going to Hollywood?

274
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,343
- No.
- Well, then how could you be so stupid?

275
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,649
I didn't think I had any other choice.

276
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,985
That ain't true and you know it.

277
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,788
Then tell me, Tom.
Tell me what was I supposed to do!

278
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,988
You were supposed to come home.

279
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,503
Now, let's see what your boy here was up to.

280
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,095
No.

281
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,871
Come on, sweetheart.
Don't you wanna see his other works?

282
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,104
Stop it, Tom.

283
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,781
I want you to come over here
and see what you could've been part of.

284
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,340
You have made your point.

285
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,749
I said, come on!

286
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,284
He was gonna do that to me.

287
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,648
What?

288
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,520
He was gonna bring me here

289
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,116
and his friends
were gonna do the same thing

290
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,559
they did to that girl on the movie.

291
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,824
- All right, just stop talking like that.
- No, it's true.

292
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:54,766
What if they're...
What if they're on their way here right now?

293
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,463
What if that was their plan all along?
They can be...

294
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,666
Okay, okay, you just calm down, all right?

295
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,005
What if they're coming here to get me, Tom?

296
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,806
That would serve you right!

297
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:03,902
- You don't mean that.
- All right?

298
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,676
You wanna know if
we were going to hell for what you've done?

299
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,877
Well, you should
take a fuckin' look around you, all right?

300
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,613
You were there,

301
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,019
and you dragged me with you.

302
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,825
All right, okay.

303
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,891
Now, the only option I foresee benefiting us
any which way is we just gotta split.

304
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,129
What?

305
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,194
Split, all right! Leave now!

306
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,899
No, we can't!
They'll find him and they'll know I did it!

307
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,670
Will you stop talking about them!
You don't know nothing about anything.

308
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,075
What about him, Tom?

309
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,771
He will not miss us.

310
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,877
They will come after us!

311
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,913
You're right.

312
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,378
It's better than us sitting around
waiting for somebody to show up, okay?

313
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,789
I mean, it don't matter if it's the police,

314
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,090
the men in that video,
or the Almighty himself, okay?

315
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,290
Look, we'll leave the video camera, all right?

316
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,527
Anybody who watches that tape,
they'll know that

317
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,799
the holes in his chest
were a direct follow-up from that.

318
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,071
Tom.

319
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,508
I don't know.

320
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,040
Let's just hope
nobody saw you here, all right?

321
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:55,717
Sir?

322
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,993
Sir, is everything all right in there?

323
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,659
Everything's fine.

324
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,426
Well, I heard what I perceived to be

325
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,331
a domestic disturbance
coming from this room, now.

326
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,664
Some signs of distress...

327
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,365
No, everything's good, it's all right.

328
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,407
The missus and I, we were just watching

329
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,808
you know, one of those
Halloween films on marathon too loud.

330
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,909
Is that true, ma'am?

331
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,715
Ma'am, I said, is that true?

332
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,050
I'm gonna have to hear it from you now.

333
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,458
Yes, yes, it's true.

334
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,121
Well,

335
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,753
it's that time of year as the man says that.

336
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:39,065
I reckon everyone's in for one good scare.

337
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:43,065
You just keep that volume
on the television turned a bit low,

338
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,505
you know as a courtesy for the other guests.

339
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,735
Thank you.

340
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,108
All right, you have a good
rest of the evening, then.

341
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,617
Now get your things.

342
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:15,825
Stay close.

343
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,925
No, don't!

344
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,902
<i>But this, this is impossible!</i>

345
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,136
<i>I saw him die with my own two eyes,
I saw him die.</i>

346
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,406
<i>But he cannot ever die.</i>

347
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,743
<i>Once bitten by the beast,</i>

348
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:52,151
<i>the victim will rise
from the dead and continue to kill.</i>

349
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,117
<i>The people they bite
will get up and continue to kill.</i>

350
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,655
<i>There is no stopping the curse.</i>

351
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,095
<i>There's got to be a way to break the spell.</i>

352
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,757
<i>They said you're the only one who can help.</i>

353
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,292
<i>If one brandishes
the blade against the beast,</i>

354
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,304
<i>the deal will crumble,</i>

355
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,601
<i>as h' it were made of sand.</i>

356
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,307
<i>Only beneath the full moon does...</i>

357
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:21,438
I used to look forward
to these radio shows when I was a kid.

358
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,813
Never cared much for trick or treatin'.

359
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,178
It's the Halloweekend Frightfest, I loved.

360
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,089
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

361
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,222
I used to sit around with my grandpap...

362
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,898
Pappy, and he'd tell us,

363
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,130
"Hey, you ankle biters,
you shut up down there.

364
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,774
"Radio show ain't gonna hear itself."

365
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:53,438
We'd always have to sit real quiet,
'cause Pappy, he couldn't hear so well.

366
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,445
I was always scared right outta my wits.

367
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,949
You never told me that.

368
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,349
But, you know, as strange as it sounds,

369
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,354
somehow, just hearing them,

370
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,360
even as I grew into a man,

371
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,961
something about it
felt comforting, you know?

372
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,083
Not no more.

373
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,461
What? Tom, what is it?

374
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,162
- You have my lighter?
- What lighter?

375
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,002
Your purse! Check your purse!

376
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,804
Get in your purse!

377
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,578
Jesus, Tom!

378
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,280
Hey!

379
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,386
Fuck!

380
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,757
Shit!

381
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,136
<i>You think he's dead?</i>

382
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,969
Certainly.

383
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,068
But I ain't a professional.

384
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,440
Tom!

385
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,214
Shit.

386
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,890
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

387
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,297
We shouldn't go back there, Tom.
It's just a lighter.

388
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,834
How many people named Tom Moses

389
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,564
do you think
won the South Texas marksmanship award?

390
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,866
Are you certain you left it?

391
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,565
Maybe you didn't have it
when you came in the room?

392
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,575
I smoked a cigarette in the room, remember?

393
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,133
How can you be sure?

394
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,008
'Cause I bought
a fresh pack on the way down

395
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,103
and there's only one missing.

396
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,080
There's two missing, Tom.

397
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,546
I don't wanna go back there.
We shouldn't go back there.

398
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,248
We can just drive and never look back.

399
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,053
- What'd you just say?
- We can just go, we don't have to go back!

400
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,323
How far did you get
when you ran off with that first clown?

401
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,054
Macon County?

402
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,931
How far you think you're gonna get
with a Texas Ranger hunting after you?

403
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,197
Now, get it through your head, sweetheart.

404
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:07,673
There ain't no movie stars in Gateswell!
Fuck!

405
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,100
Fuck!

406
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,710
<i>There's no turning back now.</i>

407
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,794
Just wait here.

408
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,033
Don't you want me to come with you?

409
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,303
It ain't your problem anymore.

410
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,939
Okay.

411
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,683
All right.

412
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,065
That's it.

413
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,012
- Tom!
- Get in the truck!

414
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,045
Get in there.

415
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,853
All right.

416
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,058
Come on.

417
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,397
Oh, fuck.

418
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,116
Come on.

419
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,165
Okay.

420
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,155
Jesus!

421
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,359
God, you scared me.

422
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,558
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.

423
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,693
I just noticed you could use a light.

424
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,488
Where'd you come from?

425
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,822
Nowhere in particular.

426
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,397
Thanks.

427
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,830
You're welcome.

428
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,297
What are you doing out here?

429
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,904
I'm just waiting for somebody.

430
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,213
It can get mighty quiet out here.

431
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,807
Yeah, it does.

432
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,825
They say this is the closest
the moon's gonna get to us all year.

433
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,831
You know some folks
calls it a harvest moon?

434
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,666
Is that so?

435
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,036
Yeah, that so.

436
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,083
Hey, honey?

437
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,982
Whose car is this?

438
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,042
Whose car is this?

439
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,546
Why?

440
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,149
Where's Michael?

441
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,095
Tom.

442
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,998
Tom!

443
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:50,923
Tom!

444
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,126
What are you doing here?

445
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,625
They're here.

446
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,682
We're coming to get you, beautiful.

447
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,343
Hey, Lovely, all right. Listen to me.

448
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,844
Sweetheart, listen.
I need you to listen to me, okay?

449
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,322
Do you remember that day
we first met on the beach?

450
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,462
Well, you remember I told you

451
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,499
you were the most
beautiful girl I'd ever met?

452
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,766
I meant it.

453
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,830
Okay?

454
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,998
He'll kill us all.

455
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,372
Hey, you listen to me, all right?

456
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,805
Listen.

457
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,106
You think I'd let anybody take away

458
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,408
the most beautiful girl
in the world away from me?

459
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,574
Huh?

460
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,440
Okay.

461
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,919
I need you to take this for me, all right?

462
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,583
Now, anybody gets through that door,
you know what to do.

463
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,358
- All right?
- Okay.

464
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,414
Somebody help us! Please! Please help us!

465
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,541
Please!

466
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,965
Step back.

467
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,486
Lovely! Come here!

468
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,950
All right.

469
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,720
I need you to squeeze through, okay?

470
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,192
I can't fit.

471
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,860
I'm gonna fall!

472
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,593
No, go fast!

473
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,003
Try to hold on.

474
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,136
Lovely, go!

475
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:16,874
<i>And with the closing of
that cryptic tale of horror...</i>

476
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,877
<i>Boys and ghouls,</i>

477
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:23,617
<i>we conclude KZMV's
super spooky Halloween weekend...</i>

478
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:28,323
<i>But don't you fret, in</i> a <i>short,</i> 365...

479
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,067
I've always liked this car.

480
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,576
You know,
Maynard stopped by the other day.

481
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,617
Stop the fucking presses.

482
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,530
It was only for a couple minutes.

483
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,936
It was good to see him.

484
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:14,131
Couple minutes with Maynard
seems like days.

485
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,573
What'd the little son of a bitch
have to say for himself?

486
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,882
Nothing much, nothing much.

487
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:34,155
Didn't, didn't say too much.

488
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:37,857
Yeah.

489
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,567
He don't know a whole lot of words.

490
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,918
Yeah...

491
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,314
Laura, Laura Louise,

492
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:08,126
she's giving him a little verbal hurting
because of the move.

493
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:09,685
You know, she be like, "We gotta move,"

494
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,891
and he's like, "No, we don't."

495
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,661
Like, "Yes, we do."

496
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,833
He say, "No, we don't."

497
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,236
Castrating bitches.

498
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,707
Shouldn't marry them,

499
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,439
should kill them.

500
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,782
Yeah, but, you know, still.

501
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,225
You know, it would've been nice
to have him tonight, right?

502
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,193
Would've been helpful.

503
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,990
Not particularly.

504
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,635
Done this shit a thousand times.

505
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:01,538
You hear that?

506
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,049
Tell me,

507
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,951
after you dumped her in the trunk,

508
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,321
did it occur to you at any point

509
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,924
you might wanna tie her down?

510
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:28,164
Fuck! Stupid! Fuck!

511
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,509
Man, I'm sorry. I just... I wasn't...

512
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,241
I just threw her in, and I'm so...

513
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,080
- Just pull over. Pull, pull over.
- No. Forget about it.

514
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,948
Forget about it, kid.

515
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,578
It's all good.

516
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:43,314
But...

517
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,187
Remind me to tell you

518
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,057
sometime about what I did back in '69.

519
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,532
Now that was a fuck-up.

520
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:05,201
Well, what happened in '69?

521
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,474
I said ask me sometime.

522
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,231
No.

523
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:08,464
No!

524
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,227
No. No.

525
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,859
No.

526
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,592
No. No.

527
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:47,873
No, no, no, no, no!

528
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,440
No! No!

529
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,603
<i>N'), m, no, no.</i>

530
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:54,436
No!

531
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,582
Get me out!

532
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,411
No!

533
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,724
No! No!

534
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,102
