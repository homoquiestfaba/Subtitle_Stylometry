Good morning.

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,519

Come on, you two.
Let's go!

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,279
- Is Dmitry asleep?
- I took him to your dad's.

11
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,279
- How's the old man?
- He's got a heart of gold.

12
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,039
Sasha, are you Greek
on your father's side,

13
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,039
or is it on your mother's?

14
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,279
His father's.
They are Mariupol Greeks.

15
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,039
Ludmila!

16
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,119
What's wrong?

17
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,319
What's happened?

18
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Nothing.

19
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
Nothing's happened.

20
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,559
I just forgot...

21
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,759
I forgot...

22
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,279
I remembered everyone
except my own father.

23
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,039
He asked me to bring him
some soil.

24
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,039
He gave me a little bag.

25
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,079
"Nothing else...
Just a little soil" he said,

26
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,039
"from the land of my ancestors."

27
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,079
He even offered a scoop
to take with me.

28
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,639
All you can do
is wait for the next time.

29
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,039
Ask for another day's leave.

30
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,039
There may not be a next time.

31
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,359
That's true.

32
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,879
Sasha...

33
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,079
Why not give him our soil?
You can swap it later.

34
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,679
That's right. Our soil is
just as good as theirs.

35
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,759
My nephew works
for a transport company

36
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,519
who sell it in Europe
for hard currency!

37
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,519
Just find a clean spot
in the yard and have a dig.

38
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,039
Make sure
there are lots of pebbles.

39
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,519
My dear Greeks,
don't wash your tunics.

40
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,519
They're disposable.

41
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,039
Welcome home, Sasha!

42
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,079
Tolya rang.

43
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,559
He wants to come over
these holidays.

44
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,079
Tolya is a saint.

45
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,319
We'll ask him over.

46
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,799
I brought him souvenir.

47
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,559
Son!

48
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,079
- You're back, son!
- Hi, Dad.

49
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,919
Come in.

50
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,079
And you're not alone...
Here's Malysh!

51
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,559
Come in.

52
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,559
- What's it like there?
- A mess, like here.

53
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,079
A mess?

54
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,079
Come on in.
I'll give him some sausage.

55
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,919
For you.

56
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,799
- Let's see...
- A jumper.

57
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,799
Thanks.

58
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,559
It's pure wool.
For the rheumatism.

59
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Thanks.

60
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,559
Is that all?

61
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,319
Don't worry.
I didn't forget.

62
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,079
I dug some up.
In Tripolis.

63
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,559
In the main square.

64
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,559
You really brought it!

65
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,559
Thanks, son.

66
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,079
I appreciate it.

67
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,559
Now I'm not afraid to die.

68
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,559
I bet you think
the old man is crackers!

69
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,079
When you're my age, you'll ask
your son for the same thing.

70
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,719
- How did he behave?
- He's the best!

71
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,719
And your wife's pretty good.

72
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,719
You're a lucky man...
a lucky man!

73
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,079
Ludmila!

74
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,559
Any idea
who could have written this?

75
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,079
He's an old squealer...
he was, and is.

76
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,319
- Who?
- Your daddy.

77
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,279
Who else could've written it?

78
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,279
"Our family
has never had a cuckold."

79
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,039
Who's the cuckold?
Me?

80
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,279
Oh, God...

81
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,679
A classmate of mine was here
and your old man dropped by.

82
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,039
Anyone I know?

83
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,759
No. But he must have thought
something was going on.

84
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,919
There must have been a reason.

85
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,279
What reason?

86
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,039
What reason did he have
to send people to prison?

87
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,039
This sudden need
for his native soil!

88
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,039
Sure. He's afraid to die here!

89
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
No one will come to his funeral.

90
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,039
Except perhaps to spit on him.

91
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,039
Stop it.
How long has he got to live?

92
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,039
Don't worry. He'll outlive
both of us.

93
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,759
His reason? A man in a pair
of underpants, that's all.

94
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
- Underpants? Why?
- Oh, God...

95
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,079
He spilt sardine oil,
so I washed his pants.

96
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
He was opening a can
and tipped it over.

97
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,559
I said I'd wash his pants.

98
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,559
Just then your dad walked in.

99
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,559
- That's funny...
- Not at all.

100
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,119
He's going to tell you
my friend left at sunrise.

101
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,079
I'm sure he was spying.

102
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,079
At sunrise?

103
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,079
Should he have left
with his pants still wet?

104
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,319
This Shurik is useful,
you know.

105
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,119
In what way?

106
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,559
He can be of help.

107
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,319
How?
He can get you sardines?

108
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,079
Anything.

109
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,319
- Who are you calling?
- Tolya.

110
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,180
<i>Nuclear specialits' city.
Evening, 25th April, 1986.</i>

111
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,359
Kolya, go to bed.
No one can wake you tomorrow.

112
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,159
Hello.
What Acropolis?

113
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,319
Hi, Ignat. It's Zhuravlyov.

114
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,319
Where are you calling from?

115
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,079
From Greece.

116
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,319
- How are things?
- Get Tolya.

117
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,399
Quick, get Uncle Tolya.

118
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,399
- Did you bring anything?
- Yes.

119
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,759
- What exactly?
- "Greece has it all."

120
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,559
Good for you.
Here he is.

121
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,079
It's Zhuravlyov.

122
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,279
Hi, Archimedes.
How do you feel?

123
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,319
Excellent. While I was away
my wife cheated on me.

124
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,319
I told you not to marry
a younger woman.

125
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,559
But, you know...
That's life.

126
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,319
Is it? All right, we'll
sort it out when I come over.

127
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,559
Wait, I'll be there soon.
Bye.

128
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,799
- Won't you eat with us?
- No, I'm late for work.

129
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,559
- I'm on night shift too.
- I can give you a lift.

130
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,799
It's all right, I'm driving
Maria to her mother's.

131
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,599
At this hour?

132
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,319
We're planting potatoes
early in the morning.

133
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
- Good luck.
- Hold this...

134
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,319
Look at that driving.

135
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,079
They must be training.
They like their war games.

136
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,079
I'll give you a shot
and you'll be fine.

137
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,559
Don't worry.

138
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,319
They shouldn't have
bothered you.

139
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,919
They want me in a hospital.

140
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,719
What are you saying?
We're just trying to help.

141
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,719
Good.

142
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,079
Thank you.

143
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,159
Look, doctor, we're getting
married tomorrow.

144
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,079
I can smell it.

145
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,079
- How about a drop?
- No, but a smoke...

146
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,559
A smoke? Just turn left
into the kitchen.

147
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,079
Yes, we're preparing.
You know how it is.

148
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,919
Doctor...

149
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,319
You know...

150
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,239
The thing is...

151
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,079
Doc...

152
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,839
Could you take him
for a week?

153
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,319
What do you mean?

154
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,079
With the wedding and all...

155
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,119
The noise, the drinking...

156
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,559
We're all in one room,
and he's an old man.

157
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't worry.

158
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,960
Don't worry.

159
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,119
- He'll outlive both of us.
- Will he?

160
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,639
Trust me.

161
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,999
I understand.

162
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,119
What could they be doing?

163
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,039
I don't like the look of it.

164
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,079
Petrovich, let's follow them.

165
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:04,700
<i>The nuclear Power Station.
Fourth reactor, 26th April, 3.12 AM.</i>

166
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,759
What happened, Ignat?

167
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,599
What happened?

168
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,119
Can you hear me?
What's wrong with you?

169
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,119
Tolya...

170
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,079
Are you in pain?
Where does it hurt?

171
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,719
- It's like I'm at a resort.
- What are you saying?

172
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,559
I'm asking you,
where does it hurt?

173
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Nowhere.

174
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,799
My face is burning.
It's like sunburn.

175
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,719
It's burning a lot.

176
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,559
I feel...

177
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,079
The reactor's exploded.

178
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,559
We have to evacuate
the complex.

179
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,799
It's only the structure.

180
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,319
Throw water on the reactor.
Radioactivity?

181
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,799
1000 micro-roentgens
per second.

182
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,599
They should check their device.

183
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,559
- It's lying.
- The device is fine.

184
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,599
There's graphite on the ground!

185
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,079
What graphite?

186
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,359
The men are vomiting...
They're passing out.

187
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,319
- There may be radiation.
- There's no radiation.

188
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,359
The reactor is intact.

189
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,079
Find out where Maria is.

190
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,799
Kolya is there...
alone.

191
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,079
Let's go.

192
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,079
Did you know him?

193
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,079
Did I know Ignat?
Yes, I did.

194
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,719
We grew up
on the same lock.

195
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,919
The two of us
and Sasha Zhuravlyov.

196
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:15,380
<i>Kiev.
26th April, 4.17 AM.</i>

197
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,079
What's wrong?

198
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,119
Is Dmitry my son, at least?

199
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,119
He's yours. Relax.

200
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,839
"The slender pines
are rustling."

201
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,119
"The bright sun is rising."

202
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,919
Don't come near.
It could be dangerous.

203
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,119
A blast at the Station.
Save the children.

204
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,359
Goodbye.

205
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,919
Tolya!

206
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,359
Where are you going?

207
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,599
Children, the lesson is over.

208
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,119
Quickly collect your things
and go home.

209
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,119
Where are you off to?
Back to your classrooms!

210
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,119
What are you doing?
Who let you do this?

211
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,119
There's been a blast
at the Station.

212
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,599
Everyone must be sent home.
Do you want to finish them?

213
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:30,740
<i>Nuclear specialists' city.
Morning, 26th April. 4km from the Station.</i>

214
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,959
Stop the game.

215
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,119
Go home!

216
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,119
Who am I talking to?

217
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,879
Listen to me!

218
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,159
Stop this!

219
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,119
Go home immediately.

220
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,119
Take your children indoors.

221
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,399
Shut your windows.

222
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,639
Wake up, you people!

223
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,359
It's dangerous
to stay outside.

224
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,119
Comrades!

225
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,959
Don't you know
what's happened?

226
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Nothing!

227
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,599
Who told you to spread
panic among the people?

228
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,119
Do we need instructions
in this situation?

229
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,159
In what situation?

230
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,119
Are you mad? Don't you
know what's happened?

231
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,119
Nothing has happened.

232
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,839
How dare you spoil
the festive Saturday mood?

233
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,119
We've scheduled 20 weddings
and we'll celebrate them all.

234
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,359
Bye, Grandpa, have fun.

235
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,599
All citizens are
to board the buses

236
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,599
designated for their
block of flats.

237
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,839
Please proceed
in an orderly fashion.

238
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,559
I repeat.
There is one bus per block.

239
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,559
Please maintain order
whilst boarding.

240
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,079
Yes?

241
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,079
The bridge has
the worst contamination.

242
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,079
Speed up 300 metres
before it, and don't stop.

243
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Yes.

244
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,079
Take two or three days' food,
and money and documents.

245
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,719
Is this an excursion
to the country?

246
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,079
Yes.
We'll explain on the bus.

247
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,319
Why aren't you coming out?

248
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,479
- I'm waiting for my mum.
- Where is she?

249
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,879
She's gone to the village
with the baby.

250
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,439
And where's your dad?

251
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,719
He's not back from work yet.

252
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,079
Come on now, we'll meet
your mother on the way.

253
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,079
Attention, citizens,
I repeat...

254
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,559
Take only bare essentials
for two to three days.

255
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,079
Hurry up.

256
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,079
There's a woman with a baby.
Stop. Stop!

257
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,919
Stop!
There's a woman out there!

258
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,799
Not on the bridge...
we can't!

259
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,319
Accelerate... we can't
stop on the bridge!

260
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:40,460
<i>Kiev, 105km
from the Station.</i>

261
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,919
What happened?

262
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,079
I couldn't, over the phone...

263
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,120
What?

264
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,519
That Station you wrote about
had an explosion.

265
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,799
- Who said?
- Shurik.

266
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,799
You're an idiot.
And those are stupid rumors!

267
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,319
They're not rumors. Shurik
doesn't lie. It's the end!

268
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,079
Shut up.

269
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,799
No one even knows.
Do something!

270
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,319
- Go home.
- Think of Dmitry.

271
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,079
I said, go home!

272
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,319
- Well, are you sending me?
- But you've just returned.

273
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,199
Now what?

274
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,559
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

275
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,359
- The Station.
- Yet another holiday article?

276
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,319
What's the holiday?

277
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,919
- Don't you know anything?
- No.

278
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,559
There's been an explosion
at the Power Station.

279
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,319
Some were killed.

280
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,319
A commission's been set up.

281
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,319
Zhuravlyov!

282
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,359
Who do you take me for?

283
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,559
An explosion? Deaths?

284
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,559
The Department just rang,

285
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,559
asking about
our holiday schedule.

286
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,079
An explosion!

287
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,799
Yes.

288
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,079
Yes, Yury Nikolayevich?

289
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,079
Yes.

290
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,079
Sure. Forty-seven countries...
an international cycling race.

291
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,079
Yes. We'll send a reporter.

292
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Absolutely.

293
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,319
Well?

294
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,079
What do you say, Zhuravlyov?

295
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,119
Tolya!

296
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,359
Maria, what...

297
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,599
Kolya is there.

298
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,759
- Tell Ignat...
- Quiet.

299
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,839
Don't worry.
You'll see him in Moscow.

300
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,959
Tell Ignat
to collect my pay.

301
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,119
Where's your little girl?

302
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,119
I don't know.

303
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,359
Don't just stand there.
Carry her in!

304
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,020
Bastards!

305
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,540
Bastards!

306
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,039
Unfortunately...

307
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,639
False information is being
willfully disseminated

308
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,639
about the evacuation
of children,

309
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,639
the numerous victims...

310
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,199
Comrades, our aim
is to prevent panic

311
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,199
and to curtail
any such rumors.

312
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,679
Antonov, "Gosteleradio".

313
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,639
What is the radiation level
in the city today?

314
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,199
Radioactivity is below
the acceptable level.

315
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,639
Then why are we told
to shut our windows?

316
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,399
Comrades!

317
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,399
The main lesson we've learned
from this accident

318
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,719
is that it's necessary
to fight for solidarity

319
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,639
in the struggle to destroy
nuclear weapons.

320
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,879
Kololyova, "Soviet Woman".

321
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,159
A question
for Comrade Vasilenko.

322
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,679
When will the people
return to the evacuated city?

323
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,159
We think they'll return
after the neutralization...

324
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,999
within a very short time.

325
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,159
More questions, comrades?

326
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,199
He's asking whether
the Americans' health

327
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,159
could be affected by
the Chernobyl accident.

328
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,519
In the aftermath of your
Three Mile Island accident

329
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,879
the Soviet people's health
wasn't affected, was it?

330
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,199
Dad...

331
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,639
I want a radish.

332
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,319
Here.

333
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,159
Get lost.

334
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,159
Where do you want to go?

335
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,799
Out on the boulevard.

336
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,159
- He wants to go out.
- He can't.

337
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,159
- Why not, Sasha?
- Dad...

338
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,199
- The things I heard today...
- I heard too.

339
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,159
On the "Voice of the Enemy".
They're a bit much.

340
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,879
I'll change phones.

341
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,399
Come on.

342
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,639
Sasha, put the phone down.

343
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,399
To your health.

344
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,119
Sasha, hang up.

345
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,599
Another one.

346
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,359
The boy wants to go outside.

347
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,359
Go anywhere you like.

348
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,759
Malysh...

349
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,439
Malysh, let's go!

350
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,839
It's terrible! You don't
even know what it is!

351
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,999
What can I do?
What?

352
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,119
Gel tickets, send us away.

353
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,119
Where to?
Where can I send you?

354
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,119
Why not to the land
of your ancestors?

355
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,440
<i>- Contaminated
- Evacuation centre.</i>

356
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,599
We can wash them, and play.

357
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,639
They're no good now.
Next.

358
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,159
Captain!

359
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,119
What have you got there?

360
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,359
Undress.

361
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,359
Straight ahead...
Into your buses.

362
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,759
Is there such a thing...

363
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,959
as complete safety,
under the circumstances?

364
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,599
It's possible that any
dose of radiation,

365
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,599
no matter how small
it may be,

366
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,599
may affect the further
development of the fetus.

367
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,599
However,
genetic abnormalities

368
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,159
are not likely to occur
in the first generation.

369
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,599
It's different for the second
and third generations.

370
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,359
For that reason, the departments
and ministries concerned

371
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,359
have no special instructions
about producing children.

372
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,400
Mummy.

373
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,119
How did you get in here?

374
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,359
- How did you get in?
- I'm looking for my mother.

375
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,359
You'd better get out of here.

376
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,119
An artificial termination
of pregnancy

377
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,599
is therefore a necessity.

378
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,119
But because the situation
is unprecedented,

379
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,119
the Health Department
does not wish to oppose

380
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,159
the individual choices
made by patients.

381
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,839

A further ticket office,

has been opened

Don't stand around...
What's your problem?

389
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,839
- Where's the stationmaster?
- That's me.

390
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,719
I'm a journalist.
A journalist, I tell you!

391
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,119
Then write! Write, write...

392
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,879
- It may bring order.
- Wait a minute!

393
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,119
You? A hero of the USSR?
There's your ticket office.

394
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,959
And there's one for cripples.
Get moving, comrades!

395
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,759
A doctor told me it's the end.

396
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,800
What?

397
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,959
- I was told to take iodine.
- Don't do it!

398
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,119
Never!

399
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,159
Do you mind?

400
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,160

Is your brother around?

405
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,759
He's in Moscow.
And I can't get out.

406
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,759
Neither can I.
I want to get my family out.

407
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,759
- Even telegrams don't help.
- What telegrams?

408
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,599
Tolya died.

409
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,119
What?

410
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,839
Mister...
Do you need any tickets?

411
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,599
- What?
- Tickets?

412
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,159
- Yes.
- Let's go.

413
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,479
Let go of me!

414
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,759
- Where to?
- Have you got Moscow?

415
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,799
- I've even got Rio.
- Two to Mariupol.

416
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,119
Moscow...

417
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,759
Mariupol.

418
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,119
Here you are.
But Zhdanov is safer.

419
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,839
- Don't worry, they're real.
- How much?

420
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,159
It's three tickets...

421
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,599
- 150 each.
- Is that milliliters of vodka?

422
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,640
Rubles.

423
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,399

429
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,159

What's there?

431
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,159
Mother sent us there
because of radiation.

432
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,639
<i>It is forbidden

433
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,799
Grandpa, what's going on?

434
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,319
- Where's everyone going?
- Hell knows.

435
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,399
They say it's
some kind of radiation.

436
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,639
It's deserted.

437
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,479

438
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,799
I do.

No.

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,159
She'll be dead by morning.

451

- Forgive me.

We really know how to love

Only through suffering.

- Them too.

- "<i>Oblonsky</i>'s household."

A fried cock has to peck

to make him scratch his head.

515
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,159
But really,
what's the big deal?

516
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,159
Two people died,
thirty are critical.

517
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,159
And yet millions of people
die annually on the roads.

518
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,799
And hundreds of thousands
die of starvation.

519
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,799

525
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,799
Just a drop for me.

526
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,639
- That must be Shurik.
- Who's Shurik?

527
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,199
A classmate.

- Christ is risen.
- Risen indeed.

532
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,159
Not a word to anyone.

533
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,159
Good evening.

- Hello. Christ is risen.
- Risen indeed.

536
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,639
Come with me.

537
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,479
- Not for me, thanks.
- As you wish.

538
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,159
I'll kill you if you tell...
An explosion is certain.

539
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,159
The city will suffer
worse than Hiroshima.

540
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,159
The roads are blocked.
This is the end.

541
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,159
Don't you dare tell anyone.

542
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,159
It's awful...

543
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,639
Sasha, help me.

544
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,399
It's impossible to get out.

545
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,399
At the markets they're
checking for radiation...

546
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,399
What radiation?

547
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,159
Close the door.

548
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,439
Shurik gave me such a shock.
We must leave.

549
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,879
Urgently.

550
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,399
They say we should only take
gold and stones.

551
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,639
Where from, stupid?

552
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,999
Give me the vodka.

553
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,159
I can't stand it any more!

554
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,639
This is the end.

555
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,439
Perhaps...
it's time for a toast.

556
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,399
It's Easter Sunday, after all.

557
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,399
I may be an atheist,

558
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,839
but there's still no better
reason for a party.

559
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,479
Come on, friends.

560
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,519
Who knows if we'll meet
next time?

561
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,799
- Christ is risen.
- Risen indeed.

562
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,159
Christ is risen...

563
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,399
Ludmila's told me
such good things about you.

564
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,399
She loves you very much.

565
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,399
It's a shame you and I
didn't meet earlier.

566
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,799
I never knew she had such
wonderful classmates.

567
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,639
- Christ is risen.
- Risen indeed.

568
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's drink!

569
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,159
Nature can't stand emptiness.

570
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,200
Really?

571
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,159
We'll all die in an earthquake.

572
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,159
- Why's that?
- Simple.

573
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,159
They'll pump out all the gas,
minerals and oil.

574
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,319
There'll be hollows,
and nature can't stand that.

575
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,439
So what can we do?

576
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,399
We'll die in a way
that befits educated people.

577
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,039
I suggest a course...

578
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,999
"Soviet death is the most
dignified in the world."

579
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,039
Make it a diploma course.

580
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,399
Shurik...

581
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,159
I need your opinion
as a "useful person".

582
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,799
What shall we do with those
who've made all this mess?

583
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,399
I'd shoot them all.

584
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,639
They don't do that any more.
Today it's uranium mines.

585
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,879
We've got a uranium mine
of our own right here.

586
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,639
You're wrong.

587
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,639
They should all be shot.

588
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,639
- And I should be, too.
- Why you?

589
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,639
We're all guilty.

590
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,639
Everyone's to blame
for what's happening now.

591
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,399
How did this mess start?

592
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,879
A son sells his father.

593
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,479
A mother's ready to
murder half the world

594
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,879
for the sake of her
idiotic daughter.

595
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,159
Intrigues, lies, libel...

596
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,639
Violence...

597
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,159
Sleeping with a friend's wife
is no big deal.

598
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,679
Being an idiot
is a prerequisite

599
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,479
for taking
a superior's position.

600
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,639
And the bribe takers...

601
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,639
They sit on their fat bums,

602
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,399
unable to put
two words together.

603
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,879
But their eyes say
"give me, give me..."

604
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,399
Why?
It wasn't like this before.

605
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,879
It's always been like this.
People want to live well.

606
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,159
But this is the end.
The end. That's it.

607
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,639
This can't go on.
Something must be done.

608
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,039
There's no need
to do anything.

609
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,959
It will pass.
As all things have done.

610
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,559
Oh, no.

611
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,439
That won't do.

612
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,399
I want everyone charged
at the Last Judgment!

613
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,439
Only by living through
what we've lived through

614
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,439
can we regain
our human face

615
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,799
and become normal people!

616
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,159
Tell me, Shurik, but only
between you and me...

617
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,159
Should we leave this place?

618
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,799
The city closes at midnight.

619
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,399
You're in a mouse-trap...
stuck.

620
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,440
Really?

621
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,159
I should be asking you
whether it's true or not.

622
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,159
Your newspapers printed
two lines only.

623
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,159
"Two people killed."
A line per person. Bastards!

624
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,639
Your fucking cycling race
is on the box non-stop!

625
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,839
Shurik!

626
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,439
I'm a cuckold
and you're a scoundrel.

627
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,439
Sardine oil on his trousers...

628
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,159
Look at me.

629
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,719
How do you like my horns?

630
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,159
You'd think they've
always been there.

631
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,159
I just never noticed.

632
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,159
I'll take your boy tomorrow.

633
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,159
I propose a dance.

634
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,159
The cuckolds invite
the ladies...

635
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,159
Stop being an idiot
and listen to me.

636
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,199
Tomorrow Shurik leaves
to stay with relatives.

637
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,159
He's agreed to take
me and Dmitry along.

638
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,479
Shurik!
You're a real friend.

639
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,599
Yes. A true friend.

640
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,159
Indeed, when there's trouble
you know who your friends are.

641
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,159
You've done so much
for our family...

642
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,639
Please do us
one more favour.

643
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,159
I want a pass to the zone.

644
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,639
The one with the red stripe
that says "EVERYWHERE"?

645
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,639
Okay. I'll do it.

646
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,039
Thanks.

647
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,159
The pass.

648
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,639
"I volunteered. "

649
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,799
It must be hard
to get to be first.

650
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,799
The lucky ones
can sacrifice themselves.

651
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,159
One of those lucky few
is your obedient servant.

652
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,159
I volunteered to die with
the other representatives

653
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,399
of our glorious epoch.

654
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,999
- Seriously?
- Yes!

655
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:51,500
<i>30km zone. Checkpoint.</i>

656
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,639
<i>Soviet radiation
is the best in the world</i>

657
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,760
Look!

658
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,519
Where did he come from?

659
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,199
<i>MOTHER I'M HERE.
COME BACK, I'M WAITING.</i>

660
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:30,580
<i>The zone.
Nuclear specialists' city.</i>

661
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,919
Sasha...

662
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,919
Don't you recognise me,
Sasha?

663
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,679
Tolya! You...

664
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,439
You have ninety seconds.

665
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,919
You can go faster,
but not slower.

666
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,879
I need you alive.

667
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,839
Check everything... get ready.

668
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,199
Go up to the roof quickly
without stopping.

669
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,199
This place is the worst.

670
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,199
We'll run through that area.

671
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,199
We go here...

672
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,199
Along the roof...
The distance is two metres.

673
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,239
I repeat,
you have ninety seconds.

674
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:03,199
It's all been calculated.
There's no risk involved.

675
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,919
Don't remove your masks.

676
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,839
Double-check your gear.

677
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,679
Watch the time,
and remember...

678
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,679
The whole world
is looking.

679
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,239
"The last decisive battle..."

680
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,799
Run! After me!

681
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,719
Forward!

682
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,439
Faster,
time's running out!

683
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,239
Forward!

684
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,199
Go on, measure it.
Measure away.

685
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,679
I can take it off,
but give it back to me.

686
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,679
Take it off.

687
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,199
It's squeaking!

688
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,839
Six hundred,
seven hundred...

689
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,839
- Well?
- Wait, granny.

690
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,839
Nine hundred...
one thousand.

691
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,919
One thousand two hundred...

692
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,919
One thousand two hundred!

693
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,399
That's twelve times
the acceptable level.

694
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:55,120
<i>Kiev, Autumn, 1986.
Chief Editor's office.</i>

695
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,199
Dad.
I'm going home.

696
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,199
Do you need anything?
Buttermilk?

697
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,199
All right.

698
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,999
Kiev are the champions!

699
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,199
DINAMO! DINAMO...

700
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,079
Sasha...

701
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,479
Were you there?

702
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,239
Where's our son?

703
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,879
Don't worry, I took him
to his grandfather's.

704
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,719
You brought him back here?

705
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,239
Forgive me, Sasha.

706
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,719
I can't live without you,
or grandfather.

707
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,719
He cried when he saw us.

708
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,239
I don't care what happens
as long as we're together.

709
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,719
It's Shurik.

710
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,239
Hi.

711
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,519
Hello.

712
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,239
