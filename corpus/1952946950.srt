AMANDA OPENS THE DOOR
TO THE COTTAGE WITH HER KEY

1545

OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

1549

HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM DINNER
WITH HER ENGLISH FRIENDS.

1550

BEGAN TO ARGUE.

OVER ANY NUMBER OF THINGS --

THAT MEREDITH DIDN'T APPROVE

1555

OR HYGIENE HABITS.

FOR AMANDA TO TAKE REVENGE.

THAT'S WHEN
MEREDITH'S ORDEAL BEGAN.

1558
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,761
IT IS AMANDA
WHO STARTED THE FIGHT

1559
01:14:46,795 --> 01:14:49,731
WHICH TRIGGERED AN UNSTOPPABLE
CRESCENDO OF VIOLENCE,

1560
01:14:49,765 --> 01:14:51,633
AND IT IS AMANDA

1561

INTO MEREDITH'S NECK.

1564
01:15:04,413 --> 01:15:06,648
CUT OFF HER BRA...

1565
01:15:06,682 --> 01:15:09,351
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A RAPE.

1566
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:14,189

COVERS THE BODY WITH A QUILT,

1567

FOR THE VICTIM.
