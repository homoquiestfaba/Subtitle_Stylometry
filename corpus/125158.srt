1
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
Where's the money?

2
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,270
I tell you, I need just a few more days.
Please, I can get it.

3
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,271
What are you gonna do to me?

4
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,430
Movie starts in three minutes.

5
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,431
If you don't tell us
where the money is,

6
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,318
we're gonna cut your fingers off
during the opening credits.

7
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,030
Titles. Credits come at the end
of the movies. Titles come first.

8
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,838
Fine. Titles.

9
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,431
We're gonna cut 'em off
during the fuckin' titles.

10
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,273
The shows starts
in two minutes.

11
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,591
I tell ya, I just need a couple more days.
Please, don't do it.

12
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,990
No! I'm telling you, don't do it!

13
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,634
You gotta listen to me.

14
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,631
Whatever you do, don't do it.

15
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,949
Do you hear me?

16
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,952
- The show starts in one minute.
- Don't do it.

17
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,235
- We gotta get him out of there.
- Devine hasn't given a signal.

18
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,958
We move when Devine gives the signal.

19
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,917
<i>Maybe he forgot it, Ray.
He's tied to a chair.</i>

20
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,912
<i>- That's Sal Rossi Jr down there, right?
- The dancing popcorn. Jesus Christ!</i>

21
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,558
Screw the signal. I say
we get him out of there.

22
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,073
No, wait, wait.

23
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,072
Devine hasn't given a signal

24
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,071
<i>because he wants Rossi to take a finger.</i>

25
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,594
<i>- What are you talking about?
- A finger? What if you're wrong, Ray?</i>

26
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,478
- What if he forgot the fucking signal?
- Look, don't you get it?

27
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,074
If Sal takes that finger, we get him
for assault, attempted murder.

28
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,912
- That's 20 years.
- This is crazy.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,228
<i>He doesn't want us to wait, Ray.</i>

30
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,390
He doesn't want us to wait
while some psycho takes his finger.

31
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,109
This is Devine's detail,
and he wants us to wait.

32
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,838
The dancing hot dog. Jesus Christ!

33
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,912
All right, you get some ice.

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,911
You get the finger.

35
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,071
Hello. I'm home.

36
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,392
Sasha, where are you?
I have presents.

37
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,391
Sasha?

38
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,951
Mr Devine, I tried calling you.

39
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,510
They said it was impossible to reach you.
I even tried that special number.

40
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,751
Delores, I have these presents
I wanna give to Sasha. Where is she?

41
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,072
I'm sorry, sir. Your dog is dead.
She killed herself.

42
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,155
What?

43
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,755
The Jacuzzi. She threw herself
into the Jacuzzi.

44
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,832
I tried to find you.
It was horrible.

45
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,516
Oh, no. Maybe she fell in.

46
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,878
Oh, there was a witness.
Alejandro, the gardener's son.

47
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,235
It was suicide.

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,355
Suicide?

49
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,829
She was lonely.
She couldn't stand it any more.

50
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,230
Then why the fuck didn't you
go outside and play with her?

51
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,311
Throw the little red ball with her?

52
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,790
I'm sorry, Mr Devine.
I know you loved that dog.

53
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,796
On Tuesday, she dug up all the flowers
and then took a dump in the kitchen.

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,314
I believe that was her note.

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,276
Joe, from the beautiful words
you've written,

56
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,113
it's clear to me that Sasha
wasn't just a great dog.

57
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,475
She was a great friend.

58
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,712
"Sasha was loyal, she was compassionate,
and she loved to shake. "

59
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,633
And now I'm going to ask you to bow
your head for one minute of silence.

60
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,469
Sorry to hear about Sasha.

61
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,313
I know you were close to that bitch.

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,675
So what brings you to town?
Did you hear about my finger?

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,117
Oh, yeah. I'm very proud of the work
you're doing here in Houston.

64
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,713
Then why don't you get me
the hell out of here?

65
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,394
Jack, you've been deputy director
of the Bureau for six years,

66
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,277
and I've been stuck here
for five of those years.

67
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,875
Do you know what people would say if
I handed you the Gotti detail in New York?

68
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,793
They took my fucking index finger.
They cut my fucking finger off!

69
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,996
And we appreciate that.

70
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,195
I'm your brother, Jack.

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,555
You tell 'em I can do this thing.
I'm gonna nail these motherfuckers.

72
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,438
Take it easy. Listen, I am on your side.

73
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,751
I'm on your side. We all know
you're gonna be a star, Joseph.

74
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,593
Jack, I'm never gonna
be a star in Houston.

75
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,511
I know. That's why
I'm sending you to Providence.

76
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,553
Providence?

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
<i>There's mobsters in Rhode Island?</i>

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,639
<i>What are we doing in Rhode Island?
We were better off in Houston.</i>

79
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,676
That's Tommy Sanz in there,
Gotti's cousin.

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,399
- Second cousin.
- He's still family.

81
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,357
<i>Sal Rossi Jr wasn't even Italian.</i>

82
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,749
Hey, we nail this Tommy Sanz guy,

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,196
that could be our ticket
to Philadelphia, New York,

84
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,396
maybe even Washington.

85
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,155
FBI agents believe John Gotti
planned Paul Castellano's murder

86
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,550
outside Sparks Steak House
in December, 1985,

87
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,394
and prosecutors are expected to try
to make another case against him.

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,792
But Gotti, in prison during the trial,
is tonight a free man.

89
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,599
So, Tommy, you get invited
to John's party?

90
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,591
Investigators have been
watching Gotti...

91
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,878
I really don't think John considers me
part of the family any more.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,639
It's my face, Willie.

93
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,554
The guys back home
can't stand to look at me.

94
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,270
I thought after the second surgery
things would change.

95
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,716
Did you talk to that
plastic surgeon?

96
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,193
He said he wanted to take skin
from my ass cheeks and put it on my face.

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,272
I beat that cocksucker
with his own chair.

98
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,430
I need to do something big.

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,559
Or I'll never get back to New York.

100
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,078
There's another movie shooting in town.
Horror movie.

101
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,390
One of the producers
calls Wally over at the local.

102
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,471
Seems they need a favour
from the Teamsters.

103
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,599
I said big, Willie.
Big, like this TV.

104
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,636
That's 52 inches.

105
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,838
They need ten trucks max,
25 drivers, no hassles.

106
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,592
Last time our cut was three grand.

107
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,716
Fine. Tell Wally...

108
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,916
They're talking about a bribe.

109
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,198
They're taking a bribe from those movie
people to make a deal with the union.

110
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,633
So?

111
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,836
So the Mob controls the union -
the Teamsters -

112
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,717
which means they control the trucks.

113
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,758
The trucks the movie people use.

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,990
What the hell
are you talking about?

115
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,514
I know how we're gonna get Tommy Sanz.

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,590
Agent Devine, it says here
you wanna produce a movie?

117
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,592
No, sir. Actually, there really
isn't going to be a movie.

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,832
I only want Tommy Sanz
to think I'm producing a movie.

119
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,151
We really don't give a shit.
Just tell us the play.

120
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,438
Trucks. This is how all movies
are made, sir. With trucks.

121
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,988
We're gonna offer Tommy Sanz a bribe

122
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,957
to intercede with the Teamsters
on our behalf

123
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,397
and, once he accepts,
we're gonna nail him for racketeering.

124
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,119
Well, there's an obvious
risk here, Agent Devine.

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,112
What do you know
about producing movies?

126
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,789
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you're such a star.

127
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,511
I don't hear anything, honey.

128
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,955
It's not happening. They're not
making any sound, honey.

129
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,429
No.

130
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,032
I can't take it any more, Steven.
I can't take it any more.

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,076
- I'm gonna go kill...
- The headphones.

132
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,389
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Do you understand me?

133
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,311
Shut the fuck fucking up!

134
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,198
I'm gonna fucking come down there
and fucking kill you!

135
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,793
Do you hear me, you motherfuckers?

136
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,192
I'm sick and tired of living like this.
My whole life smells like shit.

137
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,876
Yeah, I'm talking to you,
you piece of motherfucking shit!

138
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,109
We live in a kennel.
We live in a kennel.

139
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,919
Yeah, but you know who boards
their dogs down there?

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,199
Goldie Hawn, Ted Danson,
Meryl Streep, Connie Chung.

141
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,555
I've met agents down there,
studio heads.

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,518
I'm gonna kill those dogs.
I'm gonna fucking kill those dogs.

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,716
All right, if you wanna move,
we'll move,

144
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,597
but then we're both gonna
have to work full time.

145
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,433
Could you just stop it?
I'm so sick of you and your threats.

146
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,750
How many years have I had to live
with you and your threats?

147
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,479
Maybe I don't wanna be
an actress any more.

148
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,632
- You're a great actress.
- Oh, let's stop the bullshit, Steven.

149
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,871
I am not an actress.
I play the piano at the mall.

150
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,636
It's not the mall. It's Nordstrom's,
where every casting agent shops.

151
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,271
I'm 34 years old.

152
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,518
How messed up am I that I have to
stay here and live like this?

153
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,477
Make a great story, though, won't it,

154
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,870
when you're famous
and you have to talk about your life?

155
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,076
"Valerie Weston
goes from pound to gown

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,709
as she steps out of her limo
at the Chinese Theatre. "

157
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,830
I'm going to work.

158
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,676
<i>I know you're nervous, Robert. It's your
first day. But you're gonna do just great.</i>

159
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,796
You'll be working as
a floater in concessions.

160
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,111
You'll be in charge of napkins and butter.
Just remember a large is three squirts,

161
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,315
a medium two squirts...

162
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,278
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Next, please.

163
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,911
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

164
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,551
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

165
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,994
Mandy Patinkin?
Mandy... Mandy Patinkin?

166
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,038
Mandy Patinkin.
Mandy Patinkin.

167
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,955
Stop it, Arnie.

168
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,070
No, you stop telling me how great I am
and you tell me where my fuckin' script is.

169
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,879
You do not wanna
eat lunch off my ass.

170
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,636
You wanna eat lunch off my ass?

171
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,154
I thought you were kosher.

172
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,356
Arnie, I'll make you a deal.

173
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,592
You deliver that script, and lunch is on me,
you Lebanese piece of shit.

174
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,636
Love to Bernice and the baby.

175
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,312
<i>Roger!</i>

176
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,838
<i>Roger! Can you get me my back brace
and my banjo, please?</i>

177
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,833
I'm a big fan of law enforcement.

178
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,798
<i>I used to date the black guy
on Hill Street Blues.</i>

179
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,916
So you're going undercover

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,309
- as a Hollywood producer.
- Yes.

181
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,676
Are you doing features
or TV or MOWs? What?

182
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,718
- Movies.
- Movies. God, I love the movies.

183
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,749
After I was stabbed
by my personal trainer in 1981,

184
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,469
I was terrified to leave my house.

185
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,509
And then, one day,
I went to the movies!

186
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,229
Oh, God,
and I never came home.

187
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,231
The movies saved my life.

188
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,198
I'm even back with that trainer now,
which is really remarkable.

189
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,879
<i>Roger! Excuse me. I'm sorry.</i>

190
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,439
<i>Roger?</i>

191
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,194
Never hire a diabetic.

192
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,674
What exactly does a producer do?

193
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,390
- Well, where's your script?
- Script? I don't have a...

194
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,914
You don't have a script?

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,194
No.

196
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,431
<i>Roger! I'm sorry.</i>

197
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,993
<i>Camille, can you get fuckin' Roger!</i>

198
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,828
You know what? I'm sorry.
I've got a 3.30 and...

199
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
Well, can you help me find a script?

200
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,156
This is Hollywood. Just go outside and
ask anyone you see to give you a script.

201
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,277
A gardener, a cripple, a child molester.

202
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,114
They've all got 'em.
You just gotta find one.

203
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,476
<i>Roger? Do I need to give you your shot?</i>

204
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,996
My deepest condolences, sir.
Here's your ticket.

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,638
<i>The script is called Arizona.</i>

206
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,269
It's the true story of a young woman's
spiritual journey through the desert

207
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,558
as she battles cancer and searches for
the spirit caves of the Hopi Indians.

208
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,631
I... actually have a script with me.

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,393
If you had time, maybe after shivah,
you might want to...

210
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,516
So tell me about your script.

211
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
OK. It's a romantic comedy.
It's about this couple...

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,595
They find the guy, they find
the head of the organisation,

213
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,319
<i>- like, on a golf course.
- Right. Or a river.</i>

214
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,312
It's the true story of a young woman's
spiritual journey through the desert

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,915
as she battles cancer while searching for
the spirit caves of the Hopi Indians.

216
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,831
I've already got a cancer movie.

217
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,911
- What kind?
- Brain.

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,310
Brain? Brain's been done to death.
This is breast.

219
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,915
I have Meg Tilly attached,
and Meg Tilly likes brain.

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,797
The rest of the time he's got no head.

221
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,757
He's got, like, seven hours
to find a new head,

222
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,876
but he's fucked up
because he has no head.

223
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,916
It's about fallen angels.
There is a group...

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,709
They're not evil, but they were supposed to
watch over humanity to protect us.

225
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,109
So that's basically it.

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,670
It's a road picture. It's a love story.

227
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,274
It's a tear-jerker.

228
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,191
OK, but here's the kicker.

229
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,033
It's an election day.

230
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,238
And he can't vote
because he's got no head.

231
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,438
Hey.

232
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,318
The Jacuzzi.
She threw herself into the Jacuzzi.

233
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,478
Val, put the dog down.

234
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,869
I was trying to nap before my audition,

235
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,793
and I know this is the dog that barked.
You little fuck!

236
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,475
<i>Honey, you're gonna get this commercial,
I know it. You love Raisin Bran.</i>

237
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,916
I'm not going on the audition, Steven.
I'm finished.

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,798
- Put the Pomeranian down.
- I know it's gonna keep on barking.

239
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,155
- I know it's gonna keep on barking.
- No, it's not.

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,800
It's not gonna keep on barking,
because you're gonna give me the dog

241
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,952
and I'm gonna take it out of here right now.

242
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,396
It's OK. You can do it.

243
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,793
What are you?
Some kind of Good Samaritan?

244
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,711
No.

245
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,270
I'm a Hollywood producer.

246
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,073
Oh, sweetheart, it's OK.
It's all right.

247
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,754
No, honey. It's gonna be OK.

248
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,638
Movies and TV,
or just movies or...

249
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,790
Oh, honey.

250
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,234
I'm Steven... Schats.

251
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,629
Steven Sch... Oh, honey.

252
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,278
Who's Steven Schats?

253
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,033
He's done quite a bit of directing
in the Los Angeles theatre.

254
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,390
<i>He won the Goldstein Award for
Debbie Does Shabbat at Temple Judaica.</i>

255
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,471
Billy Crystal is a member
of that congregation.

256
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,551
Is Billy Crystal
going to be in the movie?

257
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,996
- No. Because there is no movie.
- Then why do you need a director?

258
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,992
I need a director in order to sell the movie
to Tommy Sanz.

259
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,433
But you said there is no movie.

260
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,479
I'm not really making a movie, sir.
I'm just producing one.

261
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,032
We... really don't give a shit.
Just tell us the play.

262
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,874
<i>The screenplay is entitled Arizona.</i>

263
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,953
It's the inspiring true story
of a dying young woman

264
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:12,037
as she travels through the desert in search
of herself and the Hopi Indian spirit caves.

265
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,950
What kind of movie is that?

266
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,079
It's a tear-jerker, sir.
She... dies in the end.

267
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,400
From dehydration?

268
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,871
Don't come down here...

269
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,269
Lonnie.

270
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,271
Steven. What are you doing here?

271
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,272
Lonnie, get dressed.
I have a meeting in one hour.

272
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,035
It's a lunch with a producer
who read my script over the weekend,

273
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,192
- and he liked it.
- Of course he did. It's brilliant.

274
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,191
He asked me if I was
bringing representation.

275
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,068
I didn't wanna look like a schmuck,
so I told him I had an agent.

276
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,869
You want me to go with you?
You know, I don't drive any more.

277
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,432
You don't have to drive. I'll drive.
Just put on some clothes. Get dressed.

278
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,717
We've got a lunch.
We've got a lunch.

279
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,235
Don't touch the mail if it comes.
Ever. Don't.

280
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,709
Lonnie. Lonnie, just go get dressed.
Go get dressed.

281
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,837
<i>Relax, Steven. It's just a lunch.
Where's the meeting?</i>

282
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,957
- Musso & Frank's.
- You're in luck.

283
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,395
I got a blow job
at Musso & Frank's.

284
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,551
No, no, no. You listen to me,
you Lebanese piece of shit.

285
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,189
I'm the producer, I'm in charge,
this is my picture. You got me?

286
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,998
OK. My love to Bernice.

287
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,038
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry we're late, Mr Diamond.

288
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,634
This is Lonnie Bosco
of Bosco and Sugarman.

289
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,312
Pleasure.

290
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,996
<i>Steven, let me just say that
I read the screenplay for Arizona...</i>

291
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,274
and I absolutely loved it.

292
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,069
My wife Sasha died recently,
so the story really hit close to home.

293
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,039
- What kind of cancer did she have?
- She drowned in a Jacuzzi.

294
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,433
The dentists from Boston that I represent,
they loved the movie as well.

295
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,078
I know, the script needs a lot of work.

296
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,958
We're prepared to make a deal
for you to direct the movie.

297
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,191
You wanna make a deal for me to...
But I'm...

298
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,599
We wanna move forward right away.

299
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,708
Do you think you could make the movie
for, say, a million dollars?

300
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,152
Steven wants final cut.

301
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,630
- No. No, Lonnie, I don't need final cut.
- Final cut. That's no problem.

302
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,508
- Casting approval?
- Yes. He's the director.

303
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,996
He wants ten per cent of...
first dollar gross points.

304
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,469
Yes. OK, ten per cent.

305
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,909
You're saying yes?

306
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,195
<i>You want me to direct Arizona?</i>

307
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,397
You really... You want me to do that?

308
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,550
I'm not saying yes.

309
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,835
I'm saying, "Hell, yes. "

310
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,631
He's saying, "Yes. Hell, yes,"
at Musso & Frank's.

311
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,239
There's only one question I have.

312
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,153
The cover of the screenplay
says it's written by Steven Schats

313
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,471
- and Marshal Paris?
- Yes. Marshal Paris. He's my brother.

314
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,152
Paris is his pen name.

315
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,710
We wrote the story about our sister.
She's the dead lady.

316
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,949
Well, before we make any deals,

317
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,918
I'm gonna wanna secure all the rights,
get some signatures.

318
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,878
Oh, well, that's impossible.
Marshal went home.

319
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,400
You'll just have to go home
one more time, Steven.

320
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,869
- No. No, no.
- Home...

321
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,158
to the Ponderosa.

322
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,230
The Ponderosa.

323
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,638
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Cartwrights.

324
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,439
Adam, Hoss, Little Joe,

325
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,671
and Ben Cartwright!

326
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,994
<i>Run for cover, folks. It seems
the Snake Eye Gang has robbed the bank.</i>

327
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,196
It's over, Snake Eyes. Drop the gold.

328
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,714
We don't want no more killing here.

329
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,349
It's got nothing to do
with your boys, Cartwright.

330
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,398
Let's just settle this. You and me.

331
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,798
The gift shop
will be open till 7 pm.

332
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,349
The bathrooms are out of order.

333
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,112
Marshal?

334
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,073
We're closing.

335
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,631
- Where's Dad?
- Ben Cartwright gets off at 2.30.

336
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,269
He's the star of the show.
What are you doing here?

337
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,557
<i>We did it, Marshal.
We're making Arizona.</i>

338
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,835
Charlotte's story will be told.

339
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,074
That's impossible. I haven't shown
anyone that script in two years.

340
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,958
Look at this. You see this?

341
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,793
It's a contract from a producer.

342
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,031
- He wants you to sign a release.
- It's not for sale.

343
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,475
We're gonna split $100,000.

344
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,154
This is real, Steven. This is my life.

345
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,194
I am a person with an identity now,

346
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,796
not some Hollywood flunky spending
his entire life waiting to have lunch.

347
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,314
I want you to sign this release.

348
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,755
I want you to understand
what this means to me,

349
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,035
that I've spent my whole life

350
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,032
waiting to yell "Action" and "Cut"
for the first time.

351
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,355
I used to believe you when you said
we'd have matching black Corvettes,

352
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,753
that one day we'd get to walk up the red
carpet and get interviewed by Mary Hart.

353
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,310
- I really thought it was true.
- It is true, all of it.

354
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,709
It's just ten years late.

355
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,792
I'm sorry, Steven. I'll never sign.

356
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,839
And you can tell Hollywood
she already had her chance.

357
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,637
I just need your signature
right here next to Marshal's.

358
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,632
Why does Steven have to sign a release,
Mr Diamond?

359
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,635
It's standard. I'm gonna sign a release,
the dentists in Virginia will sign a release.

360
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,154
Look at this guy.
He really thinks he's making a movie.

361
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,834
<i>We fucked up, Ray. There's
a big plumbing outfit here in LA.</i>

362
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,992
- Joe Diamond Plumbing.
- Shit.

363
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,991
We have to change his name.

364
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,039
I don't know what to say.
Is this really happening?

365
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,999
- This is it, Steven.
- Thank you, Mr Diamond.

366
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,436
Steven, you've got yourself
a green light.

367
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,276
<i>Looks like he made it</i>

368
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,593
<i>Looks like Steven's on the way
to a better life</i>

369
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,236
<i>Looks like he made it</i>

370
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,713
<i>Steven Schats is on the way
to a better life</i>

371
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,359
<i>Looks like he made it</i>

372
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,559
Steven, come on up.

373
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,829
OK. OK, great.

374
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,876
Well, I just wanna thank all of you
for being here.

375
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,635
And I wanna tell you that all of you
are going to be working on this movie.

376
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,516
And I wanna thank one man for that.
I wanna...

377
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,591
The man who made this all possible.

378
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,514
The man who came into my life
and gave me the gift of a green light.

379
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,717
<i>He made all my dreams come true.
He's the producer of Arizona.</i>

380
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,119
Mr Joe Diamond!

381
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,036
<i>Come on, get happy</i>

382
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,509
Yeah. Yeah, Joe Diamond.

383
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,717
<i>A whole lot of talent
is what he'll be bringin'</i>

384
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,872
<i>To make you happy</i>

385
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,155
<i>- Thank you.
- He had a dream...</i>

386
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,710
Steven, my name isn't Diamond.
It's Wells.

387
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,791
Wells? I thought it was Diamond.

388
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,519
No. Joe Wells. That's my name.

389
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,792
- But you said it was Diamond.
- No, it's Wells.

390
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,394
It's always been Wells.

391
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,994
It's a common mistake.

392
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,629
<i>He'll make you happy</i>

393
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,912
Look at them all.

394
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,072
I thought you might wanna be here
when I picked one out.

395
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,390
How do you know which one to get?

396
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,193
And... action.

397
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,474
Action.

398
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,436
Action.

399
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,637
Cut it. That's lunch, people.
Moving on.

400
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,315
Very quiet, please.

401
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,311
Director on set.

402
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,319
Something wrong?

403
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,868
I know what the first shot
is going to be.

404
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,590
A wide shot looking across
the desert floor.

405
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,990
Nothing can be seen for miles.

406
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,231
Then we slowly push in.

407
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,470
An image appears...

408
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,790
in the distance,
limping toward us.

409
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,509
Charlotte. An angel walking on water.

410
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,752
Only the water is burning sand,
and the angel is dying.

411
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,953
I've had that shot in my head
for a long time.

412
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,951
Thank you, Joe.

413
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,471
Listen, Steven, what do you think about
doing the picture in New England?

414
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,232
I don't understand.

415
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,675
<i>Do you think you could make it work in,
let's say, Rhode Island?</i>

416
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,877
The dentists and I have made a very sweet
deal with the film commission there,

417
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,235
and they're gonna roll out
the red carpet for us.

418
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,949
<i>But the movie is called Arizona.
It's always taken place in Arizona.</i>

419
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,315
There are scenes
inside the Grand Canyon.

420
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,393
Well, but the guts of the story
wouldn't have to change.

421
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,913
What about the Hopi Indians?

422
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,232
<i>Yeah, but do you realise how many Indians
wound up settling in Rhode Island?</i>

423
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,629
Take it from me.
I've been to both places

424
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,632
and the similarities would astound you.

425
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,908
Do that again.

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,911
We're calling this Operation Dramex.

427
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,753
At this time, I would like
to introduce Fanny Nash,

428
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,673
<i>the producer of the hit comedy
No Means No,</i>

429
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,718
to discuss proper
Hollywood protocol.

430
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,432
I am over 35 years old.

431
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,638
I am physically unable to bear children.

432
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,633
And I pay alimony to my ex-husband,
who is a faggot.

433
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,594
Yet I am willing to bet

434
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,231
that all of you would fuck me
over that desk right now

435
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,437
if you knew you'd be having lunch
with Harrison Ford

436
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,954
as soon as you blew your wad.

437
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,868
If you wanna carry yourself
like you're in the movie business,

438
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,193
you need to act like
the big dog - Clifford -

439
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,229
and remember that
everyone in the entire world

440
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,154
is desperate to play with
your big red balls.

441
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,997
<i>I can see clearly now,
the rain has gone</i>

442
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,280
I love you all.
I'll see you on the set.

443
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,909
<i>...obstacles in my way...</i>

444
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,310
It may have taken ten years,

445
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,834
but Papillon has jumped from the cliff,

446
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,071
and he's swimming to the shore!

447
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,991
<i>...sun-shiny day</i>

448
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,911
Break a leg, Steven.

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,473
<i>It's gonna be a bright,
bright sun-shiny day</i>

450
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,880
<i>We're expecting
a smooth flight into Rhode Island,</i>

451
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,033
so please sit back, relax
and enjoy the flight.

452
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,157
So how old was she?

453
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,912
Who?

454
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,151
Your wife, when she died.

455
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,959
If you don't wanna talk about it,
I understand.

456
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,996
Sasha was my age.

457
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,789
Was she in the business?

458
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,715
Now, why would I marry a whore?

459
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,678
A whore?

460
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,228
No, no, the business.
The movie business.

461
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,390
Oh, right, the movie business.

462
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,914
Yes, she was. Yes.

463
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,992
- What did Sasha do?
- Hair. She did hair.

464
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,470
Hair. Hair. That's great.

465
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,030
- So you met on the set?
- Yes, on the set.

466
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,031
What movie?

467
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,754
<i>Jaws.</i>

468
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,917
<i>Jaws?</i>

469
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,275
<i>Your wife did the hair on Jaws?</i>

470
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,353
- That's one of my favourite movies.
- Mine, too.

471
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,512
Did it bother her
that Quint always wore a hat?

472
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,160
Well, they had some words, yeah.

473
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,118
That is so ironic.

474
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,159
<i>She worked on Jaws,
and then she drowns in a Jacuzzi.</i>

475
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,110
I never really thought of it
that way before.

476
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,590
The rest of your family...
are they in the movie business?

477
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,514
Well, I have one brother.
He's a doctor, a surgeon.

478
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,354
He was the smart one.
You know, top of his class.

479
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,671
I was never much of a student.

480
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,718
In the sixth grade
I was struck by lightning.

481
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,028
Lightning?

482
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,398
I was standing in the playground
with a metal lunchbox.

483
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,438
Suddenly I saw this light,

484
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,717
the brightest light you can imagine.

485
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,109
The next thing I knew, I was...

486
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,072
I was inside of the light...

487
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,071
I was part of the light.

488
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,236
Fuck.

489
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,788
Feel the top of my head.

490
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,713
Go ahead.

491
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,189
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

492
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,748
You know what that is?

493
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,751
That's one in a million.

494
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,158
<i>Steven, this is Troy Haines from
the Rhode Island Film Commission.</i>

495
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,276
Hey, welcome to Providence,
Mr Schats,

496
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,191
the Arizona of the East.

497
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,952
<i>And this is
the Woonasquatucket River,</i>

498
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,032
which used to be known as the
Moshassuck Dam before the floods of '64

499
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,194
<i>and was seen over the credits of
the situation comedy Doctor, Doctor.</i>

500
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,636
<i>Joe, I have to be honest. This doesn't
resemble the Colorado River at all.</i>

501
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,917
Look at all that cement.
And there's way too many cars.

502
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,753
<i>That's a snack bar?
Tony Roma's?</i>

503
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,593
What if we were to shoot
the skinny-dipping scene at night?

504
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,717
<i>I don't know how Rick would see
Charlotte's birthmark.</i>

505
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,993
What about the ducks?

506
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,640
Don't worry about the fuckin' ducks.
I'll take care of them.

507
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,879
This is the second-largest
landfill in New England,

508
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,518
shot by director Miles O'Kief

509
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,637
<i>in the climactic scene
of his film Nora Declares War.</i>

510
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,029
Back then it was a park,

511
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,588
now it's the Grand Canyon.

512
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,589
Just picture some burros,

513
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,513
some tourists in some loud T-shirts.

514
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,355
The trucks are a sound problem.

515
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,351
I think there's too many seagulls.

516
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,955
Well, they mainly feed in the mornings.

517
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,077
No different than the buzzards of Sedona.

518
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,915
Garage 16-
the Hopi Indian spirit cave.

519
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,519
How am I supposed to get 30 Indians
in there dancing around the fire?

520
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,439
Well, we're gonna have to...
you know, force 'em in.

521
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,955
Steven...

522
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,352
Steven...

523
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,119
Joe, what are we gonna do?
Most of the locations are shit.

524
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,555
No cactus. There's no desert.

525
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,551
You have to call the dentists.

526
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,518
Maybe you could change the script
just a little.

527
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,750
Change the script? Change...

528
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,276
Joe... Joe, this script is...

529
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,636
You can't just change the...
A cactus is a cactus.

530
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,915
I have an obligation to Charlotte.

531
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,309
I don't have a cactus,
I don't have any thorns.

532
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,311
I don't have any thorns,
no torn dress.

533
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,675
No torn dress,
no birthmark on the ass.

534
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,320
<i>No birthmark, no skinny-dipping
with Rick and Charlotte</i>

535
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,391
<i>on the mighty Colorado River!</i>

536
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,118
No skinny-dipping,
no water snake.

537
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,316
No water snake,
no Chlamydia scare.

538
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,073
No Chlamydia scare,
no doctor...

539
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,592
Well, let me take care of all that.
I'm the producer, OK?

540
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,114
I don't think I can make this work here.

541
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,191
Hey, do me a favour.

542
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,953
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.

543
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,758
Come on.

544
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,395
Mr Schats, welcome
to the Providence Biltmore.

545
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,278
This is your key
to the Eisenhower Suite.

546
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,830
This is your suite.

547
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,514
Welcome, sir.

548
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,111
Maybe it doesn't have to be cactus.

549
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,190
- Tommy, where you goin'?
- Wally's. They're havin' a meetin'.

550
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,158
- With who?
- Hollywood.

551
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,832
Mr Kamin, Steven here

552
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,515
is one of the most sought-after
commercial directors in Hollywood.

553
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,717
Last year he was nominated for
a Clio Award over in East Germany.

554
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,917
The commercial was for a new work boot
called the Verspatten.

555
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,993
I can assure you, the Teamsters
will support your project 100 per cent.

556
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,437
See, Mr Kamin, that's the thing. We were
hoping to do this picture non-union.

557
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,796
You know. No Teamsters, no minimums.

558
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,348
That gonna be a problem?

559
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,319
Let me make this as clear
as I possibly can.

560
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,791
There is no way you are going
to produce a film in my town

561
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,193
without a full load of union trucks
and union drivers surrounding your set.

562
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,398
You try and make a movie here
without our trucks,

563
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,439
and I'll shut you motherfuckers down
before lunch.

564
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,636
Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

565
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,752
I hear you're having trouble
with the Teamsters.

566
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,070
I know somebody that can help.

567
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,352
Look at this.

568
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,069
They say American football
don't compare to rugby.

569
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,991
Last night, a player was kicked out

570
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,039
for shoving his index finger up another
guy's ass at the bottom of the pile.

571
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,275
Tommy, this is Joe Wells,
movie producer.

572
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,672
- It's a pleasure, Mister...
- You know what I hate, Mr Wells?

573
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,479
Poor sportsmanship.

574
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,389
I see you're lookin' at my face.

575
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,396
My wife set me on fire
while I was sleepin'.

576
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,635
She doused me with lighter fluid
and lit a match.

577
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,630
Six months later,
our marriage fell apart.

578
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,435
She's very beautiful.

579
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,595
Thank you.

580
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,517
I'd promised her Manhattan,
Las Vegas, Chicago.

581
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,114
But it wasn't happening for me.

582
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,556
Thanks to her,
the company sends me to Providence.

583
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,235
Tommy, he brought the money.

584
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,710
- All of it?
- Eight thousand.

585
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,836
We'd like you to take care
of this thing, Mr Sanz.

586
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,515
- We don't want any trouble with the union.
- It's done.

587
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,431
Congratulations.

588
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,796
You just made a deal
with the Teamsters.

589
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,189
That's it. Sanz took the bribe.

590
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,474
Let's move.

591
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,471
Wait, wait.

592
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,199
Devine hasn't given a signal.

593
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,030
Let me ask you something, Mr Wells.

594
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,908
How hard is it to get into
the movie business?

595
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,756
Hi, Steven.

596
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,439
Val. What are you doing here?

597
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,398
- Why are you limping?
- Charlotte was bitten by a water snake.

598
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,519
I jammed a fork into my thigh
to create a sense memory.

599
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,916
Oh, Steven, Steven...

600
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,275
Tell me I'm gonna play Charlotte.

601
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,919
Tell me I have the part.

602
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,991
Tell me it was all worth it.

603
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,753
Well... It's...

604
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,831
That's complicated.

605
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,876
I do have casting approval, though.

606
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,594
We heard the tape.
He took the bribe.

607
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,796
That's racketeering,
conspiracy to manipulate the union.

608
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,237
Abe, you saw how easy this one was.
We can go after bigger fish now.

609
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,073
Joe, it took three dogs
to find your finger in Houston.

610
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,070
You know what you're gonna lose,

611
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,549
<i>you start messing with the bigger fish
in Rhode Island?</i>

612
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,550
It's over.

613
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,029
Abe, just give me one more week
here in Providence.

614
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,872
- No.
- Let me just cast the movie.

615
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,871
That's all I'm asking.

616
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,029
Yeah. Cast the movie.

617
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,235
You said there was no movie.

618
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,834
Tommy Sanz is already on the line.
We can always reel him in.

619
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,232
- Let's see who else we can hook.
- Cast the movie?

620
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,118
You mean really cast it
or pretend to cast it?

621
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,558
Steven, this is Monica Montebello.

622
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,633
<i>She'll be reading the role of
Charlotte's oncologist, Dr Gayle Reeves.</i>

623
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,358
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello.

624
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,190
- Thank you.
- I need a moment, please.

625
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,633
Should I get the stethoscope?

626
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,757
You think she should audition
with the stethoscope?

627
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,314
Look at the shot I'm getting.

628
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,356
What are you doing?
You're shooting her tits.

629
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,510
What choice do I have?

630
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,037
You think it would be OK if I asked Joe
if I could shoot the movie?

631
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,432
- What are you talking about?
- I wanna be the cinematographer.

632
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,515
Steven. Steven.
Emily French is here.

633
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,592
She just drove up in a limo.
She wants to read for Charlotte.

634
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,752
Emily French?
She's been nominated.

635
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,559
She must think this is a big movie.

636
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,358
Maybe it is a big movie.

637
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,479
Emily French.
Oh, she's fantastic. She was nominated.

638
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,438
Oh, what's the name
of that movie she was in?

639
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,318
- She's a blackjack dealer.
- I don't think I saw it.

640
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,834
- I didn't see it, either.
- No, you saw it.

641
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,196
<i>Eric Roberts does her on the pool table.
She's got silver-dollar nipples.</i>

642
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,397
Oh, yeah. I saw that on Cinemax.
Oh, man, she's good.

643
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,711
- I remember that one.
- Yeah. What was the name of that thing?

644
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,950
Emily. Emily French.

645
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,190
- Hi, I'm...
- Don't look at me.

646
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,840
I just had a facial
and my skin looks disgusting.

647
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,672
No, it looks great.

648
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,273
<i>- Really great.
- Really great.</i>

649
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,079
I'm sorry I just turned up like this,
but I got hold of the script

650
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,119
and decided to fight the good fight
for this one.

651
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,670
Do you mind if I do the suicide scene?

652
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,671
OK.

653
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,316
I might use this chair

654
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,479
as my spirit cave.

655
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,792
It's really good, actually.

656
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,440
- Could you get me a water?
- Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

657
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,876
- And would you mind getting the lights?
- Yes, ma'am.

658
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,999
Women in Hollywood,
they are beautiful.

659
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,878
You should see the women in the navy.

660
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,191
- The navy?
- They're nice.

661
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,715
Would you switch, actually?

662
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,433
Yeah.

663
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,154
I can't even write my own name.

664
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,913
I guess this means it's almost over.

665
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,394
I can't... keep my hand on the page.

666
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,228
Where were you when I needed you?

667
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,594
<i>Do you know</i>

668
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,955
<i>Where you're going to?</i>

669
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:16,070
<i>Do you like the things
that life is showing you?</i>

670
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,430
In a moment I'm gonna die.

671
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,316
I wish I could live to see that.

672
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,511
She's a very good actress.

673
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,559
After my nomination, I just... freaked out.

674
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,279
Turned everything down that they sent.

675
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,636
Then I had a late-term abortion,
went into deep depression,

676
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,870
got really into coke,
moved to Florida for a year

677
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,520
and made a bunch of B-movies
for my Euro trash boyfriend,

678
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,434
who wrote and directed and made sure
I got my tits out in every other scene.

679
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,034
The truth is,
I was blackballed in Hollywood

680
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,793
because the great Jed Walker
claimed that the baby was his,

681
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,155
that I had murdered his baby
in the fifth month,

682
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,198
which, if you had seen it,
it clearly was not.

683
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,910
But Hollywood wasn't calling,

684
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,912
so my assistant and I checked ourselves
into rehab in New Mexico

685
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,037
and... started working with clay,

686
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,588
building miniature adobe structures.

687
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,036
Yeah, I've still got a condo there,
but I've decided to start acting again,

688
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,749
and that's why I was in New York
doing that horrible little play in the buff.

689
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,068
<i>Steven, when my African-American agent
sent me a copy of Arizona...</i>

690
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,910
I cried all night...

691
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,073
because I was born to play Charlotte.

692
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,951
I tried to kill myself...

693
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,271
twice.

694
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,390
Once in the bathtub and...

695
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,551
once in Switzerland.

696
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,438
Miss French,

697
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,594
we're prepared to offer you the role
of Charlotte right here and now.

698
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,319
- Wait. But Valerie...
- Could I have your autograph?

699
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,039
Joe, I have casting approval.
It's in my contract.

700
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,394
What the fuck is your name?

701
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,119
Steven, we have a chance to do something
right now that could change our lives.

702
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,034
For the first time, I've seen the movie
in my mind, I feel it in my gut.

703
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,839
As your producer,
I'm asking you not to mess this up.

704
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,151
There you go. Why don't you
go and ruin somebody else's dinner?

705
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,195
- OK.
- OK.

706
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,236
- We have a limited budget.
- Are you kidding?

707
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,672
I don't need the money.
I'll be your slave.

708
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,478
I'll wash your shorts.

709
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,154
I'll clip your toenails.
Give me that glass.

710
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,676
I have not failed a drug test
in six months.

711
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,671
Thank you.

712
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,794
Ahem. Miss French, what are you doing?

713
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,030
Peeing in a cup.

714
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,958
There you go.

715
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,873
I'll pee in a cup every day.
Twice a day.

716
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,511
The fucking insurance people can have
all the hot, steaming piss they want.

717
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,830
So, tell me about yourselves.

718
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,028
I want to go into business with you, Joe,
start producing movies all over the country.

719
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,398
I got contacts - Philadelphia,
Jersey, Chicago, New York.

720
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,994
I middle the deals with the Teamsters,
you produce the movies.

721
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,071
I'm talking about a 50-50 partnership.

722
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,754
These are movies we're talking about here.
There is risk.

723
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,070
You can't put guns to people's heads
and make 'em go to the movies.

724
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,789
If you say so. Anyway, that's why
it's your job to make good movies.

725
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,519
- Do you think you could do that?
- Yeah. I'm a producer. That's what I do.

726
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,999
Good, cos this is what I will do.

727
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,509
<i>Are you insane? It's in Variety, Joe.
There's an article in Variety.</i>

728
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,070
That was planted by Emily French's
publicist, and it's exactly what we needed.

729
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,958
We can't have articles
about famous actresses

730
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,270
starring in our undercover operation.

731
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,238
We're not even supposed to tell
our wives about these things.

732
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,311
Sanz is a partner,
which means they're all partners.

733
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,517
I'm telling you,
we've gotta make this movie now.

734
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,273
<i>I can produce Arizona for $1 million,</i>

735
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,193
sell off the foreign and video rights
for twice that much,

736
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,193
presell network and cable
because of Emily French.

737
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,078
And if this movie turns out
the way that I know it will,

738
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,675
I believe we can get
an American distribution deal,

739
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,637
which could mean millions more.

740
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,995
You guys have got to trust me.

741
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,399
Two years from now,

742
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,199
<i>the heads of the Rhode Island family
will be in federal prison</i>

743
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,353
watching the movie
that put them away on HBO.

744
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,679
Abe, you'd better read the script.

745
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,991
- Don't hurt him! He's my baby!
- Val, put the dog down.

746
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,752
What do you think, Steven?
You can just send me away?

747
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,071
You can just send me back to the Valley?
No, no. Charlotte was mine.

748
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,312
- Val, it's Emily French.
- I was supposed to be Charlotte.

749
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,833
She's had breast-reduction surgery.

750
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,229
She understands
the mind-set of mastectomy.

751
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,039
I'm going home, Steven, to do porno.

752
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,509
I'm going home to the Valley.

753
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,430
Please...

754
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,954
I'm gonna go home, Steven.
That's right. I'm serious.

755
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,759
Because of you, I'm gonna
get gangbanged, Steven.

756
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,115
Gangbanged in Woodland Hills.

757
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,919
A lot of great actresses
started out in porn.

758
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,118
I'm gonna break this dog's neck.

759
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,189
Don't.

760
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,909
<i>Listen, what if you played
Dr Gayle Reeves?</i>

761
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,749
The oncologist?

762
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,398
I can't believe it.
I'm the richest man in town.

763
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,357
You know why?
Because I have friends.

764
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,510
- Let's make a movie.
- Let's do it.

765
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,397
Yeah!

766
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,799
"The following screenplay

767
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,269
is the property
of the United States Government. "

768
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,032
"Fade in - Arizona - day. "

769
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,270
"A wide shot across the desert floor. "

770
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,318
"Charlotte is an angel
walking across the water. "

771
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,520
I'm leaning toward this one
with the white nose.

772
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,511
Looks like he might be named Thunder.

773
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,477
His name's Frosty.

774
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,869
What if we called him Thunder?
That's his name in the script.

775
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,359
Would he still trot for us?

776
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,591
He's a donkey. He trots
when you hit him with a stick.

777
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,478
Jesus! Look at the cock
on this one, Steven.

778
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,155
I want riding lessons immediately.

779
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,798
<i>We're in The Hollywood Reporter.
Look at this.</i>

780
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,632
Both our names are mentioned.

781
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,599
Steven, you just got
a telegram from Pat Morita.

782
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,270
<i>He's read half the script, and he thinks
he wants to play the part of Rick.</i>

783
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,715
I'm calling his agents.

784
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,872
<i>This is perfect. I've always pictured Rick
as a middle-aged Asian.</i>

785
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,949
If we get Morita,

786
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,077
we can have anybody we want for
Old Man Larreby and Chief Black Bear.

787
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,596
Joe, I want soaring music
over the reptile house montage.

788
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,830
<i>I think we should go after
Randy Newman to do the score.</i>

789
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,673
<i>Who's Randy Newman?</i>

790
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,354
<i>He wrote the score to The Natural.
Randy Newman.</i>

791
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,432
"I Love LA"? "Short People"?

792
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,713
<i>Short people got</i>

793
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,358
<i>No reason</i>

794
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,032
<i>Short people got</i>

795
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,553
<i>No reason</i>

796
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,112
<i>- Short people got
- No reason to live</i>

797
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,634
<i>- They got little hands
- Hands</i>

798
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,948
<i>Little feet</i>

799
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,600
<i>They drive little cars
that go beep, beep, beep</i>

800
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,434
<i>Well, I don't want no short people</i>

801
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,032
<i>Don't want no short people round here...</i>

802
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,032
What the fuck's wrong with Joe?

803
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,154
Abe, why don't we start
with our general comments?

804
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,994
"While we love the emotional journey
that Charlotte takes in this script,

805
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,277
we feel there are things that could
make this story more accessible

806
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,237
to a general audience. "

807
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,791
"Number one:
A high-speed motorcycle chase. "

808
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,236
I really think we need
to discuss the burro first.

809
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,311
<i>Right.</i>

810
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,595
The burro is a big problem
in Washington.

811
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,796
Well, I've already booked the burro.

812
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,395
As we read it, Charlotte frees the old burro
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

813
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,710
Yeah, she knows she's dying,
so she frees the burro.

814
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,951
If she liberates the burro back into the wild,
he's gonna die.

815
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,191
Guys, Steven loves the burro.

816
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,035
Joe, we suggest she free some other
type of animal. Maybe a large bird.

817
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,673
She could come across an injured bird
on the side of the road.

818
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,193
Maybe an eagle.

819
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,157
She could mend its wing
and then set it free.

820
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,959
The American bald eagle's
an emotional symbol in this country,

821
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,632
and they're endangered.

822
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,472
She's on foot,

823
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,155
so why is she walking around
carrying a large eagle?

824
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,070
If she had a motorcycle,
she wouldn't be on foot.

825
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,753
I heard you're cutting the burro scene.

826
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,559
- Why wasn't I called?
- We didn't think it would matter to you.

827
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,757
You didn't think it would matter to me.
They didn't think it would matter to me.

828
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,353
You didn't think it would matter to me.

829
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,159
I'm the executive producer
of this film.

830
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,959
I have business cards printed.
It fuckin' matters!

831
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,508
Tommy, the dentists in Boston

832
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,239
believe that the old burro
would die in the wild.

833
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,436
That old burro's gonna die anyway.

834
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,035
It's tired and sickly.

835
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,955
You tell the dentists that Charlotte
is giving it some fuckin' dignity.

836
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,718
We're leaning toward
another animal now.

837
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,869
Like a horse?

838
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,719
Eagle.

839
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,311
Yeah. That'll work.

840
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,198
She's gonna ride an eagle
down to the floor of the Grand Canyon.

841
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,589
Is this a fuckin' Disney movie?

842
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,875
No, no, no. She's gonna find it
by the side of the road.

843
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,791
It's gonna have a broken wing.

844
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,154
Who the fuck broke it?

845
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,559
Production. Can you hold, please?

846
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,029
Production.
No, Mr Schats is in a meeting.

847
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,678
All right. I'll transfer you.

848
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,830
Production.
No, Mr Schats is in Wardrobe.

849
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,751
He can't come to the phone.

850
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,918
Ta-da! Look at this.

851
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,389
That's it, Emily.
That's the suicide dress.

852
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,472
This will be the last image of Charlotte
as she jumps from the mouth of the cave.

853
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,755
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you guys about that.

854
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,068
About what?

855
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,549
The end of the picture,
the dreaded third act.

856
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,438
I know what you're gonna say.
We don't need the cremation montage.

857
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,239
- It's redundant.
- No, I'm talking about Charlotte's death.

858
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,278
It seems so bloody pointless
to just kill her off like that.

859
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,397
What if she lived?

860
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,515
Lived?

861
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,113
Lived? Oh, no, that's impossible.

862
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,431
This movie is a runaway train
heading towards Charlotte's death.

863
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,239
I've always felt that dying
inspired her to live,

864
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,869
which is why she tries sushi
for the first time in Flagstaff.

865
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,632
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

866
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,312
OK, yeah, I get it.

867
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,676
Yeah, it was just a thought.
I won't bring it up again.

868
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,154
I am so starving.

869
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,959
Anybody want to get a pizza?

870
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,710
Hey. You coming downstairs?
Emily's waiting at the bar.

871
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,478
I stole all the little shampoos.

872
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,597
Little conditioner, little soaps.
Even the shower cap.

873
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,559
I stole them from the hotel,
put them inside my suitcase.

874
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,359
What are you talking about?

875
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,557
Two years ago, I rented a chicken suit.

876
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,272
I stood outside the William Morris Agency
and tried to hand out copies of my script.

877
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,113
They sent two boys from the mailroom
to beat me up.

878
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,998
Well, hey. All that's behind you now.

879
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,435
What if you're wrong?

880
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,796
What if I've waited all this time,
and I can't do it?

881
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,516
Have you ever seen a man die?

882
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,079
I'm not sure I understand the question.

883
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,233
No, have you actually seen a person die,
watched them bleed to death,

884
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,189
seen them take their last breath?
I've seen that... many times.

885
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,877
Why have you seen that?

886
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,838
I used to produce music videos.

887
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,353
And when people are close to death,

888
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,715
when they're lying on the floor
staring up at those lights,

889
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,633
they all have the same
expressions on their faces.

890
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:48,511
No matter who they are, people are
basically afraid of the unknown.

891
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,875
But you don't have to be afraid.

892
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,157
You can put the shampoo bottles
and the soaps back in the bathroom,

893
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,038
because you're gonna make
a great movie.

894
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,111
We're gonna make
a great movie.

895
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,794
Yeah.

896
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,518
Yeah.

897
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,477
Hey, Joe?

898
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,154
I put a little start-up gift in your room.

899
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,152
Just something to say thank you.

900
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,232
- I didn't get you anything.
- Didn't get me anything?

901
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,629
You got me to Providence.

902
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,590
Get some rest.

903
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,000
Joe, the Federal Bureau of Investigation

904
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,789
is prepared to offer you
a three-picture deal.

905
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,233
You are kidding me.

906
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,232
We'd like to start production on movies
in Philadelphia, New Jersey

907
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,038
and New York City.

908
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,509
Any questions?

909
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,989
I want merchandising.

910
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,519
- What's merchandising?
- Toys.

911
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,989
Go fuck yourself.

912
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,555
Here is the key
to the city of Providence.

913
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,551
Arizona of the East.

914
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,313
The good people of Providence
have one thing to say:

915
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,391
"Break a leg. "

916
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,117
Hello, everybody.
I'm Steven Schats, director.

917
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,634
This is Joe Wells, our producer.

918
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,553
I'd like to just welcome everybody
to the cast and crew read-through,

919
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,074
<i>the first one of Arizona.</i>

920
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,156
We start shooting in three days,
and before we begin,

921
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,915
I'd like to go around the table
and have everyone introduce yourself.

922
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,959
<i>Oh... Pat Morita, playing Rick.</i>

923
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,630
Hey, what about this? Do we want to
see the cancer leave her body?

924
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,757
That could work. That could work.

925
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,549
That could work.
How would we do that?

926
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,478
Emily French, Charlotte.

927
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,718
Clarence Smith, cinematographer.

928
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,517
What if he said,
"Put you in remission"?

929
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,835
I like it.

930
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,878
<i>Russell Means, Chief Black Bear.</i>

931
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,353
It's actually not Chief Black Bear
any more. That didn't clear.

932
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,317
You're gonna have to be called
Chief Black Hawk.

933
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,073
Oh, shit.
Hope I can handle that.

934
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,359
<i>Valerie Weston -
Dr Gayle Reeves, oncologist.</i>

935
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,070
Lonnie?

936
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,549
This is my agent, Lonnie.

937
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,514
I guess the trip
must have tired him out.

938
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,555
Lonnie.

939
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,109
Lonnie!

940
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,957
I'll be dedicating this film to my late agent
and dear friend, Lonnie Bosco.

941
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,678
I wrote a short poem for Lonnie

942
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,469
entitled "Your Arm's Too Short
to Box with Moses".

943
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,638
Mr Wells.

944
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,511
I've got some good news.

945
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,229
There's someone flying in from New York
tomorrow for the first day of shootin'.

946
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,709
Someone very important to me.

947
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,351
This person is head of my family, Joe,
and he wants to get into the business.

948
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,271
He's talking about John Gotti.

949
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,032
I want everyone to stay on their toes.

950
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,157
- Gotti's coming to Providence.
- Make a good impression.

951
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,276
OK, Joe?

952
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,998
So don't fuck it up.

953
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,678
<i>No, you got to</i>

954
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,638
<i>Pick 'em up just to say hello</i>

955
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,315
<i>Well, I don't want
no short people now</i>

956
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,677
<i>Remission?
You put her in remission?</i>

957
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,070
Marshal.

958
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,392
You thought you could just take it,
didn't you? You thought I'd never find out.

959
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,754
Is that your gun from the show?

960
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,310
Even prop guns fired at close range
can damage an eardrum.

961
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,913
You wanna be deaf?

962
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,596
- What do you want, Marshal?
- I want what you promised me!

963
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,910
I want to walk up the red carpet.

964
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,150
I want my name on a poster.

965
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,755
I wanna be invited back to my high school
to speak at career day.

966
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,031
You want a drink?

967
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,872
Come on, Marshal.

968
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,148
Why did Dad have to
look like Lorne Greene?

969
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,390
Why did he have to be the star?

970
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,951
Take it easy, Marshal.
He means well.

971
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,589
He shoots me three times a day
in the centre of town.

972
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,069
My own father guns me down
like an animal.

973
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,993
Well, then walk away.
Marshal, you're a great writer.

974
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,594
Bullshit. I'm a fake.

975
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,354
And so are you.

976
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,557
And I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

977
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,430
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Charlotte.

978
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,272
Marshal, I'm warning you.

979
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,828
I'm warning you.
We have a sister named Charlotte.

980
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,956
We have a sister. Say it.

981
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,271
- We have a sister named Charlotte.
- No.

982
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,873
- Say it.
- We made it all up.

983
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,350
We never had a sister, Steven.
There is no Charlotte.

984
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,797
<i>We took the name from Charlotte's Web,
Mom's favourite book.</i>

985
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,108
We had a sister.

986
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,794
- We had a sister, you son of a...
- We did not have a fucking...

987
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,995
...bitch.
... sister.

988
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,548
- We did.
- We didn't have a fuckin' sister.

989
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,916
She ate peyote with the Hopi Indians.

990
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,312
My entire crew is planning on wearing
black armbands in memory of her.

991
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,154
Why couldn't you just throw the script away
like everyone else?

992
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,708
This is my big chance, Marshal.

993
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,519
If Wells finds out about...
If the dentists find out the truth...

994
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,830
If you ruin this for me,
I swear to God...

995
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,232
You can't win, Steven.
They will crucify you.

996
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,393
The Providence Cancer Society
had a dinner honouring me tonight.

997
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,438
They flew in Fred Willard to emcee.

998
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,318
They had a scholarship
named after her for summer camp.

999
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,472
Don't you get it?
They love Charlotte.

1000
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,269
They need her.
The fact that we made it up...

1001
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,793
it means nothing.

1002
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,030
You'll never get away with it, Steven.

1003
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,475
You can't fool Hollywood.

1004
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,154
They can smell a fake a mile away.

1005
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,870
I'm not a fake.

1006
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,039
I'm a director.

1007
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,595
One in a million, huh?

1008
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,591
One in a million.

1009
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,028
<i>The director is on set.
Repeat: The director is on set.</i>

1010
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,036
Half-hour, Miss French.

1011
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,073
Anyone bring film?

1012
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,594
Very quiet, please.
Director on set.

1013
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,360
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

1014
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:48,592
Well, that's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

1015
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,551
I'm gonna ask Joe
to work on his next movie.

1016
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,119
Props.

1017
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,509
I'm not carrying anybody's chairs.

1018
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,674
Who cares what we do as long as
we get the fuck out of this van?

1019
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,273
The lion has landed.
The circus has come to town.

1020
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,956
He passed checkpoint Bravo.

1021
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,793
All right, ten minutes to showtime.

1022
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,038
Ten-minute warning, people!
We've got ten minutes!

1023
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,680
The tarantula should break for lunch.

1024
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,755
Hello, Joe.

1025
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,274
- Jack.
- We need to talk.

1026
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,915
We should not be doing this,
Mrs Traviano.

1027
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,958
- Tommy, we're late.
- I just wanna see this part.

1028
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,837
As your lawyer, I want to advise you...

1029
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,833
You're not my lawyer, Mr Vaughn.
You're a paralegal.

1030
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,593
This Emily French...

1031
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,671
she's a revelation.

1032
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,830
- FBI!
- Stop right there.

1033
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,911
Get down on your knees.
Get down. Get down.

1034
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,831
To the ground!
To the ground right now!

1035
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,115
Hands behind your back.

1036
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,229
So what are you doing here?
Gotti's gonna be here any minute.

1037
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,754
I've got some very good news for you.

1038
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,470
<i>We arrested Gotti this morning
at the Ravenite Club in New Jersey.</i>

1039
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,711
- I don't understand.
- We had a bug up his ass.

1040
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,995
Got him on tape talking
about the Castellano hit.

1041
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,638
He's gonna be goin' away
for a very long time.

1042
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,915
No, no, no, no, no. You're wrong.

1043
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,310
Gotti's in Providence.
He's coming here.

1044
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,631
The man who is coming here
today is Victor Sanz.

1045
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,473
He's Tommy Sanz's 87-year-old father.

1046
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,790
We arrested Sanz a few minutes ago
at his house.

1047
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,555
If the play is in New Jersey, then why are
there five cover teams here in Providence?

1048
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,269
Because I've been using
Operation Dramex as a decoy.

1049
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,795
Decoy?

1050
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,031
Nobody knew, Joseph.
Not even the other agents.

1051
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,311
Joseph.

1052
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,198
Joseph, don't be mad about this.

1053
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,068
I was trying to nail John Gotti.
You helped me do that.

1054
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,714
What about the movie?

1055
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,110
We're the FBI. We don't make movies.

1056
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,997
I want you to go down there
and I want you to shut it down.

1057
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,514
We're about to shoot the first scene.
We're gonna get the very first shot.

1058
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,555
<i>Right now.</i>

1059
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,200
Shut it down and get these freaks
on the next plane back to LA.

1060
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,032
Jack, we can make movies
all over the country

1061
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,712
and then we can nail
the rest of these bosses.

1062
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,870
- Shut it down right now!
- I can't do that.

1063
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,839
I'm tellin' you,
shut it down or I'll do it myself.

1064
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,877
You're fuckin' yourself.

1065
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,951
- This is Jack Devine.
- We're not gonna pull the plug just yet.

1066
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,315
- Listen to me. Just listen to me.
- What are you doing?

1067
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,197
We're gonna get the first shot,

1068
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,874
- and it's gonna be a beautiful shot...
- Put that gun away!

1069
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,279
Put that gun down!

1070
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,271
Wide angle across the desert floor.

1071
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,237
Nothing can be seen for miles.
We pan left.

1072
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,108
Suddenly an image appears,
a mirage limping toward us in the distance.

1073
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,430
Charlotte is an angel
walking across the water,

1074
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,909
except the water is sand
and the angel is dying.

1075
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,797
- She's dying?
- Yes.

1076
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,189
- She's limping across?
- It's Charlotte!

1077
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,437
She's walking...
The angel's dying...

1078
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,479
Oh, Joseph, you've always wanted this
so bad, haven't you?

1079
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,313
You want it so bad,
and now you just fucked it all up.

1080
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,073
Stop it. Put the gun down.

1081
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,115
Put it down.

1082
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,475
Steven is gonna make a beautiful film.
We can do this...

1083
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,597
I don't give a fuck
about Steven and his movie.

1084
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,989
I'm shutting this down.

1085
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,717
Miss French is coming
out of Make-up right now.

1086
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,076
<i>- Roll it.
- Quiet, people. We're rolling.</i>

1087
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,151
<i>Arizona, scene one, take one.</i>

1088
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,830
<i>Arizona, scene one, take one.</i>

1089
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,193
And... action.

1090
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,788
It's over, Snake Eyes.
Drop the gold.

1091
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,509
We don't need no more killin' here.

1092
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,639
This got nothin' to do with your boys,
Cartwright.

1093
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,071
Let's just finish this. You and me.

1094
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,077
What are you doing? Marshal!

1095
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,071
You're dead!

1096
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,230
Marshal.

1097
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,434
Marshal.

1098
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,750
This is Director Devine.

1099
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,991
This is Director Devine.
Shut it down. Shut it down.

1100
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,835
Cut it!

1101
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,277
Cut. That was great, Emily.
We'll go again. Great. Great job.

1102
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,158
- That's great.
- Going again.

1103
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,596
Oh, my God!
Steven, what the fuck?

1104
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,995
Joe!

1105
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,559
Oh, my God!

1106
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,756
It's the fucking paparazzi!

1107
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,514
You people have got to learn to
leave me alone! I'm just a normal person!

1108
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,473
Joe, what's happening?
Who are they?

1109
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,160
- Dentists.
- What?

1110
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,793
Joe!

1111
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,714
Joe, don't leave. Tell them it's OK.

1112
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,439
Tell them. You're a producer.

1113
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,712
<i>The star, producer
and director of Leaving Arizona</i>

1114
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,189
has just pulled to the front of the theatre.

1115
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,909
It's an amazing directorial debut
from a tremendous talent

1116
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,151
who was the toast of Sundance this year.

1117
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,277
- Emily!
- Here she is. Emily French.

1118
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,393
<i>Leaving Arizona is the story
of the making of another movie, Arizona,</i>

1119
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,598
which was, in fact,
an elaborate FBI sting operation.

1120
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,796
So, Emily, how does it feel?

1121
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,189
Oh, you know, this film
was such a labour of love for me,

1122
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,430
and it was a very difficult journey
that I took -

1123
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,671
a journey that almost got me killed
by FBI agents and gangsters.

1124
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:45,197
But I knew as soon as I read this script
that it would make a fantastic film.

1125
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,032
Good night!

1126
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,631
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

1127
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,352
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

1128
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,070
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1129
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,549
- Good night, Mr Schats.
- Good night, Dustin. Take care.

1130
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,039
All right.

1131
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,630
Hello, Steven.

1132
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,591
My wife didn't drown in a Jacuzzi.

1133
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,830
Sasha was my dog's name,

1134
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,434
and she killed herself
because I was never home.

1135
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,795
My real name is Joe Devine.

1136
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,156
Yeah, I know who you are.
I saw the movie.

1137
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,596
And, by the way, I thought
Tom Berenger captured you beautifully.

1138
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,116
They made my character afraid of heights.
I could never quite understand that.

1139
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,159
Yeah, well, here's something
I don't understand, Agent Devine.

1140
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,515
Why me?
Why'd it have to be me?

1141
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,749
I'm sorry.

1142
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:13,152
Millions of people, and the United States
government takes down Steven Schats.

1143
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,834
Well, why?
I'd like to know why.

1144
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,473
Because you had no choice
but to believe me.

1145
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,671
Go to hell, Joe.

1146
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,439
I'd like to try to pay you back
some of that money.

1147
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,478
- Please, stop lying to me.
- Well, hey, wait a minute.

1148
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,915
What about your lies?
What about Charlotte?

1149
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,355
Yeah, that's right.
Charlotte was a lie.

1150
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,908
And I'm no director,
and you're not a producer.

1151
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,389
But we almost pulled it off, didn't we?

1152
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,234
We almost made it happen.
We almost had it all.

1153
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,470
That stuff only happens in the movies.

1154
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,797
Yeah, I know that.

1155
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,993
Do you mind? I'm trying to close up.

1156
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,471
I got something for you.

1157
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,278
I spent my last day as an FBI agent

1158
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,239
stealing this from the evidence room
in Washington.

1159
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,550
It's yours.

1160
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,392
I'll see you around, Steven.

1161
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,029
You're not gonna believe this,
but I'm working on a script.

1162
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,800
What's the script about?

1163
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,795
About two FBI agents,
one good, one bad,

1164
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,836
chasing down a million dollars' worth
of lost drug money

1165
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,195
in Los Angeles
during the 1984 Olympics,

1166
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,430
and here's the catch:

1167
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,795
They're both Mormon.

1168
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,189
Well, that's not such a bad idea.

1169
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,556
Well, it needs work. Having some trouble
with the second act.

1170
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,235
Yeah. Second acts are tough.

1171
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,995
I could use a director.

1172
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,189
Hey, Joe...

1173
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,589
Wanna watch this together?

1174
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,240
<i>OK, Sam. Roll it, please.</i>

1175
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,318
<i>Arizona, scene one, take one.</i>

1176
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,711
And... action.

1177
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,392
Live!

1178
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,948
I want to live!

1179
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,277
Oh, my God.

1180
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,918
An American eagle?

1181
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,554
That looked pretty good.

1182
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,074
Yeah.

1183
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,277
- I liked the pan.
- It seemed to work.

1184
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,032
Wanna watch it again?

1185
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,355
Would you play it again, Sam?

1186
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,437
So, what's your movie called?

1187
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,238
I don't have a title.

1188
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,029
<i>It's set in LA, so I thought
it should be Hollywood something.</i>

1189
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,554
<i>Hollywood Heat?</i>

1190
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,835
<i>Hollywood Cash?</i>

1191
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,309
<i>Hollywood Gold.
Hollywood Chase.</i>

1192
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,516
<i>Hollywood and Crime.</i>

1193
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,511
Hey, that's pretty good.

1194
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,517
What time is your audition?

1195
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,828
1.30.

1196
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,990
Oh, good luck.

1197
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,389
I know you're gonna get it.

1198
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,471
You love Oreos.

1199
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,190
I love you so much.
