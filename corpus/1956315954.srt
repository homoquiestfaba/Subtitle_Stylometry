1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,641
I feel this magnetic pull
bringing me back to the moment.

2
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:19,519
-I was feeling a little...
-[David Sampliner] But seriously,

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,229
-where are we going?
-I don't know. Where are we going?

4
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,480
[Sampliner]
Well, where did this thing happen?

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,942
I think we're going back to 1985.
[chuckles]

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:29,446
It was a chilly evening. Crisp... taut.

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,032
[Sampliner]
The evening Jay is talking about

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,491
happened when we were in high school.

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,576
This is...

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,536
[Sampliner]
I don't know if he still thinks about it,

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,747
but the reason I brought him back here
is because I do.

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,542
[Sampliner] So, is this where
you got mugged, basically? Right here?

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,711
Well, I think the fun started
coming around that corner.

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,547
We're walking here...

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,219
and the gentlemen sort of
infused themselves into our little gaggle.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,139
Some guy jumped on me, like,
with a bear hug from behind.

17
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,684
The moment I got hit,
I assumed it was a bottle

18
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:03,063
because I felt, you know, liquid,
which was blood.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,439
But I assumed it was a bottle,

20
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,566
and I remember thinking,
"That's kind of cool.

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,486
I was just sort of, like, in a bar fight
in an old Western."

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,741
I will say, I was a little upset
with my supporting cast that evening.

23
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,368
[laughing]

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,911
They may have had some pom-poms,
cheering on the side,

25
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,249
but I could have used
maybe a little more... [chuckles]

26
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,167
actual assistance.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,255
[Sampliner] Do you remember what, sort of,
happened to me during that whole thing?

28
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,757
Like, when things went down,
do you remember where I was?

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,261
[Jay] What happened?
Were they grabbing you, as well?

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,929
Did you trip? Were you taking a pee?
What happened?

31
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,807
[Sampliner] I was lying under a car.

32
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,226
[laughing]

33
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:49,401
[Jay] You were lying under a car!
You were lying under a car.

34
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,862
I don't know why that's funny.
It just is. Oh, man.

35
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,240
[Sampliner]
Obviously, I'm not proud of it.

36
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,702
It's been 20 years
since I watched Jay get mugged.

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,829
Maybe the reason I haven't let it go is

38
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,625
because I feel like I'm still that guy,
hiding under the car.

39
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,796
[Ian] I looked at you and I was like,

40
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,923
"That guy and I are supposed to
be friends. I know it."

41
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,050
That was my first impression of you.

42
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,470
Because you didn't strike me as a dude.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,434
You were warm and open.
You were almost like a chick.

44
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,062
[people clamoring]

45
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,523
[Nina] You're actually a woman
trapped in the body of a man,

46
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,858
and I've thought that for a long time.

47
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,195
-[Sampliner] Are you being serious?
-I mean, kind of.

48
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,782
You're a sensitive soul,
like the way women are sensitive.

49
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,075
[Sampliner] What does that mean?

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,452
[Nina] When I talk to you about stuff,

51
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,456
it doesn't feel different than
when I'm talking to my girlfriends.

52
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,376
In our family,

53
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:53,089
since you were the youngest,
you were definitely the follower.

54
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,801
If Michael wanted to
play ball and tackle you,

55
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,886
you were delighted to do that.

56
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,015
If Lisa wanted to dress you up in dresses,
you were delighted to do that.

57
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,267
-[Sampliner] Mmm-hmm.
-You didn't care what it was

58
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,186
as long as you were included.

59
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,316
Forty. You want one for good luck?

60
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,859
[Sampliner] I'm now turning 40,

61
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,446
and I don't have a family...
a successful career...

62
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,323
a life I'm proud of.

63
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,660
But it goes deeper than that.

64
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,582
I'm a guy who can't stand up for himself,
who can't hold his own.

65
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,503
And I don't wanna be that guy anymore.

66
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,932
[Sampliner] It pisses me off that
I just might not be an alpha male.

67
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,393
You're not.

68
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,355
You're not.

69
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,858
[Sampliner]
I might not come off as an alpha male,

70
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,028
but I tend to become friends
with guys who are.

71
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,655
Ian was no exception.

72
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,325
Part of the thing I like about you
is that you're not an alpha male.

73
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,785
You know?

74
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,912
-You're--
-[Sampliner] How is that a strength?

75
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,039
Huge strength.

76
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,833
It's not a strength
if you wish you were something else.

77
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,794
I was trained to be an alpha male.

78
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,505
My father, when I was a kid,
used to take...

79
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,925
He had big, strong hands, as do I now.

80
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,177
And he would say, "Come here, son."

81
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,014
And he would shake my hand and squeeze it

82
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:28,142
until I was able to squeeze it back.

83
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,478
And I spent years...
[mimics groaning]

84
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,106
He's like, "Squeeze back,
squeeze back, squeeze back."

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,526
And now, I've got the grip.

86
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,111
Alpha males are assholes.

87
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,448
Pretty much.

88
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,199
[Sampliner] But you're not an asshole.

89
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,454
There's an asshole in me...
because I'll bite your throat out.

90
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,457
I'll fucking kill you if I need to.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,294
[snaps fingers] An alpha male's not afraid
to risk not being liked.

92
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,589
It's more important to an alpha male
to express himself...

93
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,467
than it is to get along with people.

94
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,469
'Cause an alpha male
doesn't need to get along with people

95
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,305
'cause he's more powerful than them,
"theoretically."

96
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,433
An alpha male in the wild doesn't need
to make sure that everybody likes him.

97
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,144
He's gonna chew their face off
if they don't like him.

98
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,691
[Sampliner] What do you think it'll take
for me to get there?

99
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,322
I don't think you ever will.

100
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,999
-How'd that feel, when I said that?
-Well, crushing.

101
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,250
The only way you get there

102
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,753
is if I say to you,
"I don't think you ever will,"

103
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,132
and you go,
"Yeah? Fuck you! I will."

104
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,175
That's the way you get there.

105
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,804
No. No. No!

106
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,181
What part of "no" don't you understand?

107
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,644
I'm not asking you, I am telling you.

108
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,687
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!

109
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,689
Get out of my way.

110
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,610
Get the fuck out of my way.
Get the fuck out of my way!

111
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,738
[Sampliner] You can see why
people don't get out of my way.

112
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,407
[vocalizing]

113
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,409
[Sampliner vocalizing]

114
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,493
Yes, that's it.

115
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,786
[vocalizing]

116
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,245
[Sampliner]
I realize that voice lessons

117
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,916
don't sound like the fast track
to finding your manhood.

118
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,377
But I wanted a stronger voice,
to be less of a pushover.

119
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:23,299
You're gonna let it go wildly through
your whole body, arms, legs, face.

120
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,217
[Sampliner]
Neil's a voice coach who was hoping

121
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,011
to bring out my inner caveman.

122
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,639
-[mouthing yelling]
-[Neil] That's it. Great. Keep going.

123
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,348
-[grunts]
-Good, good.

124
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,185
Yeah, wild. Keep it long.
Really, can you keep 'em long?

125
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,771
Can you hear yourself
painting the walls with the sound?

126
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,484
Explore the violence of it, enjoy it.

127
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,574
-Good, now just take a moment and stop.
-[gasps]

128
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,160
Keep your eyes shut.
Now put your hands on your belly.

129
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,245
And just take in
what you're experiencing now.

130
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,831
What do you feel?

131
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,917
[Sampliner]
Yeah, it brings alive a lot

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,922
[chuckles] that usually stays way,
way beneath the surface.

133
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,550
It's definitely
a much more aggressive energy

134
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,176
than I normally carry around.

135
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,263
But I still feel like I'm wearing it
and not inhabiting it, somehow.

136
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,851
[Neil] Well, personally, my feeling is
better to wear it than to not get near it.

137
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,853
There's that phrase,
"Fake it till you make it."

138
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,688
Right now, I'd like you to
be exploring aggression.

139
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,315
And I don't expect it to seem natural.
It's not natural to you.

140
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,859
-You de-habituated yourself to that...
-Right.

141
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,652
...a long time ago.

142
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,198
[Sampliner] Neil thought
I could learn to be more assertive,

143
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,242
and I hoped he was right.

144
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,371
I was male, after all,
and figured I was wired to be assertive.

145
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,499
So, did you get a chance
to look at my levels?

146
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,792
I did, yeah.

147
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,545
-So, what'd they say?
-Well, it's very interesting, actually.

148
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:49,552
We're told testosterone is...
262 is the low, to 1,593.

149
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,305
So a big range,
but that comprises men of all ages.

150
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,517
And so... [clears throat]
your testosterone came in...

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,435
And remember, I said 262 to 1,593.

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,980
You came in at 262.

153
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,189
[Sampliner]
So, the absolute lowest?

154
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,108
The absolute lowest you can...
But normal.

155
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:07,278
Now, I thought, "Ooh, this is
gonna be perfect for a movie."

156
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,488
[laughing]

157
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,158
[Sampliner]
I identify more with the qualities

158
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,701
people tend to associate with women.

159
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,704
-Empathy, being a good communicator...
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

160
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,872
...and those sorts of things,

161
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:22,376
and don't identify as much with the things
that are supposed to be male.

162
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,629
Aggression, competitiveness,
things like that.

163
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:29,258
It's funny that
you rattled those off in the...

164
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,968
'Cause I've been accused
of having no empathy,

165
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,220
I've been accused
of being a terrible communicator.

166
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,182
And I've been brimming with confidence
most of my life

167
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,475
'cause things have just worked out for me.

168
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,188
Um, but I've never checked
my testosterone level...

169
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,272
so I don't know.

170
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,901
You've never been curious in all this work
to test your own level?

171
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,528
I really haven't.

172
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,074
My body behaves like a body that
seems to be adequately testosteronized.

173
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,786
So I've just never checked.

174
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,505
[Rachel] You talk a lot about
wanting to stand up for yourself,

175
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,050
and so I think that that's what
you associate with masculinity,

176
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,011
that kind of confidence,
and that outward appearance

177
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,558
of somebody who has direction and knows
what they want, goes after it, gets it.

178
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,686
I've never felt like
you weren't enough of a man.

179
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,146
You don't seem feminine to me.

180
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,398
Is that why you fell in love with me,

181
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,110
because I made you feel
like more of a man?

182
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,695
No, it's not gonna work, baby.
You're gonna...

183
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,656
I can't watch everything
you're gonna fall into.

184
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,033
-[Sampliner] You can't?
-No.

185
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,329
[Sampliner] I hadn't been in
a serious relationship in eight years.

186
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,414
-[Sampliner] Hey, Rachel.
-[chuckling] Hey.

187
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,750
[Sampliner] But then I met Rachel.

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,588
For the first time in a long time,
I was able to let someone in.

189
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,006
Home.

190
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,507
[chuckling]

191
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,593
[Sampliner] Things got serious.

192
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,804
You're the most
romantic guy in the world.

193
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,431
And before we could plan a wedding...

194
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,268
It's turning positive.
I'm pregnant.

195
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,020
[both laughing]

196
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,775
Then I heard the words
every father is supposed to wanna hear.

197
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,192
[Sampliner] Wow.

198
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,528
You are having a little boy.

199
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,822
[woman laughing over phone]

200
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,077
[woman] A boy! Oh, my God!

201
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,162
[chuckling]

202
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,456
You once said that you felt like
a boy would be more challenging for you

203
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,877
'cause you also relate more
to women in your life.

204
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,211
-[Sampliner] Yeah.
-And I feel that way, too,

205
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,546
but I feel excited about that.

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,839
It really feels different.

207
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,800
It really feels like
it's gonna be such a discovery.

208
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,176
Like, it's just something so new.

209
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,178
I didn't grow up with boys at all,
so I feel like,

210
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,808
"Wow, I get to experience this thing
that I didn't ever know before."

211
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,475
How do you feel?

212
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,896
Well, I'm thrilled.

213
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,022
[chuckles]

214
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,943
-[device beeps]
-[Sampliner] I'm terrified, actually.

215
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,153
I feel ready to be a parent.

216
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,948
But being a father to a son
isn't just being a parent.

217
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:02,704
It means bringing a boy into manhood...
a place I feel so far away from myself.

218
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,837
This is my father.

219
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,632
It's hard to believe he's 70 years old.

220
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,802
Don't step on my feet.

221
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,304
Watch your head.

222
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,348
[Sampliner]
If he's ever doubted how to be a man...

223
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,558
he's not shared it with me.

224
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,352
[James] You wanna do this exercise?

225
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,229
-[Sampliner] You keep baiting me.
-Yeah, I do.

226
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,940
I wanna see what you can do, man.

227
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,693
[Sampliner]
My dad is a classic 1950s man...

228
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,030
a kind of Jewish John Wayne.

229
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,616
He followed the playbook of his time.

230
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,119
He met my mom in college.

231
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,329
They married.

232
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:50,960
My dad was the provider,
my mom stayed home and raised three kids.

233
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,089
And 45 years later...
they're still on their honeymoon.

234
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,968
[James singing] ♪ One fist of iron
And the other of steel ♪

235
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:04,140

236
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,351

237
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,061
Stop that, David.

238
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,396
[laughing]

239
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,274
[Sampliner]
All right, guys, so tell me the story

240
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,608
of these jerseys you got on.

241
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,028
[James] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Ready, Bets?

242
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,695
[Betsy] One, two, three.

243
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,907
They came from the store.

244
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,241
[laughing]

245
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,619
The story of the jerseys is that...

246
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:26,913
Sit down, baby. It's too...

247
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,374
...every time we pass somebody
riding on our tandem...

248
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:32,751
Excuse me. Thank you.

249
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,629
-They always--
-The saga of Double Trouble.

250
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,800
They always say the same thing to us.

251
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,344
They always say, "She isn't peddling."

252
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:47,141
Or, in a lesser sense,
"Someone's following you."

253
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,726
Those are the two cute things
that everyone says,

254
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,770
and they think
they're being totally original.

255
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:57,151
However, one day, one person said to us,
"A-ha! Double trouble."

256
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,654
[Sampliner] Is there any metaphoric
significance to "Double Trouble"?

257
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:02,990
-No.
-No.

258
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,993
No real deep thinking behind this.

259
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,745
It was just at least
one slightly original statement

260
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,499
that someone made amid all the banality.

261
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,294
And that is our story.

262
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,090
[Sampliner]
My dad groomed me to be like him.

263
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,760
I went to the same all-boys school
as he did.

264
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,513
I went to Yale like he did.

265
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,016
But I was part of Generation X,

266
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,186
the kids who didn't want
their parents' marriages and careers...

267
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,982
who wanted to explore the world
before settling down.

268
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,151
So after college, I taught high school...

269
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,321
studied at a yeshiva in Jerusalem...

270
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,699
went to graduate school
in American History to become a professor,

271
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,077
which, by the way, I never did.

272
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,415
I didn't just want a job.
I wanted to do something I loved.

273
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,294
At 29, I made The New York Times.

274
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,756
Unfortunately, not because
I had accomplished anything,

275
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,925
but precisely because I hadn't.

276
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,803
They featured me in a story
called "Young-Life Crisis."

277
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,182
That's me flipping omelets
in Athens, Georgia,

278
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,683
after quitting graduate school,

279
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,229
but before I started working
at a Jewish museum in Mississippi.

280
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,109
I can hardly imagine
what all this looked like to my father.

281
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,488
Oh, wait... I can.

282
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,240
My father was quoted in the article

283
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,451
saying that my whole generation
was lollygagging through life.

284
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,455
But I knew who he was talking about.

285
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,207
[Sampliner] Do you feel like
I'm lollygagging through life?

286
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,669
Well, I would say that...

287
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,048
in somewhat respects, yes,
and in some respects, no.

288
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,300
But in some respects,
do you still think I am?

289
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,803
Well, you don't have
permanent, day-to-day employment.

290
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,767
[Sampliner]
That isn't exactly true.

291
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,645
I do cobble together a living
as a filmmaker.

292
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:03,194
It just doesn't look like
a real career to my father.

293
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,322
[Betsy] At last, at last.
[Rachel] Hi. I know, finally.

294
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,950
-Hi.
-[Betsy chuckling] Hi.

295
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,659
[Rachel] Where's your dad?

296
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,245
He's hiding outside.
I don't know if he wants to be...

297
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,538
[Sampliner]
Does he not want to be filmed?

298
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,623
[Betsy] I don't know.
[Rachel] Here, let me just do it.

299
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,668
[all laughing]

300
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,130
[Sampliner] Oh, my God.

301
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,549
[Rachel] Hi.
[Sampliner] Hi. We're dueling cameras.

302
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,469
[Betsy] So, I brought you this memory
from your old bedroom, David.

303
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,012
[Sampliner] What is it?
[James] Look at David.

304
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,307
He's on his ready. He's not sure
what's coming out of his past.

305
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,392
Only thing that was elegant
in your bedroom.

306
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,685
-Do you remember this?
-[Sampliner] What?

307
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,938
-What is this thing?
-[James] Sterling silver.

308
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,232
-Something for you to keep.
-[Betsy] How about that?

309
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,401
Sterling silver bowl
from your bedroom, David.

310
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,113
-The most elegant--
-[Sampliner] Oh, my God. Let me see it.

311
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,991
[James] And it's all...
Notice how polished it is, too.

312
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,908
[Rachel] Is it some medal that you won?

313
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,160
[Sampliner] What is it?
[Betsy] Yeah, I think he did.

314
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,787
It says, "US 1982-83,

315
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,958
Lower School Top Scholar,
David Sampliner."

316
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
-[James] Oh, my God.
-[all laughing]

317
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,963
-[Sampliner] Oh--
-Oh, my God.

318
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,048
You won a silver medal.

319
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,801
[Sampliner] I still don't know why
my parents chose this particular moment

320
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,763
to trot out a trophy from eighth grade.

321
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:18,602
Maybe they were trying to show Rachel
that even if it didn't look like it now...

322
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,604
I had once been on top.

323
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,774
My dad was used to success.

324
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,653
For over 40 years,
he had been a very successful surgeon.

325
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,698
He co-authored a groundbreaking textbook
on critical care...

326
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,244
which you can find
in the backpack of a swimsuit model...

327
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,164
on the wall as you enter our house.

328
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,542
I've always been a little embarrassed
by this poster.

329
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,835
My dad... is not.

330
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,675
-[Sampliner] So...
-So...

331
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,011
-I'm trying to get...
-David, zip up your pants.

332
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,220
[laughing]

333
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,473
[stuttering]
You're coming down here to film

334
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,808
with your pants unzipped.

335
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,936
I don't know what that means.

336
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,191
[Sampliner] In all his years as a surgeon,
I never once saw my dad perform surgery.

337
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,278
He never discussed it with me,
and I never asked questions about it.

338
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,823
[Sampliner] I'm trying to get a sense
of what your life is like now.

339
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,408
It's fabulous.

340
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,702
-Okay, but now that you're retired...
-It's fabulous.

341
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,663
-...you're no longer doing surgery.
-Yes.

342
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,041
And I wonder,
do you miss doing the surgery?

343
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,209
Yes.

344
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,212
-[Sampliner] Yeah?
-Yeah.

345
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,629
So tell me what you miss about it.

346
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,005
It's fun.

347
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,508
But I'm too old to do surgery,

348
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,844
and I realize that,
so I don't do it anymore.

349
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,431
I almost imagine there's, like,
an adrenaline rush that you miss

350
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,308
of all the pressure that you're under.

351
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,726
Not really.

352
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,729
It becomes what you do.

353
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,815
[Sampliner] You never had anxiety
about performing it well

354
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,651
when you were under the gun
and someone's life is in the balance?

355
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,573
You have to understand that
it's no different than anybody else's job.

356
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,992
You get trained to do something,
and you do it.

357
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,452
So there's not great pressure.

358
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,662
The only time there's pressure
is in dire emergencies

359
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,582
when people are bleeding,
or something like that.

360
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, how did you handle that?

361
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,752
Just very well.

362
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,755
Wasn't a problem. Enjoyed it.

363
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,967
Took care of my job, did it,
and then we were done.

364
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,845
[Sampliner] My father sometimes
seemed larger than life.

365
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:20,307
My college friend, Ed, seemed even larger.

366
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,853
In our circle of friends, I think
probably you and I were the least inclined

367
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,648
toward, what I would call,
like, "macho behavior."

368
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,608
And I think that's probably why,

369
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,486
after school,
we also were hanging out so much,

370
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,781
because I think
we were both finding our way.

371
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,410
I think you were the only person
I knew who, like me,

372
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,246
it never even crossed our minds

373
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:48,001
that we would be launching ourselves
into a "career."

374
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,088
[Sampliner] We both steered clear of
our fathers' professional career paths...

375
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,633
but with somewhat different results.

376
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,845
I envied him now
for his celebrity and success,

377
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,309
but even more for his, well... balls.

378
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,728
When being reductive
to people who don't know you,

379
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,063
or I'm introducing to you,

380
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,401
I'll say like, oh, you know,
"David's a documentary filmmaker."

381
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,320
Um, but even as
one of your better friends,

382
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:20,284
I don't think I would have as easily said,
"I know what David's pointed ambition is."

383
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,993
[Sampliner]
I've been vague about my ambition.

384
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,663
I've let it slide all over the map.

385
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,624
It was my way of not entering the game,
not choosing an ambition,

386
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,377
not choosing something
I really wanted to go after and get.

387
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,878
But I think that's the risk thing.

388
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,131
Anytime you choose a target...

389
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,635
you feel like a fake.

390
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,179
And that's the risk zone.

391
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,224
That's the zone in which
you feel vulnerable

392
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,643
because you are risking your ego.

393
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:50,105
The assertion has to happen
before the reality,

394
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,815
and the assertion is...

395
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,026
is maybe hard, you know?

396
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,447
[rooster crowing]

397
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,909
[Sampliner] I always craved
a mentor, a guide...

398
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,787
someone who could reassure me
that I was on the right path.

399
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,749
I tried rabbis, therapists,

400
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,210
and then Lauren, a life coach.

401
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:15,506
You're a little risk averse
and then it makes you a bit of a pansy.

402
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,090
Sorry.

403
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,218
- [laughs] You asked.
-[Sampliner] What do I do about that?

404
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,762
I think I agree with you.

405
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,765
What do you... You, you know,
make sure you take a risk a day.

406
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,894
Like, you actually strap on balls that
scare the shit out of you every day

407
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,312
and do something.

408
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,525
Right? Like, what you do not want to do,
you find one every day and you do it.

409
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:41,990
The New Warrior Training Adventure
is a life-changing experience.

410
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,701
I didn't know what being a man was.

411
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,539
I got over so much of the stuff
that was holding me back my whole life.

412
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,081
Only you'll know if you're ready.

413
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,958
Just... [snaps fingers] do it.

414
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,803
[Sampliner] To most people, taking a risk
means skydiving or bungee jumping.

415
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,222
To me, it meant joining a men's group.

416
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,142
The New Warrior Training Adventure.

417
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,814
Like, the title itself freaks me out.

418
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,983
It's, like, 30 guys
going into the woods for the weekend

419
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,946
and that whole stereotype
of men going off into the woods

420
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,615
and playing drums,

421
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,784
getting in touch
with their primal feelings...

422
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,495
Like, that whole stereotype
I think is about to come true,

423
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,788
and that freaks me out.

424
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,209
I've always avoided
being a part of a group of guys.

425
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,794
I actually think about things like,

426
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,422
"What T-shirt am I going to wear
on this weekend?"

427
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,548
Put me with other men

428
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,301
and I feel like the girlfriend
tagging along on poker night.

429
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,054
I feel disaster impending.

430
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,645
What I feared would happen did happen.

431
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,023
We got naked and danced around a fire.

432
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,702
But it turns out the weekend wasn't about
getting in touch with our manhood.

433
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,121
It was about getting in touch
with our feelings.

434
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,666
[man] Welcome, new warrior,
David Sampliner.

435
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,292
[all cheering]

436
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,717
[Sampliner] For the first time,
I joined a group of guys...

437
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,886
and I felt like I belonged.

438
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,220
[whooping]

439
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,142
I've never wanted to join a group, really,
and certainly not a group of men.

440
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,352
Didn't know how to do that.

441
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,897
And one of the most amazing things
about this weekend

442
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,485
was giving me the experience
of dropping all that judgment,

443
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,988
all that "I'm better than that..."

444
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:48,617
and just letting myself
have an experience without that judgment.

445
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,494
[all applauding]

446
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,415
[woman] Tell me what you're thinking
about this.

447
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,293
Um...

448
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,347
[Sampliner] What did you really feel?
Were you totally freaked out?

449
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,392
It just makes me feel, like, icky.

450
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,189
The group love, the group hug,
"We all support each other."

451
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,191
This drippy, share-y...

452
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,236
It's the overenthusiasm of the audience,
the like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

453
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,280
"In an instant, I'm like the Buddha."

454
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:29,866
Like, "I'm enlightened
and I love my brothers."

455
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,244
It's just, like,
how does that happen in a weekend?

456
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,830
[Sampliner]
I was hoping the Warrior weekend

457
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,915
would make me a different man,

458
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,875
but Rachel was right.

459
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,587
Becoming a different man
would take more than a weekend.

460
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,213
[breathing heavily]

461
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,638
[Sampliner]
This is my older brother, Michael.

462
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,724
He's the one who takes after my father...

463
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,143
[grunts]

464
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,729
...and then some.

465
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,232
[woman]
Okay, let's do six more.

466
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,110
[Sampliner]
As a kid, I wanted to be like him...

467
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,945
especially his body.

468
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,994
But I could never... quite measure up.

469
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,537
-[woman] There.
-[groans]

470
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,038
[Michael chuckles]
[woman] Pull back, pull back.

471
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,082
Man, you got some good sound.

472
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,052
[Sampliner] Of the two boys in our family,
you're the one that became the man.

473
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,721
[both laughing]

474
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,055
How did you do it?

475
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,099
[Michael]
I don't think I was becoming a man,

476
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,393
I think I just was pretending I was a man.

477
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,478
It was all external confidence,

478
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:44,274
it was all being a leader,
being strong, being athletic.

479
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,067
Um...

480
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,903
But if you put me
one-on-one in a room with someone,

481
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,072
I don't think I was truly confident.

482
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,950
I had all the man characteristics,

483
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,370
but I didn't feel like
I was a complete person behind those.

484
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,750
I was a 1950s man in the 1970s,

485
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,003
and by the 1980s,
I don't think it applied much anymore.

486
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,300
Where I am now, being a man for me
is raising two kids well

487
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,136
and having a good relationship at home.

488
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:16,431
I think my characteristics
that I got from Dad

489
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:20,351
have been exceptional for me in work

490
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,854
and have been the things
I have to push away the most

491
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,107
to try to have a successful
relationship at home.

492
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:31,154
[James]
Betsy, I want you to go look at the hedge

493
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:33,657
and see if it's proper, okay, please?

494
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,033
The one right over there,

495
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,243
where I've been waiting for you
for the last bit of time.

496
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,663
Just go walk over there and look, please.

497
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,958
[Sampliner] My dad needed things done
a certain way.

498
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,793
[James]
They don't have one ACE bandage in here.

499
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,628
That's unbelievable.

500
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,089
[Sampliner] And it was a good idea
not to disappoint him.

501
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:53,009
What I don't understand in that thing...
You don't have one ACE bandage there.

502
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,510
-Yeah, I know, it's...
-Not one.

503
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,679
-I know.
-What are we supposed to do?

504
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,472
How are we supposed to wrap somebody
if they need it?

505
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,556
We call the trainer.

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,225
I'm the trainer today.
He's gone with the football team.

507
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,309
I don't know.

508
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,270
We don't have one ACE bandage
in your trainer's kit.

509
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,856
-Okay. Okay.
-Not one.

510
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,818
So I can't wrap anybody with ice.
I can't wrap anybody with anything.

511
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,363
Don't make it so hard on me.

512
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,242
[Sampliner] Oh, no.

513
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,827
[James] You're all right-footed, eh?

514
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,290
[Sampliner] Before my dad was a surgeon...
he was a star soccer player...

515
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,002
in high school, at Yale.

516
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,213
He even played professionally
while he was in medical school.

517
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:33,133
Once you have it, you never lose it, Dave.

518
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,803
[Sampliner]
He loved to repeat this saying.

519
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,306
"Show me a good loser...
and I'll show you a loser."

520
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,894
-[chuckling] Jesus Christ.
-[Sampliner] I think I got...

521
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,479
[James] That's what I mean, Dave.
You weren't much of a head case.

522
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:50,316
I think I accurately reproduced my
10th grade baseball season, right there.

523
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,071
[Sampliner] In 10th grade,
I'd lost the ability to throw a baseball.

524
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,742
I had played all my life.

525
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,745
Throwing a baseball was like breathing.

526
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,665
Then suddenly, it wasn't.

527
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,253
I still can't explain why it happened.

528
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,631
My dad thought it was a mental thing.

529
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,967
"Don't be a head case," he'd say.

530
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,219
But I was.

531
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,433
[Lisa] I think I got a lot of
mixed messages from Dad

532
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,601
because Dad was my biggest cheerleader.

533
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:30,315
He celebrated all of my accomplishments.

534
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,984
But he made it very clear to me

535
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,029
that at the end of the day,
his expectations of me...

536
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,992
were that I would find a nice man,
settle down and be a good housewife.

537
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,870
I remember one point in time
not speaking to him for a while

538
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,622
'cause I was graduating
from graduate school.

539
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,043
He said to me, "Well,
it doesn't really matter what job you get.

540
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,754
You'll just find some man
to take care of you anyways."

541
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,382
But then I realized that, in many ways,

542
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:01,722
it saved me from a lot of the issues
that you, I think, have had with him.

543
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,224
Because, in his mind,

544
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,143
whatever I've done
has been an accomplishment.

545
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,021
So, while it aggravates me,

546
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,231
in a lot of ways,

547
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:16,236
I've been the beneficiary
of his sexist perception of the world.

548
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,822
[Sampliner] Explain that.
I don't quite get it.

549
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,325
How are you the beneficiary
of his sexist perception of the world?

550
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,536
Because I've never felt
like I've fallen short in his eyes.

551
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,206
Unlike for you, at the end of the day,

552
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,960
the only person I had to prove anything to
was myself.

553
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,925
[Betsy] Three eggs. Three.

554
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,679
[Sampliner] Compared to Michael,
compared to Dad, what was I like as a guy?

555
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,390
When I think of you as a child,

556
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:49,227
I think of you
as this totally delightful free spirit,

557
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:54,816
this little sprite who was
dancing and singing through the house.

558
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,044
But in our family,
guys were always expected to play sports.

559
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,548
And as it turned out,
you were an extremely gifted athlete.

560
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,508
Because this little sprite
who danced through the house

561
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,968
was very well coordinated.

562
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,595
The thing that made you different

563
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,433
was that you didn't
really have a killer instinct.

564
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,727
I remember somebody telling you
when you were playing soccer or something,

565
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,939
"David, stop smiling so much."

566
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,650
In other words, stop having so much fun
and go in for the kill.

567
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,768
[Sampliner] Hunting was the last thing
I'd ever imagined myself doing.

568
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:17,523
I still got the tag on this bag.
I think that's got to go.

569
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,862
[Sampliner] But I still hadn't
really challenged my own instincts.

570
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,657
I needed to do something
indisputably masculine.

571
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,660
-Let's see the hardware.
-Yes.

572
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,079
All right.

573
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,499
The official unsheathing.

574
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:39,379
-[Peter] I haven't seen it yet.
-I've barely seen it.

575
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,634
[Peter] Whoo! Cool.
It looks like a real death machine.

576
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,969
[Peter chuckling]

577
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:49,139
-Doesn't it?
-Yeah, it does. Honestly.

578
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,561
Push it. Don't be shy. Yeah.

579
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,731
-I was afraid to, like, set the thing off.
-Okay.

580
00:30:58,814 --> 00:31:00,233
All right, this is gonna be it, huh?

581
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,445
So, when you pull, just pull gently.
With the finger.

582
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,408
Oh, I have the safety.
[chuckles]

583
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,285
I was squeezing the trigger
and I have the safety on.

584
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,370
-[Peter] What's that?
-I had the safety on.

585
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,330
I was ready to squeeze the trigger
and the safety--

586
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,415
[Peter] Happens all the time.

587
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,504
I'm at half safety, God damn it.
All right.

588
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,714
-All right, so, you gotta make sure now.
-Yeah.

589
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,800
'Cause you don't want that
to happen with a deer, right?

590
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,010
Yeah.

591
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,975
Ah. Fuck, man.

592
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,811
[Peter] Chamber.

593
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,272
The thing hit me in the forehead. Ah.

594
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:44,360
[Peter] Do it. Yank it.
Pull it. Push it. Done.

595
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,112
[Sampliner] Okay.
[Peter] Fire again.

596
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,698
I just shouldn't be so close?
This thing knocked me hard in the head.

597
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,782
-[Peter] It did?
-Yeah.

598
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:50,951
[Peter] Oh, oh.

599
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,953
I don't think I'm bleeding or anything.
It just hit me hard.

600
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,620
Holy shit, you are.

601
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,873
I got a big bruise on my forehead,
I can feel it.

602
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,049
You might need to drive home, dude.

603
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,718
[man] Has this ever happened to anyone
you were teaching shooting?

604
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,511
No. I've never...

605
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,308
I should have been watching him.
I feel bad.

606
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,792
[clicks]

607
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,716
[Sampliner]
So I just wanted to ask you

608
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,052
what you thought of
the fact that I'm hunting.

609
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,596
[Michael] To be blunt about it,
this seems like kind of a stab.

610
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,348
Like, "Oh, crap,
I'm not feeling very manly today,

611
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,641
so I'll just go shoot a deer."

612
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,435
Like, as opposed to really intrinsically
building it up from inside you

613
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,937
that it seems to be almost
like an external way

614
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:05,566
to leapfrog, maybe, some of those steps.

615
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,194
Maybe it's just too obvious.

616
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,072
It's like, "Yeah, I went and shot
and killed a deer."

617
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,283
That doesn't make you a man...

618
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:18,454
and I think that you're too self-critical
to think that it would.

619
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,166
So you're not going to believe
in the cliché of that.

620
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,293
I'm sure it'd be an intense experience,

621
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:27,713
but will it bring you any closer
to what you're trying to find or feel?

622
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,303
[Rachel] What do you think
it's gonna be like

623
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,513
when you're aiming at a deer?

624
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,141
When you actually hit a deer?

625
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,768
All I was doing
was firing at a cardboard target.

626
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:44,439
Just the violence of that gun
really shook me up.

627
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,650
[Rachel] Do you feel ready to kill a deer,
to take its life?

628
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,777
I simply don't know.

629
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:01,622
I've never had a moment of,
"I'm gonna kill this poor animal."

630
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,666
Feels right to me.
It feels like...

631
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:09,672
um, part of me that was... missing.

632
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:15,261
Like the predator that was in all of us
for a hundred thousand years went away,

633
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,474
and then when I took up hunting,
it was just a revelation.

634
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,558
Can you...

635
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:25,063
You think you're a pussy
and this will make you not a pussy?

636
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,606
[Sampliner]
It's funny 'cause I don't think...

637
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,693
I don't think shooting a deer
is gonna make me less of a pussy.

638
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,820
[David] You bought a gun.
[Jon] You bought a gun?

639
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,155
Yeah, no shit.

640
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,324
[David] It's so funny
'cause you took that out

641
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,244
and all of a sudden
you seem so much more like a man.

642
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,786
[all laughing]

643
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:46,626
No, I'm serious though.
It was, like, wow, the gun changes things.

644
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,211
[Jon] Why do you think
a gun changes things?

645
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,589
[David] Because it's a serious tool.
[Sampliner] It just is.

646
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,092
You could survive with that.

647
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,220
Whereas a second ago,
you were just...

648
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,013
-[Jon] A pussy sitting on a couch.
-...a sensitive dude.

649
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,974
Now you're a guy with a gun

650
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,977
and you're gonna go kill something
that you're gonna eat.

651
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:10,150
[Sampliner] Man.

652
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,443
[chuckles]

653
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,575
-Got no dirt in it? Okay.
-No, there's none.

654
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,246
[whispering] I have a feeling
they're gonna be coming

655
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,248
from this direction over on top.

656
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,449
[breathing nervously]

657
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,918
[gunshot]

658
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,531
David. David.

659
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,829
I've hit the deer, man.
[chuckles]

660
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,665
He's lying there.
Do you see it?

661
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,669
God damn.

662
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,683
[exhales sharply]

663
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:55,315
The only thing I can say is
I'm glad I hit it a bull's-eye

664
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,607
for where I wanted to hit him.

665
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,944
I mean it's, like, instant, instant.

666
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,032
I mean, close to instant death,
but I'm just glad I didn't...

667
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,494
glad I didn't injure him.

668
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,163
Super young buck.

669
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,042
I hit him where I wanted to hit him.

670
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,461
[David] Wow.

671
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,838
-[Sampliner] Man.
-That was a perfect shot.

672
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,343
How does it feel?

673
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,303
I don't feel numb,
but I don't...

674
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,223
feel the feeling
of having taken the life of this thing.

675
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,767
[David] I bet it's in the heart.

676
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,644
Which is a bummer
because the heart's yummy.

677
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,980
-But nice shot.
-[chuckles]

678
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,440
Nice shot.

679
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,444
Let me get a picture of you with it
and text it to Peter.

680
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,404
[Sampliner] Can you
talk me through this a little bit,

681
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,699
'cause I don't wanna just jump-in do it,
'cause I'm feeling a little...

682
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,368
You did what you set out to accomplish.

683
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,454
You killed an animal
that you're gonna eat.

684
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,997
You should be proud right now.

685
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,542
You should have no other feeling
but pride right now.

686
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,882
So you just go right behind him.
Go on your knee, hold him up like that.

687
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,469
I mean, is that respect?
I just wanna make--

688
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,221
I don't wanna be holding him
in the trophy way, you know?

689
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,473
[David] Well...

690
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,100
[stuttering] That's my concern.

691
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,353
This is just...
You got one. This is your first.

692
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,564
This is rite of passage.
This is awesome.

693
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,653
[Sampliner] Oh, man.

694
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,793
[child] But I'm not hungry.

695
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,128
[man 1] Oh, Lord...
[man 2] This lady's not hungry.

696
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,255
[man 3] People could come,
start having their dinner.

697
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,342
[Sampliner] I had accomplished
exactly what I'd hoped for.

698
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,096
But having gone to this extreme...

699
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,307
I expected to feel something different...

700
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,144
some internal shift.

701
00:39:58,103 --> 00:39:59,354
And I didn't.

702
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,692
[James] I looked at it as a sport
that you were participating in.

703
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,193
-Did you really think that?
-What?

704
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,945
-That he was just going for a sport.
-Yeah.

705
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,238
-Well, how?
-'Cause I didn't--

706
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,452
How does that in any way
fit in the picture of your son?

707
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:16,456
Yeah, it really didn't. I had no
deep, intellectual thoughts about it.

708
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,541
It's not that--
It's not deep, [chuckles] intellectual.

709
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,835
You have to be practically blind
to think that.

710
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,630
[Sampliner] I knew my dad
did think about my life.

711
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,049
It also seemed pretty clear to me
what he thought about it.

712
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:32,012
[James] If you don't have confidence
and you're beset by this internal turmoil,

713
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,765
then you can't get from A to B.

714
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:41,396
And so, the person that becomes
head of something or successful

715
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:46,026
has to have enough confidence
to move from milestone to milestone.

716
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,863
And therein lies
your frustration with David.

717
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,947
No, I didn't say that.

718
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,241
-It does not mean--
-But David didn't move A to B.

719
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,869
He moved A to here, to here,
to here, to get to B.

720
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,581
That's okay, but you have to have
the confidence to make the move.

721
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, so that's maybe not why
you were upset with David.

722
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,503
That's what your worry
or the concern was.

723
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:08,090
It was a concern that you had
the spine, the confidence,

724
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:11,969
whatever it took, to get to somewhere,
wherever that somewhere is.

725
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,513
So, what's so interesting is,

726
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,681
for me, A to B,

727
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,893
-that straight logical path is so easy.
-Right.

728
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,729
So, what you define
as the way to get there

729
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,899
and to have the determination
to get on top is the easy path,

730
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,025
-which I--
-Not necessarily.

731
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,443
-For me, it is. Which I chose--
-For you it is, but not for him.

732
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,320
So, I had a lot of respect
for David because

733
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,741
he took what I consider
a more difficult path to get to B.

734
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,201
As you see it as a potential weakness,

735
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,705
-or maybe a sense of indecision, or--
-No. No, no, no, no.

736
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,415
I see it as actually a strength to say,

737
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,960
"Well, maybe I wanna dabble here,
here and here before I get here,

738
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,379
because I'll get there a more full B."

739
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,094
[James] What kind of pancreatic disease
causes intra-abdominal hemorrhage?

740
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,304
What kind of--

741
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,557
[James] Pancreatic disease.

742
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,976
-Pancreatic pseudocyst.
-Yeah.

743
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,812
Could you then have done
a cholangiogram?

744
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,897
-[woman] We could've.
-What kind?

745
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,694
-What kind?
-[woman] What kind of cholangiogram?

746
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,154
Yeah, what kind of cholangiogram?

747
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,116
What percent of patients
with gallstone pancreatitis

748
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,619
have associated common duct stones?

749
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,079
[woman] I'm not entirely sure.
I don't know.

750
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,789
-10%.
-[woman] Okay.

751
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:26,293
I think you've overstepped
your bounds a little bit.

752
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,170
[Sampliner] I never considered
following my father

753
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:29,964
into the surgical profession.

754
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,383
None of my siblings
went into medicine either.

755
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,012
Maybe we were all too aware
of the toll it took.

756
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,558
[Sampliner] Dad coming home
and yelling a lot and being really angry

757
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,977
had a, I think,
big effect on me growing up.

758
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,937
What was that experience like
for you as a kid?

759
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,021
Do you remember?

760
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,691
I think I noticed it growing up,
but I don't--

761
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,276
For some reason,
it never really bothered--

762
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,364
I mean, it bothered me in the sense that,
you know, it wasn't always pleasant.

763
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,117
And who wants to live in
a household with screaming?

764
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,412
But it didn't bother me in the sense that
it made me want to run from the house.

765
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:11,797
My response to him is
the most basic part of my personality.

766
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:17,011
I think by not trying to
have the kind of anger

767
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,932
and irrational rage that he had,

768
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,227
I successfully was able to, you know,

769
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,189
figure a way to keep it from coming out.

770
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,359
So, I have very good mechanisms for...

771
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,154
holding all that stuff in.

772
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,992
But by making sure
I was not him in that sort of way,

773
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,495
I left myself really compromised
with the ability to kind of...

774
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:46,290
um, deal with those emotions.

775
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,002
'Cause I was just great
at putting a lid on 'em.

776
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,883
[dog barking]

777
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,846
[James] I'm the only person
in the neighborhood

778
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,015
that the dog barks at.

779
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,599
[James chuckling]

780
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,852
You love it, Dave?

781
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,689
[Sampliner] If being a man
was being my father...

782
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,024
then I wanted nothing to do with manhood.

783
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,446
If he was aggressive,
I would be unthreatening.

784
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,366
If he was domineering,
I would be accommodating.

785
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,618
If he was competitive...

786
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:27,081
I would be the least competitive person
anyone knew.

787
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,375
[Lauren] If you've denied
your father's greatness in any way,

788
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,378
it's stopping you from your ambition.

789
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,382
Because if you went and got ambitious,
and you went after making a lot of money,

790
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,302
and you would, therefore,
have to go after the discipline

791
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:43,305
and the arrogance to make it happen...

792
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,141
he'd be right.

793
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,687
Right? And so that's blasphemy,

794
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,606
given you've already committed
to the other side,

795
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,567
called, "Ugh, fuck you,
I'm not doing that. You're wrong."

796
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:00,155
We've all cut major things out
to spite them,

797
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,199
but it only spites us.

798
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,545
[Sampliner] So, Pops...

799
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,589
[James] Yes, sir.

800
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:19,424
[Sampliner] I wanted to tell you
what my film was about.

801
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,926
[James chuckles]

802
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,219
[Sampliner]
Haven't you been wondering?

803
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:27,099
Uh, I have no idea, Dave.
I just don't ask questions. You know me.

804
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:32,312
I'm just a loyal subject.
I'm going for an Oscar.

805
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:34,731
What's your film about?

806
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:39,444
Well, my film, I believe,
is really about the two of us.

807
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,821
[James] Yeah?

808
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:45,617
And how we bonded
over a Rose of Sharon? [chuckling]

809
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,037
[Sampliner] We're both going through
big moments of transition.

810
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,331
I am trying to come into my manhood.

811
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,168
[James] And I'm leaving it.
[chuckles]

812
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,669
Well, I wasn't gonna put it that way.

813
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:59,089
Well, it's not true, Dave.
Whatever you said, it's not true.

814
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,050
[Sampliner] So, tell me
what you think it's about, then.

815
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,217
Or what's happening with you?

816
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,302
[James] What's happening with me?

817
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,137
[Sampliner] Yeah.
What phase of life are you in?

818
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,014
[James] I'm in a good phase.

819
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,849
I'm in the phase of total pleasure

820
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:13,187
with no responsibility
except to myself and my family.

821
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,897
-It's great.
-[Sampliner] Yeah?

822
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,108
I don't worry about anything anymore.

823
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:24,156
And how do you see
your coming into a new era of life?

824
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,575
[Sampliner] I feel like becoming a father
is a pretty new era.

825
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,785
[James chuckling] That's right.
It's not only a pretty new era,

826
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,205
it's a pretty big change, isn't it?

827
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,789
[Sampliner] It's a huge change.

828
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,587
What was it like for you when
you made that step oh-so-many years ago?

829
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,675
Well, first of all, it was a surprise,
so that started things off.

830
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,385
[Sampliner] Yeah, you did it earlier
than you wanted to, right?

831
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,013
[James] Well, let's say
we hadn't planned on it.

832
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,264
-How's that?
-[Sampliner] Right.

833
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,725
So, how did it change your life?
When it happened?

834
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,936
It didn't change my life at all.
[chuckles] I just--

835
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,646
I was on every other night, regardless.

836
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,441
But you said you never changed a diaper,
so I guess maybe it-- [chuckles]

837
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:01,151
Well, I didn't like to do that,
that's why.

838
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,862
I could've, but I didn't.

839
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:07,241
I think it probably changed Mom's life
a lot more than it changed my life.

840
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,659
[Sampliner]
Well, do you feel like...

841
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,288
making those transitions
made you more of a man?

842
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,665
I never thought about it, Dave.
I really never did.

843
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,501
-[Sampliner] Yeah?
-We just--

844
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,045
In those days...

845
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,547
growing up the way I grew up,

846
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,842
with parents that said,

847
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:30,805
"You work and go to school,
and you do something."

848
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,018
I was, as they call today,
a straight arrow.

849
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,146
So I went from college
to medical school,

850
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,315
to internship, to residency, to practice.

851
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,400
And...

852
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:47,656
you know,
when you go into surgery as an intern,

853
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:52,536
when you're, what, 26 years old
or something like that...

854
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,205
and you start cutting on people,

855
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,791
you don't think about growing up
and being a man.

856
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,709
You just-- You're there.

857
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:04,464
You don't have much time
to intellectualize what happens.

858
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,091
You just do it.

859
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,016
[woman] I usually try to find
the front part of the pelvic bone, here,

860
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:19,396
and then I just kind of lay my palms
down on this fleshy muscle back here.

861
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,231
[Sampliner] I hoped fatherhood
would somehow

862
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,608
bring me closer to my father.

863
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,361
It would give us a common experience.

864
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,574
But it was also pretty clear how little
our experiences would have in common.

865
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,826
-It's, like, the hipbones are here.
-Yeah.

866
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,453
-So, it's like--
-Just pressing in...

867
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,870
-Yeah.
-...under the front hipbone, like that?

868
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,247
Yeah, but let's ask her.

869
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
Like that?

870
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,126
Does that feel like it's opening
the cervix or whatever?

871
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,544
I think you're just--
Can you ask her?

872
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:44,754
-How's that?
-[Rachel] That's good.

873
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,839
-Is that different?
-Yeah, it's different,

874
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,633
'cause she's pushing on the muscle,
not the bone itself.

875
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,718
Okay.

876
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,304
[Ian] No, I'm not sure
this is gonna happen.

877
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,430
-[woman] Yes, it is.
-[all laughing]

878
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,433
He's so big and it's so small.

879
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:59,853
[Sampliner] Ian and his wife
were taking the class, too,

880
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,106
since their son was due
just ahead of ours.

881
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,607
-[Ian] I don't like you anymore.
-Honey...

882
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,942
I love you. It's okay.

883
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,737
-I love you.
-The sex wasn't that good anyway.

884
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,989
[all laughing]

885
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,157
I hate your father.

886
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,660
He shouldn't have said that
at the wedding.

887
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,456
This is a mistake.

888
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,291
You're gonna be holding the baby soon.

889
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,459
-You're almost there.
-No, I'm not!

890
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,044
Yes, you are.

891
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,754
The baby's stuck!

892
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,847
Nat Sherman cigars.

893
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,142
The best.

894
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,353
[Sampliner] I came over to celebrate
the birth of Ian's son.

895
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,775
My son was almost here, too,
and I still felt like the same guy.

896
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,778
I wondered if it would take
becoming a father to change.

897
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,113
Shoot.

898
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,616
[Sampliner] Do you feel like
fatherhood changed you?

899
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,330
Hmm.

900
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,166
Yeah.

901
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,250
I'd say.

902
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:08,255
What we're dealing with as fathers,
as new parents...

903
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,549
is so much.

904
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,677
So much life. Joy.

905
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,263
Fear.

906
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,723
Frustration.

907
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,768
Pride.

908
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,149
And you can't deal with bullshit now,
'cause you're dealing with life.

909
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:32,737
And cigars, which never interested me
at all, at all, ever...

910
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,406
are now somewhat charming.

911
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,826
Better with the whiskey,
but somewhat charming.

912
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,581
[Sampliner] So, how do you think
you're different

913
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,583
than your dad in all this?

914
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:49,379
[Ian] My dad
was a firm believer in tough love.

915
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,678
And I'm a firm believer in...
love...

916
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:59,514
with, at times, a bit of toughness.

917
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,727
But that's a big difference, actually.
It's a big difference.

918
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:09,108
[Sampliner] All right, this baby
could come any minute now,

919
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,362
so I'm just curious
how do you think my life is gonna change?

920
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,614
Change implies
some sort of percentage, you know?

921
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:19,118
Is it 10% of more change
or 30% change or...

922
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,619
But I think essentially
what happens is

923
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,997
your current life ends
and you begin an entirely new life.

924
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,791
[woman] Do you, David,
take Rachel to be your wife?

925
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,876
[Sampliner] I do.

926
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,753
[woman] I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

927
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,381
Congratulations.
You may kiss the bride.

928
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,923
[cheering]

929
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,303
[Michael] A lot of those things that
you enjoy about your old life,

930
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:42,349
you kind of have to throw out
and start a whole new way of living.

931
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,975
[Sampliner]
You're not reassuring me, man.

932
00:51:44,058 --> 00:51:46,436
Well, that depends on
how much you liked your past life.

933
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,604
[laughing]

934
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,570
[Sampliner] Ah,
"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."

935
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,950
[Michael] Every psychological thing that
you haven't dealt with will rear itself

936
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,661
because of this child.

937
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:07,207
And therefore, it becomes
some of the most challenging time,

938
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,084
and, of course, then also potentially
the most rewarding time of your life,

939
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,047
because, um, you could...
you actually could grow as a person.

940
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,675
[Penny] Hello?
[Rachel] Hi.

941
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,759
Hi!

942
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:19,469
Guess what?

943
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,263
-What?
-You're a grandma.

944
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,015
Oh, my God!

945
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:26,726
[voice breaking]
He's so beautiful.

946
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,270
What's his name?

947
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,858
We're not 100% sure yet,
so you have to wait till tomorrow.

948
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,485
[Sampliner] Hmm.

949
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,570
[woman] They're there?

950
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,573
Yeah, we're just, uh...
we're just in love.

951
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,044
[Rachel] It's such a physical feeling,
isn't it? It's not mental.

952
00:52:53,127 --> 00:52:56,506
It's like your heart just goes, like...
[gasps]

953
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,801
[Sampliner]
Yeah, it's not in your brain.

954
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,766
Hello, buddy.

955
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,268
I'm your dad.

956
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,812
For better and for worse, I'm your pops.

957
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,022
Mmm-hmm.

958
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,071
-Hi, Rach.
-Hi!

959
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:23,408
-How are you? Congratulations.
-Good. Thank you.

960
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,535
Here's your seventh grandchild.

961
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,079
[James] Oh, my God. It's huge!

962
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:29,956
Hey, baby.

963
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,541
[whistling]

964
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,084
-[Rachel] There you go.
-Isn't that a beautiful baby?

965
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,961
-[Betsy] Isn't he a gorgeous baby?
-Oh, my God.

966
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:36,796
-[Rachel] That's your grandpa.
-Better look out, David.

967
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,090
He's gonna be chasing the chicks early.

968
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,092
[Sampliner] Hi, there.

969
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:42,636
-So, you guys having a good time?
-[Rachel] You wanna hold him?

970
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,554
[James] Well, sure, if I'm allowed to.
[Sampliner] Yeah.

971
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,640
[James] I never wanna
usurp mother's territory.

972
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,016
No. Ready?

973
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,142
[Betsy] Watch out for his neck.

974
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,352
I know how to do it, Betsy.

975
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,478
-I've been there.
-[Betsy] I bet you do.

976
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,230
Hi, there.

977
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,565
How are you?

978
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,694
Got a little smile for me?

979
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,156
[baby crying]

980
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,116
[Sampliner] Did you poop again?

981
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,078
Buddy, you are a poop machine.

982
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,165
Okay. All right, my man.

983
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,795
-[baby crying]
-Could we get you to sleep a little bit?

984
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,212
Is that what you need?

985
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,007
Oh. [chuckles]

986
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,635
Is that a "no"?

987
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,680
Pacifier.

988
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,265
[crying stops]

989
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,684
[Sampliner] Oh.

990
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,604
Okay, love, okay.

991
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,276
Can I sing you a little song?
Can I sing you a little song?

992
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,403
Okay.

993
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:45,324
[singing] ♪ The house of the angels
was full today ♪

994
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:50,370
♪ But they made room for one more,
anyway ♪

995
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,289

996

♪ Gabriel ♪

997

♪ Gabriel ♪

998
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,757
[cooing]

999
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,802
[Sampliner] I never really doubted that
I could handle this part of fatherhood.

1000
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,055
Wow, you're doing great, buddy.
You wanna come to Daddy?

1001
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:12,559
In the early months,
being a softie was the job description.

1002
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,229
Yeah, buddy, yeah.
You're doing great.

1003
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,941
But eventually, I felt like
I would need to be more than a nurturer

1004
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:21,735
to be his father.

1005
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,194
[crying]

1006
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,864
[Sampliner] Oh.

1007
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,161
[Rachel] So, babe, are you saying that
you don't wanna have a second kid?

1008
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,163
Is that what you're saying?

1009
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,875
[Sampliner] I'm not saying
I don't wanna have a second kid.

1010
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:41,421
I'm saying that I don't think I can play
the same role with the second child

1011
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,423
that I play with Gabriel.

1012
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,717
Do you wanna have a second child?

1013
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,761
[Rachel] I think I do.

1014
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,474
I thought about how it's gonna
put strain on our relationship, maybe,

1015
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:56,144
and the balance that
we've been able to strike, and my career.

1016
00:55:56,227 --> 00:56:00,524
But when I think about
the long-term spectrum of my life,

1017
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:05,236
I feel like I would much more regret
not having another child than I would,

1018
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:07,406
like, "Oh, I didn't edit this film."

1019
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,198
[Sampliner] But I thought
you were so conflicted about it.

1020
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,534
I thought you really were worried.

1021
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,703
You're not quite established
in your career as you wanna be.

1022
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,290
And if you have another child, you're
gonna just have to further postpone that.

1023
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,751
Well, you know, the thing
that makes me worried about that

1024
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,836
is more the way that you talk about it.

1025
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,379
You know...

1026
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,675
"I'm not gonna be there
in the way that I was with Gabriel."

1027
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,635
So you, kind of,
put it all on my shoulders.

1028
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,513
[Sampliner] But I feel like
you have the same dilemma I have.

1029
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,764
I have the same dilemma.

1030
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:38,186
For me, I guess, my priorities are about
having the family that I wanna have.

1031
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,979
When I really look in my heart,

1032
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,941
I just feel like
that comes to the surface more.

1033
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,401
[Sampliner] I'm afraid that
having a second child

1034
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,030
will somehow prevent me from
getting where I want to go in my career,

1035
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:50,740
since I'm not where I wanna be yet.

1036
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,118
Well, that's what I--
Why aren't you there already?

1037
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,287
You know, what's prevented you so far?

1038
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,039
I feel like that's an excuse,

1039
00:56:58,122 --> 00:57:00,750
to say that
another child will prevent you,

1040
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,128
'cause you're 41.

1041
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,548
Why haven't you gotten there already?

1042
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,386
[Ian] One of the lessons I've learnt,
being a man now without a father,

1043
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,556
is that I'm the father now.

1044
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,727
There's nobody to look to
to find out if I'm right or if I'm wrong.

1045
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,481
And that brings
a lot of power to your life.

1046
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,068
Before, when my dad was still with us,
I was always looking.

1047
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:30,614
"Who am I in relationship to him?

1048
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,866
Am I making him proud?"

1049
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,244
And... I'm cool with him,
he's cool with me.

1050
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,121
And I'm playing my own game.

1051
00:57:39,413 --> 00:57:43,042
Everything in life is about
making your own way.

1052
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,130
That's what it's about.

1053
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,468
And if you can,
then it changes everything, if you can.

1054
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:56,389
It changes your dynamic with your spouse.
It changes your dynamic at work.

1055
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,224
It changes everything,

1056
00:57:58,307 --> 00:58:00,852
if you're not looking
outside of yourself for approval.

1057
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:06,232
I miss my father very much.
I love my father very much.

1058
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,317
And we're unveiling his tombstone
on Sunday.

1059
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:11,821
But there's a positive as well
to losing a parent.

1060
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:15,074
Especially if you can make the peace,
as I did with my dad.

1061
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,952
'Cause there was peace that needed
to be made, and it was made.

1062
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:22,541
Now in regards to your dad, you know...
this is what I would say, like...

1063
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:26,335
make sure your last memories of him
are clean.

1064
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,587
'Cause it'll help a lot.

1065
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,339
Because I have to think back to stuff

1066
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,051
that is troublesome
between my father and myself.

1067
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,595
Because that's not what's directly here.

1068
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,680
What's directly here is

1069
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,807
the last four months
of our lives together.

1070
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,519
He looked at me in the last couple of days
of his life and he said,

1071
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,437
"Of all three of my sons,

1072
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,065
you could have been the biggest screw-up
and you're not."

1073
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:50,484
And that was kind of a big moment...
because now...

1074
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,198
I'm not... to him.

1075
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,659
[Sampliner] It's interesting,
you got your father's blessing

1076
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,411
and I'm not sure I've gotten mine.

1077
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:01,955
I don't know that I will.

1078
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,164
[chuckles]

1079
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,334
Get it.

1080
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,504
[Sampliner] All right, take me there, Dad.
Let's go.

1081
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,049
Here, why don't we just
put the umbrella down? Seriously.

1082
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,258
Take it with-- I need it.

1083
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,971
You don't need it. It's hardly raining.
It's in the way.

1084
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,222
[Sampliner] All right.

1085
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,644
If this equipment stops working
'cause of the rain,

1086
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,770
you know who's gonna get blamed.

1087
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,438
[James] Yeah, you.

1088
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,859
You picked a bad day.

1089
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,820
So how often do you go out here, Dad?

1090
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:34,988
[James] Twice a year.

1091
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,530
[Sampliner] Yeah?
[James] Yeah.

1092
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,282
And how come?

1093
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,661
To make sure the stones are intact
and everything's kept up,

1094
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,039
and respect for my deceased parents.

1095
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,124
Yeah?

1096
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,751
And tell me what you do out here
when you're out here.

1097
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,544
I drive by and make sure everything's okay
and I leave.

1098
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,381
-You never get out of your car?
-No.

1099
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,510
It's an honor that you give
to your parents if you're able to,

1100
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,803
and I'm still able to.

1101
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,975
And probably an honor
no one will give to me.

1102
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,645
-You don't think we'll show up?
-I doubt it.

1103
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,815
Maybe for the event...
[chuckling] but not thereafter.

1104
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,652
[Sampliner]
What did you respect about him?

1105
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,656
[James] He was hardworking,
he was dedicated to his profession

1106
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,325
and dedicated to
seeing his children succeed.

1107
01:00:22,326 --> 01:00:24,704
[Sampliner]
Did you feel close to your dad?

1108
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,039
No.

1109
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,541
He was a difficult person
to get close to.

1110
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,670
-In what way?
-Every way. He was cold.

1111
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,088
He was rigid.

1112
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,258
At times, he was nasty...

1113
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,721
to his wife and to his children.

1114
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,183
[Sampliner] Do you feel like
you held grudges against him

1115
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,935
the way I've held grudges against you?

1116
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,853
[James] No, I don't hold grudges
like you do.

1117
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,438
Are you saying
you hold a grudge against me?

1118
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,273
I didn't say that.

1119
01:00:52,356 --> 01:00:54,818
-You implied it.
-No, I didn't imply that.

1120
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,946
I said if I was a grudge-holder, I could.
[chuckles]

1121
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,826
[Sampliner] So if you could hold a grudge
against me, what would it be?

1122
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,286
[James] 'Cause you're
so tough on me, baby.

1123
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,211
[Sampliner] I've always thought of Dad
as the classic macho man.

1124
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,005
Is that how you view him,
or do you see him differently than that?

1125
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:21,094
I think that's very definitely the way
he saw himself for a very long time.

1126
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,637
But during his retirement years,

1127
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:27,350
I think that he has become
a very different person.

1128
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:30,812
He wouldn't recognize it, but I think
he's changed his vision of himself

1129
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:35,149
because he's much more of a helpmate now
than he ever saw himself as being.

1130
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,526
You think he's less
the macho man than he was?

1131
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,278
No.

1132
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,198
No, I think that it's the role
around the house that's changed.

1133
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,158
I don't think
he's less the macho man at all.

1134
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,245
No, I think that part of him
is still very much the same.

1135
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,832
What quality of his
attracted you to him the most?

1136
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:54,335
Tremendous inner vitality
and a zest for life.

1137
01:01:55,669 --> 01:01:58,965
He's just a very, very fun person
to be with and I--

1138
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,592
That struck me from
the very first day I met him,

1139
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:04,345
and it has continued through to today.

1140
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:07,807
And I often joke that if he ever grew up,
I'd leave him.

1141
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:13,437
I see a very different person than
he shows to the rest of the world.

1142
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,106
[Sampliner] What do you see that
we don't get to see?

1143
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:18,276
The inner vulnerable side of him
that he doesn't ever show to the world.

1144
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,986
He's very open with me.

1145
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,698
And I've always said that I think
I know him better than he knows himself.

1146
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,494
-Hop on, baby girl.
-Getting on.

1147
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:30,121
"Getting on."

1148
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,289
All set.

1149
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,706
-You ready?
-All ready.

1150
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,542
-We're off.
-We're off.

1151
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,171
Here we go.

1152
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,609
[Sampliner] With Dad, I see him as
somebody whose close friend is you

1153
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:05,114
and I don't see him spending time
with anybody else, really, alone.

1154
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,159
[Betsy] I think it's very interesting that
you should point that out.

1155
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:11,120
I know he would really, really love

1156
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:15,374
to have the kind of friendship
that women have.

1157
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,544
Just get together with people
he really enjoys and talking to them.

1158
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:22,631
But it's not really that open to him.

1159
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:23,925
And I think it's a shame.

1160
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,634
'Cause I know
he would really, really love it.

1161
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,095
[Sampliner] Why do you say
it's not open to Dad?

1162
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,807
Because that's just not what guys do.

1163
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,143
[Sampliner] But you say it as if
Dad couldn't decide to call someone up

1164
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,269
and say, "Hey,
let's go have coffee."

1165
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,231
You know what, the point is he has,
and the thing is that--

1166
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,859
And then they had a nice time,
but then it's not reciprocated.

1167
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,152
-[Sampliner] Mmm-hmm.
-Because the people that he really enjoys,

1168
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,447
that he enjoys
just having lunch with or talking to

1169
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,533
are the same guys that are still jocks,

1170
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:53,371
and they have their friendships
by doing something.

1171
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,289
I never would've guessed that

1172
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,458
that was something
Dad really wishes he had, even--

1173
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,211
Absolutely.
And I think he's very much...

1174
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,255
He would be a great friend.

1175
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,008
And I just think it's just a real shame
that he doesn't have it.

1176
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,926
And I know he misses it.

1177
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,930
[Sampliner] I had an easier time relating
to this guy my mom was describing...

1178
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,515
the guy who had feelings.

1179
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,810
But that wasn't the man that
I remember growing up with.

1180
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,981
[Sampliner] One big thing I remember about
growing up in the household

1181
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,150
that was hard for me was...

1182
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,110
your anger.

1183
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,863
There was just a lot of yelling
in the household.

1184
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,449
And as a kid, I didn't understand

1185
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,743
what it meant, where it came from,
what it was about.

1186
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:35,746
And so I wanted to understand that better.

1187
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:38,666
I can't help you with it
'cause I don't remember it.

1188
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:42,086
And I'm not doing that as a cop out,
I just don't.

1189
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,005
It may have existed.

1190
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,756
It may have existed dominantly
in your life.

1191
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,093
It clearly did because
you reflect on it frequently.

1192
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,637
But I, honestly...

1193
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,764
If you said to me,
"What would you have done differently?"

1194
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:58,311
I don't know because I don't remember...

1195
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:02,148
not only specifics,
I don't even remember the gross picture.

1196
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,609
Why that is, I have absolutely no idea.

1197
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,948
I remember very happy times.

1198
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,077
I don't remember bad times.

1199
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,706
I'm sure they had to exist...
especially in your mind.

1200
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,708
[Sampliner] Sometimes
when I think about it, I go,

1201
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:23,544
"Well, Dad seemed like
he brought all this anger home.

1202
01:05:23,627 --> 01:05:26,047
Maybe it came from
being at a very intense job."

1203
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,007
I would tell you that,

1204
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:32,303
if I were playing Major League Baseball

1205
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:37,225
and I hit .350 for my career,
I would be in the Hall of Fame.

1206
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,728
And in my profession,
if I hit .350, I'd be in jail.

1207
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,897
It's a profession, by choice,

1208
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,401
where you had to be
as close to perfect as you could be.

1209
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,029
And that was my work.

1210
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,200
And if I were truth,

1211
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,327
I'm sure I carried some of that home
at some times

1212
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,539
because... there was no way to escape it.

1213
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,420
I didn't like the sound
of my dad being out loud.

1214
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,505
[man] Okay.

1215
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,507
And, uh... but I think...

1216
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,636
I let my dislike of that rule me.

1217
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:17,348
[Sampliner] Ever since getting initiated
during the Warrior weekend in the woods,

1218
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,933
I met with my men's group
every other week.

1219
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:24,813
We practiced
what you might call unlicensed therapy.

1220
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:28,359
[man 1] And we're going to use drama.
This is our stage for the night.

1221
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,819
This is your space to live out

1222
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:35,699
whatever part of your story
you'd like to... and are called to.

1223
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,951
Would you show Will
how to hold the energy?

1224
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,287
So I can see what Dad looks like.

1225
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,746
-Can you do it?
-Yeah.

1226
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:42,623
[man 2] What did Dad sound like?

1227
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:45,168
The energy's just like this blind rage.

1228
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,544
-Yes.
-Yeah, playing the blame game.

1229
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:47,628
[man 3] Channel it.

1230
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,589
-This is your time. This is your space.
-Yeah.

1231
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,965
-Close your eyes.
-Yeah.

1232
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,259
[man 3] This is your space, man.

1233
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,802
And take a deep breath.

1234
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:55,928
[inhales deeply]

1235
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,513
May I touch you?

1236
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:59,765
Breathe right here.
Breathe right down to there.

1237
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:02,185
-Breathe it. Take it in.
-Yeah.

1238
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,313
-Yeah.
-One more. Just one more.

1239
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,857
One more. Right there.

1240
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,112
Give him the message,
with your eyes closed.

1241
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,281
-Just give him the message.
-God damn it!

1242
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,325
-[man 2] Go ahead.
-God damn it!

1243
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,492
[man 3] That's it. That's the message.

1244
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,786
[shouting] God damn it!

1245
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:22,288
God damn it!

1246
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,085
-[man 2] Yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

1247
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,545
Okay, when you're ready,

1248
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:33,341
I'd like you to come out here
and switch and just watch this play.

1249
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,844
Good job, David.
Stay with it.

1250
01:07:37,761 --> 01:07:40,098
Now, let me see.
All right, yeah.

1251
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,724
Okay, yeah, so "God damn it,"

1252
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:45,686
and then respond with
your line of, "I've got to please."

1253
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,855
-Yeah, "I'm here to please you."
-Yeah.

1254
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,691
-"I want you to be happy."
-Mmm-hmm.

1255
01:07:50,774 --> 01:07:53,152
And go ahead, play.

1256
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:57,030
[yelling] God damn it! Damn it!
God damn it!

1257
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,576
[man 3] I'm here for you and not me.

1258
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,036
God damn it!

1259
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,789
-[man 3] I'm here for--
-Okay, freeze. Freeze.

1260
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,416
-Is this accurate?
-Mmm-hmm.

1261
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,834
It is, okay.

1262
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:11,212
And you walked in as a man right now

1263
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,714
into this living room
and you saw this going down,

1264
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:16,384
what would you want to do
if this was somebody else?

1265
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,762
Yeah, I'd want somebody to say, "Stop."

1266
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:23,849
[man 1] So this is your chance as a man
to come into the scene

1267
01:08:23,932 --> 01:08:26,185
and put it right.

1268
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,021
God damn it!

1269
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,481
I want to make you feel good.

1270
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,982
God damn it!

1271
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,694
-I'm here with you.
-God damn it!

1272
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,365
-God damn it!
-I'm your son.

1273
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,951
-I'm your son.
-God damn it!

1274
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,290
God damn it!

1275
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:50,000
Stop yelling.
I'm your son.

1276
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,253
God damn it!

1277
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,337
[man 4] I'm afraid.

1278
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,674
-Stop yelling. I'm your son.
-God damn it!

1279
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:04,140
-Stop yelling. I'm your son!
-God damn it! God damn it!

1280
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:08,311
Stop yelling! I'm your son!

1281
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,563
-God damn it!
-[sobbing]

1282
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,107
[sniffling]

1283
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,570
God damn it!

1284
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,535
God damn it!

1285
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:30,123
-Stop yelling. I'm your son.
-God damn it!

1286
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,753
[grunts] God damn it!

1287
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,716
-Stop yelling. I'm your son.
-God damn it!

1288
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,345
God damn it!

1289
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,807
[inaudible]

1290
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,776
Did you have a good sleep?
Did you have a good sleep?

1291
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:05,743
[inaudible]

1292
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,472
-So I wrote this letter to my dad.
-[Lauren] Yeah.

1293
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,806
[Sampliner] So here it is.

1294
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,559
Excellent. Oh, it's long.

1295
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,187
[Sampliner] Can you just tell me
what it's gonna do?

1296
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,275
It has less to do with your father

1297
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:41,153
than it does to do with you
growing yourself up.

1298
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,488
You finally can grow up and go,

1299
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:47,034
"Oh, Dad, sorry about this, this and this,

1300
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,744
and I never asked you about that."

1301
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:52,205
That's you being a great man, right?

1302
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,500
You don't know how it will feel.

1303
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,380
And trust me, you're assuming
your dad is gonna stick it to you.

1304
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,340
-Right, if you tell--
-I'm worried he'll stick it to me

1305
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,385
and he won't want to take responsibility
for his part of it,

1306
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,011
-and I think that's the part that I feel--
-Okay.

1307
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:08,847
But isn't that the very thing
you're doing? Right?

1308
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,643
I'm having you stick it to yourself
and take full responsibility for yourself,

1309
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,771
and you're like,
"But if I do that, will he?"

1310
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,191
And then the question is,
"Why do you care?"

1311
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:25,155
Like, "Oh, I'm not gonna do it on my end
because he might not do it on his"?

1312
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:27,950
Why don't you--
What normally happens in a relationship is

1313
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,911
if you take responsibility for something
and you really see it,

1314
01:11:30,994 --> 01:11:32,621
it actually creates...

1315
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:37,335
the space for the other person
to do the exact same thing.

1316
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,015
[Sampliner] "Dear Dad...

1317
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,394
I've never written a letter
like this before.

1318
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,355
I have never taken responsibility..."

1319
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,482
[James] "for my part in our relationship.

1320
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,777
I've only blamed you for
the ways you treated me."

1321
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:07,948
Continue?

1322
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,043
[Sampliner] "I'm writing you this
because I want to be able to

1323
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,171
lay down the baggage
[voice breaking] I carry from our past.

1324
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:32,222
I also want to move forward in my life
in ways I haven't yet allowed myself to.

1325
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,602
And I believe that part of
what holds me back

1326
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,730
is all the things
I hold onto about the past."

1327
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,067
[James] "I take responsibility for how

1328
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:47,279
not telling you my feelings
has diminished our relationship

1329
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,658
and prevented me from
feeling close to you."

1330
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:52,868
[Sampliner] "Rather than
share with you my feelings,

1331
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,580
I kept them to myself,
blamed you and judged you.

1332
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,961
I have blamed you for
the parts of myself I don't like...

1333
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,424
the person who is scared to take risks...

1334
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:10,803
the person who abandons things
before they are finished."

1335
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,054
[sniffles]

1336
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:17,309
[voice breaking]
"I have blamed you--"

1337
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,436
Ah... [sniffles]

1338
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,897
"I have blamed you for not achieving
the things I've wanted to achieve

1339
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,692
and not having the things
I've wanted to have in my life.

1340
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:30,406
I have blamed you for my own failure
to have the courage to be myself."

1341
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,993
[Sampliner sighs]

1342
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,370
"This letter is the beginning

1343
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:41,959
of what I mean by wanting to have
an honest and real relationship with you.

1344
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:45,671
I don't believe that
it's too late or beyond our reach.

1345
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,673
Can we start now?

1346
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:52,052
I love you, Dad."

1347
01:13:58,476 --> 01:13:59,643
[clears throat]

1348
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,814
[James] That's a beautiful letter.

1349
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:17,160
[Sampliner] I want you to tell me
what it was like

1350
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,746
having me read the letter to you?

1351
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:23,208
It felt like
David was finally coming home.

1352
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,720
[Sampliner] So what does that mean to you?

1353
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,347
It means everything.

1354
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,606
If I made mistakes, I'm sorry for them.

1355
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,818
What do I want from you?

1356
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,407
And all I can say is just be you.

1357
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,767
[trainer] One more, one more.

1358
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,479
Seven. Nice!
Stay back. Keep that tight.

1359
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,357
[Sampliner] I recently started
a new exercise routine.

1360
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,071
I go to this gym
where the guy factor is fairly high.

1361
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,698
But I don't feel entirely out of place.

1362
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,117
[trainer] Go, go, go and time.
Next station, guys, come on.

1363
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,370
I started going because of Gabriel.

1364
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:45,207
He'd learned about Mount Everest...

1365
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,293
and I promised him we'd hike up
to base camp together one day.

1366
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,966
I realized that we'd have to
probably wait until he was 18,

1367
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,343
which meant I would be almost 60.

1368
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:01,473
At 43, it doesn't seem
too early to start training.

1369
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,933
[groaning]

1370
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,560
[Rachel] So, Mommy and Daddy
want to tell you something.

1371
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,978
What?

1372
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:10,232
Well, in a few months,
right after your birthday,

1373
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:15,445
you are gonna have
a baby brother or a baby sister.

1374
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,034
[gasps] Oh, yeah.

1375
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,870
-Yeah.
-[Rachel laughs]

1376
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:23,954
[Rachel] Do you know what that means?

1377
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,288
[Gabriel] What?

1378
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:29,793
[Rachel] We're gonna have another baby
in our family.

1379
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,087
Why?

1380
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,882
[Sampliner] I look at my son
and I try to imagine

1381
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,258
the man he's going to be.

1382
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,218
[Sampliner] You know what you can do is,
go in front of the camera

1383
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,470
and I'll turn this towards you,
so you can see yourself.

1384
01:16:40,553 --> 01:16:42,347
-Okay.
-Okay.

1385
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:44,600
See?

1386
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,809
[laughing excitedly]

1387
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,394
Yeah. That's you.

1388
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,312
[Sampliner] Sometimes I feel like
I get glimpses.

1389
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,273
[Gabriel] Now I want to film you.

1390
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:52,357
[Sampliner] Let's see.

1391
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,860
Daddy will go right here.

1392
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,361
Whoa. Oh.

1393
01:16:56,444 --> 01:17:01,574
[Gabriel] But I would really like you
to sit right on my bed.

1394
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:05,788
All right, you have to turn the camera
so it faces me on the bed.

1395
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,874
-You got me?
-Yeah, I got you.

1396
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,376
You got me, bud.
That's great.

1397
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:13,503
-You know what I'm gonna do?
-What?

1398
01:17:13,586 --> 01:17:16,006
I'm gonna film you filming me.

1399
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,466
-Ready?
-But you--

1400
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,011
[Sampliner] In some ways,
he'll be like me.

1401
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,638
You might have to, um...

1402
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,181
[Sampliner] And in some ways, he won't.

1403
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,141
-...put that away.
-[Sampliner] Okay.

1404
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,434
Put that away so you can...

1405
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:30,562
[Sampliner] Both things are okay with me.

1406
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,480
-Can you talk into this?
-[tapping mic]

1407
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,232
-Want me to talk into that?
-Yeah.

1408
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,401
Sure. I love Gabriel.

1409
01:17:36,484 --> 01:17:38,696
And can you say something else?

1410
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,823
I am...

1411
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:43,325
very proud of Gabriel

1412
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:46,870
because this is the first time
he's filming me with my camera.

1413
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:50,290
Don't talk anymore.
If you talk anymore...

1414
01:17:50,373 --> 01:17:51,875
-Yeah.
-...it'll break.

1415
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,294
-If I talk anymore, the camera will break?
-Yeah, so--

1416
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:56,421
That might be true.

1417
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,895
[Gabriel] Oh, he's looking at me.
[Sampliner] Gabriel is excited. I know.

1418
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,605
Mommy, he's looking at me.

1419
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,234
He's looking at you.
He is totally looking at you.

1420
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,027
[Gabriel] I think he needs
a diaper change.

1421
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,445
[Rachel] You think so?

1422
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:22,698
-Okay.
-[James] You want to change it?

1423
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,658
I don't know how to change diapers.

1424
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:26,994
[all laughing]

1425
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:29,537
[Betsy] You know what?

1426
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:31,289
I've heard that from a lot of men.

1427
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,000
[all laughing]
