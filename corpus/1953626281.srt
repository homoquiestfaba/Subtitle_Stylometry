1
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,639
<i>I know that you've heard</i>

2
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,208
<i>This old song sung before</i>

3
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,111
<i>But you ain't heard it while
you was walking out the door</i>

4
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,782
<i>It's good-bye, baby</i>

5
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,285
<i>Honey, your time has come</i>

6
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,388
<i>Turn the tables now
and you're the one on the bum</i>

7
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,425
<i>It's la, la, la</i>

8
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,961
<i>I'm singing la, la, la</i>

9
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,730
<i>I'm so happy,
got me singing la, la, la...</i>

10
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,232
Need to get the Santa out of here.

11
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,366
Why come?

12
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,901
Number one, it's spring.
It's not winter.

13
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,837
- Spring.
- So?

14
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,972
Secondly,

15
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,241
you don't even work here.

16
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,777
When are you gonna stop
putting all your shit all around

17
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,545
all over the place?

18
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,781
- Third...
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,783
...Santa Claus ain't even
of African descent.

20
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,751
Oh, yeah, that's it there.

21
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,653
I was waiting for that.

22
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,890
You do realize Santa Claus
ain't even a real person.

23
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:08,494
You can make him
whatever color you want to.

24
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,996
No. Charlie Brown ain't real.

25
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,532
Charlie Brown real?

26
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,601
Well, hell, no.

27
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,436
Well, you ain't gonna draw a
picture

28
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:20,539
of a little black kid,
round head,

29
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,675
curly-squiggly hair

30
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,178
and call him a "Peanuts" comic.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,913
Well, you could if you wanted
to.

32
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,815
Well, you could physically,
but you can't.

33
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,517
Yes, you could.

34
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,421
All right, fine.
You could.

35
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,190
But you gotta get rid
of the damn Santa.

36
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,925
And I got news for you, too.

37
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,928
If some black man came down my
chimney wearing a red jogging suit,

38
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,463
I'd blow a hole
right through his red hat.

39
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,165
How's that...

40
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,638
What?

41
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,009
Oh, no, no.
No, no, man.

42
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,711
I just need a loan on my
shotgun.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,015
Well... honest.

44
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,685
What... what's wrong with you
kids?

45
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,155
Coming into a man place of business
pointing a shotgun at people.

46
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,392
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cause no fuss.

47
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,096
You know the pawn shop business
is a dangerous game.

48
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,364
Damn right.

49
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,633
My brother, he move out West,
opened a pawn shop.

50
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,835
- Found him in the basement, dead.
- I remember that.

51
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,304
Oh, yeah?
What happened to him?

52
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,639
I'd rather not talk about it.

53
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,107
You're lucky...

54
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,211
I didn't blow a hole
through your head.

55
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,615
Well, how was you gonna do that
with your hands up in the air?

56
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,919
Shut up.

57
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,356
Give me the gun.

58
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,364
Well, I'll give you 20.

59
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,399
Oh, come on, now.
Come on.

60
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,803
50.

61
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,772
No.

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,142
- 40.
- No.

63
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,313
- 30?
- Nope.

64
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,048
25.

65
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,120
- No.
- Come on, man. Shit.

66
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,690
Well, all right.

67
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,329
Hey.

68
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,600
Whoo!

69
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,669
Hey, man, is Vern there yet?

70
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,004
No, he late.

71
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,940
Hey, where you at, man?

72
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,275
Don't worry,
I'll be there in a minute.

73
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,977
You just keep his ass there,
huh?

74
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,915
'Cause I've been up for three
days since we smoked that shit

75
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,151
and I'm beginning
to hallucinate, man.

76
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,953
Ah! God!

77
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,089
On my way here,

78
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,359
when I was driving in,
I saw the King, man.

79
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,362
I swear I saw Elvis
walking through town square.

80
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:36,268
I can't be robbing no people
when I'm fucked up like this, man.

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,004
Hey.

82
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,541
Quit being a pussy. I'll be
there in a minute, all right?

83
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,713
You just keep Vernon there
'cause I'm gonna fuck his ass up.

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,720
Shit!

85
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,906
Jesus Christ, man.
Thank God, man.

86
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,208
Where the hell have you been?

87
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,710
Oh, I had to pawn my shotgun
to get gas money.

88
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,247
Man, how the hell we gonna
rob Stanley without a shotgun?

89
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,883
- Well, how was I supposed to get here?
- You stupid fuck!

90
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,419
How was I supposed
to get here without gas?

91
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,088
I would've come
and picked you up, dumbass.

92
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,759
Listen, don't you think this whole
robbing Stanley thing is stupid anyway?

93
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,261
And why the fuck we gotta meet
out in this field?

94
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,430
You are so fucking stupid, man.

95
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,766
'Cause it's top secret shit,
that's why!

96
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,340
So fields is the place
for top secret meetings, huh?

97
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,078
Why are you so damn worried
about the gun anyhow?

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,913
There's three of us
and only one of him.

99
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,581
We just go in there,
we beat him down,

100
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,116
we take the meth,
we get out of there.

101
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,185
- It's easy.
- You're so stupid, man.

102
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,388
- What? - The guy is
a fucking geeked-out,

103
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,459
hillbilly, drug-cooking,
dumb shit.

104
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,028
You don't think he has
a fucking arsenal of weapons

105
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,797
laying around his fucking house?

106
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,466
You don't think he ain't got his
head out the window every five minutes

107
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,601
peeking 'round to see
what the fuck's going on?

108
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,504
You know this shit
fucking makes you paranoid, man.

109
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,376
Speaking of dope, man,
you got any on you?

110
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,811
Hell, no.

111
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,214
That dickhead at the pawn shop
only gave me 20 on the gun.

112
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,116
So I only got enough for gas...

113
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,887
What the fuck, man?!

114
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,956
Shit!

115
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,401
What the fuck, man?

116
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,770
That son of a bitch stole $80
out of my sock drawer.

117
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,072
- No, he didn't.
- Bullshit!

118
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,007
Randy, he didn't fucking take
shit.

119
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,710
- Vern didn't steal anything, man.
- How the fuck do you know?

120
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,680
Because he just pawned
the goddamn shotgun

121
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,749
so he could put some fucking gas
in his car, man.

122
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,518
And he didn't have no meth,
either.

123
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
So clearly,
he ain't got no extra cash.

124
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,523
Huh.

125
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,091
Well, shit.

126
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,294
Wait,

127
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,863
he pawned the shotgun?

128
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,664
How the fuck are we supposed
to rob Stanley?

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,934
I don't know, Randy.

130
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,704
Fuck, man, why you gotta go
and run Vernon over?

131
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,274
I mean, shit, what makes you think
he stole it in the first place?

132
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,176
Lamar told me he took it.

133
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,677
- Oh, Lamar did.
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,012
You mean the crackhead?

135
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,181
You mean that lying,
fucking cheating thief?

136
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,282
That Lamar?

137
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,618
You stupid fuck!
He gets his hair cut at Cook's!

138
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,621
- He said he seen Vernon take it.
- That don't mean shit, man!

139
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,190
I mean, Jesus Christ!
You fucking...

140
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,627
you ran fucking
Vernors ass over, man.

141
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,096
You could've
fucking asked him first.

142
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,898
What the fuck?

143
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,733
Instead you trust
some dude's word

144
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,968
with the name
of fucking "stinky nuts. "

145
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,737
Made sense at the time, all
right?

146
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,409
Man, we gotta do something.

147
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,612
We gotta take him
to a hospital or something.

148
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,915
This gurgling shit,
this ain't normal, man.

149
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,383
I ain't taking his ass nowhere
and getting locked up.

150
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,620
- Well, we can't just leave him here.
- Move.

151
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,857
See? He's fine.

152
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,525
Let's go get my money from
Lamar.

153
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,861
Good afternoon.
I'm Connie Swanson.

154
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,031
And I'm here with a man
who helps save lives by day

155
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,100
and is the King by night.

156
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,671
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski.

157
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:36,007
He's a volunteer emergency
medical service technician by day

158
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,410
and, as you can probably guess,

159
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,613
does Elvis tribute shows by
night.

160
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,583
- That's right. I'm Ricky Baldoski.
- Yes.

161
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,586
Tell us who some of your
big influences are, Ricky.

162
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,620
Well, definitely.

163
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,022
The King, um, King,
and the King.

164
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,191
- KKK all the way.
- You can catch Ricky...

165
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,426
- Wait, no...
... this weekend

166
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,929
performing his tribute
performance to the King.

167
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,899
God bless America!

168
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,534
...Irwin County Fair.

169
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,935
Back to you, Michael.

170
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,537
Lamar!

171
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,039
You lying bastard.

172
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,609
Vern didn't steal my money,
you did.

173
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,477
No, I didn't.

174
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,845
Bullshit.

175
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,780
I know it was you 'cause
it sure as hell wasrt Vernon

176
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,382
and you're the one who lied.

177
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,551
Oh.
Oh, man.

178
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,086
I guess it was me, man.

179
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,120
What the...

180
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,955
I fucking knew it.

181
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,224
You give me my money,
you lying piece of shit.

182
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,627
- I don't have it.
- What?

183
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,961
Where is it? Where is it?

184
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,163
It's in the air, man.
I smoked it up.

185
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,700
$80 since this morning?
What the fuck?!

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,871
We gonna kick your ass, Lamar.

187
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,840
We gonna fuck you up good.

188
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:45,176
'Cause of you,
old Vern got killed.

189
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,512
And that shit ain't cool, man.

190
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,813
There's getting high

191
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,149
and there's getting a brother
fucking ran over!

192
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,085
God damn it, bro!
Kick his ass!

193
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,888
I oughta kick
your fucking ass, Lamar.

194
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,657
Randy, don't, man.

195
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,958
You got a gun, huh?

196
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,092
- Huh?
- No.

197
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,962
- We need a gun.
- Hey, hey, we could ask Don.

198
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,730
Don will have a gun.

199
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,033
Yeah.

200
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,736
We gonna go get the gun and we
gonna come back and shoot you.

201
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,140
- Right?
- Don't you steal shit while I'm gone.

202
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,541
Okay?

203
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,942
Okay.

204
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,783
Is that my Styx CD in your
pants?

205
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,486
- Huh?
- God damn it. Yeah.

206
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,655
Fuck, Lamar!

207
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,857
Put it back, Lamar.

208
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,893
- I ain't fucking around.
- Sorry, man, it was right here.

209
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,594
I was warming it.

210
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,563
It's your fucking ass now.

211
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,298
You're fucking dead, Lamar.

212
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,601
Kick his fucking ass, Randy.

213
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:44,836
What the fuck?

214
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,237
What, you ain't gonna kick
his fucking ass?

215
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,739
Shut the fuck up.

216
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,442
We gonna come back
and kick your fucking ass!

217
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,178
Oh, shit!
Fuck, man!

218
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,081
- You guys are fuckir mean,
man.

219
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,052
Yeah, so we just wanna borrow
your gun for a couple of hours

220
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,721
and we'll bring it right back.

221
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,890
Get the fuck outta here.

222
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,995
What the fuck, man?

223
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,641
I can't believe that fuck-mouth
slammed the door in my face.

224
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,344
I should've kicked his ass. That's
what I should've fucking done.

225
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,279
- Yep.
- Dumb motherfucker.

226
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,347
Hey...

227
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,518
didn't we borrow
his lawn mower one time

228
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,121
and then we sold it

229
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,057
instead of taking it back to
him?

230
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,159
I want that machine back
tomorrow, you understand?

231
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,194
Yeah, yeah, you got it.
You got it.

232
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,496
Thanks, Mr. Don.

233
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,190
Huh.

234
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,526
Oh.

235
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,829
- No wonder he's so fucking pissed.
- Yeah.

236
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,534
Hey, man,
I've gotta ask you something.

237
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,037
Yeah?
What is it?

238
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,740
Look, don't be giving me
no bullshit about

239
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,609
how you can't believe I don't
know and stuff, though, okay?

240
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,844
Fine. What is it?

241
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,180
I'm serious, man.
You can't be calling me dumbass.

242
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,384
For fuck's sakes, all right.

243
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,352
Okay, we've been
in the Aryan Confederacy now

244
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,387
for about a year, right?

245
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,955
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Okay.

246
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,692
There's one thing
I don't understand.

247
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,261
Would you just spit it out, Raw
Dog?

248
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,563
Man, you're freaking me out.

249
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,264
- Fuck.
- Okay. Okay.

250
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,968
I understand

251
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,437
why we're supposed
to hate niggers, okay.

252
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,606
- Yeah.
- They look different,

253
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,508
they walk different,
they talk different.

254
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,243
I get it, okay.

255
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,613
But Jews, man,

256
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,715
why are supposed
to hate the Jews?

257
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,521
I just found out
Jerry Springer was a Jew.

258
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,657
Jerry fucking Springer, man.

259
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,759
If I seen him in the street,

260
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,862
I would kiss his ass

261
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,496
and ask him for an autograph.

262
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,468
I got three
Adam Sandler DVDs at home

263
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,537
and I just found out
he's a Jew, too.

264
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,977
If I was in a building
and 10 Jews sit down next to me,

265
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,212
I wouldn't even know it.

266
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,014
So what's the difference?

267
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,149
They got money?
Well, money ain't so bad.

268
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,085
Shit, I wish I had some money.

269
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,821
They got big noses.

270
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,956
At least they're supposed to.

271
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,658
Damn Teddy's got a nose
that's bigger

272
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,827
than this whole damn truck
and he ain't Jewish.

273
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,996
So, what, are we supposed
to hate him?

274
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,733
For crying out loud.

275
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,303
Jesus is a Jew, man.

276
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,038
I mean, we're talking Jesus.

277
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,173
We go to church every Sunday

278
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:13,111
and we pray
to the King of the Jews, man.

279
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,880
Well?

280
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,222
Now you listen

281
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,391
and you listen good.

282
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,493
If you repeat this,
so help me God,

283
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,728
I will run your ass over, too.

284
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,074
I don't know, either, man,
all right?

285
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,143
I don't know, either.

286
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,614
I mean, hell,
I don't even hate black people.

287
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,785
Tyrone and Bert
are some of my best buddies.

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,487
- You know them, right?
- Yeah, man. They're cool, too.

289
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,756
Yeah.

290
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:02,727
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

291
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,295
when I got to leave
the card game early

292
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,497
to go to my white supremacist
meeting?

293
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,132
I mean, they seem
to understand,

294
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,268
but, hell, it's just...

295
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,472
The only reason I started going
in the first place

296
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,542
is 'cause Greg's wife puts
out that little buffet table

297
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,610
with them meatballs
and them little smoky wieners.

298
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,814
- Yeah, them are good, too.
- Hell, yeah, they're good. Fuck.

299
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,683
Next thing I know,
I'm going to every meeting,

300
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,118
you know.

301
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,887
Full-blown member.
Got the tats and everything.

302
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,697
So we're pretty much
on the same page, then.

303
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,535
Sounds like it.

304
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,305
We ain't even really white
supremacists at all, are we?

305
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,511
Guess not.

306
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,181
Should we still be going
to them meetings, Randy?

307
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,789
Them little smoky wieners
sure are good.

308
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,725
- Yeah, they're pretty good, all right.
- Yeah.

309
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,328
They are good.

310
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,596
Oh, shit!

311
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,381
What the fuck?!

312
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,586
- Oh!
- Shit!

313
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,373
Hey.

314
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,008
Huh?

315
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,814
What is that?
A bow?

316
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:06,250
Yeah, it's a bow.
Let's get it.

317
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,153
What are we gonna get that for?

318
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,457
We gonna rob Stanley with it.

319
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,764
He's taking a...

320
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,670
- Hey!
- Hey.

321
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,073
Oh, shit!
Come on, let's go.

322
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,642
Come on, Raw Dog.

323
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,678
Come on, man.

324
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,615
Hey!

325
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,451
Take a guy's bow like that?

326
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,186
Fucking prick.

327
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,559
Hey, see you later there,
cheese dick.

328
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,763
Yeah, Raw Dog!
Yahoo!

329
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,578
Shit.

330
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,513
That motherfucker.

331
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,283
You okay?

332
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,589
I don't think so.

333
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,203
What happened to you?

334
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,340
This bastard ran me over.

335
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,479
Run over and left for dead, huh?

336
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,716
Yeah.

337
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,517
Take you to a hospital?

338
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,654
I don't wanna go to the
hospital.

339
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,057
I wanna find those
backstabbing cocksuckers.

340
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,460
Revenge, huh?

341
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,930
That's a dangerous word.

342
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,100
It's appropriate, though, I
guess.

343
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,205
You don't look familiar.

344
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,175
You from around here?

345
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,280
Just passing through.

346
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,484
You sure I can't take you
to a hospital?

347
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,754
No.

348
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,456
I know where them fuckers
is gonna be.

349
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,759
I plan on meeting them there.

350
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,263
Only problem is I pawned
my shotgun.

351
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,198
I see.

352
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,941
Give me a second.

353
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,034
Now...

354
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,936
I can't take you there...

355
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,373
but I can offer you this.

356
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,079
- You'd give me your gun?
- I ain't giving you my gun.

357
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,050
I'm offering you salvation.

358
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,989
What the fuck happened
to you back there, huh?

359
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,724
Froze up like a retard.

360
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,960
I can't have you doing
that shit in there.

361
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,663
I seen something.

362
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,835
What?

363
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,871
I'd rather not say.

364
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,742
Remember when
we was talking on the phone,

365
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,943
I told you I'd been up
for three days

366
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,412
and I started seeing
some weird shit?

367
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,480
Just tell me what you seen.

368
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,089
An army of naked zombie women.

369
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,594
An army of naked zombie women?

370
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:55,433
Dear God,
are you fucking losing it?

371
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,901
First Elvis, now this?

372
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,403
What the... man,
pull your shit together, man.

373
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,005
- We got a job to do.
- I know, man.

374
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,274
That's what I'm saying. Is
this such a good fucking idea?

375
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,444
Maybe we should just... like, we
should just rest for a couple days

376
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,746
- and get ourselves a fucking gun.
- No.

377
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,615
A proper weapon and then we can
go do that shit then.

378
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,751
No, we can't wait.

379
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,787
The fair's right here.
It's making plenty of noise.

380
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,623
All hell breaks loose,
ain't nobody gonna hear shit.

381
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,960
Now come on,
break out them fucking masks.

382
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,529
Come on.
Let's go.

383
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,667
I got this one for you.

384
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,503
Yeah, buddy.
Whoo-hoo.

385
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,078
Holy shit!
What the fuck is that?

386
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,048
- It's a fucking mask, man.
- ¶ Amazing Grace...

387
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,484
It's a fucking clown mask.

388
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,887
Well, we needed
two fucking masks.

389
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,056
And I found that there ski mask

390
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,924
and then I found this here
clown mask.

391
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,693
And for a minute I was thinking

392
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,661
maybe I could should go
and get another ski mask.

393
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,630
But then I was like,
"Why the fuck would I do that?"

394
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,465
'Cause this mask
is gonna work perfectly fine.

395
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,334
I ain't going in there with you
wearing a fucking clown mask.

396
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,935
Forget that.
Uh-uh.

397
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,038
Are you scared of clowns
or some shit?

398
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,842
No.

399
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,979
Fuckir stop it!

400
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,081
Randy, I'm gonna come and
get you in your sleep, boy.

401
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,618
I ain't fucking with you.
Stop it, you fucking bastard.

402
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,286
Okay? Stop it.

403
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,921
What the fuck are you laughing
at?

404
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,856
Youse fucking scared of clowns.

405
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:31,061
I ain't scared of shit.

406
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,631
Fuck it. Come on,
let's go do the goddamn thing.

407
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,432
Fucking asshole.

408
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,572
Fuck you.

409
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,865
What the fuck
is this bullshit here?

410
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,069
Oh, fuck me.

411
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,572
Hey, you put down
that there gun

412
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,107
or I'm gonna shoot you
with this fucking arrow.

413
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,277
Fuck your arrow. I got a gun.
You put it down.

414
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,382
You put it down and give us
all that meth you got cooked up.

415
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,051
Randy?

416
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,886
- Is that you?
- Uh...

417
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,756
- No.
- Bullshit!

418
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,758
That's Raw Dog right there.

419
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,026
No, it ain't.

420
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,295
Do I look like
a fucking idiot to you?

421
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:42,199
You buy my shit every fucking
day. I know what you sound like.

422
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,541
Wearing a fucking clown mask
ain't gonna scare me none.

423
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,543
My name's not Raw Dog!

424
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,781
I oughta fucking shoot your ass
in the head.

425
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,783
Shit, you best get that powder

426
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,885
or Raw Dog's gonna
shoot your ass in the head.

427
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,354
Aha!

428
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,024
You just said
my fucking name, Randy.

429
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,126
You just said my fucking name!

430
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,465
Fucking dumbasses.

431
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,800
I told you
this was a stupid fucking idea.

432
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,370
Man, my fucking arm's
getting tired.

433
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,405
I can't fucking hold this shit
any longer.

434
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,774
The bow ain't got nothing
to do with it.

435
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,310
It ain't my fault that Stanley sits
next to his window all fucking day

436
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,778
waiting for shit like this to
happen.

437
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,780
Well, what the fuck
are we gonna do now, huh?

438
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,754
Oh, fuck!

439
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:40,190
Oh, what the fuck, man?

440
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,495
Fuck, Randy. I didn't
mean to fucking shoot you.

441
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,430
Oh, what the fuck?

442
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:49,033
- Fucking dumbass.
- Shut the fuck up, Stanley!

443
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:50,267
Fuck, man.

444
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,935
What the...

445
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,504
Does it hurt?

446
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,706
Fuck, yeah, it hurts, man!

447
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,841
I hope you two
don't do this for a living.

448
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,942
Ah!

449
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,811
Do I pull it out?
Do I pull it out?

450
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:03,380
- What do I do?
- No, I don't think so, man.

451
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,382
What am I gonna do?

452
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,885
- What the fuck?
- You motherfuckers.

453
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,721
- Vernon?
- Vernon, you in on this?

454
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,756
Shut up.

455
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,692
These assholes run me over

456
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,027
and left me for dead
in the middle of nowhere.

457
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,664
Asshole? Vernon, I wasrt the
motherfucker that ran you over.

458
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,300
Fuck you, Raw Dog.
You left me there.

459
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,803
Hey, just calm
the fuck down, Vernon.

460
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,673
Look, I got a fucking arrow
in me, man.

461
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,211
And what the hell are you doing
with my clown mask on?

462
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,114
'Cause it was the only
fucking mask I could find, man.

463
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,415
Easy now.

464
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,017
Don't be pointing
that shotgun in here.

465
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,553
You know what's gonna happen
if you shoot that thing off.

466
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,789
Yeah, you damn right I do.

467
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,938
- Shit!
- Die!

468
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,906
Oh, shit!

469
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,846
You know, salvation comes
in many forms.

470
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,180
- Ha!
- Fuck, man!

471
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,182
Today, it rolled up in a 4x4.

472
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,184
Vernon, you damn fuck!

473
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,092
Fuck!

474
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,694
Shit, shit, shit!

475
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,801
You methy douchebag. I'm...

476
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,937
- No!
- Step on this, bitch!

477
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,506
Ah!

478
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,015
Fine. If you wanna keep
the Santa out there,

479
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,252
it'll be Christmas year-round
in Irwin, Georgia.

480
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,654
You know you ain't
fooling nobody, right?

481
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,125
It ain't got nothing to do
with it being spring time.

482
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,195
You don't like it 'cause he's
black.

483
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,631
Why you calling me a racist?

484
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,267
Well, you don't like
black Santa Claus.

485
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,936
And last week,

486
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:08,138
you told me you don't like
black porno.

487
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,674
Now hang on a damn minute.

488
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,576
Now that's got nothing
to do with racism.

489
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,044
I like black chicks in porno
movies.

490
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,313
I just don't like 'em with the
black guys in them, that's all.

491
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,649
Why come?
They make you feel inadequate?

492
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,117
No.

493
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,553
It's because their dicks
are so dark.

494
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,188
They get to fucking,

495
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,157
their dicks get wet,
they get glisteny and shit,

496
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,928
and it's hard for my eyes
to unfocus off it.

497
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,997
Make me sick.

498
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,370
Eh, well, I guess you got a
point.

499
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,009
Hey, why come
you selling that car?

500
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,012
I told you.
I was up at a four-way stop,

501
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,281
a big black 4x4 truck,

502
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,951
black tinted windows
went out of turn, nearly hit me.

503
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,190
Shit!

504
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,860
Motherfucker.

505
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,462
Fuck you, shit for brains!

506
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,598
Learn how to drive!

507
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,600
Fuckir creep.

508
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,405
Christ!

509
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,315
- Nut job.
- Well, who was it?

510
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,184
I don't know.

511
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,087
Not from around here.

512
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,722
Had West Virginia plates.

513
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,658
Now every time I take the car
out, fucker appears out of nowhere,

514
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,093
tries to run me down.

515
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,162
Well, obviously, this boy
got himself a mental problem.

516
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,001
Why come you gonna let this
one fool make you sell your car?

517
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,504
Look, he tried to kill me eight
times.

518
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,741
That piece-of-shit car
ain't won'th dying over.

519
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,476
I guess you got a point.

520
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,914
Hi there.

521
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,417
I'm Richard and this is Sandy.

522
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,152
We just got married yesterday.

523
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,187
- Congratulations.
- Ta-da.

524
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:05,589
Yeah, look at that.

525
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,926
That's some rock.

526
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,028
Listen, this is gonna
sound totally nuts,

527
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,898
but we're on our way to Orlando
for our honeymoon,

528
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,401
and I stopped
at an ATM machine

529
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,436
and some son of a gun
hacked into my account

530
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,338
and drained every last dime.

531
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,974
Well, you look pretty chipper for
somebody that just got ripped off.

532
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,609
Well, I got news for you,

533
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,912
there's absolutely nothing
that's gonna bring me down today

534
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,315
because I just married

535
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:35,919
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

536
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,589
Mwah!

537
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,028
We're gonna enjoy our honeymoon.

538
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,733
And I'm confident that the bank
is gonna straighten everything out.

539
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,969
But until then,

540
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,338
we need a little cash
for our trip.

541
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,507
We're just gonna need a couple thousand
and we'll pick it up on the way back.

542
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,843
Well, I ain't got that
kind of cash lying around.

543
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,212
Folks don't come in here
with a $10,000 ring.

544
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,947
Here.

545
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,983
Sorry, hon.

546
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,320
Here, here, take a look
at this baby right here.

547
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,722
How much can you
loan us on this?

548
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,291
Just for a week or so
until the banks get back.

549
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,396
I don't know.
Maybe four or five hundred.

550
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:20,564
Are you kidding me?

551
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,299
Four or five hundred.

552
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,742
Can I help you
with something there?

553
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,543
Let me see that ring.

554
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,317
Which one?
This one here?

555
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,285
Yes.

556
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,888
Honey, is something wrong?

557
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,512
Oh, no.

558
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,614
Richard, what's wrong?

559
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,315
Honey, what's the matter?

560
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,586
Um...

561
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,655
I'm gonna need you
to wait outside.

562
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,724
- What?
- No, no.

563
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,826
Just wait outside.

564
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:25,262
- Honey, can't you just tell me?
- Please.

565
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,930
Outside.

566
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,533
I'll be out in a second.
I'll explain everything.

567
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,007
You okay there, mister?

568
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,043
Where did you get this ring?

569
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,478
No, I can't tell you
that kind of information.

570
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,346
- Where did you get the ring?
- What are you, a parrot?

571
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,549
I said I can't tell. Look, you
think that ring was stolen from you,

572
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,884
- you gotta fill out a police report.
- Now, I want you to listen to me.

573
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,555
This ring...

574
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,623
this ring belonged to my wife.

575
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,293
Not her.

576
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,096
My first wife Cyndi.

577
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,401
Six years ago,

578
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,269
Cyndi disappeared.

579
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,707
Her car was still in the garage.

580
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,643
There was blood
found in the driveway.

581
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:17,647
So I know she didn't just run
away.

582
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,216
That wasrt Cyndi.

583
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,186
No.

584
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,489
She was taken from me

585
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,457
without a trace.

586
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,295
And, you know,
to make matters worse...

587
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,299
I seem to be the cops'
number-one suspect.

588
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,603
Mm-mm-mm.

589
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:43,406
And now... six years later,

590
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,443
the day after my wedding,

591
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,712
I end up in a pawn shop...

592
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:52,282
what, six, seven, eight
states away from my hometown...

593
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,820
to find a ring

594
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,022
that I had custom-made for her

595
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:02,259
with our names
inscribed in the band

596
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:05,529
and you say you can't
give out information?

597
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,899
No. You'll have to call the
cops.

598
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,568
- Maybe they can figure it out.
- No cops.

599
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,771
I want you to tell me
who sold you this ring.

600
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,306
Man, I can't.

601
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,375
All right, you listen to me.

602
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:21,178
You see that diamond
you got in your hand?

603
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,413
I want you keep that ring.

604
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:27,250
That's a $17,000 ring, by the
way.

605
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,620
All I want in exchange for it

606
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,889
is my old ring back

607
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,326
plus that shitty hatchback
you got for sale out front.

608
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,794
Hmm.

609
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,698
What is it you want?

610
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
How much you give me on this?

611
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,702
It's a valuable family heirloom.
Belonged to my granny.

612
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,738
She's dead.
It's pretty. It's pretty.

613
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:54,544
Well, I'll give you 40.

614
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,112
Deal.

615
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,656
His name's J.J. Thomason.

616
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,628
Might even find him
at Lou's Fire Pit in the square.

617
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,330
He's a cook there.

618
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:16,700
Now don't tell nobody
I told you nothing.

619
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,409
- Don't.
- L...

620
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,744
- Don't say...
- I'm just saying...

621
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,312
Just don't say nothing.

622
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,882
Richard, what is going on?

623
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,919
- I need you to go back home.
- What?

624
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,154
Take the car
and go back to Connecticut.

625
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,956
But... no, no, no, no.
We're on our honeymoon

626
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,359
and now you want me
to just drive home?

627
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,261
I wanna know
what the hell is going on.

628
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,795
It's a private matter.

629
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,364
Private?
It's private?

630
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,733
There is no private.
We just got married.

631
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,769
You can't just drive off
without an explanation.

632
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,071
I'm your wife.

633
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,876
I already have a wife.

634
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,144
What are you talking about?

635
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,814
Why are you doing this to me?

636
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,451
Richard?

637
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,888
Richard, come back!

638
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,090
Richard, don't go.

639
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,060
We're supposed to go to Orlando!

640
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,030
Richard!

641
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,200
<i>You know how I feel</i>

642
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:27,704
<i>It's a new dawn, it's a new
day</i>

643
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,774
<i>It's a new life</i>

644
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,576
<i>For me</i>

645
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:37,247
<i>And I'm feelir good</i>

646
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:42,218
<i>Yeah</i>

647
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,622
<i>Dragonfly out in the sun</i>

648
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:49,626
<i>You know how I feel</i>

649
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,963
<i>Butterflies havir fun,
you know what I mean...</i>

650
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,048
<i>Now I'm feelir...</i>

651
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,256
Say there, missy.

652
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:57,026
Carlee, I don't suppose that
you noticed that I was in town.

653
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,863
I'm doing a tribute show
to the King

654
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,998
down at the county fair later
on.

655
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,933
Big news story about it
and everything.

656
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,635
Gonna be on the news
later on this afternoon.

657
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,804
Even put a poster in the window.
You should check it out.

658
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,907
It's against the rules.

659
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,509
Management.

660
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,714
Say, I was wondering
if maybe

661
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:21,451
you would perhaps be interested
in trading a little lunch

662
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:25,188
for a pair of front-row tickets.

663
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,123
I don't go to the fair.

664
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,126
And we only take cash
for food here.

665
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,494
Hmm.

666
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,632
How 'bout just a couple
scrambled eggs for the tickets?

667
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,301
We only take cash here, mister.

668
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,971
You are gonna pay
for that coffee, right?

669
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,541
- How 'bout the tickets for the coffee?
- It's $1.20.

670
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,592
Um, I'm about 16 cents short
here.

671
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:06,963
How 'bout you take that
and the two tickets?

672
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,233
You can keep 'em, honey.

673
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,472
I can't take this shit no more.

674
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,208
Theresa, hey.
Baby, where are you going?

675
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,309
Hey there. Hey there.
Hey there.

676
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,944
Come on, now.
What's your problem?

677
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:24,280
- What's your problem?
- I can't live like this anymore, Ricky.

678
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,649
Shug, what's the matter?

679
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,885
We're traveling around.

680
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:31,154
We're seeing new places.

681
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,556
We're rocking it out to the
King.

682
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,759
The places we travel
ain't nowhere I wanna see.

683
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,629
We're broke, hungry,

684
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,365
your car smells like shit
for some reason,

685
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,867
and I'm tired of it.

686
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,504
All right, first of all, I do
not know what that smell is.

687
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,572
And second of all...

688
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,709
this is me, baby.

689
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,979
I'm living the life of the King.

690
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,814
And I ain't giving it up for no
one.

691
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,683
You ain't living the life of the
King.

692
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,353
You don't have his money,
his voice,

693
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,854
or his looks.

694
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,660
Well, there is one thing
that I do have.

695
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:11,828
And what's that?

696
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,731
Skin without worms
crawling through it.

697
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,270
I'm sorry, King.

698
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,838
Forgive me.

699
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,773
It was my jealousy.

700
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,210
Hold my hand.
Help me.

701
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,879
- King...
- I'm outta here, Ricky.

702
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,447
Outta here?
Where are you going?

703
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,784
You're 200 miles from anywhere
near anywhere...

704
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,920
I can get around
anywhere I'm at

705
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,222
because I got one thing you
don't.

706
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,690
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

707
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,058
A pussy.

708
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,528
Can't argue with that.

709
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,763
Fine.

710
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,598
Go on.
Get outta here.

711
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,866
You're making a big mistake!

712
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:53,536
I'll be at the Ramada Express
in no time flat.

713
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,905
They said they'd love
to have me back.

714
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,841
That was eight years ago, Ricky.

715
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,778
They didn't say when!

716
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,911
¶ And I'm feelir good.

717
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,546
Hello, sir.

718
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:38,281
Is your soul saved?

719
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,051
Fuck off.

720
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,757
I really gotta work on my
approach.

721
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,995
I'm looking for J.J.

722
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,796
He's in the back. I'll let
him know you're out here.

723
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,365
- Don't bother.
- Hey.

724
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,333
You can't go back there.

725
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,668
Hey!

726
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,269
I said you can't go back there.

727
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,504
Ooh!

728
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,872
Who's J.J.?

729
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,345
- You J.J.?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

730
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:11,314
I told him he couldn't
come back here.

731
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,383
Where'd you get this ring?

732
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,686
What, you a cop?

733
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:19,188
No.

734
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,424
Then fuck off.

735
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,433
I asked you nicely.

736
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,636
Get off me!
Get off me!

737
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:37,140
The ring... you gonna tell me
where you got it?

738
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:38,775
Fuck you!

739
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,279
You're gonna tell me...

740
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,448
where... you got it.

741
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:06,002
No!
- Two choices:

742
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:08,538
Tell me where you got
the ring or die.

743
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,507
Okay, okay. It was my uncle.
I stole it from my uncle.

744
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,677
- Your uncle?
- Yeah.

745
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,145
Who is he
and where do I find him?

746
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,847
His name is Ben Thomason.

747
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,650
He lives about a mile
off the highway

748
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:24,253
on Ivy Street in a gray house
next to a purple house.

749
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,971
- Can I help you with your bags?
- Jesus Christ!

750
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,607
You scared the piss outta me.

751
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,709
Who are you?

752
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,112
That's not important.

753
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,913
What's important is...

754
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,483
where did you get this?

755
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:55,351
My ring.

756
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,321
That's mine.
Where'd you get it?

757
00:45:58,323 --> 00:45:59,822
I asked you first.

758
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,257
That's none of your damn
business.

759
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,992
Someone stole it from me
and I want it back.

760
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,996
Well, I'm afraid
you can't have it back.

761
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,165
Somebody stole it from me first.

762
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,201
Now, you wanna tell me
where you got this ring?

763
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:14,804
You wanna tell me
where you got it?

764
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,039
This is my damn house.

765
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,942
You don't just show up
demanding shit around here.

766
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,678
All right, how about this?

767
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,281
I'll tell you where I got it

768
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,250
and then you tell me
where you got it.

769
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:28,751
Deal?

770
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,555
Deal.

771
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:35,057
Like I said,

772
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:38,227
this ring was taken from me
a long time ago.

773
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:43,432
But where I got it today
was in a pawn shop.

774
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:49,372
Your nephew sold it there
after he stole it from you.

775
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,240
J.J.?

776
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,380
I fucking knew it.

777
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,250
Oh, that little bitch.

778
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,290
All right, your turn.

779
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,027
I won it in a poker game
about a year ago.

780
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,262
Really?
From who?

781
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,331
Johnny Shaw.

782
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,168
What can you tell me about him?

783
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,170
He's a good guy.

784
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,472
Gets his haircut at Doc's,
so he's okay by me.

785
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,941
Where does he live?

786
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,045
I answered the question.
I told you where I got the ring.

787
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,980
That was the deal.

788
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,882
I ain't gonna start
giving out information

789
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,817
to some guy who just pops up
at my house.

790
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,352
Now give me the damn ring.

791
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,820
I don't think so.

792
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:40,256
It's mine.

793
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,525
No, it was my ring first.

794
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,929
And I'm not leaving here

795
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,632
until you tell me where I
can find this Johnny Shaw.

796
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,701
No.

797
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,104
No, you ain't leaving here

798
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,506
until you give me back
my damn ring.

799
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,511
So I guess it's gonna
get ugly, then.

800
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:04,847
Oh, I reckon.

801
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,362
Okay, you son of a bitch...

802
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:54,830
last chance.

803
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:57,433
Where's Johnny?

804
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,270
Fuck you.

805
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,039
Fuck you!

806
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,778
Stubborn son of a bitch.

807
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,593
...lives by day
and is the King by night.

808
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,597
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski...

809
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,715
I'm just living the dream here,
you know.

810
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,017
Okay, you can hold it.
You know...

811
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,319
Just living the dream
and traveling around.

812
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,954
You know, uh,

813
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,490
see people, go places,

814
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,360
like, just rocking it out...

815
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:00,096
There we go.

816
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:01,831
There you are, Johnny.

817
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,941
...some of your
big influences are, Ricky.

818
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:15,578
Well, definitely.
The King, um, King and the King.

819
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,613
- KKK all the way.
- You can catch Ricky...

820
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:18,948
- Wait, no...
... this weekend

821
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,485
performing his tribute
performance to the King.

822
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,454
I'd like to just say
God bless America!

823
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,323
Irwin County Fair.

824
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,891
Back to you, Michael.

825
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,998
Johnny.

826
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,601
- Yes, Johnny.
- Yes, Johnny.

827
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:49,305
- Johnny, please give it to me.
- Yes, Johnny.

828
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,576
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

829
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,447
Yeah.

830
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,550
Yes.

831
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,322
Oh, yes, Johnny.
Oh, yeah.

832
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,324
Just like that.

833
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:11,127
Harder.

834
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,374
- Smile, Cyndi.
- Stop, I look terrible.

835
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,976
You always look beautiful.

836
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,916
Come on, Cyndi. Do one more.

837
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,249
How you doing, player?

838
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,019
I've been better.

839
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:45,955
I bet you have.

840
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,692
You wanna put it away, Johnny?

841
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,414
You like to go fishing, do you?

842
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,483
When I get the time.

843
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,225
You, uh...

844
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,693
you wanna tell me
why you're in my house

845
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26,595
with a gun pointed at my head?

846
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,174
You wanna tell me
where you got this ring?

847
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,646
I ain't never seen it before.

848
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,214
Really?

849
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,816
Well...

850
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,052
I hear you lost it in a poker
game.

851
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,456
I don't know
what you're talking about.

852
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:58,327
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

853
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,596
Well, there's a picture of my
wife,

854
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:03,365
the woman I gave this ring to,

855
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,501
on your refrigerator.

856
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,071
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

857
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:13,475
Say you don't know what I'm
talking about again, motherfucker.

858
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,612
- Please...
- Say it! Go ahead and fucking say it!

859
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,114
- Pl... please.
- Shut up!

860
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,124
You wanna tell me
the truth, Johnny?

861
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:32,161
L... I found a pocketbook.

862
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,530
The ring was in it.
That's all I know.

863
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,866
And the picture?

864
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,635
Was that in the pocketbook, too?

865
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:41,637
Yeah.

866
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,173
And you decided to just
hang it up on your fridge?

867
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,075
Look, I don't know any more.

868
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:48,677
I found it. The picture
was pretty, so I hung it up.

869
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,679
I can't tell you nothing more.

870
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,181
Look, if you don't believe me,

871
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,650
you can just go ahead and kill
me.

872
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:58,420
I'm gonna kill you, Johnny.

873
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,724
Just how long it takes...
that's up to you.

874
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,946
What the hell did you do to me?

875
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,576
Sometimes a picture really
is won'th a thousand words.

876
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,178
Shh.

877
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,222
Check this out.

878
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,393
It's called a flail.

879
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,330
You know, I'd start with this,

880
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,966
but then I might as well just...

881
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,936
shoot you in the head
with that rifle over there

882
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,005
'cause this would kill you
pretty quick.

883
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,074
Luckily...

884
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,745
I stumbled onto these two items

885
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,014
laying around your house.

886
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,517
Why don't we get creative?

887
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,954
It's simple.

888
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,290
Tell me what happened to my
wife.

889
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:48,297
"I don't know"
is a bad thing to say, Johnny.

890
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,438
This is just the beginning.

891
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,240
We can do this all day.

892
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,416
Yes, please.

893
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:10,018
Please, tell me what you did
with my wife.

894
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,854
Tell me how you raped
and killed her

895
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:15,657
so I can kill you and I can get
some fucking closure with my life.

896
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:20,395
Tell me what you did
to my fucking wife!

897
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,867
And I told you about saying
that.

898
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,349
Don't you fuck with me.

899
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,618
Don't fuck with me.

900
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,886
Don't you fuck with me!

901
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,338
Yes. Yes.

902
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,507
Cyndi... oh, my God.

903
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,113
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.

904
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,881
I'm here, Cyndi.

905
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:22,985
I'm here, baby.

906
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:24,553
I'm gonna get you out.

907
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,255
Cyndi.

908
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,561
Come on, Cyndi.

909
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,064
It's me.

910
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,666
It's me, Richard.

911
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:42,371
Cyndi, it's your husband.
That's it.

912
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:44,106
Come on, Cyndi.

913
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,042
Take my hand.

914
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,179
That's it.
That's it.

915
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:53,448
Come on, that's it.

916
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,983
That's it.

917
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,085
Come on.

918
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:58,887
Come on.
Don't worry, baby.

919
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,856
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

920
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,724
I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

921
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:05,093
Wait, Cyndi. Cyndi.

922
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:07,462
It's okay. It's okay.

923
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,031
Cyndi.

924
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,767
Come on.

925
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:13,368
Take my hand.

926
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,704
- I'm gonna take you home now.
- I am home.

927
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:16,972
What?

928
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,175
Go away.

929
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,744
Cyndi, please, listen to me.

930
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,147
You're not thinking right.

931
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:27,215
Come on, it's time to go.

932
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:29,117
Cyndi...

933
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,787
it's me, Richard.

934
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,588
Get out.

935
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,025
Listen to me, Cyndi.

936
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,529
This... I don't know
the term for this,

937
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,631
but I saw it
on television somewhere,

938
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,067
where the...

939
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:48,704
the victim starts to sympathize
with the captor.

940
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,672
Well, that's what's happened to
you.

941
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:53,942
You need help.
Just... it's time to go home.

942
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:56,411
Cyndi, listen to me.
It's time to go home!

943
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:57,979
Get out!

944
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,340
You have her caged
like a fucking dog?

945
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,010
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

946
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:31,346
I haven't been
a man of my word lately.

947
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,585
How do you like this?

948
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,421
You son of a bitch!

949
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,456
She's my wife! My wife!

950
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,759
My ever-loving wife,
you son of a bitch!

951
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,896
Who's the bitch now?

952
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,933
Get out.
Come on, we're going.

953
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,602
I'm gonna get you help.

954
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,370
Come on.

955
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,607
Let's go.

956
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,147
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

957
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:08,483
It's just you're not...
you're not thinking straight.

958
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:12,120
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

959
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,156
But, please...

960
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,891
you gotta trust me.

961
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,528
You trusted me before.

962
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,900
All right, you ready?

963
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,434
Let's go.

964
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:28,403
- I can't leave.
- What?

965
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,238
I'm number one.

966
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,974
Number one?

967
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,310
I'm number one.
L... I've got my own silo.

968
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:39,014
And Johnny lets me go in
and watch TV sometimes.

969
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,285
There's others?

970
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:44,419
Yeah?

971
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:48,857
Yeah, but...
I... I'm number one.

972
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,565
Come on, let's go.

973
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,500
- I can't...
- Come on.

974
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,167
What the fuck did he do to you?

975
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,259
Oh.

976
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,764
It's okay.

977
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,601
Come on.

978
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:54,683
Get you outta here.

979
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,470
Come on.
Out.

980
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,007
There's soap and hot water
in the house.

981
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:21,142
Call for help.

982
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,144
You're free to go
back to your lives.

983
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,153
They cannot go in the house.

984
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,155
I'm number one

985
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,624
and I'm not even allowed
to use the phone.

986
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:39,527
Well, it's time to go.

987
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,062
I can't go.

988
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:43,131
Get in the car, would ya?

989
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,971
Do you even remember me?

990
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,677
Well, then you know
I'm not gonna hurt you.

991
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,445
Come on, it's time to go.

992
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,719
I'm gonna get you some clothes.

993
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,388
But for now...

994
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:08,490
I'm... I'm not allowed
to wear clothes.

995
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:11,593
Hey, you're allowed to do
whatever you want.

996
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:14,562
You're not a slave and
neither are those other women.

997
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,897
Put...

998
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:17,699
You shouldn't have let them
in his house.

999
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,501
They're not allowed, just me.

1000
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:21,202
Twice a week for 30 minutes.

1001
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,371
Stop saying that!

1002
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,980
Hey...

1003
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:33,748
Look.

1004
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,950
Cyndi...

1005
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,822
do you remember this?

1006
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:42,657
This ring?

1007
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,826
This is the ring
that I had made for you.

1008
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,730
This is the ring
that you used to wear.

1009
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,532
You won't believe how I found
it.

1010
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:51,933
I was with...

1011
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:56,337
Well, I wound up in a pawn
shop...

1012
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,074
and there it was.

1013
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:05,146
It was like God brought me
there.

1014
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:06,815
Give me your hand.

1015
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:34,943
<i>Time and love</i>

1016
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:38,012
<i>They don't ever get along</i>

1017
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:40,081
<i>At all...</i>

1018
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:55,964
<i>Time and love...</i>

1019
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,967
We should call Johnny
and let him know where I'm at

1020
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:03,071
because I... I really shouldn't
be gone for too long.

1021
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:05,473
Cyndi,

1022
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,342
Johnny's dead.

1023
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:08,710
What?

1024
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,979
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

1025
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,114
He's dead.

1026
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:15,783
- Wait, what?
- You're safe with me.

1027
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,218
How did he die?

1028
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,954
Cyndi, I stabbed him in the
chest.

1029
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:23,825
I watched him take his last breath
as he whimpered like a little bitch.

1030
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,795
You... you killed him?

1031
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,998
Yeah, that's right,
I killed him.

1032
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,034
I only wish he was still alive
so I could kill him again.

1033
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,475
Bastard.

1034
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,644
Who's a ba... I'm a bastard?

1035
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,412
I'm a bastard?

1036
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,581
Aw, Cyndi, come on.

1037
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,717
He had you living in a cage

1038
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,619
filled with your own piss and
shit

1039
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,121
for six years.

1040
01:09:53,123 --> 01:09:54,656
And I'm the bastard?

1041
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:57,759
Oh, he let you watch TV
a couple times a week?

1042
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,894
Well, I bought you a goddamn TV

1043
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,296
and a house

1044
01:10:01,298 --> 01:10:04,532
and every other goddamn thing
you wanted, Cyndi.

1045
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:09,003
I don't believe this.

1046
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,339
I'm a bastard?

1047
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:12,874
Look, I'm sorry.

1048
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,176
I can't even imagine, pumpkin,
what you've been through.

1049
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:17,145
You son of a bitch!

1050
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,181
Motherfucker!

1051
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,783
You killed Johnny,
you motherfucker!

1052
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,886
I was at the top of the pyramid! Now
I'm going to be nothing, like you!

1053
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,988
- Stop it, Cyndi!
- Do you know how many other girls

1054
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,091
I had to piss on to get on top
of that fucking pyramid,

1055
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:32,360
- you son of a bitch?
- I love you! Ah!

1056
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:37,131
<i>I thought I knew the score.</i>

1057
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,461
Hello?

1058
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,964
Hey, babe.
It's me.

1059
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,000
What the hell do you want?

1060
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,504
I think I made a big mistake.

1061
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:19,207
How about turning around
and picking me up?

1062
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,876
We can still make it to Orlando
in time for our reservation.

1063
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,512
Richard...

1064
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,448
fuck you!

1065
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,050
But, babe...

1066
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,953
Babe?

1067
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,260
I should've seen that coming.

1068
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:47,302
<i>No, I'm never gonna fall</i>

1069
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:51,105
<i>In love</i>

1070
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,875
<i>Please don't make me</i>

1071
01:11:53,877 --> 01:12:00,948
<i>Fall in love</i>

1072
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:09,190
<i>Again...</i>

1073
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,265
- Oh man.
- <i>That's why I'm singir</i></i>

1074
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:19,934
<i>Oh...</i>

1075
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:22,303
Come on, sug.
Come on, baby.

1076
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:23,838
Come on.
Good girl.

1077
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,207
Good girl.
Good girl.

1078
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:27,975
Hang in there.
Son of a... oh.

1079
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:30,044
No, no, no.
No, no, not now.

1080
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,413
Not... not now.
No, no, please, please.

1081
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:33,948
Come on.
I'm begging you, sweetheart.

1082
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,917
Come on.

1083
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:38,619
Baby, forgive me.

1084
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,421
Oh, come on, baby.

1085
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:44,325
I'm just saying, if you're gonna
build a robot that speaks English

1086
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:47,862
to go back in time to kill
people, why give it an accent?

1087
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,198
That just don't make sense to
me.

1088
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,034
<i>-Again.</i>
- Come on, baby.</i>

1089
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,773
What in the blue hell
is you talking about?

1090
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:01,809
Arnold Schwarzenegger
is from Austria.

1091
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:03,745
Austria, Australia,

1092
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:05,913
it's the same thing
without the "alia. "

1093
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,324
Hello.

1094
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:17,725
Hi there.

1095
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:20,995
Who are you supposed to be,
Liberace?

1096
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:23,364
Heck, no.

1097
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:26,434
I do a little tribute show to
the King.

1098
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:28,102
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.

1099
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:29,670
Going back to the county fair.

1100
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,672
Gonna be a big show.
Big, big show.

1101
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:33,674
I'm doing two shows tonight.

1102
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,410
- And one on Saturday and one
Sunday.

1103
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:38,479
And there's gonna be a big news show
on it and everything on Channel 7.

1104
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:41,015
Now, listen.

1105
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,717
I'm a little strapped right now

1106
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,619
'cause they don't pay me out
till Monday.

1107
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:00,034
Well, what do you want?

1108
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:01,602
You want to pawn that suit?

1109
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,137
Heck, no.

1110
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,773
- 'Cause I was gonna say...
- No, no, no, no, no.

1111
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,675
The thing is I...

1112
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,879
I would,
on principle only,

1113
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:14,415
never perform without this

1114
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,918
because this, my friend,

1115
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,354
belonged to the King himself.

1116
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,557
- Elvis Presley?
- Mm-hmm.

1117
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,292
Bullshit.

1118
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,427
If I'm lyir, I'm dyir.

1119
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,129
24-karat gold.

1120
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,101
What do you say?
Take a look?

1121
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,870
Let's see.

1122
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,879
I don't care if it belonged to
Ronald McDonald as long as it's gold.

1123
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,115
What do you need?

1124
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:51,219
Um, I'll take, say...

1125
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,755
- 200?
- I can swing that.

1126
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,591
All right, then.

1127
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:58,759
Uh... very good.

1128
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:00,361
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1129
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:03,264
You... you take good care of my
baby.

1130
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,820
Damn, that's no good.

1131
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,989
No, no, no.
Can't have that in the show.

1132
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,757
I need a barber shop.

1133
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,492
Where's a barber shop at?

1134
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,569
Fans.

1135
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:51,105
This town is loco.

1136
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:54,075
Well, with a name like Doc's,
you can't go wrong.

1137
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:14,061
- Good afternoon.
- How you doing?

1138
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:15,496
Have a seat.

1139
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:18,733
These gentlemen ain't doing
anything but wasting time.

1140
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:20,935
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1141
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,510
Okay.

1142
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,789
Now then, I don't need a cut.

1143
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:45,993
I just want you to even up
these here sideburns.

1144
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,764
That's an awful lot of hair.
You sure you don't want a trim?

1145
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51,499
Oh, no.
It's perfect for the show.

1146
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,867
The show?

1147
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,669
Oh, what are you, in the circus?

1148
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,537
No, no.
I'm in the county fair.

1149
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,406
Oh.

1150
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:00,307
What are you, the magician?

1151
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,577
No. I ain't no magician.

1152
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,647
I do a tribute show.

1153
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:08,182
A tribute... what's that?

1154
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,651
You show people
how to sew sequins on outfits?

1155
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,752
Pshh.

1156
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:13,854
I don't show people
how to put sequins...

1157
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,724
Hey!

1158
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:18,959
What the hell?!

1159
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,330
What do you think you're doing?

1160
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,232
I'm cutting your hair.

1161
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,735
I told you to even out my
sideburns.

1162
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:29,870
You nearly took this flap right
off.

1163
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:33,741
Son, I don't know how they
cut hair in the big city,

1164
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:36,477
- but here, that's it.
- I'm from South Carolina.

1165
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:39,947
- Sweet Jesus, I'm outta here.
- Hey, you owe me $12.

1166
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:42,183
You...

1167
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,191
One for the money.

1168
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:51,959
Two for the show.

1169
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,096
10 for a lousy haircut.

1170
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,699
You know what?
I'll take some of that to go.

1171
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,845
- I can't believe he chose Doc's.
- Oh, he's gonna regret that.

1172
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,246
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey there.

1173
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,647
- Welcome to Irwin.
- Thank you.

1174
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:16,283
So you are a Doc man, huh?

1175
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:17,585
Hell, no!

1176
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,286
Look what he done to me.
He butchered me.

1177
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:21,288
I'm gonna try Cook's.

1178
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:25,893
- Looks like Doc can't cut the
mustard.

1179
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,307
Howdy.

1180
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:42,643
Good afternoon.

1181
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:44,445
Have a seat.

1182
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,614
These old-timers
are just wasting time.

1183
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:51,452
Looks like some commotiors
going on out there, huh?

1184
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:55,156
Yeah, looks to me
like the loony boon...

1185
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:57,892
loony tune bin just dropped off
a bunch of mental patients

1186
01:19:57,894 --> 01:20:00,728
on a field trip or something
there.

1187
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:03,497
So what are you,
some kind of magician?

1188
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:06,033
No, I'm not a magician.

1189
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,935
Say, do you have a TV?
Do you know what time it is?

1190
01:20:07,937 --> 01:20:10,037
Could you put on...

1191
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:14,141
... the King by night.

1192
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,077
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski.

1193
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:20,447
He's a volunteer emergency
medical service technician by day

1194
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,449
and, as you can
probably guess,

1195
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:26,153
does Elvis tribute
performances by night.

1196
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,454
So, Ricky, tell us

1197
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:29,890
- a little bit about yourself.
- Uh-huh.

1198
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:32,359
Well, now, looks like
we got ourselves

1199
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,562
a celebrity in the house, huh?

1200
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:36,897
Pssh, come on now.
I'm just glad to be here.

1201
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:39,967
Just glad to be here.

1202
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:42,903
You know, I actually was a little bit
nervous during that there interview.

1203
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:44,505
They asked a lot of questions
and everything,

1204
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,740
but I had my sign up.
I think that just...

1205
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:49,076
What in the Hades
is going on out there?

1206
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,312
Looks like a riot.

1207
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:53,480
I don't mean no offense
or anything like that,

1208
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:57,685
but there's something a little
bit whacko about this town.

1209
01:20:57,687 --> 01:21:00,421
The oyster brain next door,

1210
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:03,958
I asked him just to even up
my sideburns

1211
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,626
and, son of a gun,

1212
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:08,362
- he just chopped this side...
- Excuse me.

1213
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,531
- You went next door first?
- Yes.

1214
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,104
Do I look like sloppy seconds
to you, boy?

1215
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:20,307
You decide to be a Doc man,
you stay a Doc man.

1216
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,209
I ain't no second choice.

1217
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,511
Sir, I just asked him
to even up my burns

1218
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,747
because one of them's a little
higher than the other one

1219
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:28,282
and he cut half of it off.

1220
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:31,785
Now if you could be so kind to
just please trim this one so it...

1221
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,924
You... what the heck?

1222
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,827
That'll be $12.

1223
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,862
You cut me?

1224
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:46,600
Y'all are cuckoo in this town.
Whacky crazy.

1225
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,435
Oh, we're whackos, huh?

1226
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:51,672
You come in here in your fancy
suit and your boufed-up hairdo

1227
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:54,508
and you can't even figure out what
barber you want to cut your hair.

1228
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,977
We don't care for you
Hollywood types around here.

1229
01:21:56,979 --> 01:22:00,080
I am from South
nutter-butter-lovir Carolina.

1230
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,815
I don't care
where you're from. Get!

1231
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,458
Get out of my way!

1232
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:15,129
Out of my way!

1233
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,596
Thank you.

1234
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:55,302
<i>I was figgir by the
river...</i>

1235
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:59,073
<i>And I seen a reflection of a
man</i>

1236
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,713
<i>I swore it was the devil</i>

1237
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,917
<i>When he reached out
his sun-scorched hand...</i>

1238
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:26,266
Good evening, sir.

1239
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,068
Hello.

1240
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,671
You're not from around here,
are you?

1241
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:32,373
Heck, no.

1242
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,409
Bunch of psychos in this town.

1243
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:39,079
You caused some kind of
commotion up at the barber shops.

1244
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:43,684
What kind of whacko town only lets
you get your haircut in one place?

1245
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,587
Well, that's just the way it is.

1246
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:49,623
You're either a Cook man
or you a Doc man.

1247
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:51,658
Everything needs its balance

1248
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,962
and you done come along here
and unbalanced everything.

1249
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:56,797
Huh.

1250
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:58,165
Okay.

1251
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:01,869
Can I ask you a question?

1252
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,905
Shoot.

1253
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:10,477
You ever feel lost?

1254
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,615
Sometimes.

1255
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:17,785
You ever feel like

1256
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:19,887
you're giving life
everything you got,

1257
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:23,057
but you just can't get
to where you want to be?

1258
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:26,226
Who are you,

1259
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,228
some kind of mind reader
or something like that?

1260
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,998
What if I could help you find

1261
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,133
what you're looking for?

1262
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:37,471
What if I could put you in that
place

1263
01:24:37,473 --> 01:24:40,641
that you've always wanted to be
in?

1264
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,779
What if by just saying
one little bitty word,

1265
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:50,484
that I could grant you everything
that you've ever really wanted?

1266
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:59,126
You see, these things on Earth,
they can be grand...

1267
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:03,664
but they can only
truly be achieved one way

1268
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,666
and that's with your soul.

1269
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:08,902
<i>He walked me to the crossroad</i>

1270
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:12,172
<i>Tear shed from my eye</i>

1271
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:14,341
<i>'Cause I knew what he was
after</i>

1272
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:17,311
<i>And it was time for me to
die...</i>

1273
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,383
Well?

1274
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:25,319
What do you say?

1275
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,489
Excuse me a moment.

1276
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,230
- Hello?
- Mama.

1277
01:25:36,232 --> 01:25:38,165
- Who's that? Ricky?
- Mama.

1278
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:39,900
- Is that you?
- Mama, it's me.

1279
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:42,169
- Where you calling from?
- Listen, Mama.

1280
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:45,772
I think I just met the devil.

1281
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:47,608
- Satan? I knew it.
- He wants to make a deal.

1282
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:49,510
Playing that devil music,
Satan was bound to find you!

1283
01:25:49,512 --> 01:25:51,578
- Mom, calm down.
- Elvis Presley died young.

1284
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,815
- Mama, I know that the King died young.
- On the toilet full of drugs.

1285
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:57,217
Eating a grilled peanut butter
and banana sandwich.

1286
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:00,787
- That man, he was a disgrace.
- Mama, he had a better life

1287
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,789
here on Earth
than anyone ever did.

1288
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:07,094
- I knew darn well the reason why.
- Singing the devil's music.

1289
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:09,596
- It's because he sold his soul.
- Ricky, now you come home this minute.

1290
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:11,965
- Mama, I haven't taken...
- Your soul is not for sale.

1291
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,034
- And you tell him I said so.
- I'm gonna think about it

1292
01:26:14,036 --> 01:26:15,903
- and I'll call you back.
- Ricky, now you get your tail...

1293
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,916
Um...

1294
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,653
well, uh...

1295
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:35,556
thank you very much
for your offer.

1296
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:38,725
Um... I will give it
some consideration.

1297
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:40,527
I'm gonna need a little bit of
time.

1298
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,496
I understand.

1299
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:44,231
Listen, I got this show to get
to

1300
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:46,633
and, uh,

1301
01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:49,036
I should be on my way.

1302
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:50,837
Maybe you'd like to come?

1303
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,112
Bye for now.

1304
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,717
I'll be around.

1305
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,787
You make up your mind,
I'll be easy to find.

1306
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,144
<i>Forever...</i>

1307
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:37,484
Such bullshit.
Doc sucked 30 years ago

1308
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:38,852
- and he sucks still now.
- <i>Forever...</i></i>

1309
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:40,654
Yeah, whatever, man.
Have you looked in the mirror?

1310
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:42,589
Your hair's so gappy, it looks
like you've got the mange.

1311
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,758
I wouldn't let Doc trim the hair
on my dog's balls.

1312
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,892
Thank you, ladies.

1313
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,562
And thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

1314
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:50,797
for coming out to see our show

1315
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:54,268
here at the Irwin County Fair.

1316
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:58,405
I'm Jerry Cleveland.

1317
01:27:58,407 --> 01:28:02,709
This show has been brought to you
by Jerry Cleveland Enterprises.

1318
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,479
Now, next up

1319
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:07,881
is the closest thing you'll ever
get

1320
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:11,952
to hearing the King himself
alive.

1321
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:15,589
Please welcome Ricky Baldoski.

1322
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:18,025
He had his haircut at Cook's.

1323
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:19,593
Ricky Baldoski.

1324
01:28:22,331 --> 01:28:25,299
I said, please welcome

1325
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:27,768
Ricky Baldoski.

1326
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,223
Hey, man, it's the magician.

1327
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:51,958
Hey, get your hair cut.

1328
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,827
You know Doc invented scissors.

1329
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,163
Yeah? Cook
invented the bowl cut.

1330
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,244
This guy stinks!

1331
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:46,313
Get off the stage!

1332
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,239
Oh, I'm sorry, Ricky.

1333
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:49,209
- We'll have it looked at.
- Everything's fine, Ricky.

1334
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,978
You suck, son!

1335
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,047
Go home, Liberace!

1336
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,531
I accept your offer.

1337
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,972
Now what?

1338
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,666
- Did your soundtrack go out, baby?
- That's right.

1339
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,969
- Need some backup?
- I certainly do.

1340
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:04,150
<i>Amazing grace</i>

1341
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:09,556
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

1342
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:12,559
<i>That saved</i>

1343
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:20,200
<i>A wretch like me</i>

1344
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:26,740
<i>I once was lost</i>

1345
01:32:26,742 --> 01:32:32,379
<i>But now am found</i>

1346
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,849
<i>Was blind</i>

1347
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:43,557
<i>But now I see</i>

1348
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:50,030
<i>'Twas grace that taught</i>

1349
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:55,869
<i>Taught my heart to fear</i>

1350
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:59,039
<i>And grace</i>

1351
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:07,547
<i>My fears relieved</i>

1352
01:33:07,549 --> 01:33:11,451
<i>How precious</i>

1353
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:19,292
<i>Did, oh, did that grace appear</i>

1354
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:21,928
<i>The hour</i>

1355
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,265
<i>I first</i>

1356
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:30,670
<i>Believed</i>

1357
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:36,276
-<i>Amazing grace...</i>
- Oh, my God.</i>

1358
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:42,549
<i>How sweet the sound...</i>

1359
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,557
What the...

1360
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:58,164
You can't walk around here
like that... naked.

1361
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,900
Give me the flags.

1362
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,702
Wait. Please, stop.

1363
01:34:02,704 --> 01:34:04,270
Cover yourselves.

1364
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:08,074
<i>And grace</i>

1365
01:34:08,076 --> 01:34:13,213
- <i>Will lead us home...</i>
- That's better. There.</i>

1366
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:16,549
There.

1367
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:21,855
Mm. That's it.

1368
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:27,527
- <i>Amazing grace...</i>
- This will make you warm.</i>

1369
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:33,099
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

1370
01:34:33,101 --> 01:34:38,638
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

1371
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:43,977
<i>Like me</i>

1372
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:47,480
<i>I once</i>

1373
01:34:47,482 --> 01:34:50,083
<i>Was lost</i>

1374
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:55,555
<i>But now am found</i>

1375
01:34:55,557 --> 01:34:58,992
<i>Was blind</i>

1376
01:34:58,994 --> 01:35:06,466
<i>But now I see</i>

1377
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:13,606
<i>When we've been here</i>

1378
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:19,345
<i>10,000 years</i>

1379
01:35:19,347 --> 01:35:23,349
<i>Bright shining</i>

1380
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:31,357
<i>As the sun</i>

1381
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:37,197
<i>We've no less days</i>

1382
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:42,635
<i>For to sing God's praise</i>

1383
01:35:42,637 --> 01:35:45,805
<i>Than when</i>

1384
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:51,878
<i>We first begun...</i>

1385
01:35:56,084 --> 01:36:01,020
<i>Through many dangers</i>

1386
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:05,725
- <i>Toils and snares...</i>
- Hey.</i>

1387
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:09,662
- Here, honey. Pretty girl.
- <i>We have already...</i></i>

1388
01:36:09,664 --> 01:36:12,732
With a funky smell.

1389
01:36:12,734 --> 01:36:17,771
<i>Become</i>

1390
01:36:17,773 --> 01:36:23,777
<i>'Tis grace that brought</i>

1391
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:29,382
<i>Oh, brought me safe thus far</i>

1392
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:35,522
<i>And grace will lead...</i>

1393
01:36:35,524 --> 01:36:37,323
<i>Us home...</i>

1394
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:39,492
Oh, honey, you smell a little
ripe.

1395
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:47,200
<i>Amazing grace...</i>

1396
01:36:47,202 --> 01:36:50,603
- Yeah, you damn right I do.
- <i>How sweet</i></i>

1397
01:36:50,605 --> 01:36:53,106
<i>Sweet the sound</i>

1398
01:36:53,108 --> 01:36:57,310
<i>How sweet, sweet the sound</i>

1399
01:36:57,312 --> 01:37:03,116
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

1400
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,453
<i>Like me</i>

1401
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:09,756
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

1402
01:37:09,758 --> 01:37:15,361
<i>I once was lost</i>

1403
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:20,934
<i>But now am found</i>

1404
01:37:20,936 --> 01:37:24,037
<i>Was blind</i>

1405
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:32,078
<i>But now I see</i>

1406
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:35,915
<i>Was blind</i>

1407
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:42,856
<i>But now I see.</i>

1408
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,815
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

1409
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:11,184
How you doing, county?

1410
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:14,287
Anybody order some fireworks?

1411
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:16,222
Liberace. I love you, man!

1412
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,225
Shucks, I'm just glad to be
here.

1413
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,027
Hey, listen, man,
it was won'th every minute.

1414
01:38:21,029 --> 01:38:23,396
Every single minute!

1415
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:25,098
I just got one thing to say,
that's God bless America

1416
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,466
and long live the King!

1417
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:38,444
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!

1418
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:43,182
The King lives on.

1419
01:38:43,184 --> 01:38:44,884
- That was amazing.
- Well, thank you, sir.

1420
01:38:44,886 --> 01:38:47,487
- Thank you very much.
- Just amazing.

1421
01:38:47,489 --> 01:38:50,456
Thank you, sir!
Thank you very, very much.

1422
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,825
Say, I just wanted to ask you.
What's with these here flag ladies?

1423
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:54,460
They done smell like shit.

1424
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:58,097
I thought they were with your
show.

1425
01:38:58,099 --> 01:38:59,999
Oh, that's right.
They are part of my deal.

1426
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:02,402
- Yeah, I bring them along with me.
- Speaking of deals,

1427
01:39:02,404 --> 01:39:05,805
how would you like to join
Jerry Cleveland Enterprises?

1428
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:08,107
We do shows for county fairs

1429
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,810
in eight states
throughout the Southeast.

1430
01:39:10,812 --> 01:39:13,379
And it pays.

1431
01:39:13,381 --> 01:39:16,015
Why, yes, sir, I would.
I would, indeed.

1432
01:39:16,017 --> 01:39:19,319
Yes, I would! I would!
Thank you very much, sir.

1433
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:21,521
I made it!
I made it!

1434
01:39:21,523 --> 01:39:24,290
- Hey, handsome.
- Howdy.

1435
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,926
I caught your show.
I was pretty impressed.

1436
01:39:26,928 --> 01:39:28,661
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1437
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:31,831
So listen, I'm sorry
about all that stuff I said.

1438
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,433
- Are you now?
- Let's get outta here.

1439
01:39:33,435 --> 01:39:35,601
- Where we gonna go?
- Let's go home, baby.

1440
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:37,603
I am home. This is my home.
That's my home.

1441
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:39,138
Open road is my home

1442
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,774
'cause I'm signed on with
Jerry Cleveland Enterprises.

1443
01:39:41,776 --> 01:39:43,943
I may be doing at least
eight shows a week.

1444
01:39:43,945 --> 01:39:46,946
I'm gonna get paid money.
Real money.

1445
01:39:46,948 --> 01:39:49,482
- Whoo!
- You're just gonna leave me here?

1446
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:51,284
That's right.
Like you done did to me.

1447
01:39:51,286 --> 01:39:52,652
I'm just gonna leave you right
here.

1448
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,187
But you're gonna be
just fine, sweetheart.

1449
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:56,789
You know why? 'Cause you
got something that I don't.

1450
01:39:56,791 --> 01:40:00,326
- What's that?
- A kitty cat. Whoo!

1451
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:01,894
Well, I can find a man

1452
01:40:01,896 --> 01:40:04,263
and a place to stay in five
minutes.

1453
01:40:04,265 --> 01:40:06,332
All right. Whoa. Nothing.
That's freaky.

1454
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,601
Okay.
Take all the time you need!

1455
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:15,308
I hear you're looking
for a place to stay.

1456
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:19,379
I've got an open spot
if you need a few days

1457
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:21,214
to get your feet back on the
ground.

1458
01:40:21,216 --> 01:40:23,049
Well, thank you.

1459
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:26,052
I think I just might
have to take you up on that.

1460
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:29,756
Are you okay?

1461
01:40:29,758 --> 01:40:31,290
What happened to you?

1462
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:33,760
Just a little accident.

1463
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:38,164
Ladies, I've been looking for
you.

1464
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,233
Why don't you go and get in the
van?

1465
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:46,239
Don't worry.
You can ride up front.

1466
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:13,599
What do you mean
you ain't never ate a tater tot?

1467
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:15,802
I don't believe in them.

1468
01:41:15,804 --> 01:41:17,437
Believe in them...

1469
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,072
Christ's name.

1470
01:41:19,074 --> 01:41:21,374
Some people don't believe in God
or the tooth fairy.

1471
01:41:21,376 --> 01:41:24,077
You think you have the right to
dismiss the existence of tater tots.

1472
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:27,613
Every freezer section, every grocery
across this nation has tater tots.

1473
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:34,454
I do not believe in eating
processed potatoes.

1474
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:37,790
Well, ain't that something?

1475
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:41,894
Sometimes you come in here eating
pickled pig's ass out of a jar.

1476
01:41:41,896 --> 01:41:44,797
But now... now you too good
for tater tots.

1477
01:41:44,799 --> 01:41:47,300
- Now I've heard everything.
- Oh.

1478
01:41:47,302 --> 01:41:49,735
You know what?

1479
01:41:49,737 --> 01:41:51,971
Speaking of pickled pig's ass...

1480
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:55,074
I'd better be getting on home

1481
01:41:55,076 --> 01:41:57,677
before my old lady
get to raising sand.

1482
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,746
Go on, now.

1483
01:42:00,748 --> 01:42:02,915
Okay, then.
I'll see you in the morning.

1484
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,817
God willing.

1485
01:42:15,329 --> 01:42:16,596
- Hi there.
- How can I help you today?

1486
01:42:16,598 --> 01:42:17,797
Hi. How can I help you?

1487
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:20,500
I'm just looking for a baseball
bat.

1488
01:42:20,502 --> 01:42:22,101
Yeah, I got one of them.

1489
01:42:22,103 --> 01:42:24,036
I don't know.
It's here somewhere.

1490
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,838
I got one of them right here.

1491
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,212
That's the one I got.
It's the only one I got.

1492
01:42:33,214 --> 01:42:34,780
Right there.
That'll be $7.

1493
01:42:34,782 --> 01:42:37,717
Yeah?
This should work.

1494
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:39,819
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1495
01:42:39,821 --> 01:42:42,788
- Take a look at my truck out there.
- Oh.

1496
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:45,458
You like it?

1497
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,393
Hey, whoa...

1498
01:42:47,395 --> 01:42:49,128
You think you can
just get rid of your car

1499
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:50,730
and I wouldn't be able to find
ya?

1500
01:42:50,732 --> 01:42:53,199
There's only, like, five people
in this whole town!

1501
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,535
- You got to understand
something...

1502
01:42:55,537 --> 01:42:57,537
Oh! Don't do that. Shit!

1503
01:42:57,539 --> 01:43:00,806
Nobody flips me...

1504
01:43:00,808 --> 01:43:02,775
Get off!

1505
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:08,481
Oh, shit! Ow.

1506
01:43:08,483 --> 01:43:10,016
Shit.

1507
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:12,351
Oh, you sick little midget.

1508
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,654
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do it, Alton.

1509
01:43:14,656 --> 01:43:18,658
- Hell, you...
- He ain't won'th going to prison for.

1510
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,628
If I bury him deep enough,
nobody will know better.

1511
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:25,698
Come on, man. Ain't you
never seen "Forensics Files"?

1512
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,568
They can find molecules
of your ass hair

1513
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,103
and poop on stuff
I ain't even heard of before.

1514
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:32,638
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1515
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,707
I just know that
they always find the killer.

1516
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:37,076
Don't do it.
Come on.

1517
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:40,746
You get your ass outta here.

1518
01:43:40,748 --> 01:43:41,981
All right?

1519
01:43:41,983 --> 01:43:44,584
Unless you got a piece
of yellow brick road to pawn,

1520
01:43:44,586 --> 01:43:46,252
don't you come back
around here again.

1521
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:51,657
Fine.

1522
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:54,327
I'm three weeks late for a
business meeting in Atlanta

1523
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:56,095
because of you anyway.

1524
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:05,037
- Oh, Jesus.
- Damn.

1525
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:07,440
What in the hell was that about?

1526
01:44:07,442 --> 01:44:09,508
It's a long story.

1527
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:11,210
I gave him the finger.

1528
01:44:11,212 --> 01:44:13,879
He's been stalking me ever
since.

1529
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:16,015
Well, I guess it's a short
story.

1530
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:17,783
Shit.

1531
01:44:17,785 --> 01:44:20,620
Hey, how much
you give me on this?

1532
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:24,991
Uh... let me see.

1533
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,296
I'll give you 40.

1534
01:44:30,298 --> 01:44:32,064
Sold.

1535
01:44:32,066 --> 01:44:33,566
Here.

1536
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:59,525
<i>Left my coat and left my hat</i>

1537
01:44:59,527 --> 01:45:01,260
<i>Went down to the river</i>

1538
01:45:01,262 --> 01:45:03,629
<i>Sat at her bed</i>

1539
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:06,832
<i>I laid down, opened my eyes</i>

1540
01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:12,004
<i>Prayed to the heavens
and yelled at the skies</i>

1541
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:14,607
<i>Yelled at the sky</i>

1542
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:19,045
<i>I'm staring at the rain above
me</i>

1543
01:45:19,047 --> 01:45:22,415
<i>Down the barrel of a gun</i>

1544
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:26,185
<i>Praying for the gods to love
me</i>

1545
01:45:26,187 --> 01:45:30,256
<i>Praying for someone to love</i>

1546
01:45:30,258 --> 01:45:33,893
<i>Can I get someone to love?</i>

1547
01:45:38,532 --> 01:45:42,168
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah</i>

1548
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:49,241
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah</i>

1549
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:55,715
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah</i>

1550
01:45:55,717 --> 01:45:59,785
<i>I'm staring at the rain above
me</i>

1551
01:45:59,787 --> 01:46:03,222
<i>Down the barrel of a gun</i>

1552
01:46:03,224 --> 01:46:06,592
<i>Praying for the gods to love
me</i>

1553
01:46:06,594 --> 01:46:09,995
<i>Praying for someone to love</i>

1554
01:46:09,997 --> 01:46:16,001
<i>I'm looking at the river,
down the barrel of a gun</i>

1555
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:21,006
<i>Now I'm leaving
all my cares behind me</i>

1556
01:46:21,008 --> 01:46:24,310
<i>Leaving all my world's desires</i>

1557
01:46:24,312 --> 01:46:27,913
<i>When they come
and try to find me</i>

1558
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:31,183
<i>There won't be no me to find</i>

1559
01:46:31,185 --> 01:46:33,119
<i>'Cause I'm moving up the river</i>

1560
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:37,022
<i>Down the barrel of a gun</i>

1561
01:46:38,024 --> 01:46:41,527
<i>- Now I'm looking up the river
- Yeah, yeah</i>

1562
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:43,696
<i>Now I'm looking up the river</i>

1563
01:46:43,698 --> 01:46:47,333
<i>- Yeah, yeah
- Yeah, I'm looking up the river</i>

1564
01:46:47,335 --> 01:46:50,870
<i>- Yeah, yeah
- Now I'm looking up the river</i>

1565
01:46:50,872 --> 01:46:56,275
<i>Yeah, yeah, ooh</i>

1566
01:46:56,277 --> 01:46:59,478
<i>Ooh, yeah, yeah</i>

1567
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,380
<i>'Cause I'm looking up the
river</i>

1568
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:04,116
<i>Down the barrel of a gun.</i>

1569
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:21,934
where'd these stanky ladies
in the flags come from?

1570
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:25,104
They smell like something that done
flew out of a defecation device.

1571
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:27,139
I thought they were with your
show.

1572
01:47:27,141 --> 01:47:29,742
So where'd all these

1573
01:47:29,744 --> 01:47:31,444
stanky skanky flag ladies
come from?

1574
01:47:31,446 --> 01:47:33,112
They smell like something
that fell out of that goat.

1575
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:36,248
Say, can you tell me, who are all
these ladies wrapped up in flags?

1576
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,084
'Cause they smell like
someone yawned in Technicolor.

1577
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:40,820
- I've got a question to ask you.
- Yes, sir.

1578
01:47:40,822 --> 01:47:43,155
Why are all these naked ladies
wearing flags

1579
01:47:43,157 --> 01:47:44,657
and why do they smell like
doody?

1580
01:47:44,659 --> 01:47:46,592
You know what?
I got something that you don't.

1581
01:47:46,594 --> 01:47:49,061
- What's that?
- A tutti-frutti! Whoo!

1582
01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:52,465
I got me a star-spangled
blammer!

1583
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:55,034
Yeah!

1584
01:47:55,036 --> 01:47:57,703
A Yankee doodle dandy.
Whoo!

1585
01:47:57,705 --> 01:48:00,973
I got me a whop-bop-a-loo-bop
a- wham-bam-boom.

1586
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,742
And I'ma leave you here. And I
think that you should be careful.

1587
01:48:03,744 --> 01:48:05,077
You should be careful,
young missy.

1588
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:06,879
'Cause something that go
bump in the night gonna climb up

1589
01:48:06,881 --> 01:48:09,148
your little scoochy-cooch
and it's gonna find its way

1590
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,450
into that thing
that you got that I don't.

1591
01:48:11,452 --> 01:48:13,919
Hello, my lovely...

1592
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:17,590
We gonna fuckir...

1593
01:48:17,592 --> 01:48:19,458
kick your ass, Lamar.

1594
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:20,559
All right, Paul, let's...

1595
01:48:21,863 --> 01:48:23,529
Somebody could have said

1596
01:48:23,531 --> 01:48:25,865
- let's dial it back.
- Wow.

1597
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:28,033
Let's dial it...

1598
01:48:28,035 --> 01:48:30,169
This gurgling,
this ain't exactly normal.

1599
01:48:30,171 --> 01:48:32,505
I ain't taking his ass nowhere
and getting locked up. He's okay.

1600
01:48:32,507 --> 01:48:35,541
We can't just leave him here.

1601
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:38,077
- Look at that.
- Sorry.

1602
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:45,951
Okay, let's reset.

1603
01:48:45,953 --> 01:48:47,319
Get another one.
That was great, too.

1604
01:48:47,321 --> 01:48:50,856
I'm sorry, I lost it.
L... I'm a fucking bastard.

1605
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:52,424
It's not gonna be funny
when I really kill ya.

1606
01:48:52,426 --> 01:48:54,493
It's not gonna be...
it's not funny now,

1607
01:48:54,495 --> 01:48:57,296
but I don't know
why it made me... okay. Shh.

1608
01:48:57,298 --> 01:48:59,798
- Okay, we haven't turned around yet.
- Are we turning around?

1609
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,700
Fuck.
I'm sorry I lost it.

1610
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:02,968
No, it's okay.

1611
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:06,238
And cut.

1612
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:10,509
All right, cut, cut, cut.

1613
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:12,511
Gross!

1614
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:18,183
First carousel?

1615
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:31,497
Cut.

1616
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:22,067
Oh, Johnny,
you're the best.

1617
