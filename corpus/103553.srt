1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,828
Hey, Pete!
Hey, hold this.

2
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:36,385
I bought some sausage
to go with crackers

3
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,952
for Adrienne and me
because we made out last night.

4
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:43,125
Think she likes crackers?

5
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:45,252
I can't right now.
I gotta go. I'm in a hurry.

6
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:46,452
I bought French sausage

7
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:49,583
because I believe Adrienne's family
is of French descent.

8
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,183
Interesting. Look, I gotta go.

9
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,918
There should be plenty
if you want some later.

10
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:54,321
- Okay. Good luck.
- See you.

11
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:56,550
- You all right? Go!
- Wish me luck!

12
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,885
Last final.
Aced it, baby. Aced it!

13
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,113
Party time!

14
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,347
It all starts now.

15
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,147
Hey, I'm trying to study.

16
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,548
Booker, you finished
your last final yesterday.

17
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:15,345
I'm getting a head start
on next semester.

18
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,747
Wrong kind of head, little brother,
because today, you become a man.

19
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:23,249
No longer--get up--will you
look at yourself and see a little boy.

20
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,340
No longer will you cry in the shower
knowing no matter how hard you scrub,

21
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:31,869
you cannot rid yourself
of that most heinous of afflictions.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,909
- Virginity!
- I don't cry in the shower.

23
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:38,137
Settle down.

24
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,404
This is all a very complicated process,
so pay attention.

25
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:44,931
Chicks won't have sex with a guy unless
the guy's bagged at least four other chicks.

26
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,202
Girls are shallow and want
a guy with experience--like me.

27
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,897
How am I supposed
to have sex with a girl

28
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:53,871
if girls won't have sex with a guy
who hasn't had sex?

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,496
The same way all men have been
doing it for thousands of years.

30
00:02:56,573 --> 00:03:00,060
- The on-ramp to manhood--whores.
- I'm not going to a hooker!

31
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,693
- Don't you wanna be cool like me?
- You're not cool.

32
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,497
- Yes, I am.

- I'm not going to a hooker.

33
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,661
Look, I figured you'd try
and pussy out like this,

34
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:07,565
being the pussy that you are,
you pussy!

35
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,964
So I've already called an escort service,
your whore's on the way,

36
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:13,693
and I told everyone, so they're all gonna
think you're a homo if you don't do her.

37
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,323
I'm not giving
my special gift to a hooker.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,729
I'm in love with Rachel.

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,890
You're a fag!

40
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,594
Forget that prude.

41
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,151
And that's for calling virginity
your special gift.

42
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,591
If you must call it something,
call it your horrible shame,

43
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,990
because that's what it is,

loser ass.

44
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,289
Did you really tell everyone
you got me a hooker?

45
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,519
Yes.

46
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,853
Now, you're gonna have sex with
this whore, and you're gonna like it.

47
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,786
Merry Christmas.

48
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:50,218
Did you hear?
Styles got Booker a prostitute.

49
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,187
- No way.
- Yes, way! He told me himself.

50
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:53,585
Pete, you've gotta hear this.

51
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:56,142
- I gotta meet someone at the station.
- Friend from out of town?

52
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,709
We're carpooling home for break.

53
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:00,184
- What's with the Christmas tree?
- Foosball bought it.

54
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,514
We're not supposed to have
Christmas trees--it's a fire hazard.

55
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,743
But the R.A. went home,

so who cares?

56
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:05,874
Whatever. See ya.

57
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:09,279
No, I can't come down.

I'm waiting for someone here!

58
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:10,940
No, I can't!

59
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:13,509
Adrienne, did you hear
about the prostitute?

60
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,979
Yeah, Styles told me.

61
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,605
It's disgusting. I don't even think
we should let her in the house.

62
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,112
- I agree.
- Tony, did you hear?

63
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:22,010
Yes, I heard about the prostitute,
and, no, I don't care.

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,738
- But prostitution--
- You know what?

65
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,675
You two need to stay out
of other people's shit.

66
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,708
You need to get a life.

67
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,169
He's such an asshole.
I don't know why Claire's with him.

68
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,141
Yeah, what an asshole.

69
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,833
- Don't you think Tony's an asshole?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,135
- What's your problem?
- I kinda made out with Newmar last night.

71
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,604
I'm trying to avoid him.

72
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:46,596
I don't even need to tell you
how pathetic that is.

73
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,462
Maybe he'll forget about it
over Christmas.

74
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:54,333
- I doubt it. He's Jewish.
- How long are you here?

75
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,664
My last final's on Saturday.
I can't leave until then.

76
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,097
Come on, Lynne.
Let's go yell at Styles.

77
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,655
No prostitute is coming into this dorm
if I have anything to say about it.

78
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,062
- Hey, Adrienne.
- Gerri, how was the spelunking trip?

79
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,857
It was tough
but sort of interesting.

80
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:19,416
What's this?
From the university.

81
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,324
Maybe your appeal went through.

82
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:24,258
I wish. There's no way I'm getting
my scholarship back for next semester.

83
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:25,656
My grades were true shit.

84
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,714
- Who's the package from?
- I don't know.

85
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:32,723
I knew it. They rejected the appeal.
Oh, well. So much for college.

86
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,585
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't see that there's--

87
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,849
Have a great holiday, too.

88
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,480
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hi, Claire.

89
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:45,451
Gerri, I'm going to the gym.
It's cardio-abs day. Wanna come?

90
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,638
- That was close.
- Explanation?

91
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,704
I kinda borrowed Claire's
favorite handbag without asking,

92
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:02,111
and I have no idea where I left it.

93
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,170
I'm trying to avoid her
until I can find it.

94
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,712
Or maybe she'll forget
about it over Christmas.

95
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:08,637
Yeah, you're screwed.

96
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:12,477
Do me a favor? A foreign exchange
student's meeting me here soon,

97
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,874
but I have to run down to work.

98
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:16,307
- Could you meet her for me?
- I'd like to, but I got a lot of--

99
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,965
Hey, Wang.
Hey, have you seen Adrienne?

100
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,632
No. Could you do me a favor?

101
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,195
Yeah. Maybe later, buddy.

102
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,431
But--but...

103
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,031
- You lose his bag, too?
- We kinda hooked up last night.

104
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,092
Shut up!
I was depressed.

105
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:49,156
I was hitting on Foosball all night
and he was totally ignoring me.

106
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,290
- lsn't Foosball gay?
- No!

107
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,561
- Sure. I'm here for you.
- Thanks, Foos.

108
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,220
Her name's Dominique,
she's French,

109
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,525
and she's gonna call my phone,
so hang on to it.

110
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,721
Do you still have
my copy of Steel Magnolias?

111
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,919
Booker's got it, I think.
He and Rachel were watching it.

112
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:09,654
- By the way, you're gay, right?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:14,317
Suck one! It's a free country
and I can get a whore if I want to!

114
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,585
No, you can't.
It's against the law.

115
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,055
Yeah, you're going to jail, mister.

116
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,647
Suck one!

117
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:39,980
Oh, my God!

118
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,641
Did I just hit you?
I am so sorry!

119
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:43,876
It's okay.

120
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,573
I was just looking for my handbag.

121
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,240
Okay. Well, did I leave
my books in here?

122
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:53,973
I don't know. I didn't see them.
But you can look if you want.

123
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,978
I'm on the way
to the gym, okay? Bye, baby.

124
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,366
"Britney, hope this
takes care of things.

125
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,836
Call me if you need
anything else. Lorenzo."

126
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,499
- Yeah?
- Lorenzo?

127
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:36,726
Hey. no names.
So. you got the package?

128
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,232
- Yeah, it's just--
- Cool.

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,924
We're square. right?
We're good?

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,726
I think there's been
some kind of mix-up.

131
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,457
What are you saying?
Is there a problem?

132
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,190
Well, yeah. The bag isn't--

133
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:48,923
You know what? We shouldn't
talk over the phone.

134
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,791
Meet me at the university arboretum
in 15 minutes.

135
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:53,350
- Yeah, but--

- Center bench.

136
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,253
So, you lost
all your money in Vegas?

137
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,986
I had a system, you know?

138
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,554
- But it didn't work.
- Right.

139
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,923
- Then Beth broke up with me.
- 'Cause you lost all your money?

140
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,581
I lost all her money, too.

141
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,853
Whatever. Then there's
the thing with the cat.

142
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,511
I don't even wanna hear about the cat.

143
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,848
- It was an accident.
- I'm sure it was.

144
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,873
That's in the past, man. What time
are you gonna be done with work?

145
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,884
I'm done at 6:00.
Just hang out at my dorm.

146
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,507
It's co-ed. You'll like it.

147
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:29,049
No one's gonna bother me, right?

148
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:32,445
I'm really not in the mood
for conversation. Just wanna chill out.

149
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,914
Pete, can you do me a big favor?

150
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:37,038
Tell Foosball my foreign exchange
student doesn't speak English well.

151
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,376
Foosball, no English. Cool.

152
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,043
I gotta get to work.
Come on, let's go.

153
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,123
Britney.

154
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,115
Lorenzo?

155
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,215
What's the problem?
You're expecting more?

156
00:10:51,326 --> 00:10:53,314
Well, it's just that l...

157
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:58,186
What? Don't wanna talk in public?
I understand.

158
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,016
Got someplace private we can go?

159
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,383
- Yeah, like a restaurant?

- No, like private.

160
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,549
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you--

161
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:11,945
I think that guy
right there's watching us.

162
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,705
Let's go.

163
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,813
This is your target.

164
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,707
You seem a little nervous.

165
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:26,212
I understand. You're worried
about your performance.

166
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,803
But you know what?
I have a fail-safe cure for that.

167
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,368
I wasn't gonna
share this with you,

168
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,502
but what's
an older brother for, right?

169
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:34,771
This is my beat-off rag.

170
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,310
I've been beating off with this
since I was in sixth grade.

171
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:39,865
I've never washed it, either.

It brings me luck.

172
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:42,875
- Oh, God, no!

- Oh, Booker, yes.

173
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,271
- Before Dominique gets here--
- Who's Dominique?

174
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,000
Your whore, you idiot.

175
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,198
Did you lose your virginity
to a hooker?

176
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,103
Hell, no.

I don't have to pay for it.

177
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:52,933
But Dominique comes
highly recommended,

178
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,665
so I'll probably do her
once you're done.

179
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:58,766
I want you to jerk off with this
before she gets here, okay?

180
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:02,166
I call it Susie. Trust me,

you are gonna be a stallion. Take it.

181
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:03,293
No!

182
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,425
Don't be such a girl.
It's just semen! Take it!

183
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,863
What the hell was that?

184
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:12,290
Nothing.

185
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,663
- What's up?
- I think that rag cut me.

186
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:20,092
Can I get my copy
of Steel Magnolias back?

187
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:23,320
Hey, guys.
This is my friend Cliff.

188
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,725
He's from France,

he doesn't speak any English,

189
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,284
so don't bother talking to him.

190
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,790
Look. Cola.

191
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,481
Yeah, let's go.

192
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,887
You know, I just realized the amount
you sent is what I agreed to.

193
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:48,080
I think I was just thinking
of another job.

194
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,544
So, you're saying we're cool?

195
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:52,610
Yeah, we're cool.

I'll keep in touch.

196
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:58,143
Wait. What do you say
we hang and talk for a bit?

197
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,880
I've wanted to meet you
in person for a long time,

198
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,609
Miss Master of Disguise.

199
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,609
I gotta a couple choice jobs
I want to run by you

200
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,875
that I think we could pull together.

201
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,675
I got a shitload of stuff
I gotta take care of.

202
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,441
Fifteen minutes.

203
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,411
Come on.
It'll be worth your while.

204
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,034
All right. Fine.
Fifteen minutes.

205
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,068
But...here's the deal.

206
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:25,938
I've set myself up in a dorm.
My name is Gerri Farber.

207
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,669
Don't do anything to blow my cover.

208
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:40,805
Claire, we have got to stop that prostitute
from coming in this house.

209
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,860
Sure. Whatever.

210
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:45,199
I'm not gonna stand by and watch
the moral decay of this dormitory.

211
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,035
What happened to your face?

212
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:53,125
Tony hit me.

213
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,795
With the door.
He hit me with the door.

214
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,663
I'll see you guys later.

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,858
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Tony's beating Claire.

216
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,796
He hit her with the door?
That was a pretty lame cover.

217
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:07,660
Didn't I tell you there was
something up with him?

218
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:08,753
You did!

219
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:09,818
French?

220
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,453
You didn't want to talk to anybody,
now they won't bother.

221
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:14,789
I don't speak French, man.

222
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:16,953
Neither does anyone else
in this dorm, so who cares?

223
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:19,118
We leave tomorrow, anyways.
I'm late for work.

224
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,556
I should've been there
like five minutes ago.

225
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,252
Oh, crap. Foosball.

226
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:31,416
- Have you seen Foosball?
- He's in McFee's room.

227
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,648
- Can you tell him something for me?
- I'm thirsty.

228
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:37,987
Newmar! I need you to go
to McFee's room and tell--

229
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:41,247
and tell Foosball the girl he's
waiting for doesn't speak English.

230
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,979
Yeah, but after l--

231
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,542
- Okay, fine.
- Thanks.

232
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,504
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

233
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,773
We're on to you, wife beater.

234
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:06,570
- What?
- We're on to you.

235
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:12,109
You know, sometimes I hate

this place. I really hate this place.

236
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,604
So, how long did it take you
to set all this up?

237
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:21,833
Over a year.

238
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,469
How do you feel
about armored cars?

239
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:32,437
Take Suzie and go use her
in the bathroom.

240
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,231
- No.
- Take it, Booker.

241
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:37,599
- Leave me alone!
- Take Suzie--now!

242
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,157
Shut up!
I'm calling Rachel.

243
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:44,623
Rachel lives
down the hall, tard. Tard!

244
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,666
Will you go easy on him?
He's nervous.

245
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,789
You know this is
a no-smoking dorm, don't you?

246
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,126
Good thing Brady went out of town.

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,926
Hey, when the cat's away,
it's time to play.

248
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,460
Give this back to me.

249
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,987
I have to go use the can.

250
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:14,150
Okay, when he comes out,
I'll just tell him that I love him.

251
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,216
Not tell him that I love him.
Tell him that I want him.

252
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,085
That is much sexier.

253
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:21,943
Adrienne!

254
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:30,086
- Where's Foosball?
- In the can.

255
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,108
- Are you guys waiting for a girl?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:36,514
Okay, I'm supposed to tell you
that she doesn't speak any English.

257
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,244
- Awesome!
- Okay.

258
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,873
Wait! Does that mean
she's here already?

259
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,176
I don't know.

260
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,906
She's here!

261
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,105
She doesn't speak
any English, either!

262
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,668
- Be a man!
- Rachel. it's me.

263
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,262
God!

264
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:17,592
He's here.

265
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:20,727
Get off the damn phone, Booker.
Your whore is here.

266
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,760
Can I help you?
Who are you looking for?

267
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:33,766
- I am looking for--
- Beat it, Marla.

268
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,765
Hi. You Dominique?

269
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,190
Great. Follow me.

270
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,786
- That's the prostitute?
- Yes, now get lost.

271
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,886
I am Dominique.
I am student from France--

272
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,621
- Get out, tramp!
- What? I am from France.

273
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:51,953
Come on, Dominique.
Ignore her. She's a bitch.

274
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:53,854
- Come on.
- Bitch.

275
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:54,984
Lynne!

276
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,212
Come on.

277
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,181
Loser!

278
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,781
Go freshen up, okay?
I have to prep him.

279
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,047
Come on!

280
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,908
- Have you guys seen Adrienne?
- Screw off, Newmar.

281
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:18,180
We could tell Foosball
about the prostitute.

282
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:21,219
He'll be on our side.
Gay guys are really sensitive.

283
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:22,615
Have you seen the prostitute?

284
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,274
She looked like such a skank.

285
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,544
Exactly what I pictured
a call girl looking like.

286
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:29,310
- A prostitute?
- I am from France.

287
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,793
Two hours max.
Next job's across town.

288
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,065
I'll be out in a flash.

289
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,727
I miss you.

290
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,098
Yeah. me. too.

291
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,960
- Hey, how's it going?
- Not too bad.

292
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:17,661
Listen, has anyone ever said anything
to you about thinking I'm a wife beater?

293
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:18,722
What?

294
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,891
Never mind, man.

You doing anything?

295
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:24,056
Just waiting for Wang's foreign
exchange student to show up. Why?

296
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,791
Well, Adrienne and I have

this acting final on Saturday,

297
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,524
and I can't find her anywhere.
You wanna help me?

298
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:32,660
- What's it about?
- Just some melodramatic crap.

299
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,558
My character knocks up
Adrienne's character.

300
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,219
In this scene, it's us fighting.

301
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,620
I don't know what
to do with a baby.

302
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,183
It's driving me nuts!

303
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:43,723
Of course I want her
to have the abortion,

304
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,315
but she won't listen to me.

305
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,357
So, I've made it up
in my mind to dump her.

306
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,414
Oh, God! Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

307
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:53,388
Tony got clair pregnant and wants her to
get an abortion or he's gonna dump her!

308
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:54,786
Oh, my God!

309
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:59,051
Hello? Dominique.

310
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,277
All right,
I'll be right down.

311
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,177
I'll catch you later. If you see Adrienne,
tell her I'm looking for her.

312
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,969
What's wrong with you?
Stop being such a lame-ass.

313
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,205
Leave me alone!
I love Rachel!

314
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,133
- Hello?
- Who is this?

315
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,143
- Who's this?
- This is Wang.

316
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,539
I'm gonna give you to the count
of three to get out of there.

317
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,438
Booker. why are you
answering my phone?

318
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,838
- You're not mom!
- One...

319
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,136
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Two...

320
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,639
I was trying to reach Foosball to see
how things went with Dominique.

321
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,433
- Three.
- Everything go okay?

322
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,495
Stop pressuring me!

323
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,766
My arm is broken, Booker!

324
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,859
Booker! Oh. my God.

325
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:01,595
The bone is popping out!

326
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:05,029
I'm gonna faint.

327
00:21:05,102 --> 00:21:08,362
Mom's gonna kill me.
and it's your fault!

328
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,921
Booker. it's broken!

329
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,689
Sucker!

330
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:18,956
Dominique, I presume?

331
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:20,519
- That's me.
- Come in.

332
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:26,253
- So, you're French?
- Should I be?

333
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,724
- Yeah, that's what I was told.

- Then I'm French.

334
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,952
- Your English is wonderful.
- So is yours.

335
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,014
So, you just wanna wait for Wang?

336
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,581
Why wait?

337
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,817
I guess you could just come in with me,
or you could stay in his room.

338
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,150
Who has my money?

339
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,711
Money? I don't know anything
about any money.

340
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:46,447
Well, who's my guy?
Where is he?

341
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,351
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
He had to step out for a second.

342
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,778
God. This is great.

343
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:54,683
Why don't you wait in his room?
He'll be back any minute.

344
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:56,342
Okay, yeah. Whatever.

345
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:02,677
I'm just saving you from yourself.

346
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,569
I'm gonna go get
your whore. Okay?

347
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,211
Don't even think about trying
to make a run for it.

348
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:21,401
But how do you know
he's your soul mate?

349
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:25,009
I just know.
Kind of like you and Newmar.

350
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:29,235
What?! No, no. Last night
was an accident. That was--

351
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:33,830
Who is it?

352
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:35,838
It's Tony.
Is Adrienne in there?

353
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,565
Yeah. Hang on a sec.

354
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,365
I thought you might be Newmar.

355
00:22:44,438 --> 00:22:46,494
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

356
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,398
We really need
to work on this scene.

357
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,531
All right, let's get
down to business!

358
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,930
Where is Wang?

359
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:56,988
Wow. Your accent is awesome!
His wang is right in here.

360
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,895
There he is.

361
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,424
Be gentle, okay?
He's nervous.

362
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:05,690
Can you understand
what I say?

363
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:08,729
Where is Wang?
I want Wang.

364
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:10,791
Wow, you're an eager one.

365
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,793
See, Booker. Your brother

knows how to pick 'em.

366
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,916
All right, he is the one.
Him right there. Hello? Hi.

367
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:20,390
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, okay? Bye.

368
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,581
Okay, is there a problem here?

369
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:29,922
That's right, money is
always up front. How stupid.

370
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,477
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty,
one hundred. There you go.

371
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,611
All right? Knock 'em dead.

372
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:37,918
Okay, come on.

373
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:41,509
Knock it off, Styles.
Clearly she doesn't want to do this.

374
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,107
Listen, she's a whore.

They have no discretion.

375
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,173
This must be part of some little act.

376
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,478
Start grabbing her ass.

377
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,107
All right, something is obviously wrong.
Booker, go wait in the hall.

378
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,909
She must want to haggle.
I'll fix this.

379
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,336
Rachel, it's me.

380
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,433
So, maybe if you're naked
when he comes back in, that'll help.

381
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,977
Go for it.

382
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:10,642
That's right, you don't speak
any English. Okay, look.

383
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:13,738
Get it? Hello?

384
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:16,401
No? Okay.

385
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,230
All right.

386
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,536
Hi. Look at the birdie.

387
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:21,937
See, you just need to go--

388
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,401
I think I really got
a hold of my character.

389
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,102
- Don't tell her you saw me!
- What?

390
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,758
- How are you?
- Good.

391
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:40,126
- Check out my abs!
- Nice.

392
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,260
- Punch me in the gut.
- Give me a break.

393
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:46,163
Seriously, I'm feeling
ripped right now.

394
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,221
No, we got people in the hall.

395
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:50,229
Come on, don't be a weiner.

Just do it.

396
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,728
Fine, but you asked me
to do it--remember that.

397
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,285
Bring it.

398
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:57,450
Oh, my gosh!

399
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,220
I can explain.
She asked for it.

400
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:03,486
I'm sure they all ask for it, Tony.

401
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,889
I don't mean she asked like--

402
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,288
Honey, tell them
that you asked me to do it.

403
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,256
It's not what it looks like.

404
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:15,646
He's trying to give her a miscarriage.
We've got to get her out of here.

405
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,312
Okay, sure.
We believe you.

406
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,480
Can we have a word
with you alone, Claire?

407
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:22,315
Wait, explain to these nags
that I'm not beating you.

408
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:23,547
Goddamnit, tell them!

409
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,552
Quit trying to scare her into lying.

410
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,742
What was that all about?

411
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,841
Don't ask.
They're frickin' insane.

412
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,315
Why are you hiding?

413
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,543
Well, I accidentally stole
Claire's favorite handbag,

414
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:39,241
and then I kind of lost it.

415
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:40,645
The one her grandmother gave her?

416
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,078
She'll kill me if she finds out.
Don't tell her you saw me!

417
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:44,772
I'm still looking for it.

418
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:47,244
I won't say anything,
but I would find it if I were you.

419
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:51,540
Look, we gotta work on this scene.
I don't wanna look like an idiot.

420
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:55,168
Well, let me hold the script,
'cause I'm still a bit rusty on my lines.

421
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,267
Are you ready? Okay.

422
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,000
- You're not having that baby!
- Yes, I am!

423
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,399
Hey, sexy.

424
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:26,658
- I want you.
- I bet you do.

425
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:30,299
You know you're the only one
who's ever pleased me.

426
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,855
That's funny.
I've heard that before.

427
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,363
I need you to do it to me so hard.

428
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:35,863
Oh, I will.

429
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:37,897
I'm gonna give it to you so good.

430
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,520
Yes, you are!

431
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,891
I'm gonna lick every inch
of your gorgeous body.

432
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,424
I can't wait to get
my hands on those tits.

433
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,824
What?

434
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:56,017
Oh, no!

435
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:09,017
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

436
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:17,015
Wait. Stop. What about me?
What about me? Come on!

437
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,208
You don't need us.

438
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,273
You've got Suzie.

439
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:25,682
I don't want Suzie.

440
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,942
Girls!

441
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:35,969
What the...?
How'd I get in the closet?

442
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,607
Crazy French whore!

443
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,905
Booker! Booker,

get me out of here!

444
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,466
What's all this about?

445
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:46,531
This way.

446
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:54,164
Who's this?

447
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,399
Some goon Pete is friends with.
Don't worry, he doesn't speak English.

448
00:27:57,473 --> 00:28:00,631
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm pretty sure. Jackass?

449
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,534
Do you understand a word
I'm saying to you,

450
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:04,264
or is your brain pierced, too?

451
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,258
Perfect. Okay, about Tony,
we know what's been going on.

452
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:14,356
You guys think Tony's beating me,
right? That's what this is about?

453
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,229
- Don't try to lie about it.
- Or the baby.

454
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:17,789
We overheard him talking to Foosball.

455
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,263
We know he's beating you because he
doesn't want you to have the baby.

456
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,922
Well, honey, we're here for you.

457
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:23,688
What baby?

458
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:26,696
Claire...the one in your womb.

459
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:29,126
Seriously, Marla,
I'm not pregnant.

460
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:32,291
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

461
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:34,891
Tony must've been talking
about a different girl!

462
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:37,290
He's beating Claire
over the frustration over his mistress!

463
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,883
He's not beating me,
and no one is pregnant.

464
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,686
I'm gonna settle this, okay?

465
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:45,323
You guys just wait here,
and I'm gonna go talk to Tony.

466
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,079
So, I let Nick Stuckis

feel me up last Tuesday.

467
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:53,145
- Over or under the shirt?
- Under. What am l, 12?

468
00:28:57,588 --> 00:29:00,018
- You're not having that baby!
- Yes, I am!

469
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,582
Listen, bitch, you're gonna have
that abortion either way!

470
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:07,310
If you won't go to the clinic,
I'm gonna knock you down them stairs!

471
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:08,714
I can't believe you.

472
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:10,750
You think you could
just have sex with me

473
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,714
wheneveryou want
and not pay the price?

474
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,181
You are a loser!

475
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,646
And don't think I won't tell
your skanky-ass girlfriend!

476
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,975
Look, bitch, you won't tell her
a goddamn thing!

477
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,376
What's going on in there?

478
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:29,410
Nothing! I'm changing!

479
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,568
Don't open the door yet.
Hold on.

480
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:34,208
Tony, who's in there with you?

481
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:35,536
No one!

482
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,541
Can you come back later?
I'm looking for something.

483
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:42,404
Yeah, fine.

I'll come back later. Asshole.

484
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:44,564
Oh, shit. She's pissed.

485
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,271
I gotta go after her.
You can split, if you want.

486
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,291
I don't think
that makes you a slut.

487
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:12,091
Sometimes a bathroom stall
is all you can find.

488
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:19,385
It's Adrienne.

489
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,586
Tony's been messing around
with her behind my back,

490
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:23,490
and she is most certainly pregnant.

491
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:26,288
Wow. And she screwed around
with Newmar, too.

492
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,689
What a slut!

493
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,850
She wants to tell me,

but he threatened her if she did!

494
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:31,481
You need to confront her.

495
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,615
Let's go.

496
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,080
See, it's like clockwork.

497
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:56,639
Every Tuesday and Thursday, this truck
picks up between one and two mill--

498
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:59,113
Put it on pause
for a second there, chief.

499
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:02,080
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

500
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:05,979
Where is she?

501
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:08,036
- Who?
- Come on. Claire.

502
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,640
She went outside.

503
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:27,196
Marla, you moron.
Like I don't have my keys.

504
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,199
Shit, I don't have my keys.

505
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:34,694
Marla, open the door!

506
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:42,929
- Hi!
- Did you find her?

507
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:44,730
No. Are you sure
she went downstairs?

508
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:45,789
Yeah.

509
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:47,991
Is someone out there?

510
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,999
What? No. Why?

511
00:31:58,465 --> 00:31:59,862
Can you excuse me
for one minute?

512
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,222
Newmar, have you seen Adrienne?

513
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,019
Never mind.

514
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,183
What the hell?

515
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,291
I'm glad to see I'm not
the only one you're hiding from.

516
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:15,326
I'm not hiding from you.

517
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,014
Somebody open the door!

518
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:48,307
Well, if you're not
hiding from me, then...

519
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,871
that's great, because...

520
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:55,343
'cause I bought us a big sausage,
and...it's French.

521
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,842
You are
of French descent, right?

522
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,467
Look, Newmar,

about last night...

523
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,203
I was kind of drunk.

524
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:07,631
Yeah!

525
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:09,199
I was really drunk.

526
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,499
Yeah.

527
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,097
I like somebody else.

528
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,333
Is it me?

529
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:19,666
No, of course it isn't you.
It's somebody else.

530
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,136
Somebody who's not in this room
and is not you.

531
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,561
I see.

532
00:33:29,037 --> 00:33:30,195
You don't like me.

533
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:34,161
'Cause I'm weird
and I'm boring

534
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:36,224
and I'm unattractive
and I have really bad hair.

535
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,357
No, no.

It's 'cause of something else.

536
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,331
So, you mean there's more?

537
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:46,556
Newmar, someday you're gonna
find a girl that really likes you.

538
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,193
It just won't be me.

539
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:53,558
I'm sorry. I'm just glad we could
finally get this out in the open.

540
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:59,183
Okay, let me just show you
the sausage, 'cause it's really nice--

541
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:04,614
Newmar! I don't wanna share
anything with you, okay?

542
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,347
Just leave me alone.

543
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:09,850
Please.

544
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,187
My shirt.

545
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:20,344
Wait, wait, wait.

546
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:46,802
Dude, what's wrong?

547
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,141
I'm just kind of bummed out,
that's all.

548
00:34:51,412 --> 00:34:52,809
You wanna eat my sausage?

549
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,138
Excuse me?

550
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:57,869
I bought some really expensive
French sausage for Adrienne and l,

551
00:34:57,943 --> 00:34:59,999
but I don't think she wants any.

552
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:02,838
She doesn't like me.

553
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,430
It's French sausage?

554
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:07,767
Wang's foreign exchange student
Dominique--she's from France.

555
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,998
She has nothing to do
until Wang gets back from work.

556
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:13,525
Why don't you see if she wants
to eat with it you? She's so hot.

557
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:29,554
Hi. Are you Dominique?

558
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:31,926
It's about time.
What's been keeping you?

559
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:33,486
I don't know.

560
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,956
I didn't think it took me that long
to walk down here, but...

561
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:38,953
Did Foosball call you?

562
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,324
Foosball? I don't know.

563
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:45,149
Look, I gotta go soon,
so can we get this going?

564
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,818
- Yeah, sure.

- Where do you wanna do it?

565
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:52,120
Well, I was thinking the kitchen,
but here's fine with me.

566
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,782
Why don't you sit here?

567
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,845
So, did Foosball tell you
about my sausage?

568
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,119
Why don't you tell me
about your sausage?

569
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:12,777
- Well, it looks really tasty.
- I'm sure it is.

570
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:20,972
That's really nice.

571
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,537
Yeah? Well, I want you
to feel good, baby,

572
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:26,445
so tell me what you want.
What do you want me to do?

573
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:30,213
Well, I want--

574
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:32,677
Foosball said you might like
some of my sausage.

575
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:36,109
I'm sure I'm gonna love your sausage,
but what do you want me to do with it?

576
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:39,076
Eat it. What else is there
to do with it?

577
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:41,075
Anything you can think of.

578
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:43,802
But if all you want is oral,
that's fine.

579
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:47,301
- You don't have a knife, do you?
- I've got handcuffs.

580
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,068
I don't think those will cut anything.

581
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:51,129
I'm sorry.
That's one thing I don't do.

582
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,036
No cutting,
and no hitting, either.

583
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:54,572
No cutting?

584
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,366
Well, this sausage
is pretty damn big.

585
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,561
I doubt you'd want
the whole thing.

586
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:01,364
I can take it all, baby.

587
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:04,698
That would be pretty impressive to see,
but just in case you're wrong,

588
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,257
I thought you could keep the rest.

589
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,765
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- As a present.

590
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,623
You don't have anywhere
you could put it, do you?

591
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,196
You can put it
anywhere you want.

592
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,924
Even in my ass.

593
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:23,452
Why would I wanna put
my sausage in your ass?

594
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:24,928
Some guys like that.

595
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:28,119
The French.

596
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:32,354
I think we should stick to the mouth
as the only point of entry, if you get me.

597
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:36,189
Whatever floats your boat.

598
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,315
Except for you have to pay up front--
in case your friend didn't tell you.

599
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:41,414
Pay? Money?

600
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,979
Why would I pay you
to eat my sausage?

601
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:46,985
If you want me,
you have to pay.

602
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:51,316
Well, I'd prefer to just eat it
myself if that's your attitude.

603
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:53,310
Look, l...

604
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:59,079
Look, I'm sorry,
Dominique, but...

605
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,845
while it's obvious
that you have feelings for me,

606
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,577
my heart belongs to another.

607
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:06,139
I don't know
what is customary in France,

608
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,875
but here in America,

609
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,437
when someone offers
to share their food with you,

610
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:12,845
you don't demand money.

611
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,902
Food?

612
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:17,944
You gotta help me find her.
Something's gone wrong.

613
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:20,342
Find heryourself.
She's your hooker.

614
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:23,572
- I never wanted her.
- Fine, you ungrateful bastard.

615
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:25,973
I will find her,

but this time around,

616
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:29,372
you don't get to have sex with her
because she's mine now!

617
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,630
Fuck!

618
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,903
Booker, I'm so happy you didn't
make love to that call girl.

619
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:41,269
I'm saving my special gift
for you, Rachel. You know that.

620
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,066
Oh, Booker.

621
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:21,753
No, no, no.

622
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,417
There you are. Come here.
I gotta talk to you.

623
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,418
- What is it?
- Remember the package I got?

624
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:44,081
Don't worry about him. I think that's
Wang's foreign exchange student.

625
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:45,709
He doesn't speak
a word of English.

626
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:49,316
The package wasn't for me.
It was for some girl named Britney.

627
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,874
Britney? Britney Spears?

628
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:54,474
No. They must've put the package
in the wrong mailbox or something.

629
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,606
There was a purse in it
with a phone number.

630
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,841
I tried to return the purse
to some guy Lorenzo

631
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:02,368
who's a drug dealer or a con artist,
and he's upstairs in my room right now.

632
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:05,571
And there's a bunch of money
hidden in the bag.

633
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:09,043
- How much money are we talkin' about?
- There must be like $30,000.

634
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,103
Bad.

635
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,336
Bad, you know?
Is sour.

636
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,005
Did Newmar find you okay?

637
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:21,064
I need to talk to you.
I think there's been some mistake.

638
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:23,300
- What do you mean?
- Have you seen Adrienne?

639
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,999
- No.
- You! That's the prostitute Styles got!

640
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:28,198
- Styles McFee--that was his name.
- Who is this?

641
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:30,965
Wang's foreign exchange student.
She's from France.

642
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,560
You know what we should do?
Call the police.

643
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:36,262
Prostitution is very illegal.
They would arrest her and Styles.

644
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:38,862
So, you're from France?

645
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:44,889
There's this guy here--
Cliff, I think, is his name.

646
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:46,956
He's French and
doesn't speak a word of English.

647
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:48,192
We should introduce you.

648
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,024
We need to do
something about that whore.

649
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:56,427
If you don't see me in ten minutes,
call my room.

650
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,395
If I say,
"No, I can't make it to the party,"

651
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:01,292
then I need you
to help me get rid of him.

652
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,351
Okay.

653
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:13,784
Help! Need Wang.

654
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:18,256
What the fuck!
I don't speak no English! French!

655
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,009
So long! Good bye.

656
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,775
Hi, Claire.

657
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:41,043
Remember--"No, I can't

make it to the party."

658
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:43,706
- You and I need to talk.
- I know.

659
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,112
We'll leave you two alone.

660
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,212
- Let's talk in here.
- Okay.

661
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:50,836
I'm not sure where he is.

662
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,236
There he is! Cliff!

663
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,701
I found you a friend!

664
00:41:58,778 --> 00:42:00,538
Have anything
you'd like to confess?

665
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,004
You found out what I did?

666
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:05,134
This is gonna be good.

667
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,107
I want you to know
I am really sorry.

668
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:10,971
You're sorry? I hope you know this is not
something you can just apologize for.

669
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,370
You can't take this back.

670
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:15,167
- Are you really this mad?
- Shouldn't I be?

671
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,864
I realize it was kind of uncool
of me, but it's not that big a deal.

672
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:19,926
Are you kidding?

673
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,061
I shouldn't borrow things
without asking,

674
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,534
but I really needed it,
and I thought you'd say no.

675
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:27,500
- I only wanted it for one night.
- You call that borrowing?!

676
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,967
And of course I'd say no!

677
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:31,330
I don't care how bad
you needed it, you slut!

678
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,424
Excuse me?!
Who are you calling a slut?

679
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:36,091
Oh...you, slut!

680
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,654
Look at you. You want
everybody to know about it.

681
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:39,891
With Tony's shirt on.

682
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,089
Okay, I didn't ask
to borrow this, either, but...

683
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:45,618
Newmar spilled something on my shirt,
this guy was staring at my boobs--

684
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:48,663
How many guys do you have
on the side, tramp?

685
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,785
Okay, I don't care
what the hell I did,

686
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:55,020
if you call me a slut or a tramp
one more time,

687
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,490
I'm gonna slap you
upside the head, bitch.

688
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:17,977
You guys!

689
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,849
Come on, you two.
Don't be shy.

690
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:31,713
Menage a tois ever?

691
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,205
I'll leave you two alone.

692
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:58,502
Where the hell is everyone?!

693
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:02,302
So you don't speak
any English, do you?

694
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,395
- Hello?
- Hello.

695
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:16,297
- Yeah?
- Mona, it's me--Dominique.

696
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:18,630
- What's up?
- God, I'm in a fix.

697
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:22,689
I've been confused with a foreign
exchange student. They think I'm French.

698
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:24,926
They've got me in this room
with this weird French prick.

699
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,056
How did that happen?

700
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:30,188
They think the real foreign exchange
student is the working girl instead of me.

701
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:33,423
- Did your guy pay you?
- No, I never got the money.

702
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:35,325
I never found the guy
who ordered me.

703
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:37,725
- Where's Ted?
- What the--

704
00:44:38,696 --> 00:44:39,786
Excuse me?

705
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:45,925
Let's get everything
out in the open.

706
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:48,822
You're not French, and I speak
American just fine, right?

707
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:52,784
This is so perfect.
You're like a pro, right?

708
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,187
Like, a hooker?

709
00:44:56,857 --> 00:45:00,912
Just let me leave. I don't know
what you're after, but I don't do freebies.

710
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,475
What if I had
a proposition to make?

711
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:06,485
- How much you got?
- No. A different kind of proposition.

712
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,211
Like a partnership.

713
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:12,116
What if I said I knew
where we could get $30,000?

714
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:14,374
Okay.

715
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,139
Thanks.

716
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:25,010
So, I guess I'm gonna go back
to my room and finish getting ready.

717
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:27,069
- Wait, Foosball.

- Yeah?

718
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:33,070
Nothing.

719
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:34,303
Never mind.

720
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,439
I suck!

721
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,098
If there's a stack of money in this house,
and you know who has it,

722
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:46,503
why do you need a partner?

723
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,063
Why not keep it for yourself?

724
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:51,799
You're right. I don't need a partner.
What the hell was I thinking?

725
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:54,429
Psych!

726
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:57,567
No, no. Seriously.

727
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,899
The plan I have
needs two people.

728
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,901
One of them should be
a pretty girl.

729
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:05,627
Two--my friend lives here.
It puts me in a weird place.

730
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:07,667
But you--nobody knows
who you are.

731
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:09,758
So, what's the plan?

732
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,657
First we gotta write a note
to this girl Gerri.

733
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:14,588
That's it!

734
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:18,357
I'm too chicken to tell Foosball
that I like him to his face...

735
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:20,157
I'll just write him a love letter.

736
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:22,789
Why didn't I think of it before?

737
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:25,757
I'll write Adrienne
a romantic poem!

738
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:32,752
"l will not be happy until we can
be together. Yours truly, Adrienne."

739
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,548
What do you guys think?
It's missing something, right?

740
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:41,853
Perfume! Good idea, Oliver.

Where's that sample?

741
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:51,819
Claire's bag!
This'll get her off my back.

742
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:09,378
"...and like a rose in the sun,

so are you."

743
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,275
That's good stuff.

744
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:22,643
- What you got behind your back?
- My back?

745
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,702
Nothing.

746
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:30,340
Okay...what are you doing?

747
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:31,897
Going to the bathroom.

748
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:35,164
All right.

749
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:44,234
"Love...Newmar."

750
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:57,823
Thank God!

751
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,865
I'll go downstairs
and call her from that phone.

752
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:02,454
You go upstairs and get
that goon out of the room.

753
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:05,258
Also, remember to leave the note

so she can see it.

754
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:08,058
Here's what the note says--

755
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,720
"l know everything.
Decided to leave.

756
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:12,955
"Just give the bag
to my associate

757
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:15,187
who's waiting at the front
of your building."

758
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:18,926
Wait, are you sure your pimp's
not gonna look in the bag?

759
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:21,458
He's not my pimp, smart ass.

760
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:38,079
Sorry!

761
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:40,812
Are you okay?

762
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,913
Okay.

763
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,076
Shoot!
Where did it go?

764
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:00,846
Listen, some girl's gonna come
out here and give you a bag.

765
00:49:00,914 --> 00:49:02,311
Hold on to it for me.

766
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,706
And don't look inside!

767
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,143
And, who knows,

if we do this job together,

768
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,676
maybe you and I can--

769
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:14,572
No attachments. I don't get
involved with people I work with.

770
00:49:14,643 --> 00:49:16,631
And you never make
an exception?

771
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:24,069
- Hello?
- Hello. Gerri Farber?

772
00:49:24,774 --> 00:49:27,705
- Yes?
- I have a package downstairs.

773
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:30,465
Could you please
come down here and get it?

774
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:33,059
- Okay.
- See you in a jiffy.

775
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:41,427
I'll be right back. There's a delivery
for Gerri Farber at the front door.

776
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:54,920
"Dearest, here is a poem
I've written for you.

777
00:49:54,997 --> 00:49:56,394
"Your beauty fills...

778
00:49:57,597 --> 00:49:58,755
Love, Newmar"?

779
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:21,778
Excuse me,

I foreign exchange student.

780
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,343
Could you help me
with something?

781
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:28,011
It only take a second,
okay? Yeah?

782
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:29,416
You should find somebody else.

783
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:33,884
But I need someone strong
to help carry something for me.

784
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:38,609
My back hurts when I bend down
to pick up things. See?

785
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,138
- Yeah, I see.

- Yeah.

786
00:50:42,216 --> 00:50:45,442
- All right. Let's go. This way?
- This way. Okay.

787
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:57,201
For me?

788
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:01,242
"l know everything.
Decided to leave.

789
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,763
Give the bag to my associate who's
waiting at the front of your building."

790
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,534
Claire is insane about this bag.

791
00:51:19,571 --> 00:51:22,559
- Hello?
- It's me. man. What's up. Pete?

792
00:51:22,637 --> 00:51:23,795
Pete's not here, man.

793
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:28,093
Am I supposed
to give you the bag?

794
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,156
- I'm the guy.
- Well, here you go.

795
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:31,722
And I don't know who you are,

796
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,958
but you better tell that stupid bitch
to stay out of my way!

797
00:51:38,532 --> 00:51:40,690
...the girls in your dorm--
maybe they'd be up for it.

798
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,252
What are you talking about?!

799
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,318
I can look in the bag
if I want to.

800
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:53,920
I'm loving this color.

801
00:51:56,692 --> 00:52:00,952
Super for you, dude, but I'm
not Pete, and I'm going. Bye.

802
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,245
Yeah!

803
00:52:10,055 --> 00:52:12,282
Einstein, our plan worked, man!

804
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:16,677
I'm just good for genius.
Genius!

805
00:52:18,653 --> 00:52:19,640
Here.

806
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,640
Look at time!

807
00:52:23,718 --> 00:52:25,706
I have to go, okay?

808
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:27,475
But--but...

809
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:31,972
What the...

810
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:36,376
- Well?
- We did it! Oh, baby!

811
00:52:36,447 --> 00:52:39,105
Don't spoil things.
Let's just get the bag.

812
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,098
Maybe you got it wrong, Einstein.

813
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:57,105
It's bullshit, man! There was

supposed to be money in that bag.

814
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,764
Ted, did you take anything
out of this bag?

815
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,362
No. I didn't even look inside.

816
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,496
- And a girl gave it to you?
- Yeah.

817
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:06,128
And she said to tell
that stupid bitch to stay out of her way.

818
00:53:06,204 --> 00:53:08,260
Stupid bitch?

819
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,498
Maybe she's on to us and that's
a dummy bag, you know?

820
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:14,295
- Is there a problem?
- Shut up, Ted.

821
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,095
Look, we gotta go soon.
We got other appointments.

822
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:20,065
Didn't you hear me tell you
to shut up the first time?

823
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,598
Now get rid of this!

824
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:25,153
Nobody calls me a stupid bitch.
We're getting that bag.

825
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:32,721
Just let it out!
Go for the eyes!

826
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:33,852
Focus!

827
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:44,657
- I don't think she wants to see you.
- Shut up!

828
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,352
- Claire, what the hell

is going on?

829
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,822
How could you cheat on me?!

830
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:52,481
Why do you listen to these two ho-bags?
I've never cheated on you!

831
00:53:52,557 --> 00:53:56,215
I overheard you and Adrienne,
and then she admitted it to me!

832
00:53:56,289 --> 00:53:58,117
- You got her pregnant!
- What?!

833
00:53:58,188 --> 00:54:01,448
Oh! No! Look, that's a scene

for our acting class.

834
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:03,110
In the scene, I get her pregnant.

835
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:05,448
- You expect her to believe that?
- Suck my balls!

836
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,042
- Get a clue, loser!

- Wait.

837
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,412
Why would Adrienne admit it
to me if it was just a scene?

838
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:12,746
You must've confused her.

839
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:15,748
She's been hiding from you
because she lost your favorite purse.

840
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:19,107
What?! She stole
grandma's handbag?

841
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:22,340
Claire, I can prove to you
that we were just doing a scene.

842
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:24,072
Meet me in my room
in five minutes.

843
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:26,408
I'll find Adrienne
and I'll grab the script,

844
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,468
and this could all
be explained, all right?

845
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:30,772
Meet me in my room.
Five minutes.

846
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,199
You're not gonna go, are you?

847
00:54:34,177 --> 00:54:36,039
Maybe I should hear
what he has to say.

848
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,138
I can't believe Adrienne
had sex with your boyfriend

849
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,071
and stole
your favorite handbag.

850
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,630
What a klepto-slut!

851
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,436
You look cute
when you're mad!

852
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,663
I've got a plan to get rid of this guy.

853
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:56,395
but I need you to keep this bag
for me until he's gone.

854
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:57,800
You're keeping the money?

855
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,959
- Doesn't it seem a little dangerous?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. anyway.

856
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:03,263
There's no way he can track me
all the way to San Francisco.

857
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:05,562
And he thinks the money
is mine. anyway.

858
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:08,792
Just hold on to this for dear life,

and I'll give you some for helping me.

859
00:55:08,866 --> 00:55:10,922
- Shit, okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

860
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,253
This kind of looks like Claire's bag.

861
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,724
Where's the bag?

862
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:31,257
The bag? Isn't it here?

863
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:33,257
- Who was at the door?
- No one.

864
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:36,584
No one?
Well, that's interesting.

865
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,517
Because here's the thing--
while I was waiting for you to return,

866
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:43,248
I noticed that bag was missing,
and I got to thinking--

867
00:55:43,322 --> 00:55:46,287
what if you really
are Gerri Farber and not Britney,

868
00:55:46,354 --> 00:55:47,842
and now you're scamming me?

869
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:50,351
What are you talking about?
I am Britney.

870
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,907
And, you know, the bag
was here when I left.

871
00:55:53,985 --> 00:55:56,313
You sent the package,
remember?

872
00:55:56,385 --> 00:56:01,077
It's my money, so maybe I should
be asking you where the money is.

873
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,637
I really don't care
what you think right now,

874
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:05,772
because I know
I didn't take it!

875
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:07,337
And I know I sent it!

876
00:56:07,415 --> 00:56:10,403
But what I don't know
is if you're who I sent it to.

877
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,499
Hey, it's me.

878
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:28,862
You've seen Britney before, right?
What does she look like?

879
00:56:30,108 --> 00:56:32,470
When she's not
in disguise, idiot!

880
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:44,659
I guess you check out.

881
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:46,763
Sorry I doubted you.

882
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:50,494
It's fine. I can find the bag myself,
so why don't you just leave?

883
00:56:50,568 --> 00:56:51,555
No.

884
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:56,490
You left the bag with me, and, clearly,
somebody called you out as a distraction.

885
00:56:56,566 --> 00:57:00,394
I shouldn't have left the bag alone,
so this is my fault and I'm gonna fix it.

886
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:03,519
I think I knowwho took it.

887
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,660
I'll be right back.

888
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,420
Adrienne, open up!

889
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,284
Come on!

890
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:15,354
Shit!

891
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:22,588
Where the hell is my script?!

892
00:57:22,658 --> 00:57:23,714
Shit!

893
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:28,816
Gerri, sorry to bug you, but you were
Garber's T.A. Iast semester, right?

894
00:57:29,423 --> 00:57:31,479
Can I have her home number?
I need to call her.

895
00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:32,611
Sure.

896
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,776
- Don't tell her where you got it from.
- Thanks.

897
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:44,214
You have no idea how much
of a huge jam this will get me out of.

898
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:46,714
- Help!
- What?

899
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:48,306
I'm from France. Help!

900
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,741
Man! There sure are a lot
of girls from France around here.

901
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:54,802
Hey, maybe you'd like my sausage.

902
00:57:57,747 --> 00:58:00,735
Look, here you go. You can keep it.
I don't even want it anymore.

903
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:03,607
But I'm gonna tell you this--
I am not gonna pay you to eat it.

904
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:05,666
I don't care what they do in France.

905
00:58:05,745 --> 00:58:08,539
- Need help!
- Help with what? Opening it?

906
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:11,801
There you are!
Come here!

907
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:14,364
She was just about
to eat my sausage!

908
00:58:14,442 --> 00:58:17,339
Too bad! I'm the one
who paid for her! Come here!

909
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:18,566
Where you going?

910
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:24,465
Man! What's the deal with everyone
paying the French to eat their food?

911
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:28,570
- There you are.
- Hey, Foosball.

912
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,796
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that you were gay?

913
00:58:30,871 --> 00:58:32,995
Well, I had to--what?!

914
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:36,058
I'm really flattered
that you'd come out for me, but...

915
00:58:36,136 --> 00:58:37,396
you're just not my type.

916
00:58:37,468 --> 00:58:38,763
I'm not gay!

917
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,731
No, don't go back in
just because I'm rejecting you.

918
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,390
Someday, you're gonna find a guy
who really likes you.

919
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:46,624
It just...
it's not gonna be me.

920
00:58:47,265 --> 00:58:49,729
I'm sorry. I'm glad
we got this out in the open.

921
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:51,456
Well, what the hell.

922
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:53,462
What don't you like about me?

923
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,926
Newmar, listen.

You're a great guy, okay?

924
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,482
I just...I don't like you like that.

925
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:01,617
But I think I may know
someone for you.

926
00:59:02,594 --> 00:59:03,650
Yeah.

927
00:59:13,057 --> 00:59:14,283
I don't see Adrienne.

928
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:17,946
I couldn't find her. I'm actually
calling my professor right now.

929
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,611
She'll explain what the scene is about.

930
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,415
- You've reached Proffessor Garber...
- Damn. It's her voicemail.

931
00:59:25,919 --> 00:59:27,474
I smell perfume.

932
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,741
"My love...

933
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,936
"You have no idea how much
I desire to be with you.

934
00:59:50,012 --> 00:59:52,670
"l think about you day and night
and dream of you.

935
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:55,107
"l need to share my life,
love, and soul with you.

936
00:59:55,177 --> 00:59:58,108
"l will not be happy
until we can be together.

937
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:59,800
With love, Adrienne."

938
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:01,465
What?!

939
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:05,563
No! I--wow.
I've never seen this before.

940
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:09,300
Look, Gerri wrote my acting
teacher's number on the back.

941
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:11,804
See? Here's the number.
This is Gerri's letter.

942
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:15,268
Why would Adrienne
write Gerri a love letter?

943
01:00:15,338 --> 01:00:16,803
Maybe they're lesbians.

944
01:00:17,471 --> 01:00:20,459
Pretty lame.
Fuck off, Tony!

945
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:24,129
Come on.
I can explain, baby!

946
01:00:27,568 --> 01:00:29,760
I know you're
around here somewhere!

947
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,890
Damn!

948
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,086
Buddy, seen a pretty girl
around here with a funny accent?

949
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:39,027
Yeah. I've been looking for her
'cause she has my money.

950
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:40,858
Your money?
That ain't your money.

951
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,952
Fuck off.
Who the hell are you?

952
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:01,147
Well?

953
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:03,644
Well, what?

954
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:07,447
What'd you think of the letter?

955
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:10,781
How'd you know about Newmar's letter?
Newmar wrote me a love letter.

956
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:13,284
- He's come out of the closet.
- Newmar's gay?

957
01:01:13,354 --> 01:01:16,251
It's so cute. I had to turn him
down, though. Obviously.

958
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,113
Yeah. Obviously.

959
01:01:18,185 --> 01:01:21,343
I'm so happy to finally have someone
to go clubbing with in this dorm.

960
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:25,711
Being surrounded by all you breeders
was really getting me down--no offense.

961
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,179
You're gay?

962
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:29,240
Are you sure?

963
01:01:29,315 --> 01:01:32,802
- You didn't know I was gay?
- Yeah, of course I did. It's just...

964
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:35,810
Newmar's gay?

965
01:01:35,879 --> 01:01:38,037
I almost wish
I were attracted to him.

966
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:42,202
He wrote the sweetest poem.
Here. Check it out.

967
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:47,932
What did you do?!

968
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:52,430
I'm not sure how this guy's connected,
but he knows about the money.

969
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:55,301
- I know this guy. I don't--
- Trust me. He knows something.

970
01:01:57,373 --> 01:01:59,600
"Our love could be
a delightful bloom.

971
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:01,500
"From the beginning,
I already knew.

972
01:02:03,204 --> 01:02:06,396
Like a rose in the sun,

so are you."

973
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,262
I wish somebody would write
a poem like that for me.

974
01:02:15,234 --> 01:02:17,562
- I read your poem.
- You did?

975
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,462
- But I thought I gave it to Foosball.
- He let me read it.

976
01:02:21,765 --> 01:02:22,923
I loved it.

977
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:25,754
Really?

978
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,420
It all makes sense now.

979
01:02:27,496 --> 01:02:30,052
You only made out with me
'cause you were confused--

980
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:31,185
'cause you're gay.

981
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:34,126
No, it's okay. We can
hang out now. We can shop!

982
01:02:34,195 --> 01:02:37,160
We can hang out 'cause...
I'm gay.

983
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:39,351
I've always wanted a gay friend.

984
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:41,852
Now that I know
that you're gay...

985
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,220
you suddenly seem
more attractive.

986
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,483
Great.

987
01:02:46,557 --> 01:02:48,317
Your whole personality
makes sense now.

988
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,446
Apparently,
I'm still ugly, though.

989
01:02:50,523 --> 01:02:52,579
I'm sorry
Foosball turned you down.

990
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,753
Maybe if you took off
these thick glasses.

991
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:01,477
You have really nice eyes,
Newmar.

992
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,376
Thanks.

993
01:03:04,419 --> 01:03:06,145
I just wish they worked better.

994
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,239
I really loved your poem.

995
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:17,110
So, you do have my bag?

996
01:03:17,181 --> 01:03:19,907
This is not your bag!
I gave your bag back!

997
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:22,071
You lying slut!
You never gave it back!

998
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:24,475
- Give it back, you psycho!
- What?!

999
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:30,099
My glasses!

1000
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,068
Hello?

1001
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,535
This fuckin'--

1002
01:03:39,974 --> 01:03:42,302
Claire. This is perfect.
I just got ahold of my professor--

1003
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:44,531
Tell Adrienne
you haven't seen me.

1004
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:49,228
She went that way.

1005
01:03:57,535 --> 01:03:59,023
Is she gone?

1006
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:03,524
- Come on, let's call the professor--
- I don't have time now.

1007
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,030
Adrienne's gone insane.
She's trying to attack me!

1008
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:08,291
I have proof at my fingertips
that I'm not lying.

1009
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:12,193
She's coming! Hold on to my bag
until I get back, then I'll listen to you.

1010
01:04:16,096 --> 01:04:17,425
I see you!

1011
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:20,027
- She went that way.
- I know!

1012
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:54,510
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

1013
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:58,145
You know what?
Let me get you some help.

1014
01:04:58,217 --> 01:05:02,614
No, I just need to lay down.
Take me into the room.

1015
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,206
Yeah, okay.

1016
01:05:08,014 --> 01:05:09,502
You're heavy.

1017
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,066
Hello?!

1018
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:26,539
What happened to you?
Why are you wet?

1019
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:29,265
I don't know, but...

1020
01:05:30,706 --> 01:05:32,967
Maybe I should get
out of these wet clothes.

1021
01:05:35,238 --> 01:05:39,566
Wait. No, no, no...

That would end up bad for me.

1022
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,191
I'll go get you a towel.

1023
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:52,825
What are you doing?

1024
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:56,527
I was just admiring your bag.

1025
01:05:58,632 --> 01:06:00,290
I think I should hold on to this.

1026
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:04,860
- What are you doing?
- I'm just admiring the bag!

1027
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,155
What the hell?!

1028
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:09,253
Give me the bag!

1029
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:11,792
Crazy mother--

1030
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,849
Enough already, all right?

1031
01:06:16,926 --> 01:06:18,914
Who the hell are you,
and what the hell's going on?

1032
01:06:18,992 --> 01:06:21,184
We're wasting time!
Somebody will find it!

1033
01:06:21,258 --> 01:06:24,087
That's my girlfriend's bag.
Her grandmother gave it to her.

1034
01:06:24,156 --> 01:06:26,484
It's not. Why would your girlfriend
have a stack of cash?

1035
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:28,453
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.

1036
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:31,008
And I'll give you half
if you help me get out of this dorm!

1037
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,348
Right.

1038
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,676
- How much is half?
- $500.

1039
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:38,810
Let's go.

1040
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:42,509
I don't know anything about a bag.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1041
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:45,344
I assume you're
Dominique's pimp or whatever,

1042
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:47,176
and I don't know
what she told you,

1043
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,373
but we didn't even have sex with her,

so we shouldn't have to pay.

1044
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:52,871
You wanna work him over?

1045
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,935
He doesn't know anything.
Just put him back downstairs.

1046
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,369
Is that you?

1047
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:00,575
Whatever you say.

1048
01:07:03,445 --> 01:07:05,909
I'm still chucking him outside
just to be safe.

1049
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:08,806
I really don't think the bag
would've fallen all the way down here.

1050
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:10,534
Well, just look for it!

1051
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:16,033
You idiot!
Now we'll never know where it is!

1052
01:07:16,107 --> 01:07:17,265
Why are you yelling at me?

1053
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,861
You're the one who came to me
with the money and--

1054
01:07:19,939 --> 01:07:21,870
Well, I never!

1055
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:29,295
- Who the hell was that?
- Some meatball who got fresh.

1056
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,164
So what took you so long?

1057
01:07:31,236 --> 01:07:34,167
Look, I almost got the bag, okay?
I'll be back in a second!

1058
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:37,893
- Maybe I should go with you.
- No. No, I should go alone.

1059
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,456
Why's that?

1060
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:41,557
Cliffy...

1061
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,286
No, don't take that tone with me.

1062
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,693
You'll make me think
you don't trust me.

1063
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,788
You don't think
I'd double-cross you, do you?

1064
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:53,088
I was sorta thinking that.

1065
01:07:54,662 --> 01:07:56,684
No, I would never

do that to you.

1066
01:07:57,361 --> 01:08:01,189
But now that we're in the clear,

'cause I'm--I mean we're--

1067
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,418
that close to the bag,

1068
01:08:03,492 --> 01:08:07,820
I don't know...I was kind of
thinking that after we got away,

1069
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:09,220
maybe we could...

1070
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,348
I thought maybe
we could see each other again.

1071
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:21,252
I was sort of...
sort of thinking the same thing.

1072
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:23,785
You were? Good.

1073
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:25,249
You stay here.

1074
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:28,008
Don't worry.

1075
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,281
Come on.
We don't have much time.

1076
01:08:34,349 --> 01:08:36,745
Why the hell did you hit me?
And who's that guy?

1077
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:39,644
No one. He thinks he's getting
half the money, but it's yours now.

1078
01:08:39,714 --> 01:08:44,270
I had to do that to get rid of him.
So, if you want it, get me that bag!

1079
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:49,566
You're right.
This does look like Claire's purse.

1080
01:08:49,644 --> 01:08:52,541
- Where is she?
- I hope Tony didn't do anything to her.

1081
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:54,803
Bitch!

1082
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:59,029
Newmar, I need your help!

1083
01:08:59,808 --> 01:09:02,136
Yes, it's me.

I need you to hold on to this bag.

1084
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,695
Don't let anyone take it,
no matter what they say.

1085
01:09:06,006 --> 01:09:07,595
-Do you have my glasses?
- Yeah.

1086
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:11,196
Do you?

1087
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:13,861
What? Where are we going?!

1088
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,028
- I can't see!
- I'll come back!

1089
01:09:16,103 --> 01:09:17,125
Hurry!

1090
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:29,297
Wow, that was fast.

1091
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:36,129
This is so stupid.

1092
01:09:36,197 --> 01:09:39,286
I'm not gay!
I wrote that poem for you!

1093
01:09:39,995 --> 01:09:41,255
I love you!

1094
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:51,519
Where did she go?

1095
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,485
Pardon me, ladies,

have you seen--

1096
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:59,421
- Have you seen a girl with a bag?
- Who the hell are you?

1097
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,682
- Maybe she went back upstairs.
- All righty!

1098
01:10:02,722 --> 01:10:05,278
Something funny's going on here.

1099
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,269
How did I get outside?

1100
01:10:41,177 --> 01:10:44,006
Finally got you horizontal,
you crazy bitch!

1101
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:48,332
I think I'll just be taking
my money back.

1102
01:10:54,406 --> 01:10:55,735
Holy balls!

1103
01:10:58,405 --> 01:10:59,665
Thank you.

1104
01:11:06,802 --> 01:11:07,960
Thanks again.

1105
01:11:13,766 --> 01:11:15,560
What are you doing?
Where's the bag?

1106
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:16,962
What do you mean?

1107
01:11:17,032 --> 01:11:19,792
You came and grabbed it
and bashed me over the head with it!

1108
01:11:19,864 --> 01:11:21,852
I didn't! That wasn't me!

1109
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:26,352
Well, clearly, this is a good reason
to give me my glasses!

1110
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,252
What happened to you?

1111
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:37,957
Help. I'm from France.
I'm an exchange student.

1112
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:39,184
You don't say!

1113
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:42,051
What'd you do that for?!

1114
01:11:42,124 --> 01:11:44,418
I can't have her saying that.
She'll blow my cover!

1115
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,079
I thought you were
the foreign exchange student.

1116
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:49,579
- I'm the hooker.
- So, you're the hooker!

1117
01:11:50,256 --> 01:11:51,448
Come on, we gotta hide her.

1118
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:57,407
Hello!

1119
01:11:58,319 --> 01:11:59,807
- Can you help me?
- I doubt it.

1120
01:11:59,886 --> 01:12:01,374
No, wait! I...

1121
01:12:01,452 --> 01:12:05,110
I'm looking for a girl, and she has
a handbag, and I need to--

1122
01:12:05,184 --> 01:12:08,273
How many people
know about the frickin' bag?!

1123
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:09,406
I don't know!

1124
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,513
I gotta get the hell out of here.

1125
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:17,375
- Do you have any rope?
- Why would I have rope?

1126
01:12:17,447 --> 01:12:19,968
I've got some bondage stuff
in my bag downstairs!

1127
01:12:20,046 --> 01:12:23,408
- Use your belt for now.
- I need my belt. These pants are huge.

1128
01:12:23,478 --> 01:12:25,204
Deal with it!
I'll only be gone for a second.

1129
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:27,533
No.

1130
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:30,174
Goddamnit.

1131
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:31,708
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1132
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,998
That was fast.
Come on in.

1133
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,031
The prostitute?!

1134
01:12:45,805 --> 01:12:46,861
I can explain!

1135
01:12:46,937 --> 01:12:48,834
Just when l
was starting to believe you!

1136
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,628
Wait! No, no, no!

You're staying here!

1137
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,792
I forgot my bag.

1138
01:12:55,602 --> 01:12:57,430
Oh, Jesus! Tony!

1139
01:12:57,501 --> 01:12:59,795
- I could still explain.
- Where's my bag?

1140
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:01,693
About your bag...

1141
01:13:01,766 --> 01:13:04,060
My grandmother
gave me that bag!

1142
01:13:04,133 --> 01:13:05,359
I hate you!

1143
01:13:05,432 --> 01:13:08,726
Claire, wait!

No, don't go anywhere.

1144
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:09,785
Wait!

1145
01:13:20,594 --> 01:13:21,752
No!

1146
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:22,985
Come on!

1147
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,116
Open up!

1148
01:13:24,893 --> 01:13:26,051
Not again!

1149
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:40,582
How ya doin'?

1150
01:13:43,286 --> 01:13:44,444
Call me.

1151
01:14:01,448 --> 01:14:03,878
Hi. Can I help you?

1152
01:14:03,947 --> 01:14:06,810
So, you're Styles McFee.

1153
01:14:08,413 --> 01:14:09,435
Who are you?

1154
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:11,272
What if I said
I was the girl you ordered,

1155
01:14:11,345 --> 01:14:13,503
and that other girl's
a foreign exchange student?

1156
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:16,870
That would explain some things.

1157
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:19,574
I'll cut to the chase.

1158
01:14:19,642 --> 01:14:22,607
You've got my money. I'll let you
keep half if you help me get out of here.

1159
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,332
Possession is 9/10
of the law, toots.

1160
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:30,462
It's my money now.
You're gonna have to do better than half.

1161
01:14:33,405 --> 01:14:35,131
I think we
can work something out.

1162
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:41,692
It's a lot of money.

1163
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,897
Get the chair, bitch.

1164
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,159
See, now we're talking.

1165
01:14:51,299 --> 01:14:53,230
I'll gonna make you
a little deal, okay?

1166
01:14:55,164 --> 01:15:00,924
If the sex is really, really great,
I'll give you half the money.

1167
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:04,617
Baby, when l
get done with you...

1168
01:15:04,695 --> 01:15:06,887
you'll give me all of it.

1169
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,187
We'll see.

1170
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,718
I'm done with you.

1171
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:16,521
Oh, and look...

1172
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,019
I got all of it.

1173
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:23,684
That's not fair!

1174
01:15:25,255 --> 01:15:27,243
Okay, I can play fair.

1175
01:15:29,454 --> 01:15:30,851
- Fair enough.
- No!

1176
01:15:40,484 --> 01:15:43,074
Come on, Styles.
Reach out and touch it.

1177
01:15:43,616 --> 01:15:44,945
Oh, yeah. You can't.

1178
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,571
Thanks for the good time, Styles.

1179
01:15:49,648 --> 01:15:51,636
No, stop! Come on.

1180
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,642
I don't deserve this!

1181
01:15:54,712 --> 01:15:55,734
Help!

1182
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,543
Someone help! Help!

1183
01:16:03,243 --> 01:16:04,572
Get over here!

1184
01:16:06,309 --> 01:16:07,740
Tony! Help me.

1185
01:16:07,809 --> 01:16:08,899
What happened to you?

1186
01:16:08,974 --> 01:16:12,166
There's no time to explain.
A whore stole my purse!

1187
01:16:12,707 --> 01:16:15,796
My girlfriend's purse.
But you gotta help me get it back.

1188
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,860
Man, that two-timing--

1189
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:22,070
Go get her. Tony!
Don't look in the purse. though!

1190
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:36,854
Someone help!
Help!

1191
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:48,653
Help!

1192
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:52,290
Someone help!

1193
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,125
I call the police.
They come!

1194
01:17:04,258 --> 01:17:07,745
Let me just explain, because I think
you might've misunderstood.

1195
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:11,151
And...you look great.
You do.

1196
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:14,550
This is gonna hurt you
more than it's gonna hurt us.

1197
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:15,643
What?

1198
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,947
Hey, man. We need to talk.

1199
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:33,544
- Knock it off. It's about the money.
- What money?

1200
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,375
Don't give me that.
I need the frickin' bag back!

1201
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:37,845
The hooker screwed us both!

1202
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:40,310
I knew she was too hot
to be trusted.

1203
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,538
We gotta get her!

1204
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:48,005
Where do you think you're going?!
Give me the purse.

1205
01:17:48,078 --> 01:17:50,838
I was looking for you, baby!
Both you babies.

1206
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,966
Shut up!

1207
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:54,473
You don't mind us keeping
this bag, then, right?

1208
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:57,302
Hold her hands. I bet she's
got something hidden on her.

1209
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,598
Yeah, you like that, right?

1210
01:18:01,673 --> 01:18:05,160
What's this?
This a vibrator or something?

1211
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:07,703
Pepper spray.
You gonna spray me, huh?

1212
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:09,964
- Let me go!
- What if I strip search her?

1213
01:18:10,038 --> 01:18:12,696
We should just let her loose, pervo.
We got the money.

1214
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:17,689
I called the police.
You all go to jail!

1215
01:18:21,767 --> 01:18:23,391
I don't have time for this.

1216
01:18:29,265 --> 01:18:32,593
- She's getting away!
- Forget her. We got the bag!

1217
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:35,150
- No. I got the bag.
- Hell, no!

1218
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:38,888
We're gonna head down
to the student union now.

1219
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:43,052
You'll find students studying,
having a snack--in their natural habitats.

1220
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,654
- My bag?!
- I can explain.

1221
01:18:56,723 --> 01:18:59,279
That bitch tricked us!
There's only a little money here!

1222
01:19:07,053 --> 01:19:09,779
- Come on. We gotta get out of here.
- It's about time.

1223
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:16,542
- Give me the money!
- Ted.

1224
01:19:20,949 --> 01:19:22,937
That's not fair, man!

1225
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:25,377
Pleasure doing business
with you boys.

1226
01:19:30,512 --> 01:19:33,601
- Man, that's my money.
- No! It's my money!

1227
01:19:36,677 --> 01:19:39,608
Our graduates include two
Nobel prize winners and 14 senators.

1228
01:19:39,676 --> 01:19:42,868
Our faculty is one of the most
prestigious in the entire country.

1229
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:47,434
Tradition.
Studiousness. Dignity.

1230
01:19:47,507 --> 01:19:50,097
These words come to mind
when one thinks of this fine university.

1231
01:19:55,171 --> 01:19:57,398
So, here's an interesting bit of trivia.

1232
01:19:57,471 --> 01:20:01,663
Can anyone tell me which campus building
Eugene O'Neill died in? Anyone?

1233
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:06,524
Hey, Pete.

1234
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:09,126
One of the nice things
about this university

1235
01:20:09,201 --> 01:20:12,189
is that public beatings like this
rarely happen. Oh, God.

1236
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,486
How does everyone know
about the bag?

1237
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,552
I don't know.
Something weird's going on.

1238
01:20:21,629 --> 01:20:25,082
I think we're being set up.
You should pack some things.

1239
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:26,149
Why?

1240
01:20:27,161 --> 01:20:28,148
Trust me.

1241
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:29,454
What are we doing?

1242
01:20:30,494 --> 01:20:33,822
I'm looking for my bag.
Where is it?

1243
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:37,949
Okay...we have to back
in the dorm.

1244
01:20:38,025 --> 01:20:39,819
Oh, no.

We're out of here.

1245
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:42,377
Listen, you idiot,
you do what I say.

1246
01:20:42,457 --> 01:20:44,319
And I say we're going
back in the dorm!

1247
01:20:49,954 --> 01:20:52,112
Do you know someone
who lost a purse around here?

1248
01:20:52,187 --> 01:20:53,675
- You found it?
- Yeah.

1249
01:20:53,753 --> 01:20:55,581
Adrienne's been looking for it!

1250
01:20:55,653 --> 01:20:56,640
Here you go.

1251
01:20:58,118 --> 01:20:59,447
Well, thanks!

1252
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:04,313
Everyone, this is not a representation
of how things work on this campus.

1253
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:06,371
I'm giving 3 to 1 odds
on the ugly white guy.

1254
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:08,437
- This is ridiculous.
- My money's on tattoo-boy!

1255
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:12,276
Gambling is not allowed on campus.
Sir, gambling is not--

1256
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:14,540
- What are the odds?
- Three to one.

1257
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:15,873
I'm good for 20.

1258
01:21:15,946 --> 01:21:17,740
- Hold it.
- Yeah, right.

1259
01:21:19,611 --> 01:21:21,667
Out of my way, morons!

1260
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,536
36 Starflower.
We're 10-97 making entry.

1261
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:28,767
You live here?

1262
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,932
Yeah, I'm the R.A.

What's going on?

1263
01:21:31,008 --> 01:21:34,836
We received a call saying there was some
kind of hostage situation at this address.

1264
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:41,065
Reggie. I thought
you went home already.

1265
01:21:41,138 --> 01:21:43,830
Who called the police,
and why is there a Christmas tree?

1266
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:45,926
- That's a fire hazard!
- Don't look at me.

1267
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:48,935
- Grandmother's handbag.
- You should kick Tony in the balls.

1268
01:21:49,003 --> 01:21:52,263
- Totally! The police are here.
- Thank God.

1269
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:56,390
Officers, you will be interested to know
that there is a prostitute in this dorm.

1270
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:58,022
- A prostitute?
- That's her!

1271
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:02,428
- That's Dominique the prostitute!
- Me student! They crazy attacking me!

1272
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:04,258
- It seems she's on drugs.
- Cuff her!

1273
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:06,888
- What's going on?
- They're arresting Styles's prostitute.

1274
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:08,758
- Did Dominique ever arrive?
- That's her.

1275
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:11,590
Wait, let me get this straight.
There are two Dominiques?

1276
01:22:11,662 --> 01:22:13,456
But one's the whore,

and one's just a foreigner.

1277
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:17,620
We should get going, or we'll miss
our flight to North Dakota.

1278
01:22:19,193 --> 01:22:22,282
Well, it was really nice meeting you.
Dominique, was it?

1279
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:24,347
Have a nice time
in North Dakota.

1280
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:27,390
I just have a few more things to pack.
I think you'll like North Dakota.

1281
01:22:27,457 --> 01:22:28,581
I smell smoke.

1282
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:30,679
- Foosball was smoking.
- He bought the tree.

1283
01:22:30,756 --> 01:22:32,914
- You bitches!
- This is a no-smoking building.

1284
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:35,283
Marla and Lynne have
an eight-ball of coke in their room.

1285
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:37,445
- It's hers!
- Whore!

1286
01:22:44,485 --> 01:22:46,915
- Stop it!
- What?

1287
01:22:46,985 --> 01:22:49,950
They're going back in the dorm.
Obviously, the money's still there.

1288
01:22:50,017 --> 01:22:52,244
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should go!

1289
01:22:56,615 --> 01:23:00,511
I am Dominique from France,
foreign exchange student!

1290
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,838
It looks good to me.
But if you're the student--

1291
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:08,604
Then who are you?!

1292
01:23:09,211 --> 01:23:10,198
There she is!

1293
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:18,697
Where do you think
you're going, babycakes?

1294
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:21,767
Finally we meet.
I'm Wang.

1295
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,067
Who actually called us?
Where's this hostage situation?

1296
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,264
The cops!

1297
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,429
- Lorenzo Rosatti!
- Let go of the girl!

1298
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:28,493
Take that!

1299
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:37,927
Booker, I think I smell smoke!

Seriously! Do you smell that?

1300
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:50,430
- Finally we have the Black Hand!
- You! Down here!

1301
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:53,096
Cuff all three of them right here.

1302
01:23:53,164 --> 01:23:54,561
- Who are you?
- Gerri Farber.

1303
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,356
No, that's just a cover.
She's Britney the Snake.

1304
01:23:57,429 --> 01:23:59,326
I am not going down alone!

1305
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:01,554
- Does anybody know this girl?
- Yes. Gerri.

1306
01:24:01,628 --> 01:24:03,217
- Give me the gun.
- It's really her!

1307
01:24:03,295 --> 01:24:05,725
I've seen her before, Rosatti.

That ain't Britney.

1308
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:08,485
- She's lying!
- Shut up, Rosatti.

1309
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:10,683
Okay, now I smell
something burning.

1310
01:24:24,087 --> 01:24:26,711
- They were supposed to fix this.
- Do you know how to turn that off?

1311
01:24:26,787 --> 01:24:27,945
I think so.

1312
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:39,742
All right. You three stay put.
Everybody else, back to your rooms.

1313
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:46,936
- I can--
- You can explain.

1314
01:24:48,513 --> 01:24:52,000
- I'm really sorry. It's just that--
- I believe you.

1315
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:54,704
God, I love you.

1316
01:24:54,778 --> 01:24:56,333
I love you, too, baby.

1317
01:24:58,377 --> 01:25:01,240
- My grandmother was a bitch, anyway.
- Yeah, she was.

1318
01:25:07,641 --> 01:25:09,902
- Wanna go find that money?
- Really?

1319
01:25:15,605 --> 01:25:16,661
There you are.

1320
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,796
I got your bag back.

1321
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:24,561
That's not the right bag.

1322
01:25:26,868 --> 01:25:28,265
Can I have my glasses back?

1323
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:33,625
I have...

1324
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:36,396
a confession to make.

1325
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,620
I'm not gay.

1326
01:25:39,697 --> 01:25:42,287
I didn't write
that poem for Foosball.

1327
01:25:42,364 --> 01:25:44,226
I wrote that poem for you.

1328
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:46,892
You did?

1329
01:25:54,893 --> 01:25:57,289
There's a shitload of money in here.

1330
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:01,919
Keep it together.
Sorry. Please.

1331
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,680
- You don't need to look over there.
- Forget it.

1332
01:26:05,756 --> 01:26:09,016
Screw it. We don't want your stupid,
ugly kids at our university, anyway.

1333
01:26:09,089 --> 01:26:11,077
This place is a madhouse.
What a day.

1334
01:26:11,154 --> 01:26:13,812
We got Lorenzo Rosatti--
"the Black Hand," a prostitute,

1335
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:15,715
and a couple of kids
with a bunch of coke.

1336
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:22,115
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
I don't know.

1337
01:26:22,185 --> 01:26:24,843
Totally! After we give
Gerri some for her tuition,

1338
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:27,245
we can go to the Bahamas
and live like kings.

1339
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,577
I don't know if we'll have
enough money to do that.

1340
01:26:29,649 --> 01:26:31,637
All right,
then we'll go to Vegas.

1341
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:35,543
We'll go away and have the best
Christmas break ever...together.

1342
01:26:35,614 --> 01:26:39,101
- I'm feeling kind of lucky.
- Yeah, so am l.

1343
01:27:02,138 --> 01:27:03,467
Booker, thank God!

1344
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:06,936
I don't even want to know.

1345
01:27:09,403 --> 01:27:11,731
I've had some time
to think about it...

1346
01:27:11,802 --> 01:27:14,358
and I'm really sorry
for the way I've been acting.

1347
01:27:16,201 --> 01:27:19,030
In fact,

I have a confession to make.

1348
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:22,154
I'm a virgin, too.

1349
01:27:22,233 --> 01:27:25,959
I know. I talk really big
'cause I can't find a girlfriend.

1350
01:27:28,231 --> 01:27:30,889
And I guess I ordered
the whore for myself,

1351
01:27:30,963 --> 01:27:32,655
but I was too embarrassed
to admit it.

1352
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:36,125
But I realize now
that it's okay to be a virgin, Booker.

1353
01:27:36,195 --> 01:27:39,523
It's okay. We don't have
anything to be ashamed of.

1354
01:27:39,594 --> 01:27:43,184
Speak for yourself, loser.
I just lost my virginity.

1355
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:46,186
In fact, I only came back
to get some Gatorade.

1356
01:27:46,258 --> 01:27:49,121
I'm gonna go have
a bunch more sex now.

1357
01:27:51,623 --> 01:27:53,111
See you tomorrow, Styles.

1358
01:28:01,486 --> 01:28:03,644
You're not really
gonna leave me here, are you?

1359
01:28:05,652 --> 01:28:07,480
I don't deserve this, Booker!

1360
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:09,876
Yes, I do.

1361
01:28:27,312 --> 01:28:28,970
I'm such a jerk!

1362
01:28:30,045 --> 01:28:34,737
I mean, I don't do unto others

as they would want it--

1363
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,297
I don't even know what it is,

but I don't do it.

1364
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:53,192
My family has a lot planned
for us to do over the break.

1365
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:54,599
Tell me about your family.

1366
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,463
Need bathroom.

1367
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:05,794
It's right over there.

1368
01:29:09,999 --> 01:29:11,055
Sorry.

1369
01:29:13,398 --> 01:29:15,522
Somehow I got your phone,

1370
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:18,391
and it's campus security
about something.

1371
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:19,785
Thanks.

1372
01:29:20,596 --> 01:29:21,652
Nice robe.

1373
01:29:22,361 --> 01:29:23,849
Hello?

1374
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:25,188
Yeah, this is Wang.

1375
01:29:28,593 --> 01:29:31,114
What? That's impossible.
She's here with me!

1376
01:29:31,193 --> 01:29:33,783
I don't know who that is,

because I'm standing here with a girl

1377
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:35,584
who was mugged
on her way to see you.

1378
01:29:35,658 --> 01:29:38,145
They took all her things.
Even her passport.

1379
01:29:38,224 --> 01:29:42,086
We have confirmed her identity.
She is your foreign exchange student.

1380
01:29:42,155 --> 01:29:44,551
So can you please come
open the door and let us in?

1381
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:45,745
I'll come right down.

1382
01:29:46,754 --> 01:29:48,083
Then who the hell is...

1383
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:01,107
- Yeah, Lorenzo double-crossed me.

- He got away?

1384
01:30:01,183 --> 01:30:03,647
I followed him and this girl
to her dormitory on campus.

1385
01:30:03,715 --> 01:30:04,907
Can anyone ID you?

1386
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:09,241
No. This dumb foreigner arrived,
which gave me the perfect cover.

1387
01:30:09,314 --> 01:30:11,142
This whole thing's falling apart.

1388
01:30:11,213 --> 01:30:13,201
- Shit.
- Did you get the money?

1389
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,108
I had it in my hands,
but I lost it.

1390
01:30:15,179 --> 01:30:16,667
We need to find it!

1391
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,006
What the hell happened?
How'd you lose it?

1392
01:30:19,077 --> 01:30:20,235
Hang on a sec.

1393
01:30:30,874 --> 01:30:33,862
It's a long story.
I'll tell you when I get there.
