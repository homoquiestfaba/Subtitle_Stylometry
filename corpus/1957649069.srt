1
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,403
Nice place, man.

2
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,935
My father lives here.
I live out there.

3
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,328
Better get my suitcase ready.

4
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,859
Okay.

5
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,801
How long are you gonna
be gone this time, Earl?

6
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,432
Never know.

7
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,210
How long, Earl?

8
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,155
So I take it
you can't smell that?

9
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,356
What?

10
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,524
You stink, Dupre.

11
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,823
Yeah, I'm a working man.

12
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,065
Is that how you gonna look?

13
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,430
No, man.
I was gonna wear this.

14
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,666
You ain't got nothing
slick to wear?

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,435
Be who you is.

16
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,342
Because if you be who you ain't,
you ain't who you is.

17
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,943
You picked them
pole beans

18
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,979
-like I told you to?
- When I get back.

19
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,780
-I'll pick them when I get back.
-Emerald.

20
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,646
- Daddy.
- Yeah. Have a seat.

21
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,920
What you all excited about?

22
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,455
Nothing. Everything.

23
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,323
Yeah.
Where you off to then?

24
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,854
Library.

25
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,158
Wait up a minute.

26
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,429
She all right your mama.

27
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,765
She not like you and me.

28
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,268
We need a bigger playing field.

29
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,375
Found that out in the army.
Things around here

30
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,243
never did look the same
after that.

31
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,708
-Confirm?
-Yes, sir.

32
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,511
Never forget.
You're my daughter.

33
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,148
What do you mean?

34
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,753
I don't want you
on your knees cleaning floors.

35
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,427
I want you man some good for
nothing from around here

36
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,195
going nowhere drag you down.

37
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
You meant for better things.
Get that.

38
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,630
I'm gonna be going away
for a while, so.

39
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,935
Working offshore?

40
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,704
Yeah, for a while,
you hear?

41
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,072
I'm trying to tell you
something

42
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,903
I want you to remember.

43
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,241
Love undoes a woman

44
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,344
fast and spit.

45
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,281
You look out for that.

46
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,417
Daddy.

47
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,323
You think I should never
fall in love?

48
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,658
No

49
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,528
that's not what I think.

50
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,049
Don't screw up.

51
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,647
Give me a minute.

52
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,827
Hey,

53
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,100
Looking good, Johnny Beaugh.

54
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,064
Merci beaucoup.

55
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,334
The car, not you.

56
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,706
You're the iceman.

57
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,774
Why is that?

58
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,974
Because you're so cool.

59
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,680
Hey, cher. Comment ça va?

60
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,254
What you want coming
around here calling me Cher.

61
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,690
You got
a suspicious mind, you.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,388
Serves me well.

63
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,960
I've been thinking.

64
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,028
-Dangerous activity for you.
- Come on now.

65
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,764
-No kidding for a minute.
-I'm not kidding.

66
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,865
Let me get paid.

67
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,666
I ain't buying your butter,
Johnny Beaugh.

68
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,465
And I ain't paying you
before you play.

69
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,239
We got a problem.

70
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,640
You got a problem.

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,442
No, you got a problem too.

72
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,778
Nigger saw got called up
to New Orleans today

73
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,212
for a recording session.

74
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,082
He's not gonna be back tonight
or next week to save.

75
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,451
That's a big break for him.
That's too soon.

76
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,685
We got a deal.

77
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,251
You can't go on
without a lead singer.

78
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,891
Already got a replacement.

79
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,755
Really? Who?

80
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,062
Billy Dupre.

81
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,565
-Is you a fool?
-He sounds colored.

82
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,733
This ain't radio.

83
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,835
I ain't never had a white man
in here before.

84
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,171
Oh, come on, Ruby.
Don't nobody mind

85
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,006
mixing it up in bands no more.

86
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,041
-You is a fool.
- You know what, anyway,

87
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,277
you got a full house
coming tonight. Uh-hmm.

88
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,145
You know that Fridays are big.

89
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,580
That's him out there?
He out there?

90
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,178
Yeah, he out there.

91
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,219
But he wants his money
up front or no go.

92
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,419
Up front or no go? Jeez.

93
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,155
Hold on. Let me light
that for you, Ruby.

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,065
What's your problem?

95
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,130
You think I won't pay?

96
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,632
I always pay. Ask anybody.

97
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,872
I need the money now.
It won't do me no good

98
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,507
-in the middle of the night.
-Yeah, cher, listen,

99
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,742
now he's gonna play all
four sets with the band tonight.

100
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,144
Okay.
You got my word on it.

101
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,378
You can't give
your word for him.

102
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,580
It don't work like that.

103
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,281
Now, now, Ruby,
come on please.

104
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,482
Look, pay the man up front.

105
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,651
I do it for him
then they all hit on me

106
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,119
every week
for the same thing.

107
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,550
No.

108
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,723
-All right then.
- No, Billy, wait.

109
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,492
Come on. Ruby, look,
I made the rounds.

110
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,427
-I can't find nobody else.
- Look,

111
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,058
just give me my cut.

112
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,364
I won't tell anybody
I got it early.

113
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,132
Hey. I won't say a word.

114
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,298
You got my word on that.
You know I'm good for it.

115
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,770
What is your trouble?

116
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,042
That's none of your business.

117
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,944
It's my business
if you don't show.

118
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,542
I'll show up.

119
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,245
Since when crackers
don't lie to niggas.

120
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,447
I'm not going for that
Ms. Ruby.

121
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,717
Don't you call me miss.
I'm a married woman.

122
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,462
Give me your driver's license.

123
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,365
Ruby, don't take that.
How's the man supposed to drive?

124
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,096
Very carefully.

125
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,865
Hand it over
if you want a deal.

126
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,008
Well, you look more human
if you smile.

127
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,677
Smile.

128
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,982
Now you don't show.

129
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,622
I'll come find you.

130
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,153
Hey, Earl.

131
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,359
Yeah, well,
as long as you understand.

132
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,994
It's just a one-shot deal.

133
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,592
One shot deal.

134
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,933
Dress nice before you
come back here.

135
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,534
What's the matter
with you, man?

136
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,532
- He will.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,573
Shit. What was I gonna do?

138
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,305
Can he sing?

139
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,540
Johnny says.

140
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,356
Too damn hot.

141
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,427
You didn't think so
when Emmy sat on your lap.

142
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,399
You smell like an ash tray.

143
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,513
Mama, I got to talk
to you about something.

144
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,815
Talk.

145
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,783
I wanna go live with
Aunt Marlene in Chicago.

146
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,585
-You wanna what?
-I've been thinking about it

147
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,954
for a long time.
I could go to school there.

148
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,590
-Lucy could look after me.
-Lucy?

149
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,126
Go to school, mama.
My teachers down here

150
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,562
don't even speak good English
at English class.

151
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,263
Get ready for college
that way.

152
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,399
What brought this on?

153
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,797
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

154
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,299
Yeah.

155
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,206
Girl, you ain't going nowhere.

156
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,742
And you got the sense
God give a chicken.

157
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,377
I make straight A's.

158
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,978
Yeah, book smart,
not people smart.

159
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,747
You ain't got
no common sense, Emerald.

160
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,849
You like to make me
feel small.

161
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,880
Emerald Marie Delacroix.

162
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,750
-What'd you just say?
-Nothing.

163
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,920
Don't you accuse me
of making you feel small.

164
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,658
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,458
And don't you yes, ma'am me
either with that tone.

166
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,995
I don't know what you want me
to say, mama.

167
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,064
I make you feel small.

168
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,067
And why is that?

169
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,169
Go on, tell the truth.

170
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,574
Because it makes you feel big.

171
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:13,817
Well then,
you ain't going nowhere.

172
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,583
Just stay right here with me.

173
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,159
Are you Mr. Robicheaux?

174
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,427
How you all doing?

175
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,695
Fine.

176
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,094
Just making sure
everything's okay.

177
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,000
Everything's fine.
Why don't you come on in?

178
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,971
Not tonight. I saw Noogie
in New Orleans.

179
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,103
Singing for Allen Toussaint.

180
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,940
-Who you got?
-A fella by the name of Dupre.

181
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,775
White boy?

182
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,244
Unusual.

183
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,626
How y'all doing?

184
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,995
Let's get the party started.

185
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,799
Mes ami, hey.

186
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,801
Ms. Ruby!

187
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,455
Have a good time.

188
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,973
Bonner, I want you to come by

189
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,972
and do some work for me
next week. All right.

190
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,885
I have some good news
and I have some good news.

192
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,854
Noogie went up
to New Orleans

193
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,190
to record a record
and become famous.

194
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,258
And to take his place
for the next few nights,

195
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,390
we have the one and only...

196
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,692
Billy Dupre.

197
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,854
Give me a cigarette.

198
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,355
Man, that was great.

199
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,152
It sure was.

200
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,502
Hey there, good looking.

201
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,141
You know the old songs too,
huh, Dupre?

202
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,112
You're a pretty woman,
Mrs. Delacroix.

203
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,849
Nobody in they right mind
called me pretty.

204
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,817
Well,

205
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,326
I must be out of my mind then.

206
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,058
Yeah, there's always
a possibility.

207
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:03,500
-I just wanted to say thanks.
-For what?

208
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,598
You forced me into it.

209
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:11,370
Hey, you got
my driver's license?

210
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,477
-Yup.
-Can I have it?

211
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,809
Uh-hmm.
End of the evening.

212
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,049
What? I ain't gonna
skip out on you.

213
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,015
Good. So you'll be here
the end of the evening.

214
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,152
Hey, Dup!

215
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,258
Come on, man,
we're waiting on you.

216
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,890
Yeah, I'll be right there.

217
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,131
- Ruby.
-Hey there.

218
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,829
Hey.

219
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,968
What do you want?

220
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,104
What time are you leaving
in the morning, Earl?

221
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,035
My ride comes at 7:00.

222
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,875
Earl, you're the only man
go offshore

223
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,011
for two weeks
that go on two months.

224
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,980
-Don't start.
-Why is that then?

225
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,049
I stay for the overtime,
you know that.

226
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,118
They don't keep nobody
out there that long,

227
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,753
they just don't do it.

228
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,418
Earl, why do you take me
for such a fool?

229
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,253
Earl...

230
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,130
Two, three, four.

231
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,868
Hey.

232
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,981
May I?

233
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,436
Shit.

234
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,858
What's up?
How you doing?

235
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,801
Here you go.

236
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,874
Thank you.

237
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,883
Yeah, hold on.

238
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,836
What you doing here, Ms. Betty?

239
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,372
Just came to hear him sing.

240
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,145
Yeah, but this ain't no
place for you.

241
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,646
Jack,
get her out of here,

242
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,181
there's more
to notion with him,

243
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,983
I don't need no trouble
in here now.

244
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,781
I'm not hurting anybody.

245
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,186
All right.

246
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,318
Sing. Keep playing.

247
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,787
Hey, Jack.

248
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,592
Jack.

249
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,227
Maybe we could
take it easy, Ruby.

250
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,462
Get her out of here.

251
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh, Jack.

252
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,900
Damn.
Come on, Ms. Betty,

253
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,165
-I'm gonna take you home.
-No.

254
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,006
Take it easy.
Take it easy, Ms. Betty.

255
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,874
That is my husband.

256
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,405
Yes, it is.

257
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,978
- That is my husband.
- The show's not over.

258
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,081
No, it's not over,
I'm not going home.

259
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,480
I don't want--
don't, please leave me alone.

260
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,491
Let go of me. Let go of me.

261
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,289
I'm not holding her.

262
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,828
Let's just go.

263
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,596
I'll take care of her,
all right?

264
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,794
All right,
what are you doing here?

265
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,633
Okay.
All right, all right, hey,

266
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,635
drinks on the house, huh?

267
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,304
Pick it up, pick it up.

268
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,605
Damn it.

269
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,938
Why don't you just leave me?

270
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,108
You know why.

271
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,582
Do you have someone in mind
for tonight?

272
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,317
-Did I mess up your plans?
-Yeah, right.

273
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,586
You're a pathetic little man
looking for a piece of ass

274
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,687
in a nigger honky-tonk.

275
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,422
- Let Jack take her.
-I'm taking her.

276
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,687
You gotta play the rest
of your set.

277
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,860
I'll be back.

278
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,428
Don't bother.

279
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,896
Will you lay off, Ruby?

280
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,965
I'm running a business here,

281
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,864
you don't get time off
for family fights.

282
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,333
See you tomorrow.

283
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,928
I thought
I'd listen in the back

284
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,694
and you'll never know
I'm there.

285
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,698
You know,
and I'll see deep into his eyes,

286
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,701
like I used to,

287
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,638
but he never lets me anymore,

288
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:56,312
and I know that if I could
see deep inside of you,

289
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,147
I would know what
you were thinking

290
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,979
and you would see
deep inside of me.

291
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:05,084
I was gonna jump
into you through your eyes.

292
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,221
And you are gonna
love me again.

293
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,679
You want breakfast?

294
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,782
What?

295
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,785
What you got in there?

296
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,358
Earl,

297
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,423
I got to look at you last night,

298
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,896
how you act when I'm gone,

299
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,398
now you got the nerve
to do it in front of my face.

300
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,196
No.

301
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,604
I swear to God, Earl.

302
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,039
I never--I never--I never done
anything against you,

303
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,104
not one word, not a deed.

304
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,174
No, please, Earl,

305
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,143
you son of a bitch.

306
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,348
It's just an excuse.

307
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,450
You were leaving anyway,
weren't you?

308
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,556
You got another family
somewhere,

309
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,521
is that where you always go?

310
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,589
Is it another woman?

311
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,225
Just tell me.

312
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:25,230
Respect me enough
to tell me the truth for once.

313
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,766
You'll never know.

314
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,610
What about Emerald?

315
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,781
If she was a boy,
I'd take her with me.

316
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,787
It won't be long
before she spread her legs

317
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,753
for some
end up like the rest of y'all,

318
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,822
weak and stupid,

319
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,724
I do nothing for her no more.

320
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,995
You wanna see weak and stupid?

321
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,964
Look in the mirror.

322
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,482
Come on. Come on.

323
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,285
Come on. Get in now.

324
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,639
Honey, will you get me
a glass of water?

325
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,276
The matter with your legs?

326
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,445
You like my legs?

327
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,793
Take your medicine first, huh?

328
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,796
You like it
when I'm tranquilized.

329
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,036
Billy,
will you stay with me tonight?

330
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,938
You know I got to go to work.
They'll have me.

331
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,641
And why don't you sing for me
and we'll dance.

332
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,510
I'll take you for a walk
tomorrow, all right?

333
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,845
I'll take you for dinner
at the drive-in, ça va?

334
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,147
-It'll be nice.
-Yeah. We'll see.

335
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,382
We'll see how drunk
you get tonight

336
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:57,153
and how tired you are tomorrow
with ball games on the radio.

337
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,850
Look, honey.

338
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,525
You take your medicine
or I'm not coming back.

339
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,327
That's how it is.

340
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,963
Yes, master.

341
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,766
Whatever you say, master.

342
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,371
So now, you have to come home.

343
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,524
Hey,
I heard you might need a singer.

344
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,598
No, not really.

345
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,799
We're doing just fine.

346
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,968
- Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

347
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,633
I got my license.

348
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,541
Tell me he's trying
but it ain't...

349
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,372
He's trying to make it rain.

350
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,347
Welcome.
What can I get you?

351
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,946
-I'm all good.
- Ruby, come here, girl.

352
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,350
-What?
-Two beer.

353
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,437
All right.

354
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,550
Now, come on, Bo,
give us the real singer.

355
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,023
Hush, my boy.

356
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,854
You're doing good, John.

357
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,123
I got one for you.

358
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,226
Ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,900
Ms. Ruby Delacroix
is gonna come up here

360
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,069
-and give us a special treat.
-No. No.

361
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,837
-Yeah.
-Whoo!

362
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,372
No. No. No.

363
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,671
Well, singing will make you
feel better, baby.

364
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,007
You down, Ruby?
Sing out the blues.

365
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,646
-Give me a lighter.
-Come on, Ruby.

366
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,715
Come on up here
and show us what you got.

367
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,350
Johnny, leave me be.

368
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,648
I ain't got time for this.

369
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,785
to the bayou.

370
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,856
I'm a woman...

371
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,726
with a whole lot on my mind.

372
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,965
But that don't mean
I'm the serious cat.

373
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,387
I don't know what got into me,

374
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:34,089
but let's take a break
and get something cool to drink.

375
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,461
And Mr. Dupre
will be back to sing for us.

376
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,760
Let's sell some beer.

377
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:04,219
Ooh, I thought
you was a tomboy.

378
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,387
Look what I've been missing.

379
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,455
I want a drink.

380
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,690
No, you can have some root beer.

381
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,759
No. A Coca-Cola with rum.

382
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,694
You go ask your momma
for some rum.

383
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,225
Chicken.

384
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,898
Qu'est que tu fais, hmm?

385
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,699
You're gonna get me some trouble
around here.

386
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,068
You're afraid of my momma.

387
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,569
When it comes to you, I am

388
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,805
and you should be,
you ought to be too.

389
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,706
I got to get out of here.

390
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,438
Qu'est que tu va aller?

391
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,677
Chicago,
I got the Humvee.

392
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,913
Watch out now, Humvee,

393
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,382
-you're too young for that.
-Everybody's scared,

394
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:36,147
too scared to move, I'm not.

395
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,984
-I wanna drink.
-You know what?

396
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:42,157
Your momma would kick my butt
and then refuse to pay me.

397
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,055
And everybody's business.

398
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,495
-Can I have a sip of yours?
-No.

399
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,996
I'll show her who's boss of me.

400
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,061
-I'm the boss of you.
-See?

401
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,469
You go to your room.
No, you better not give her

402
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:54,937
-nothing to drink.
-Not now, Rub.

403
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,572
Girl, did you hear
what I told you?

404
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,136
Go to your room.

405
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,683
Why you got that trash on?

406
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,255
It's your clothes.

407
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,891
I recognize my own trash
when I see it.

408
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,756
What you wearing it for?

409
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,758
You look ridiculous.

410
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,593
Johnny didn't think so.

411
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,795
Oh. You got shit for brains.

412
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,332
You think I look ugly?
You got shit for brains.

413
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,141
Emerald, go to your room
and take that off.

414
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,878
I don't wanna slap you again.

415
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,666
- Hey, goodnight, Ruby.
- We got to get or hire

416
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,931
-some help to carry this guitar.
- Yeah.

417
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,270
Goodnight.

418
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,305
All right now.
Hey, ya'll drive safely now.

419
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,240
Hey, everybody's going to
Johnny's to wind down,

420
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,105
-wanna come?
-Can't.

421
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,144
It's nothing, you know.
Let's have a drink.

422
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:12,277
Thanks, but I can't do it.

423
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,279
Can't or you won't?

424
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,282
It's all right.

425
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,184
Goodnight.

426
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,011
You want some?

427
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,751
Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas, Silas?

428
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,920
Don't play games
with me, Johnny.

429
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,355
What?

430
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,623
Go to New Orleans.

431
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:15,857
-Tonight?
-No. No. No.

432
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,559
-Let's move there.

433
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,060
I don't wanna play no Dixieland.

434
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,295
Yes, if that's it,

435
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,130
you can play
with Allen Toussaint.

436
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,232
That's domino. Noogie's going in
down there now.

437
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,367
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

438
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,903
You got a straight job here,
you can do the same thing there,

439
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,771
what's the difference?
You can get a new band,

440
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,741
you can get more exposure
down there in two weeks

441
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,509
you get down here
your whole entire life.

442
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,278
I don't like that
New Orleans sound,

443
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:37,913
I like what we play down here.

444
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:40,615
We got Jim Records,
Joe Berry's doing good.

445
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,947
-I mean...
-We can live in the corner.

446
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,850
We can live together.

447
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:49,224
You know, we got a life
in New Orleans, being ourselves,

448
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,689
being alive,
being natural, brother,

449
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,095
or you got a life here
without me that's lies,

450
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,060
and lies, and lies?

451
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,931
What are you gonna do
if you stay?

452
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,233
Well, I know.

453
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,239
You're gonna marry sweet
Katia Washington

454
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,204
and pretend
that you're straight.

455
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,844
Will you think about that
when you're lying in bed

456
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,742
with her dreaming about me?

457
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,349
Once in a while,
you're gonna sneak out,

458
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,748
catch a little bit
of what you really like,

459
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:20,018
feeling guilty,
and crazy, and ashamed.

460
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,290
Free yourself, Johnny.

461
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,995
Come with me.

462
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,947
You know, this thing, uh,
went out.

463
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,949
-You know, what?
-Hey.

464
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,985
Thanks, man.
I'm heading out. All right?

465
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,620
Yeah. You want some?

466
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,217
Yeah. Why not?

467
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:57,121
No shit, bud,
you sound good in there.

468
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,327
You never know when you're
gonna catch it right.

469
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:00,858
I guess not.

470
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,266
Give me a call, baby,
if you change your mind.

471
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,501
Goddamn it, Silas, arrêter.

472
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:10,034
this is who I am.

473
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,554
Hey, Rub.

474
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,790
-Morning, Ruby.
-Good morning.

475
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:41,826
Good morning Ms. Emerald.

476
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,033
What's the matter with you
this morning?

477
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,431
Too sophisticated to talk to us.

478
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,033
Excuse me.

479
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,940
Let me get that girls to help.

480
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,743
Emerald, Regina,
I need you girls to help.

481
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,146
-I'm going with Regina.
-Miss Sassy.

482
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,281
Since when do you tell
and not ask?

483
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,112
Come with me.

484
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:42,257
Who do you think you are
talking to me like that?

485
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,459
I'm not like you.
Daddy said.

486
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:46,857
Oh, yeah?
Well, what did he say?

487
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,631
He said I shouldn't
turn into you.

488
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,562
I should get out of here.

489
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,004
Girl, you don't know nothing
about real life.

490
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,935
Then tell me.

491
00:43:58,036 --> 00:43:59,441
What you want to know?

492
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,843
Well, why take college?
Why men hate women?

493
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:05,176
So, the worst possible thing
you can be is a collared woman?

494
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,678
Slave-thinking. See?

495
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:11,086
Daddy's right,
I'm not like you.

496
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:13,050
I'm not scared.

497
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:16,587
You don't know.

498
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:17,992
The world look at me

499
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,128
and they see a nursemaid,
a whore and a mule,

500
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,064
rolled up into one, and wonder
why I ain't serving there.

501
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,732
Oh,
they waiting for me to stumble.

502
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,035
I pay more so called taxes
than anybody,

503
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:29,404
more than these peckerwoods,
more than these colored men

504
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,972
what run bars
in the same parish,

505
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,574
and if I don't pay,
do you know

506
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,209
what kind of accident
is gonna happen?

507
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,578
I earned that bar from my momma,
it's mine.

508
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,279
But everybody still wait
for your daddy

509
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,915
to come from offshore
to talk business,

510
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:43,051
and it's my business.

511
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,153
As far as this world concerned,
a woman like me

512
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,386
is in good need of a whooping.

513
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,088
Now, when you learn to stay low,

514
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,290
you will be all right.

515
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,794
I won't stay low.

516
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,398
I can't be like that, ma.

517
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,334
I'm different than you.

518
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,837
So you said.

519
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,890
Good afternoon, Miss Daigie.

520
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,793
Hey. Not short
again this month, are we, Ruby?

521
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,795
No, ma'am.
Not short this month.

522
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,228
Well, well.
What a pretty business that is.

523
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,967
Thank you.

524
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,299
I heard you pre-cut out,
aren't you?

525
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,439
-He came back, though.
- That's good.

526
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,375
When's Noogie coming home?

527
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:21,906
Next week.

528
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,679
Well, tell Earl to call me.

529
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,281
He's offshore.

530
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,515
Is there anything I could--

531
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,514
Well, how long is he out for,
fourteen or seven?

532
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,287
I don't know.

533
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:35,486
Earl does seem to stay out
longer than most.

534
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,859
Well, don't worry.

535
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,261
I'll keep an extra special line.

536
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,362
Thank you.

537
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,097
Here's your change, honey.

538
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,062
Thank you.

539
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,731
See you.

540
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,948
Hello, Texaco, may I help you?

541
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,717
Yes, hello.

542
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,519
I wanna send a letter
to my husband,

543
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,921
so I need to find out
what rig he's on.

544
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,423
What's his name?

545
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:09,991
Earl Delacroix.

546
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,056
Hang on, honey.

547
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:17,328
Sorry. He no longer works
at Texaco.

548
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,068
That is not possible.

549
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:23,367
They said that
he didn't show up last week.

550
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:26,770
Uh...

551
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,243
Are you sure?

552
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,745
I'm looking right here

553
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,877
at the paperwork, missus.

554
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,316
-Thank you.
- Goodbye.

555
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,638
Hey, son.

556
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,006
Hey, pop.

557
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,876
Listen, Silas tells me
you're going to be moving.

558
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,812
Qu'est-ce que tu dis, Silas?

559
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,114
Huh?

560
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:08,349
No, no, pop,
Silas just pulling your leg,

561
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,550
I ain't going nowhere.

562
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,785
Well, that's what I thought.

563
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,720
You know, because, uh,
you've got a sweet deal

564
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,056
back there, and you know it.
And that's what I'm telling him.

565
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:18,025
I can't see you giving us up
for some roach filled

566
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,828
slave part of New Orleans
where you don't know no nobody.

567
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:23,064
That could be
a foolish thing to do.

568
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,399
And you ain't no fool.

569
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:27,135
I ain't no fool.

570
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,904
But we're not too sure
about Silas now, are we?

571
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,502
Yeah.

572
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,876
Silas.

573
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,484
But you're trying
to cut me off

574
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,153
from everybody
that I know and love

575
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,985
so I only have you to turn to?

576
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,423
I'm not going nowhere
with you, man.

577
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,896
-You screwed up.
-Screwed up?

578
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:56,827
Who screwed up?

579
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,897
Me, who wants to live
who I am without shame?

580
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,236
Or you? You, who's desperately
trying to hide

581
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,168
his dirty little secret.

582
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,873
Hmm, but let me see.

583
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:08,372
That would have to be you.

584
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,809
You don't know me.

585
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,577
Never will.

586
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:17,348
How can you say that, huh?

587
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,585
I know you better than anybody.

588
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,689
I'm a man...

589
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,293
with a family.

590
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:33,334
I got seven brothers
and sisters.

591
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:38,068
I got 15 nieces and nephews.

592
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,904
I'm from a place.

593
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:43,878
I know every inch
of those woods behind my house,

594
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:46,981
and how they change
from season to season.

595
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,350
I know everybody
in the music scene.

596
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,617
And my house is their house,
and they know it.

597
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:55,857
And they need that.

598
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,288
And I like giving it.

599
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,596
I'm a man from a place

600
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:05,329
with family and friends, first,

601
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:09,133
and I'm a homosexual, second.

602
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:14,308
But that's because they just
don't know you, baby.

603
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,210
How do you think
your daddy would react

604
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,979
if he knew that you like boys?

605
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:20,414
I don't need to hurt him
like that.

606
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:24,048
Oh, no.
You'll just hurt yourself.

607
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,656
Don't come here no more.

608
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:30,220
I...

609
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,959
-I wanted...
-I mean it.

610
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:34,892
What do you say, Johnny?

611
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,563
Don't come here no more, Silas.

612
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,443
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

613
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,379
-Cut that off.
-Why?

614
00:51:51,409 --> 00:51:53,243
Because I said.

615
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,215
What's for supper?

616
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,157
You didn't cook?

617
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:05,255
You always cook.

618
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,891
What's the matter?

619
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,230
You are a grownup,
you cook something.

620
00:52:42,093 --> 00:52:44,561
-Daddy?
-Hey, there, little one.

621
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:47,231
Hmm.

622
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:49,437
I thought you were offshore?

623
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:50,571
No, no.

624
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,340
No more rough necking for me.

625
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,775
I've been to New Orleans, huh?

626
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,744
Watch your present.

627
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,575
Go ahead, open it.

628
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,715
- Earl, come on!

629
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:03,547
Yeah, yeah. Come on, baby.

630
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,254
What's this for?

631
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,122
Because you a young lady.

632
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:10,524
I've never had stockings before,
though.

633
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,393
Yeah, I know. It's time.

634
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,295
Because you are a beautiful
young lady.

635
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,660
Oh, is that good?

636
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,399
My sweet .

637
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,705
I'mma miss you.

638
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,637
Where are you going?

639
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,442
Can you keep a secret?

640
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:29,977
Cross my heart, hope to die.

641
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,409
Uh-hmm. I'm going to California.

642
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,049
-What you think of that?
-Can I go?

643
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,350
Come on, Earl. Let's go!

644
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,685
Yeah. Oh.

645
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,855
Well, uh, no, baby, no.

646
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,953
Uh, not now, later on.

647
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,259
After I'm all setup.

648
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:49,193
You can come out for a visit,
okay?

649
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:51,699
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

650
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,232
Remember, never be afraid.

651
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,937
You're just as good as anybody.

652
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,840
Better than most.

653
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,010
Right, you know that already.

654
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,483
Earl!

655
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,730
Baby, you know I love you,
right?

656
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,799
You do?

657
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,802
Aye. What you think?

658
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,338
Always?

659
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,077
Always.

660
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:38,141
Forever.

661
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,952
So when you coming home,
tonight?

662
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,895
So when you coming in?

663
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,360
Could you leave me in peace?

664
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:33,501
Where are you playing?

665
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,633
Same place they'll have me.

666
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:40,508
Ooh.
What's the matter neighbor,

667
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,906
can't you do
any better than that?

668
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:46,543
You should be more uptown,
a man of your talent,

669
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,579
or are you drinking
your talent away?

670
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,020
Did that crazy wife of yours

671
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,755
drive you to drink
your talent away?

672
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,920
Did that woman ruin your life?

673
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:59,456
Or did you ruin hers?

674
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:07,230
-Hey, Billy
-Hey, how you doing?

675
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,766
What's up, man?
How about yourself.

676
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,610
You're looking good,
as usual, Mrs. Delacroix.

677
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,642
Where's Earl?

678
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,111
I don't know.

679
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:23,517
And I don't think
he's coming back.

680
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,682
And why is that?

681
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,122
You.

682
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,520
What did I do?

683
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,128
He didn't appreciate me
dancing with you.

684
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:37,494
Come on. You're joking.

685
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:41,198
No, don't worry,
I wasn't really hit.

686
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,201
And he's in a mood to go.

687
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,404
Let me tell you what.

688
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,540
He's a foolish man to leave you.

689
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,448
Known him
since I was seven years old.

690
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:56,046
Well...

691
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,220
Well, he always walked in a

692
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,351
light of pride.

693
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,690
He wouldn't hunch over
for nobody.

694
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,230
That's what I loved about him.

695
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,767
Standing full, tall.

696
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,406
He's a beautiful man.

697
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,006
And it's the one that he ain't
been killed for that.

698
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:30,080
You know,
he was decorated in the war.

699
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,983
I didn't know that.

700
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,252
Sharpshooter.

701
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,988
Yeah.

702
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,661
You know,

703
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:47,764
he sure hit the mark
when he found you.

704
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,949
I have to--
I have to check on him.

705
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,434
Are you all right?

706
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,169
Yeah,
I'm doing this book report

707
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,004
for the summer program
at the library.

708
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,106
Uh-hmm. What book?

709
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,975
Reconstruction
in the Old South.

710
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,944
Hmm, they're still going on,
ain't it?

711
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,745
Yeah.

712
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:33,714
A very good girl.

713
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,115
Hmm.

714
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,718
You're gonna be first
ever go to college.

715
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,154
You smell like men's cologne.

716
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,689
Really?

717
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,287
Hmm. Must be Johnny's.

718
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:47,394
Okay, uh, are you sure
you're all right?

719
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:48,696
-Yeah?
-Yeah. All right.

720
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:51,294
-Don't stay up too late.
-I won't.

721
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:01,675
All right. Now here's
favorite pasttime.

722
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,374
Wine, wine, wine.

723
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:29,396
Ooh, let's go.

724
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:31,398
Yeah, let's go.

725
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,630
What did you drink?

726
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,364
Man, I can't drink no more.

727
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,637
Say, baby, so we can go in
and have us some fun.

728
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,273
Oh.

729
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,911
Yo, it's too bad.

730
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,410
No, he's coming back tomorrow.

731
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:24,047
I know.

732
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:27,050
Come on.

733
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,693
Bring that on, baby.

734
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,178
-Chicken.
- I am not.

735
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,813
I thought you were joking.

736
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:54,444
You did not.

737
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,483
You can't let me go by myself.

738
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,951
Then don't.

739
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,083
Go home, nut.

740
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,290
-Regina.

741
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,188
Regina!

742
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:38,292
Please. Please stop.

743
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:39,560
Please stop.

744
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,758
Come on.

745
01:02:58,041 --> 01:03:00,543
- You want a ride?

746
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,966
I'm going to go check
on Emerald. Cover me.

747
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,619
Emerald.

748
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,233
Jack?

749
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,432
-Jack.
- What, baby?

750
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,771
-Emerald is gone.
- Gone where?

751
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:05,939
I don't know.

752
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,174
Uh, run away?

753
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,239
Well, did she take her clothes?

754
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:11,078
She was talking about Chicago.

755
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,009
She wanted to go to--

756
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,382
Oh, my gosh. She's probably
going toward the bus

757
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,450
in Lafayette.

758
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,884
I need to borrow your car.

759
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,049
No, no. I'll take you myself.

760
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,058
- Oh, Ruby, maybe...
-Oh, you guys.

761
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,660
Don't tell me.

762
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,628
She's probably just walking
toward Lafayette.

763
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,064
Jack, would you go
get her and bring her back?

764
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,299
-We'll get her.
-We're going.

765
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:33,830
We're going.

766
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,551
Yeah, what's up, man?
How are you doing ?

767
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,483
All right.

768
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,473
- How you doing, baby?
-Hi.

769
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:20,310
Hi.

770
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:25,048
Let's go.

771
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,420
Excuse me, sir?

772
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,224
Excuse me. Rum and Coke!
Over here!

773
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,765
Ponchy. Ponchy!

774
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:42,165
-Rum and Coke!
-Yeah. I'll be right there.

775
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,204
Thank you.

776
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,340
My pleasure.

777
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:12,466
So how come
I never seen you around.

778
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:15,631
-Just passing through.

779
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,040
So what's your name?

780
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,604
Emerald.

781
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:25,775
You certainly are.

782
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,813
What's yours?

783
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:34,217
Mr. Right to you.

784
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:39,860
- Good show, Ruby.
-That's a good show, Ruby.

785
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,657
-All right. Goodnight, Ruby.
-Bye.

786
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,261
-See you.

787
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,433
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

788
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:53,302
-Have a good night, ma'am.
-Night.

789
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,639
You want some company?

790
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:00,510
No.

791
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,516
Sure?

792
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,252
I'd have enough trouble
to be talking to a white man

793
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:07,387
in the middle of the night.

794
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,552
Well, what trouble you got?

795
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:12,989
Nothing.

796
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,891
Ruby.

797
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,063
What's going on?

798
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,495
Well, what do you want from me?

799
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,166
Go home to your wife.

800
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,287
It's crowded over there.

801
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,962
Come on, darling. Come on.

802
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:55,631
No.

803
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,569
You're wild, little thing.
I like that.

804
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,609
-Come on, let's go.
-No. Get off of me.

805
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,844
-Come on, let's go.
-Get off of me.

806
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,013
-Let go of me.
-What?

807
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,011
May I cut in?

808
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:23,459
15?

809
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,700
What you all staring at?

810
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:50,653
It's okay, it's okay.

811
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:54,327
It's Emerald.

812
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,895
-Is she--
-She had enough.

813
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,327
Emerald, Emerald.

814
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,331
Are you okay?

815
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,937
You know,
the funny thing is,

816
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:12,545
I raised her to have
all this spirit, this spunk,

817
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,978
and every time she shows that,
I just get so scared.

818
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:18,852
And I know this world

819
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,684
is gonna try to bring her down
to her knees.

820
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,692
I thought they'd be back by now.

821
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,829
You're such a little momma,
you know that?

822
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,700
You got children?

823
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,140
We had one...

824
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,677
but we lost her.

825
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,812
Sorry.

826
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:54,550
Betty was in a car wreck and...

827
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,754
she flew sideways and...

828
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:01,691
hit the baby and...

829
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,995
died instantly.

830
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:12,072
Thing is, I was passed out
in a barn,

831
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,070
they were coming to pick me up.

832
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,742
So, it's all your fault.

833
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,379
Three...

834
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,481
four seconds...

835
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:28,517
been a different world.

836
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:34,728
See, I can't seem to shake
those three seconds.

837
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,259
Hmm.

838
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:42,368
You know, sometimes all it takes
is a few seconds

839
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,067
to turn your life
in the right direction.

840
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,208
One...

841
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,585
two...

842
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,806
Where have you been?

843
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:28,844
Girl, where have you been?

844
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,717
Over at Petrie's.

845
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:31,951
And how did you get there?

846
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,016
And you better
tell me the truth.

847
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,088
Hitchhiked.

848
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,490
Girl,
have you lost your mind?

849
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,325
Do you know where you are?

850
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,729
This is the segregated south
and you are a negro.

851
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:44,430
It's the middle of the night.

852
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,767
I will not have my daughter
beat and rape as a joke

853
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:48,968
by some drunk white man.

854
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:52,238
-Ma, I'm all right.
-By the grace of God, Emerald,

855
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:53,373
I could just beat you.

856
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:55,775
I could just shake you
until you get some sense.

857
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:58,144
-I'm sorry.
-Go to your room before I decide

858
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,942
to beat you right now.

859
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:02,048
Please don't talk to me
like that.

860
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:04,083
I'll talk to you
any way I want to.

861
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,614
No.

862
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,152
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

863
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:15,391
But I'm not a dog,
so don't talk to me like one.

864
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:24,400
Jack, Bootsie, I owe you.

865
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:26,569
You don't owe me
nothing, sheriff.

866
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,472
-Good night.
-Good night.

867
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:34,810
Well, hey, Dupre.

868
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:37,480
You had some night.

869
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,416
Just keeping her company
while she wait.

870
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:44,086
-I'm heading out.
-Good.

871
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:45,625
Bonsoir.

872
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:48,457
-Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir, mon ami.

873
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:01,303
Mommy.

874
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,143
I'm sorry, Emerald.

875
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,013
I'm sorry, too.

876
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,483
But I'm not sorry.

877
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:24,660
It's hard to know
what's right to do sometimes.

878
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:34,997
What are you doing?

879
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:40,002
I don't know.
I see your light on and...

880
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,205
I mean, you still got
my driver's license.

881
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:49,245
-Can I come in?
-Emerald's asleep.

882
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:56,285
Come.

883
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,885
I can't do this.

884
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:31,958
Why?

885
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,890
Because people
get killed for it, that's why.

886
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,296
You're a handsome man.

887
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:42,831
Well, thank you.

888
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,740
Women
tell you that often?

889
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,941
No.

890
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,472
Don't lie.

891
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,744
I'm sorry.

892
01:16:55,812 --> 01:16:58,581
You won't be sorry
for telling the truth.

893
01:17:01,551 --> 01:17:04,687
From all the goings-on
around here, I see.

894
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:07,323
I ain't like that.

895
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:14,263
Couldn't stop thinking
about you.

896
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,138
All I wanna do
is touch you again.

897
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,177
I never been
with another man.

898
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,183
Save myself for marriage

899
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,815
and then kept my promise
ever since.

900
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:36,552
Now, can you feature that?

901
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:42,491
Road house queen
of St. Mary parish.

902
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,101
Got no idea
how beautiful you are, do you?

903
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:49,569
Hmm.

904
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:51,200
No, you don't.

905
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:55,604
How long you'd been hiding?

906
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:00,175
How long you'd been waiting?

907
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,783
I see you, Ruby.

908
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:05,685
I don't understand
why I feel like

909
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:09,355
I know you.
I don't know you.

910
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,423
You do know me.

911
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:13,389
I know you make me feel
like I'm crazy.

912
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:15,591
Like I don't wanna...

913
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,313
Shine, Ruby.

914
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,652
Do I?

915
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,110
Shh. Come on.

916
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:29,735
I smell like cigarettes
and beer.

917
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:33,368
Me, too. So, what?

918
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:38,144
Uh...

919
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:39,808
I'm not--

920
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:44,947
I mean, if you don't want.

921
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,166
Shh. Shh. Shh.
You're gonna wake Emerald.

922
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:41,600
You're the one
making all the noise.

923
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,769
-Well, if you stay away from me.
-You know I can't.

924
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:45,171
No. No. No. No. No.

925
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:47,340
If you tickle me one more time
I'mma lose my mind.

926
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:50,376
You got a weakness
and I found it. Come here.

927
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,345
No. No. No.

928
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,811
-Don't you tickle me.
-Okay. Okay.

929
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:59,047
Promise. No more tickling
behind the knees.

930
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:02,718
You're the devil
and I don't believe you.

931
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:07,222
Open the door.

932
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:10,726
Open the door.

933
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,365
Bar's closed.

934
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:15,364
Sounds to me like you're
doing some business in there.

935
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:16,569
This is my place.

936
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,637
I want you gone,
I'mma call the sheriff.

937
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,307
I don't think you have to do
that with a white man in there.

938
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,438
-I'll go ahead back.
-Go.

939
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,112
You got to get her out of here.

940
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,043
Billy!

941
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:29,682
Billy,
I've got to tell you something.

942
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:31,117
I'll go get my things.

943
01:22:31,147 --> 01:22:33,315
I need to talk to you.

944
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:36,785
Dupre, open the door.

945
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:39,425
Billy, please open the door.

946
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:44,459
He's coming.
He'll be here in a minute.

947
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:23,265
I want you to listen to me.

948
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,502
You never listen to me.

949
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:32,374
When you stay out,

950
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:38,013
when you come home,
everything about you hurts me.

951
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:40,820
I waited for you tonight,

952
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,885
because I was gonna tell you
that I forgive you.

953
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,321
And I was gonna ask you
to forgive me.

954
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,926
And then you didn't come.

955
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:55,197
And I knew that nobody's ever
gonna forgive anybody.

956
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:01,003
What's your name?

957
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:04,840
Ruby.

958
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:10,545
Oh, you.
Did you enjoy my husband?

959
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:14,950
It didn't mean anything.

960
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,554
It does to me.

961
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,891
Do you have a husband?

962
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:25,394
Yes.

963
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,829
Does he do this?

964
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:33,869
Yes.

965
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:39,474
I don't know
why it cuts me so deep.

966
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:41,243
Betty, I...

967
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:45,414
I'm sorry this happened.

968
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,286
-I'm sorry--
-You are sorry you got caught.

969
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:55,057
And that's it.

970
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,859
Don't lie.

971
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00,362
Don't lie.

972
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:02,497
You know, you're right.

973
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,568
I'm not sorry it happened.

974
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:12,140
I can't live like this anymore.

975
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,283
Our son may be gone,
but you and I,

976
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,548
we're both still alive.

977
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:23,118
We can let go, hmm?

978
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,387
We can let go.

979
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,023
It's gonna be all right.

980
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:30,492
Nothing will ever be
all right again.

981
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,527
No.

982
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,832
No.

983
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,845
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

984
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,978
Stay with me. Don't move.
Hold on.

985
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,646
Hold on.

986
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,886
Can we call somebody?

987
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:55,617
You shot him.

988
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:58,019
Can we get help?

989
01:25:58,354 --> 01:25:59,955
He's dead.

990
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,234
Oh, man.

991
01:26:47,436 --> 01:26:48,970
Where's Ruby?

992
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:51,006
I don't know.

993
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,212
I came as fast as I could.

994
01:26:53,242 --> 01:26:54,613
What the hell
happened here, Ruby?

995
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:56,882
Qu'est que ça?
You didn't shoot him, did you?

996
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:58,283
She did it. But it don't matter.

997
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,152
They'll get me
on my knees because of it.

998
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:01,387
I can't let Emerald see that.

999
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,188
No. Ms. Betty would tell them
what happened.

1000
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,024
-She won't lie.
-I never lie.

1001
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:06,558
You see,
she'll tell them the truth.

1002
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,127
And nobody will think
you did anything.

1003
01:27:08,157 --> 01:27:10,663
It doesn't matter. They'll know
I slept with a married white man

1004
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:13,132
and he got killed because of me.
The door is open, Johnny,

1005
01:27:13,162 --> 01:27:14,763
I'll never get it shut.

1006
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,502
Earl's gone, Johnny.

1007
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,170
It's just me
against all of them.

1008
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,436
I got to get Emerald out of here
before it all starts.

1009
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,252
Leave it.

1010
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,326
I'll tell them
I was with Dupre,

1011
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:42,661
she came, they got in a fight
and she shot him.

1012
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:43,896
I saw everything.

1013
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,497
You were in the back.
Not even here.

1014
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:46,999
You think she's gonna lie
for me.

1015
01:27:47,029 --> 01:27:48,763
I never lie.

1016
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,632
No more lies.

1017
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,668
I'll never get away
if I don't do it right now.

1018
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:56,942
Johnny, I wanna give you
the deed to my building

1019
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:58,177
in exchange for your car.

1020
01:27:58,207 --> 01:28:00,479
But you were born here.
This is yours.

1021
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:02,915
I won't let them take my dignity
because I forgot my place

1022
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,616
-for a few minutes.

1023
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:06,185
Because I acted human
for once.

1024
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:07,883
Where's the phone?

1025
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:13,255
Johnny...

1026
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,027
do this favor for me.

1027
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:16,628
Take the deed
to the Bucket of Blood.

1028
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,793
No, this is too much.
Just...

1029
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,464
-Just take the car.
- No, no, please.

1030
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:25,934
I know it will be in good hands.

1031
01:28:27,069 --> 01:28:28,670
Do it for me.

1032
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,541
Emerald!

1033
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,445
Emerald!

1034
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:49,891
Ma, did you shoot him?

1035
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,631
-No.
-Then why are we running?

1036
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,496
We're not running.

1037
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:01,136
Ma! Leave me.

1038
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:04,543
Don't push me down. I didn't do
anything to be ashamed of.

1039
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:07,108
-Neither did I.
-Then don't act like it.

1040
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,854
I'm doing this for you.

1041
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,624
No. You're scared...

1042
01:29:23,225 --> 01:29:25,297
-like always.
-You're damn right I'm scared.

1043
01:29:25,327 --> 01:29:27,099
And smart to be scared.

1044
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:28,734
Is it smart to run
like a criminal

1045
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:30,936
-when you're not a criminal?
-I might risk it

1046
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:34,202
if it was just me, but I can't
take the chance with you.

1047
01:29:37,573 --> 01:29:41,276
Your daddy, he's gone.

1048
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:43,979
And he ain't coming back.

1049
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:46,614
I know.

1050
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:50,652
You knew?

1051
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,493
Then what happens
if I get jailed for this?

1052
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:56,391
What happens to you?

1053
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:59,231
Livin' beneath the bars?

1054
01:29:59,261 --> 01:30:00,299
But what if you don't?

1055
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:02,534
Don't get jailed for this?

1056
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,899
Then we just live
with a scandal.

1057
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:07,702
Small towns don't ever forget.

1058
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:27,155
Mommy, I'm okay.

1059
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:31,960
If I don't leave today,
I'll leave soon.

1060
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:36,735
So don't do this for me.

1061
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:40,101
Don't hide behind me.

1062
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,073
What do you need to do?

1063
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,980
Dupre.

1064
01:30:55,884 --> 01:30:58,153
He was so kind to me.

1065
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:04,058
God! I thought for a second
he might be able to save me.

1066
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,364
Maybe he did.

1067
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,643
I should have left
a long time ago.

1068
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,951
Let's get out of here.

1069
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:50,205
