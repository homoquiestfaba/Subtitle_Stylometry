00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,127
At 7:00, a meeting
with His Holiness

00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,596
At the Plazo del Gubenaturato,
and then a dinner

00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,698
At 8:00 to follow.

00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:31,632
And to eat?

6
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,433
What?

7
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,301
The course.

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,268
Ah.

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,571
It was beef last
time, perhaps fowl.

10
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,940
On a Tuesday?

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,076
Nothing is guaranteed
except cake.

12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,212
The pontiff loves his cake.

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,658
Road block ahead,
your eminence.

14
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,799
Rock slide ahead.

15
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,469
You'll have to wait
here until it's clear.

16
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,903
I don't hear any machines.

17
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,573
Where are the other workers?

18
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,409
Well then, tell
Cardinal Ponti his bill

19
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,444
Collectors have arrived.

20
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:28,589
Please, man.

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,723
You've gone back on your word.

22
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:30,891
Too bad that's not
an official sin.

23
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,794
I could go through
the usual channels.

24
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,130
All I want is what's mine.

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,832
My soul is no longer for sale.

26
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,712
One way or another, I
will have you in Hell!

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,659
If I don't get some new

I was making more money when
I was pimping your old lady.

Forget it.

He wants to make a very
public appearance there

To drum up support.

00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,515
I think it's a good idea.

will meet with Agent Tango

the hell's wrong with you?

particularly feisty,

do an Elvis story.

No.

Look at this stuff.

The Vatican threatened
a libel suit, Dare.

176
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,371

But the facts!

180
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,479
The proof spoke for itself!

181
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,147
Oh, forget it, Dare.

182
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,049
This job just ain't your style.

186
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,354
Right now, I'm... I'm in a slump.

187
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,355
I'll be the first to admit.

188
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,791
My girl kicked me out, and...

189
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,792
Oh, look, is that all?

190
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:25,959
You need a place to stay?

191
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,728
Why don't you stay
with your brother?

192
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:28,862
Doesn't he have a big place?

193
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,163
Anthony?
Forget it!

194
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,131
No way!

195
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,667
I am not hanging
out with that freak.

196
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,636
Well, my wife and I
have a spare bedroom.

197
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,906
No one's using it right
now, since my kid went off

198
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,473
To tabloid journalism school.

199
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,608
So, uh...

200
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,442
Yeah?

201
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,311
[Growl]

202
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,180
So here's $30.

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,782
Go get a motel.

204
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,918
Dare, we hired you on the
basis of your experience

205
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,453
With the paranormal, so
I've decided to put you

206
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,222
On the Cardinal Ponti story.

207
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,023
What?

208
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,424
The guy's a fake!

209
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,526
Any choir boy worth his weight
I n wafers will tell you that!

210
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,962
Well, he's coming
to town in 36 hours,

211
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:05,298
And the guy always
puts on a good show!

212
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,801
Why don't you give me that UFO
lead I was telling you about?

213
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,037
Oh, Dare, we missed the
last miracle the guy did.

214
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,571
He's a pariah.

215
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,073
People love that shit.

216
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,209
Catholics are our second biggest
audience after homemakers.

217
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,645
Ponti makes the
cash registers ring!

218
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,813
So get out there!

219
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,114
The guy's a fake.

220
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,583
Those miracles he does are
just old tent revival gigs.

221
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,518
The man's practically a saint.

222
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,288
He's been shot at more times
than he can count, and lived!

223
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,758
Oh, and those assassination
attempts are fake too,

224
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:31,959
Mr. Cannon.

225
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,561
The ballistic reports the
FBI published are fake.

226
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,263
I got a guy on the inside.

227
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,765
And, uh, check this out, Art.

228
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,867
[Singing]

229
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,101
Hey, that's a good angle.

230
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,335
Let me take that, Art!

231
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,136
Art?

232
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,671
No more conspiracies.

233
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,606
Give me pop stars!

234
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,440
Professionalism!

235
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,241
Photos!

236
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,342
And proof!

237
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,477
The golden Ps.

238
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,413
Isn't that P, S, P, F, and P?

239
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,282
Oh, get the hell out of here.

240
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,985
And take that yodeling
Elvisita with you!

241
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,591
What the hell is this?

242
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,688
MAN: Mecca Arena,
get me the Skull.

243
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:36,489
No lacquer.

244
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,757
What are you going to do?

245
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,692
Tell them, Dario.

246
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:40,828
Dario Dare here!

247
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,062
Let me tell you something.

248
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,931
Jimmy the Skull?

249
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,299
It's all over for you
tonight at the Mecca!

250
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,168
My man, the Rock and
Roll Miracle... oh,

251
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,502
Let me just say this!

252
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:54,207
1991 has been the year that
rock and roll has been reborn!

253
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,576
The Rock and Roll Miracle
came down from the sky,

254
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,846
And he's looking right
at you, Jimmy the Skull!

255
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,380
Tonight, it's all over!

256
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,649
Steel cage match, Jimmy!

257
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,450
That's right.

258
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,052
Tonight, on the WWW Square...

259
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,653
I need a room.

260
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,157
Aye, we can do
that for you, sir.

261
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,225
Say, you look just
like that fellow.

262
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,428
Like... like... like Dario
Dare, the wrestling fellow!

263
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,164
You look just like him.

264
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,066
Yeah, I look like
him, sound like him,

265
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,400
I even dress like him, too.

266
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,970
Man, I am Dario Dare.

267
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,171
What an honor!

268
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,340
The Dario Dare in me very
own bed and breakfast!

269
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,311
You know, wrestling
is me favorite sport.

270
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,780
How about that room?

271
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,582
Aye, we got our
best suite open.

272
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:36,449
Number seven.

273
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,650
Lucky seven.

274
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,721
Would you autograph
this for me, please?

275
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,522
To?

276
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,356
Polo.

277
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,458
My name's Polo, like the game.

278
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,427
Or like that smelly
stuff, the cologne.

279
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,330
Polo McCrimmin, of
the clan McCrimmin.

280
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,198
To Polo.

281
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,472
So what are you doing now?

282
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,074
Not enough.

283
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,509
A man with your reputation?

284
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,044
I'm working for the
National Explainer.

285
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,378
I'm a writer now.

286
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,579
The Explainer!

287
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,816
That's me favorite
magazine, lad!

288
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,885
Would you... would you... would
you sign this, too, please?

289
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,328
To Polo.

290
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,829
Would you give me
the fucking room now?

291
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,796
Dario Dare.

292
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,332
[Laughing]

293
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,433
You wrestling managers!

294
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,635
You got such a way
with the language!

295
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,569
Sure, your room.

296
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,406
You rang?

297
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,179
Aye.

298
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,349
Please take Mr. Dario Dare's
things to our celebrity suite.

299
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,984
Which one is that?

300
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,185
Number seven.

301
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,319
They're identical.

302
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,554
No they're not.

303
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,756
I don't have anything
to, uh, carry.

304
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,458
Thanks anyways.

305
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,628
You could take me
to my room, though.

306
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,098
This way, Dare.

307
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,266
That's Mr. Dare.

308
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,768
He's a celebrity.

309
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,603
This is the big night, Jimmy!

310
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:04,704
It's all over!

311
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,006
The little mask thing
isn't going to work!

312
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,975
The hokey pokey
and the spookiness!

313
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,776
Put your mojo bone away, pal.

314
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,577
It's all over.

315
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,444
Ring the bell.

316
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:12,379
Oh, the referee!

317
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,513
I can hear him
counting to three!

318
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,381
You hear that, Jimmy?

319
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,182
It's all over!

320
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,451
Oh, boy!

321
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,519
Celebrity, huh?

322
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,320
Not anymore.

323
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,322
I'm a working guy now.

324
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,624
Sort of.

325
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,494
Hey, uh, want to step back
later for a night cap?

326
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:30,430
Here.

327
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,100
You're going to need this.

328
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,968
You know, I have
the strange feeling

329
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,337
I've seen you somewhere before.

330
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,905
Miss April, 1988.

331
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,473
I knew it!

332
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,977
You have the greatest... ow.

333
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,445
[Phone ringing]

334
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,181
MAN: Hey man, it's
back in a motion

335
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,584
Picture that will make you never
want to see another film again.

336
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:56,156
Hello, Nancy, a tale of lust
and honor in the Third Reich,

337
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,592
With Nancy, mistress
extraordinaire

338
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,228
On the Sieg Heil set.

339
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,795
She must come after
the pastoral herd

340
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,665
Animal love making
montage, otherwise

341
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,501
The motivation is for poo poo!

342
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,936
[Phone ringing]

343
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:10,903
Wait.

344
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,805
What is that effect?

345
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,441
How could a phone be ringing?

346
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,275
It's off the hook?

347
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,243
It's your cell, Van Halen.

348
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,077
Pick it up.

349
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,348
Hello?

350
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,249
Oh, Dario!

351
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,717
What a super prize surprise!

352
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,518
Hey, everybody!

353
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,654
It's my brother!

354
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,588
Listen, Tony.

355
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,389
I need...

356
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,958
Please call me A Man, Dario.

357
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,327
You changed your name to A Man?

358
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,063
What's wrong with my name?

359
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,498
It's a name of stage and screen.

360
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,234
Everybody knows Dario isn't
your real name, Eugene.

361
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,070
Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.

362
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,304
Fine.

363
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,640
Listen, A Man, Alison
kicked me out, and...

364
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,278
A monstrous decree of travesty
has befallen my dear Dario.

365
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,646
The she wolf will pay for this.

366
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,316
Alison kicked you out
of your own house?

367
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,684
No, no, no.

368
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,753
She was perfectly
justified in what she did.

369
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,124
Why, that little
Sadian wench biscuit.

370
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,658
It's not your house?

371
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,727
Well, I mean, you pay
rent on the bloody thing.

372
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,729
It may as well be.

373
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,231
You don't?

374
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,031
Oh.

375
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,666
Ho hum.

376
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,203
Maybe you can live with me,
humble servant of Dionysus

377
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,670
In the palace of pleasure.

378
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,708
Bedazzled by a glowing in my
presence once again, brother!

379
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,177
But you'd have to share a
room with the mountain lion.

380
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,712
Hello?

381
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,649
It appears his
desires have changed.

382
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,252
Gino, where's my cappuccino?

383
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,421
Why are you looking at
me, you filthy thing?

384
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,322
Get my cino!

385
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,162
You are the ginkiest A Man!

386
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,097
That's me.

387
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,565
Mm-hm.

388
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,033
[Laughing]

389
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,135
Jimmy the Skull!

390
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,236
You went down!

391
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,471
Oh, you didn't last
very long in that cage!

392
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,406
One, two, three, it's all over!

393
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,207
Rock!

394
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,576
What's... what...

395
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,377
Yeah!

396
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,082
Hello, lady.

397
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,385
Welcome to Polo Celebrity Motel!

398
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,556
Oh my God!

399
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,424
Oh, God!

400
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,225
Oh.

401
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,360
That's me favorite sport.

402
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,295
You like wrestling too, maybe?

403
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,565
[Screaming]

404
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,967
With the right person.

405
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,302
I need a room.

406
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,102
Very good.

407
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,103
Cash or credit?

408
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,040
Ah.

409
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:28,841
We take this.

410
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,845
Miss, uh... Catalina Powers?

411
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,680
Cat.

412
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,814
I knew it!

413
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,750
You're that singer from
New York, aren't you?

414
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,685
Among other things.

415
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,952
How do you now?

416
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,754
There isn't a whole lot to
do out here in the sticks.

417
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,889
I read a lot.

418
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,124
I really loved your last CD.

419
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,459
Thank you, Miss?

420
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,460
Tango.

421
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,261
Marian.

422
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,900
Uh, I read too, you know.

423
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,002
You read tabloids, Polo.

424
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,538
Not exactly Oscar Wilde.

425
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,606
Only the Explainer, lassie.

426
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,508
It's me favorite magazine!

427
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,316
How long are you staying?

428
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,417
Until my work is done.

429
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,251
Oh?

430
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,819
What are you doing here in town?

431
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,754
Ponti sent me.

432
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,755
Ponti?

433
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,391
No need to play coy with me.

434
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,059
These bags contain
your equipment

435
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,294
And mission briefings.

436
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,396
The usual security
measures apply.

437
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,332
Do you have a map of town?

438
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,333
There's this.

439
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,368
Not very detailed.

440
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,802
I can't believe
you're one of us.

441
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,970
The Cat Powers.

442
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,075
Sore?

443
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,445
Take off your shoes.

444
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,246
Relax.

445
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,813
You can trust me.

446
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:46,118
I may be a secret agent for the
Vatican, but I'm just a girl.

447
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,854
You are so amazing.

448
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,129
[Burp]

449
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,067
[Burp]

450
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,004
You seem very familiar to me.

451
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,106
Have I seen you in the academy?

452
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,010
I modeled a few years ago for
a couple of men's magazines.

453
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,913
Cardinal X wants this all
to go off without a hitch.

454
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,515
Yes.

455
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,550
Do you understand your orders?

456
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,985
Yes.

457
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,255
You got the greatest...

458
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,556
Oh my god.

459
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,793
So, you ever thought about
returning to the ring, lad?

460
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:27,894
Hell no.

461
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:28,695
Are you kidding?

462
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,496
It's too violent.

463
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,531
It nearly killed me.

464
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:32,499
Serious now?

465
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,333
Oh, yeah.

466
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,502
Listen, I'm no fighter.

467
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,538
Writing for the Explainer
is more respectable anyway.

468
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,772
Hmm.

469
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,409
What kind of stories
they got you writing now?

470
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,045
Some sports, but mostly
reporting on the paranormal.

471
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,748
Aye, me cousin was a
wee bit paranormal, too.

472
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,982
No, no, no.

473
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,086
It's like, the strange, the
bizarre, the unexpected.

474
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,624
Well, you know, we've got
a lot of that around here.

475
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:58,758
Really?

476
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,728
The other night, down
by the sausage factory,

477
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,632
I saw something that scared
the bejeezus out of me!

478
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,634
That... wait.

479
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,970
If I tell you, do I get
to be in the Explainer,

480
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,305
Next to the two-headed
lizard lovechild?

481
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,973
Aye, I saw...

482
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,109
Polo, what did you see?

483
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,320
You know we're going?

484
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,821
Oh, aye, sir.

485
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,423
Just you wait and see.

486
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,403
Great rocks, Polo.

487
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,203
Shh.

488
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,004
Get down.

489
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,809
You don't want them to hear you.

490
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,610
The rocks?

491
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,944
The demons!

492
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,012
Sit down.

493
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,949
It may be a while
before we see them.

494
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,488
Sometimes, there will be
groovy bright lights, too.

495
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:04,156
Maybe a space ship or something.

496
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,127
It'd make a great story.

497
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,129
Will the hotel get mentioned
if it's printed, lad?

498
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,072
[Snorting]

499
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,378
That's them, lad!

500
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,880
Fantastic.

501
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,348
They don't look like aliens.

502
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,851
It be the devil's work.

503
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,021
Yeah, well, Satan
makes great press.

504
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,924
Got a built in audience
of every God-fea...

505
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,892
Where the hell are they?

506
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,466
Do you think
they've seen us, lad?

507
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,367
Uh, yeah.

508
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,870
[Screaming]

509
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,872
[Laughing]

510
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:09,121
Took a wrong turn there, Dario.

511
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,991
You have an appointment in Hell.

512
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,092
Oh, shit!

513
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,962
[Non-english speech]

514
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,331
[Laughing]

515
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,133
Eat this!

516
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,540
Bloody hell, let's
get out of here!

517
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,560
Damn it, lad, that was close.

518
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,896
Well, Cannon's
got his story now!

519
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,931
I don't understand.

520
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:56,736
You go to this quarry, and
these robed demons chase you,

521
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,471
And then you run into
this guy with a hat...

522
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,773
A hard hat.

523
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,274
And then he says
something in a... in a...

524
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,578
Weird otherworldly voice!

525
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,614
How many of those
beers have you guys had?

526
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,381
Damn it, lassie, it was real!

527
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:12,852
Mr. Dare, he's got
pictures to prove it!

528
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:13,786
Is this true?

529
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,588
It is, my dear.

530
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,657
It is.

531
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:18,891
You have failed.

532
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,826
How could you fail?

533
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,929
Their strength
is great, master.

534
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,164
You ruined my robe, great one.

535
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:25,965
Silence!

536
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,066
No excuses!

537
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,669
It's falling apart, just time.

538
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:33,272
Get there, and get him alone.

539
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:36,843
The robed creatures, along with
their supernaturally endowed

540
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:42,915
Suited accomplice, all
seem to add up to... yeah!

541
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:43,916
Get him!

542
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:44,951
Get him!

543
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:51,423
Get him, get him,
get him! [Shouting]

544
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,376
Don't open this
door for anyone.

545
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,477
Why?

546
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,880
Those guys are full
of shit, aren't they?

547
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,681
Maybe.

548
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,955
Come on, you bastards!

549
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,157
I know you're out there!

550
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,058
Come and fight me!

551
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,660
What are you doing out here?

552
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,764
Uh, protecting you ladies.

553
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,666
Super.

554
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,636
And the honor of
the Clan McCrimmin.

555
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,436
Bozo.

556
00:25:56,756 --> 00:26:00,126
[Screaming]

557
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:18,044
[Screaming]

558
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:28,788
Ow.

559
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:29,588
Idiot.

560
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,623
What took you so long?

561
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,191
I'm tired.

562
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:32,992
Huh?

563
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:33,793
[Gunshots]

564
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:34,994
Hey!

565
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,963
Stop it!

566
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,430
That hurts!

567
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,431
Quit it!

568
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,399
Stop it!

569
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,576
Whoa, Mr. Dare.

570
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,496
Report.

571
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,999
We have Dario Dare,
my lord, but we

572
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,201
Got more than we bargained for.

573
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,705
One Polo Angus McCrimmin,
motel owner, and Catalina

574
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,173
Powers, agent of Vatican City.

575
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,509
Vatican, eh?

576
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,544
Erase Miss Powers
from existence.

577
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,480
Don't want any of those
fruitcakes down here.

578
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,318
Enslave McCrimmin on
Level D. And as for Dario,

579
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:36,655
Strip him and bring
him before me!

580
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:37,489
Sign in!

581
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:50,903
Greetings, Dario.

582
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,839
You look like hell.

583
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:56,275
[Laughter]

584
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,712
What is this place?

585
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,748
Let's just say you went south.

586
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,615
Come on, guess.

587
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:04,416
Guess.

588
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,918
What, no?

589
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,754
It's Hell!

590
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,521
I'm not surprised.

591
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,923
I lived my life the
way I wanted to.

592
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,725
Oh, you're not dead.

593
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,161
And I suppose you're not Satan.

594
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,328
You flatter me.

595
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,129
Beazley.

596
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,298
Bob Beazley.

597
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,099
Bob Beazley.

598
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,501
Beazley Bob.

599
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,335
Beelzebub.

600
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,503
Very funny.

601
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:25,437
Prove it.

602
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,306
Prove that any of this is real.

603
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,508
We are a very
shapers of reality.

604
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,410
Each and every one of us.

605
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,447
For example, you and I both
know that professional wrestling

606
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,451
Is real, but how many
people claim otherwise?

607
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,588
And how many people have laughed
off the National Explainer

608
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,323
As a rag full of lies?

609
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:48,394
Hey, everything I write
is the God honest truth!

610
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,062
No offense.

611
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,964
People put down the
National Explainer

612
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,633
Because it doesn't fit in
with their predetermined

613
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,035
Sense of reality.

614
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,906
Just because people haven't
seen a Bigfoot in person,

615
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:02,541
They assume it doesn't exist.

616
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,643
But the very same
individuals will never

617
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,014
See a platypus or
an emu in person,

618
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,149
But believe in them
unquestioningly.

619
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,184
I've said that too.

621
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,419
But listen, Bob.

622
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,754
This whole Ronnie James
Dio playhouse you got here?

623
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,257
Um, I'm not buying it.

624
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,259
I admit you had me
hooked here for a while,

625
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,129
But when that broad came in
with the gun firing blanks?

626
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,931
I mean, come on, guys.

627
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,033
It's not even Halloween.

628
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,401
I'm sorry, but the Shriners
put on a better spook show

629
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,870
Than you dudes.

630
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,840
Hey!

631
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,807
[Screaming]

632
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:38,277
[Laughter]

633
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,863
Fuck you, Bobby, my man!

634
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,597
That's the Dario
Dare I know and love.

635
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:03,836
Now look, chum, I'll make
this painfully obvious to you.

636
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,437
I need you.

637
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:09,508
You are going on a mission...
An assassination, to be exact.

638
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:14,013
You are to terminate
Cardinal Giancarlo Ponti

639
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,747
And bring his soul to me.

640
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:16,515
Sorry, Bob.

641
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:17,850
You got the wrong guy.

642
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,419
I'm a reporter, not a lone nut.

643
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,922
Besides, can't you
guys kill him yourself?

644
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:23,923
You don't need a killer.

645
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:24,823
You need a patsy.

646
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,359
Oh, we tried the usual paths.

647
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,662
But his powers are the
equal of my own by now.

648
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,632
Only a surprise
attack will work.

649
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,502
No more of this frontal
assault nonsense.

650
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:37,303
Powers?

651
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,104
But I thought...

652
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:40,239
Oh, it's real, Mr. Dare.

653
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,341
Ponti and I had a deal.

654
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,144
I gave him some minor powers
in exchange for his soul.

655
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,946
A routine transaction.

656
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,715
Bait and switch, as
we call it down here.

657
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:54,286
And now, as usual, the asshole
wants to keep his little soul.

658
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,355
You mean all his
miracles are Hell powered?

659
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,890
Far out.

660
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,027
I knew that Ponti wasn't
as pure as Perrier.

661
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,661
But what does he want?

662
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,363
He wants to be Pope.

663
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,932
Pope is power.

664
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:09,936
Some men will do anything to
be in a position of leadership.

665
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,138
And what do you get?

666
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,172
Even.

667
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,574
Oh, I had aspirations.

668
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:19,145
An agent of Satan in the
Vatican, a car in every garage,

669
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,580
A baby in every stove.

670
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,017
You see, soul ownership is a
bit of a trade here in Hell,

671
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,853
And I've got some real
winners in my collection.

672
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:33,359
The Marquis de Sade, Edgar Allen
Poe, John Holmes, Liberace.

673
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,194
That's how I got this palace.

674
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,996
Overachievement!

675
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,731
In the service of
our King Satan.

676
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:45,304
And do you know what my crowning
Earthly achievement was?

677
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,105
What?

678
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,039
Jonestown.

679
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,840
The Guyana tragedy.

680
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,676
You did Jonestown?

681
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:54,213
Let's just say I had agreements
with a few key people.

682
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:55,514
Kool-Aid, Mr. Dare?

683
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:56,315
Later.

684
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,353
Ponti would have
been my masterpiece.

685
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:11,497
[Grunt] A toast to all
my friends, and to you,

686
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,864
Dare, for taking the job.

687
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:13,932
I'm not taking the job.

688
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,902
Oh, too late to back
out now, old chum.

689
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,038
I have something you want.

690
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,706
Look familiar?

691
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,308
Oh, I suppose not.

692
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:24,710
You've never seen a soul before.

693
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,979
It's yours, Dario.

694
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:32,818
Shake shake shake, shake shake
shake, shake your soul jar!

695
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,886
Well, it's a bit tarnished,
and a little bit smaller

696
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,188
Than when you first started.

697
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,723
But it must mean
something to you.

698
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,295
What now, goddammit?

699
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,663
Missile attack, my liege!

700
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,398
Mistress Gumbata is at it again!

701
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,199
Gumbata!

702
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:51,903
Ow!

703
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,705
Ow!

704
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,506
Enough!

705
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,009
Playtime is over.

706
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,077
So long, Dario.

707
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,845
We'll be in touch.

708
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,313
Dickhead.

709
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,149
I don't care about security.

710
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,784
I want to speak to Cardinal X,
Vatican facilitator right now.

711
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,686
I've got a missing
agent on my hands.

712
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,722
Agent Tango, why are you
using an unsecured line?

713
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,523
X?

714
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:12,558
Screw you.

715
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,759
I'm not in the mood
for formalities.

716
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:16,428
What did you do with Cat Powers?

717
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:20,432
Why would we do anything to one
of our own operatives, Maria?

718
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,936
Now, tell me where you are.

719
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,772
So you can have
me eliminated too?

720
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:30,642
Cat Powers left the motel at
11:36 in full battle dress.

721
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,378
Where did you send her?

722
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,214
Surely I don't know what
you're talking about.

723
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,583
We've issued no
orders of any kind

724
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,752
From this office in
the last 10 hours.

725
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,388
Now get a grip.

726
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:47,025
Cardinal Ponti will be
arriving in just a few hours.

727
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,061
A few hours? [Muffled shout]

728
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,697
Didn't you read
the briefing yet?

729
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:52,631
Tango?

730
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:53,432
Tango!

731
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,036
It's me, Your Holiness.

732
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,405
You idiot!

733
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,972
Get Tango out of sight now!

734
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,517
[Screaming]

735
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,193
Check me out!

736
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,661
I'm not naked!

737
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,296
No one naked over here!

738
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:27,533
Not naked.

739
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,867
Yeah.

740
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:32,371
Check me out, because
I'm not naked!

741
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,172
Yeah!

742
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,306
No one naked over here.

743
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,349
BOB (VOICEOVER): This
is your mission, Dare.

744
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,185
Should you decide not to accept
it, your soul will rot in Hell,

745
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,053
Your body will become
demonized, zombified,

746
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,655
And eventually give out.

747
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,190
So don't waste
any time reporting

748
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,491
This to the
authorities, or trying

749
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,660
To get anyone on your side.

750
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,263
This the Hellion
7,000 sniper rifle.

751
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:01,233
Bolt action, 7.62 millimeter,
with an eight power scope

752
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,303
And a specially outfitted soul
catcher... the chrome cylinder

753
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,837
You see before you.

754
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,874
When fired at a living human,
the bullet takes the life

755
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,642
While the soul catcher
attracts the life

756
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,977
Force contained therein.

757
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,545
It's simple, Mr. Dare.

758
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:14,346
His life for yours.

759
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,747
His soul for your own.

760
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,485
Just shoot straight and leave
the rest to the soul catcher.

761
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,454
At the moment the soul
catcher is occupied,

762
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,022
We will teleport
you back to hell

763
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,024
And reunite you with your soul.

764
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,858
Sounds peachy, huh?

765
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,661
Don't mess it up.

766
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,462
Too tight?

767
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,899
Ow.

768
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,033
Too bad.

769
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,069
Your reputation
precedes you, Marion.

770
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,006
Three years in Laos,
two in Costa Rica.

771
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:45,211
Personal assistant to Bishop
Schikel Gruber in Berlin?

772
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,012
Quite a dossier.

773
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,281
If you two are that fond
of me, a simple fan letter

774
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,682
Would have sufficed.

775
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,719
Idolatry is a sin, Miss Tango.

776
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,154
But so is killing, and
that hasn't stopped us yet.

777
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,689
As long as we
confess afterwards,

778
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,325
I suppose there
isn't anything we

779
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,092
Won't do in the line of duty.

780
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,832
A quote comes to mind.

781
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:07,899
Kill them all.

782
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,968
God will know his own.

783
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,438
Arnold Amelrick
Pabelaget, 12:08.

784
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:15,674
You guys are crazier than
you look, you know that?

785
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,677
Take Cardinal
Ponti, for instance.

786
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,145
A real up and comer, they say.

787
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:24,115
A shoo-in for the
[inaudible], the next Pope.

788
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:28,554
Let's just say he
hasn't got a prayer.

789
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:32,891
Not with his cheap
bodyguards out of the way.

790
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,926
So what do you think
you can get away with?

791
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,796
This is the 20th century, in
case you haven't been counting.

792
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,733
The Holy See transcends
time, my dear.

793
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,970
Since when have local laws
and rules of etiquette

794
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,239
Applied to its membership?

795
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,208
The Pope is the last
true sovereign figure

796
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,544
In all of Europe!

797
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,749
Are you paying attention?

798
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,785
She could confess at any moment!

799
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,487
You're ranting.

800
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,756
I am not ranting.

801
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,892
I am warming her up.

802
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,627
What is this?

803
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,230
Good agent, bad agent?

804
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:17,202
Hey, handsome, give me
a hit off that shake.

805
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,170
God, how could you?

806
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,506
Sharing straws. Ugh!

807
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:23,975
Do you mind?

808
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,110
Go sit down.

809
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,817
There's just a few things we
need to know if our plan is

810
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,520
To go off without a hitch.

811
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,255
MAN: Finally, the JFK
board game was here.

812
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,859
I've been waiting six
weeks for this thing.

813
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,893
[Knocking]

814
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:42,694
Come in!

815
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:47,833
- Hey, Kirk.
- Dario!

816
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:48,767
I don't believe it.

817
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,035
You're just in time!

818
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,237
I invited you over here
five years ago, man,

819
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:53,772
And you're finally here.

820
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,073
I just... look what I just got!

821
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,442
The JFK board game!

822
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,009
You're just in time to play it.
Oh, this is great.

823
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,810
You want anything?

824
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,313
Like some ice cubes, or...

825
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,314
Oh, hey, muffins!

826
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,515
Muffins, muffins, oh, hey!

827
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,450
Yeah.

828
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,484
Those are... those
are my muffins.

829
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,853
No, those are my muffins, Dario.

830
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,856
Jesus Christ, man.

831
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,659
Special, uh... special
muffins for me.

832
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,160
You're a big
conspiracy nut, right?

833
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,094
Oh, am I?

834
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,664
Oh, god, you
wouldn't believe it!

835
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:22,167
I mean, I got books,
tapes, CD-ROM, cassettes.

836
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:26,071
I mean, I got a subscription to
Paranoid Creep Magazine, even.

837
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,639
I mean, you can ask me
any question you want.

838
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,440
Any question.

839
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,375
Go ahead.

840
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,377
Like who did the
autopsy on Kennedy

841
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,111
At the Bethesda Naval
Hospital and then

842
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,312
Burned all of his notes?

843
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:35,814
Go ahead, ask me.

844
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:36,815
Who?

845
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:37,883
I don't know, but
I can look it up.

846
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,418
I got it right here.

847
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:40,686
Uh, here it is.
Humes.

848
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:41,587
Commander James Humes.

849
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:42,688
No.

850
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,623
He's the guy who... he...
He burned his notes,

851
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:45,557
And... oh, man.

852
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,358
I know.

853
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,225
Amazing.

854
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,660
I want you to go
to the Basilica

855
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,095
And take some pictures for me.

856
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,029
Get a camera.

857
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,764
Take some pictures
for me of Ponti.

858
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,065
Oh, no, that's your story.

859
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,534
Cannon gave it to you.

860
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,235
That's not... that's your story.

861
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,004
Yeah, but how
many pictures have

862
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,407
You seen of Ponti
with his head exploded

863
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,675
From a sniper's bullet?

864
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,544
What are you talking about?

865
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:09,515
Well, if you just show up
at the Basilica with some

866
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:12,017
Pictures of Ponti, for me...

867
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,652
Yeah?

868
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:17,389
You will have the
scoop of the century.

869
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,189
Huh.

870
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,157
Yeah.

871
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,126
Yeah.

872
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,095
[Laughter]

873
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:24,896
Yeah.

874
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:25,764
Can you do that for me?

875
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

876
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:27,866
- Yeah.
- By the way.

877
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,100
- Yeah?
- Jim Jones?

878
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,035
Yeah?

879
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,770
The Kool-Aid is
green and not red.

880
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,204
You owe me $5.00.

881
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,172
I'll pick it up later.

882
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,340
Oh.

883
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:36,475
Don't forget, an hour from now.

884
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,275
Basilica!

885
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,276
Be there!

886
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,816
I'll be here if you want
to come over in five years.

887
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:45,751
I'll...

888
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:46,852
Be there in an hour!

889
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:47,653
Oh, yeah!

890
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,855
I'll see you.

891
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:55,226
This is XD253, a truth
drug engineered right

892
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,496
Here in the United States.

893
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,098
Used successfully numerous
times on intelligence gathering

894
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,333
Missions such as this.

895
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,170
You guys can use about as much
intelligence as you can gather.

896
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,073
It would be wise to keep
your mouth shut while you can,

897
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,609
For as soon as the XD253
reaches your brain,

898
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,410
You're going to be doing
a lot of talking that

899
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,680
You'll wish that you weren't.

900
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,382
Oh, baby, I get her
when you're finished.

901
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,150
Uh, yeah.

902
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,820
You look like you could make me
sing without any fancy needles

903
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,354
Or formulas.

904
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,925
How about you and I abscond to
the next room for a little tete

905
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:27,726
A tete?

906
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:28,794
What's abscond mean?

907
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,462
She's trying to trick you.

908
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,396
Forget it!

909
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:32,698
I'm gonna do it to her now!

910
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,365
What are you...

911
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,367
Relax.

912
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,302
Idiot!

913
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,605
This is a complete
waste of time.

914
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,306
Maybe for you it is.

915
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,626
Can I at least ask
you some questions?

916
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:01,927
It's your thing!

917
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,862
Go ahead.

918
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,799
Where is your partner?

919
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,002
Here I come, baby.

920
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,505
Now I'll try again.

921
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,907
Where is Cat Powers?

922
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:16,708
Ow!

923
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,143
I don't know!

924
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:19,745
I thought Cardinal X...

925
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,212
Cardinal X?

926
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,447
Cardinal X what?

927
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:23,314
Took her.

928
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,084
Oh my god.

929
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,854
So wait, you do or you
don't know where she is?

930
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,922
Is that yes to the first
and no to the second, or...

931
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,457
Could you stop talking?

932
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,492
I'm trying to pay attention.

933
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:38,564
What is the
Cardinal's itinerary?

934
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,700
I don't know that either!

935
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,735
I haven't read it yet.

936
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,939
By the merciful son of God,
don't you know anything?

937
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,711
I don't think so!

938
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,681
[Groaning] Thank
you very much! Baby!

939
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,687
Thanks, sweetheart.

940
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,088
You're a real charmer.

941
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,430
Hey, uh, what can
I get you for lunch?

942
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,231
Corn dogs?

943
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,871
Finally, back on schedule!

944
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,462
I can't.

945
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,866
[Screaming]

946
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:21,226
[Laughing]

947
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:24,389
You know, I read
every manual on torture

948
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,223
In the Vatican library.

949
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,024
Really.

950
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:34,199
I just finished last
week, oh, what was it?

951
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,134
Um, Malleus Maleficarum.

952
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,203
Oh, what a book.

953
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:41,739
Words to live by!

954
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,541
Now, an opportunity
to use that knowledge.

955
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,777
What luck!

956
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:49,447
You, my dear, are a door.

957
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:53,584
Your body, your
mouth, your lips,

958
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:58,423
All are a doorway to the
knowledge that lies within.

959
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:03,862
Now I just need
to find that key.

960
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:07,665
What is your key?

961
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,802
What do I need to twist to get
you to give up your secrets?

962
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,108
No fair.

963
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,259
Oh, yes!

964
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,227
Oh, come to papa!

965
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:43,634
Bet she's got some
some hot panties on!

966
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,403
Oh, she's the one.

967
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,873
Oh yeah!

968
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,374
No, that one!

969
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,308
That's the one!

970
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,109
Oh, yeah.

971
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,941
Fucking lone nuts.

972
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,014
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

973
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:34,986
Oh my god!

974
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,462
[Groan]

975
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,380
[Groaning]

976
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,706
All right, Beazley, or
whoever the hell you are!

977
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,375
I did my job!

978
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,443
Now give me back my soul!

979
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:33,911
Give it back!

980
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,491
Mr. Johnson, do you have any
connections with the Vatican?

981
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,392
The Vatican?

982
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:48,759
I'm not even Catholic.

983
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,228
Uh, how about a militia group?

984
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,963
Do you belong to
a militia group?

985
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:53,264
No, I'm a security guard.

986
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,300
I work for Stone Security.

987
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,502
Any idea what... what
groups may be involved

988
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,070
In this particular conspiracy?

989
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,039
No, I have no idea at this
time what other groups may

990
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:03,674
Be involved in this conspiracy.

991
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,444
Is it true that you have not
found a murder weapon yet?

992
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:09,780
Yes, it is true we have not
found a murder weapon yet.

993
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,516
Do you have any other
targets besides the Cardinal?

994
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:12,750
No, you're not listening!

995
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,119
I didn't shoot anyone!

996
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:15,286
I didn't shoot the Cardinal.
Why would I have other targets?

997
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:16,087
I'm a patsy.

998
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,222
I need a lawyer.

999
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,530
[Shouting]

1000
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,504
[Screaming]

1001
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,176
Security cameras and
witnesses at the scene

1002
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:41,746
Corroborate the presence of
this man, suspected to be

1003
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:46,151
Joey Ramone, rock musician and
member of the band Ramones.

1004
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:50,288
If you have any clues as to
the whereabouts of Joey Ramone,

1005
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,290
Please call the
number on your screen.

1006
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,230
Then, out of the
corner of my eye,

1007
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,766
I spot the rifle
barrel coming into view

1008
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:02,900
On top of the Warren building!

1009
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,169
Boom!

1010
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,605
Bravely into the hail of
bullets I went, charging ahead,

1011
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,974
My camera rattling
off shot after shot.

1012
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:12,877
And before I know it, I got
the photographs of the decade!

1013
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,145
I tell you, Ponti's not dead.

1014
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,881
He's gonna pull a
Christ in three days.

1015
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:19,950
According to this diagram
I had the boys at the lab

1016
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,886
Draw up for me, there
were two gunmen.

1017
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,355
As an overwhelming
number of witnesses say,

1018
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,125
There were two shots
fired, one from on top

1019
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,294
Of the Warren building,
the other across

1020
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,096
At the gas and power office.

1021
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,398
The paths of the bullets
fired, along with the street

1022
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,866
In front of the
Basilica, form a pyramid.

1023
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,635
Which is the symbol
used by the Freemasons!

1024
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,770
Which means CIA.

1025
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,906
What about his palm
print on the rifle?

1026
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,274
Ah, forget about it.

1027
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,676
The paraffin tests on James
Johnson's hands were positive.

1028
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,844
Positive for what?

1029
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:48,446
He fired a rifle today.

1030
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,314
Guilty.

1031
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,348
Johnson didn't do it!
Patsy!

1032
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:51,216
Guilty!

1033
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:52,450
Patsy!

1034
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,451
Guilty!

1035
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,552
Patsy, patsy,
conspiracy, conspiracy!

1036
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,254
Well, if he didn't
do it, then who did?

1037
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,989
[Groaning]

1038
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,458
Dare, where the
hell have you been?

1039
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,260
I thought that was
your goddamn story!

1040
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,594
I mean, what the Christ?

1041
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,062
Oh, it's my story, all right.

1042
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:06,664
But I could do one better.

1043
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,934
Disillusioned Catholic kid,
spirited to Satan's court,

1044
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:13,037
Forced to commit acts of
murder in order to save soul.

1045
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,206
Kills member of the
Roman Catholic Church.

1046
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:18,476
Dare, I said no more
bullshit fantasy stories.

1047
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,345
Kuric Camp here managed
to get the major league

1048
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:21,479
Snaps today at the Plaza.

1049
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,115
He's not feeding me a
line of crap like you.

1050
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,283
Oh, but then it gets better.

1051
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:26,784
Devil goes back on his word.

1052
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,253
Kid becomes demonized.

1053
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:30,721
Kid kills his boss!

1054
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:31,789
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1055
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:32,790
What are you doing?

1056
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,561
Wait, wait, hold it, hold it!

1057
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:40,064
[Screaming]

1058
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:46,537
[Thunder]

1059
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,038
[Screaming]

1060
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,241
If I can't kill him, I'll
settle for all of your panties.

1061
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,177
[Laughing]

1062
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:55,580
[Screaming]

1063
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,957
I think Dario killed
the Cardinal, Mr. Cannon.

1064
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,993
No fucking shit!

1065
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,262
I think he was working
for the... the builder

1066
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,464
Burgers or Rosicrucians.

1067
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,434
J. Jonah Jesus on a... on
a dangling rubber crutch!

1068
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:17,702
Did anybody get that?

1069
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,805
Get the printer on the line
and hold the front page!

1070
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,072
We're going exclusive on this!

1071
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,343
[Laughing]

1072
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:51,902
Rock!

1073
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,704
I thought I might
find you here.

1074
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:54,505
Why?

1075
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,245
Star reporter?

1076
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:02,347
Shit, I gotta ask
for more money.

1077
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:03,914
Kid, I know you
better than anyone,

1078
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,718
And I know you may be a
misogynistic caveman, a

1079
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,987
Stupid pervert, and a knothead.

1080
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,055
But you're not evil.

1081
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,590
What the hell's going
on with you, man?

1082
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,791
I lost my soul, Rock and Roll.

1083
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:14,825
It's gone.

1084
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,394
It's rotting in Hell
for all eternity.

1085
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:17,662
OK, maybe.

1086
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,730
But you're a man with friends,
and a man with friends

1087
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,031
Can work his way
through any situation.

1088
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,033
Well, eventually.

1089
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,435
I want to be good again, Rock!

1090
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,103
I want to be the good guy!

1091
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,839
I want to go into that
ring, guaranteed victory!

1092
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,041
No more this
designated loser crap.

1093
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:31,976
You can do it.

1094
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:33,378
Impossible.

1095
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:35,746
It'll take some kind of miracle
for me to get my soul back now.

1096
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:36,914
Oh, you got the magic, kid.

1097
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,048
It's inside you.

1098
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:38,849
It's inside us.

1099
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,117
It's family.

1100
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,452
What are you talking about?

1101
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,487
You got a big question, right?

1102
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:43,988
A big Q?

1103
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:45,155
Yeah.

1104
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:46,957
What's every Q have?

1105
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,758
An answer.

1106
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:48,726
An A, man.

1107
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:49,527
A Man!

1108
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:50,461
My brother Anthony!

1109
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,329
Of course!

1110
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,897
You're coming with me, right?

1111
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,164
Nope.

1112
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,766
Then what's with all this
friends can help you shit?

1113
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,568
[Laughing] Screw that!

1114
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,704
I got better things to do
than be killed with you, you

1115
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:00,505
Little butt.

1116
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,006
At least give me a ride.

1117
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,007
Forget it.

1118
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:13,284
Start again.
Rethink it.

1119
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:14,151
Yes, yes, more of that!

1120
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:14,952
Excellent!

1121
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:17,388
Excellent!

1122
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,356
Oh, yeah!

1123
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:20,858
Big company.

1124
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,328
Oh, more of that.

1125
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:24,329
Yes!

1126
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:25,296
Yeah, that's it.

1127
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,269
Yes.

1128
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,070
Let it go.

1129
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,238
That's it.

1130
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:36,907
Get the hair back,
get the hair back.

1131
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:37,708
Excellent.

1132
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,209
I like it!

1133
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,678
Yeah!

1134
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,680
Make it pop.

1135
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,149
Looks like crap.

1136
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:48,118
Edge, who is this victim?

1137
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,055
Will someone please
shoot him with a gun?

1138
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,089
Oh, no killing, no killing!

1139
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,491
He is mine.

1140
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:54,425
He is my blood.

1141
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:56,060
He comes in here
again, he's going

1142
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,462
To be blood all over the floor.
All right.

1143
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,163
Ava Maria.
Take five.

1144
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:01,899
Take five.

1145
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,969
Dario, oh cheeky one,
how many times have I told

1146
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,372
You never to interrupt my work?

1147
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:08,172
Never.

1148
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:12,009
You never said that, ever.

1149
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,745
I need your help, Tony.

1150
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:17,081
Please address me
as A Man, Dario,

1151
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,984
Especially in the
presence of my entourage.

1152
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:21,051
Entourage?

1153
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,620
Aren't these the people
that used to work

1154
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,589
With you at the Dairy Queen?

1155
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:25,623
I should say not!

1156
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,658
These are some of
the high fashion

1157
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,761
Models lucky enough to be
photographed at my site today.

1158
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,163
Aren't they super?

1159
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:36,934
[Growling] Anyone willing to
part with their panties today?

1160
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,836
My doctor recommends it!

1161
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:48,245
Say, I have a problem.

1162
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,647
You can say that again.

1163
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:52,149
By the way, did you say
my name with a capital A,

1164
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:53,984
Or with a small A?

1165
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,186
Will you knock it
off with that A shit?

1166
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,390
Oh, what a drag
you are, my brother.

1167
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,158
Hey, do you still
have that book?

1168
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,228
That one by John D. That
was found in Austria?

1169
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,396
This one?

1170
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,597
You bet, baby.

1171
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,966
Great bedside reading when
I'm entertaining members

1172
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,901
Of the local witches coven!

1173
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,937
I need to go to Hell.

1174
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,073
You're here, man, you're here!

1175
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:17,274
No, I'm serious.

1176
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,409
I was just there.

1177
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,478
Now I need to go back
and settle some business

1178
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:23,748
With Bob Beazley, a very
powerful and influential demon.

1179
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,551
Now, if you don't mind, we need
to do this pretty damn quick,

1180
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:29,153
Because I'm turning into
Eddie fucking Munster.

1181
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,387
Zounds!

1182
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,189
What an accessory!

1183
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,223
It's beautiful.

1184
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,527
Why would you want
to... can I touch it?

1185
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:38,696
Maybe we can use
you in the spread.

1186
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,097
Just give me the
damn spellbook!

1187
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,065
No.

1188
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,233
Teddy, can we use
the studio tonight

1189
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,835
To perform a
mystical incantation

1190
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:47,605
Designed to send my brother
to the very pits of Hell?

1191
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:48,706
No.

1192
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:51,308
We will perform the
most magical ceremonies

1193
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,610
This very eve!

1194
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,012
Get your things, my
mystical confidants.

1195
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,046
We begin at once!

1196
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,848
[Cheering]

1197
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,663
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1198
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,200
It's been zero zero five niner
since my last confession.

1199
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,068
Agent Tango?

1200
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,671
I know who killed
Cardinal Ponti.

1201
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,039
I was there when it happened.

1202
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:24,408
And it wasn't that
guy on television,

1203
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:26,711
And it wasn't the dark haired
agent on the roof of the gas

1204
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:27,612
And power building, either.

1205
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,179
It was Dario Dare.

1206
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:29,980
Dario?

1207
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,848
Dare.

1208
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,117
He's a tabloid journalist.

1209
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:34,351
He's a weaselly little man.

1210
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,053
Hardly significant.

1211
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:39,724
And certainly not an
agent or a hired gun.

1212
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,391
I'm sure he did it.

1213
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,461
The only thing I can't
be sure of is why.

1214
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,264
I think it has something
to do with the attempt

1215
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:49,166
On Ponti's life last
month at Castrovillari.

1216
00:57:49,266 --> 00:57:51,536
At which you were also present.

1217
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,738
Well, I didn't include
this in my official report,

1218
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,274
But they were robed
soldiers there.

1219
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,709
Men.

1220
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,044
Dead men.

1221
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:02,146
Raised by some unholy power.

1222
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,848
And Dare had congress
with them the night

1223
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:04,949
Before the
assassination, when he

1224
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,383
Met the man with the hard hat.

1225
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,718
The man in the hard hat?

1226
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,486
Oh, I know this all
sounds ridiculous,

1227
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:11,556
But Dare is the shooter
at Basilica Plaza!

1228
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:12,990
I know that!

1229
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,391
Now I just need to
determine if he's

1230
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,529
Involved with the anti-Ponti
constituent at Vatican City.

1231
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,831
I think you should
come with me, Marion.

1232
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:23,568
Cardinal X will be very
interested in your findings.

1233
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,636
What do you mean?

1234
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:29,607
We see it somewhat
differently, Agent Tango.

1235
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:31,576
First, the incident
at Castrovillari

1236
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:35,445
When you failed to
protect Cardinal Ponti,

1237
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:37,648
Stands as a noticeable
but forgivable

1238
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:40,851
Blemish on your record.

1239
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:44,088
Then, I'm disturbed by the
unexplained disappearance

1240
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:49,059
Of Agent Catalina Powers
from your remote station.

1241
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,028
Are you suggesting that I
had something to do with it?

1242
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:53,363
Then, when he was
under your protection,

1243
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,801
The absolutely inexcusable
public execution

1244
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,938
Of a member of the Holy
Roman Catholic Church.

1245
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,108
I have no option but to take
you in for further questioning.

1246
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:08,212
Please, no flash
photography during the event.

1247
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,047
OK, so how's this work?

1248
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:14,652
First, we sit on
the ancient stone.

1249
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,754
It's styrofoam.

1250
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:17,788
Ancient stone!

1251
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,824
Pretend!

1252
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:23,027
Before we send you to the
darkness of the great pit,

1253
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:25,095
We need to bring you
a little sunshine!

1254
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,066
Hey!

1255
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,534
How now, my brother?

1256
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:32,870
The demon in you is strong.

1257
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:38,275
To kill you will take
extreme measures.

1258
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,645
Thank you, Kristen.

1259
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,546
Get that shit away from me!

1260
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:43,347
Blasphemer!

1261
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:44,815
Body of Christ!

1262
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:48,252
[Growling]

1263
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:00,530
Blood of Christ.

1264
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:04,034
[Gagging]

1265
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:15,980
It has begun.

1266
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:33,397
Hey!

1267
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:36,533
Tony, get these
chains off of me!

1268
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,968
Goomba, he lives!

1269
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,370
[Applause]

1270
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,438
No thanks to you.

1271
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:42,539
Oh, please.

1272
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,010
I rock the material and
the spiritual world.

1273
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,946
Sorry about the anguish, but
it's only part of the process.

1274
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:52,482
Do you want to go to
the burning hell or not?

1275
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,718
But first, you must
dress the part.

1276
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:54,518
Come!

1277
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,390
Much improved.

1278
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,658
My brother dresses me funny.

1279
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:04,661
Can you believe this?

1280
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:07,164
And also, a gift, to
help you on your way.

1281
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:11,869
Oh, candy!

1282
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,371
[Non-english speech]

1283
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,846
I didn't know he was
multidenominational.

1284
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,915
I call upon the powers
of good and evil!

1285
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,552
Hear me, powers, and know that
this priest means business!

1286
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:36,994
[Non-english speech]

1287
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:38,295
Hey, man.

1288
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,865
You're doing it wrong.

1289
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,867
What?

1290
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:44,068
The chant.

1291
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:44,935
It's [non-english speech].

1292
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,906
Dionysus!

1293
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:51,842
Oh, great god of
all that is super!

1294
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:55,746
How's it going?

1295
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,247
Dionysus?

1296
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:58,582
Oh, please, Dario.

1297
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:01,218
Everyone knows
he's my patron god.

1298
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,987
My apologies, oh partying one.

1299
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:07,124
My lame-o brother knoweth
not what he speaketh.

1300
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,760
Your guidance is always welcome.

1301
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,095
Thank you, A Man.

1302
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,898
But you know, my assistance
is not without its cost.

1303
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:15,265
Not you.

1304
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:16,767
Not you.

1305
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,603
Oh, you, beauties, come to me.

1306
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:22,940
[Laughter]

1307
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,345
Ciao, mi amores.

1308
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:29,313
Godspeed, Dario.

1309
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,114
Dickhead.

1310
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,422
Bing, bang, boom.

1311
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,858
Deus ex machina special effect.

1312
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:45,162
OK, Dario has gone into Hell.

1313
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,363
Wait.

1314
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,198
Can't send mortals into
hell without special help.

1315
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,434
I'll lend him my ivory chariot.

1316
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:51,936
Nope, not insured for mortals.

1317
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:52,736
Uh.

1318
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:53,804
Oh!

1319
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:57,641
I'll give him some
able-bodied help.

1320
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,977
Miss Marion Tango.

1321
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:01,078
Mm-hmm.

1322
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:01,879
Yeah.

1323
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,686
Hey, you're that
maid at Polo's motel!

1324
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,021
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1325
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:14,058
Why did you kill
Cardinal Ponti?

1326
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,559
Cardinal Ponti
was my benefactor,

1327
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,194
And it's my job to protect him!

1328
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,129
And it's my job to see
that the man who shot him

1329
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,497
Is brought to justice.

1330
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:22,766
Is that before or after you
get done cleaning motel rooms?

1331
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:23,934
I'm not a maid!

1332
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:27,004
Good, because
those rooms sucked!

1333
01:03:27,104 --> 01:03:28,338
Are you trying to deny it?

1334
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,574
Listen, lady, I was
just doing my job.

1335
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:32,242
And I'm doing my job.

1336
01:03:32,342 --> 01:03:33,844
So I'm going to
bring you to justice.

1337
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:36,546
Now put your hands up on your
head and come along quietly.

1338
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,481
Come quietly where?

1339
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:38,849
This is Hell!

1340
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:42,186
And since when do motel maids
go around enforcing the law?

1341
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:42,987
Uh-uh!

1342
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:44,821
I am not a maid!

1343
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:48,458
I am an agent of Vatican City.

1344
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,559
Vatican?

1345
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,063
You mean pope, tall
hat, and stick Vatican?

1346
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,965
So what?

1347
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:56,533
Don't you have any
remorse for what you did?

1348
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:57,902
I'm in Hell, aren't I?

1349
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:58,936
That should tell you something.

1350
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:20,757
So this is Hell.

1351
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,296
Could be worse.

1352
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,101
I guess I expected
something more dramatic.

1353
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,003
More fire or something.

1354
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:39,509
Is it all like this?

1355
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,310
No.

1356
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,412
There's a palace up ahead.

1357
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:43,680
How did we get
down here, anyway?

1358
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,951
My a-hole brother
did a spell on me.

1359
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,753
Why did you let your
brother send you to Hell?

1360
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:51,088
Look, some guy stole my soul.

1361
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:52,056
He's holding it ransom.

1362
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:53,523
Only I paid that
ransom, and that

1363
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,026
Was killing Cardinal Ponti.

1364
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:57,861
And he still won't
give it back, OK?

1365
01:04:57,962 --> 01:04:59,964
Get up to speed on this.

1366
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,699
I'm only here to
get my soul back.

1367
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,334
Got it?

1368
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,602
So am I dead?

1369
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:06,470
Oh, Christ.

1370
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,271
No more questions!

1371
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,480
Boss, boss, white alert.

1372
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,717
Two humans spotted
in the Elysian Plain.

1373
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:21,986
What?

1374
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:23,853
MAN (ON INTERCOM): Human
beings approaching the palace.

1375
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,322
Patch it in.

1376
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:31,795
Blood red, Dario Dare,
how did he get here?

1377
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,637
[Screaming]

1378
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:51,681
There he is.

1379
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,117
Cat?

1380
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:55,452
You're alive!

1381
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,021
Well, sort of.

1382
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,256
You are alive, aren't you?

1383
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:00,224
Alive, dead.

1384
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:03,527
We're in Hell.

1385
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,761
Well, come along with us.

1386
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,363
We're getting out of this place.
Dare knows the way.

1387
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
Hey.
How are you doing?

1388
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,032
I can't.

1389
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,066
My people need me.

1390
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,801
I found my true calling.

1391
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,437
I don't understand.

1392
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:14,504
I'm saving souls.

1393
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,606
That's what I joined
the Vatican for.

1394
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,343
That's what it used to mean
before people like Cardinal X

1395
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:21,778
Turned it into an
assassin's cult.

1396
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,814
So you knew about the
plot to kill Ponti.

1397
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,216
I suspected.

1398
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,187
No, the world of the
living isn't is for me.

1399
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:33,257
My underground railroad is
doing far more good here than I

1400
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:36,193
Could have ever done topside.

1401
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:38,328
Good luck, Marion Tango.

1402
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,997
And I hope someday you find
what you're looking for, too.

1403
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,004
Hey, wait a minute!

1404
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,339
How do you rate?

1405
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:51,975
I had to kill a cardinal to
get out of Beazley's palace!

1406
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,543
What did you do?

1407
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,312
I killed a few guards.

1408
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:57,081
Damn, I should have
thought of that!

1409
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:57,614
My candies!
Hey!

1410
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,218
Hey!

1411
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:02,219
Let's go!

1412
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,019
Hey!

1413
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,126
Yes.

1414
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:14,831
Look, dearie, I've
been here before.

1415
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:17,901
I know the way out of here.

1416
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:18,702
Stick with me.

1417
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:20,003
I'll protect you.

1418
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:22,639
Thanks, but no thanks.

1419
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,375
What makes you think I
can trust you, anyway?

1420
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:29,646
Does this look like
the face of a liar?

1421
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,115
Whoa!

1422
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,083
My everything!

1423
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,318
An idiot, maybe.

1424
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:40,090
Did you watch, uh,
Lawrence Welk last night?

1425
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,625
Are you kidding?

1426
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:47,564
It's the closest thing to music
we've got down here. [Humming]

1427
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:59,176
Ugh, can't you smell that?

1428
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,544
Choose not to.

1429
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,746
Besides, it's going to get a
lot worse than that upstairs.

1430
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:10,587
Lord Kuric, an intruder
has entered the palace.

1431
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:13,723
You must find and dispatch
him with violent haste.

1432
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:27,637
Come on!

1433
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:36,012
Hey, you don't belong in here.

1434
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,447
This is a restricted area.

1435
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:39,483
Commander, I'm relieving
you of your duties.

1436
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,651
Who are you?

1437
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,819
Dario Dare, motherfucker!

1438
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:43,620
Bam!

1439
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:51,295
You.

1440
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:52,128
Hey.

1441
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,963
You're Dario Dare.

1442
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,765
I was just telling the
guys down in torture

1443
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,168
That if anybody would end up
down here, it'd be Dario Dare.

1444
01:08:58,268 --> 01:09:00,103
Can I get your autograph?

1445
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,509
Wow.

1446
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:06,610
Thanks.

1447
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,979
So, uh, Gus, how's this
setup of yours work?

1448
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,516
Well, you've got the
map here, and then you've

1449
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,384
Got the switch up here where
you lock on your coordinates

1450
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,519
And hit your target.

1451
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:20,524
Then you hit this
button, and major damage!

1452
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,359
[Phone ringing]

1453
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,160
Yes?

1454
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,431
Sir, Dare is in the
missile command center.

1455
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,032
[Growling]

1456
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,469
Lord Kuric, Dare is in the
missile command center!

1457
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,803
Get him at all costs!

1458
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,171
Stop at nothing!

1459
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:46,916
Targets locked on.

1460
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,386
Gambada's [inaudible].

1461
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:50,587
Gambada?

1462
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:51,521
Lock and load.

1463
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:52,689
Launch 'em, baby.

1464
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:07,904
Missiles away.

1465
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,841
What?

1466
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,843
These disguises
aren't going to help.

1467
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,545
If this Gambada has
missiles and counterattacks,

1468
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,681
This place is gonna be hopping.

1469
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:20,484
They're not going to
worry about little old us.

1470
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:21,918
Yeah, and I can
get my soul back.

1471
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:23,453
With only minor setbacks!

1472
01:10:33,297 --> 01:10:34,564
Who's this?

1473
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,533
A minor setback.

1474
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:40,404
You have been a
very naughty boy.

1475
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:45,208
My lord Beezley has sent me,
and Kuric, his errand boy,

1476
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:50,146
To wreak exquisite pain upon
your naughty little behinds.

1477
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,048
Which one do you want?

1478
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,283
I'll take the French guy.

1479
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,251
You get the quarterback.

1480
01:10:55,352 --> 01:11:00,624
Sorry, my sweet, but I
called dibs on Dario, dear.

1481
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:01,425
Bleh!

1482
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:29,353
Un.

1483
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:35,325
Deux.

1484
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:46,336
[Laughing]

1485
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:47,804
Trois!

1486
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:51,307
[Screaming]

1487
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,283
So, you are ready to play, huh?

1488
01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:07,724
Don't worry, I won't break
anything important yet.

1489
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,040
I'm a very big fan
of yours, Mr. Dare.

1490
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,410
This is a very big honor for me.

1491
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,878
I've seen everything that
you do on the wrestling.

1492
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:29,679
Very violent.

1493
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,180
I like it a lot.

1494
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,316
But you know, I've
always wondered,

1495
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:36,620
You do that thing with that
girl in Michigan, that blonde?

1496
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,822
How did you learn that?

1497
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,490
I've never even
seen that before.

1498
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,358
Very incredible.

1499
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:44,260
Do you mind if I use that?

1500
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,731
Oh, sacre bleu, you
stepped on my foot!

1501
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,669
[Screaming]

1502
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:56,139
Merde!

1503
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:02,612
[Screaming]

1504
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:31,374
[Explosion]

1505
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,813
[Shouting]

1506
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:43,653
Thank you.

1507
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,454
Right.

1508
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:45,922
No, I mean it.

1509
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:46,990
OK, sure.

1510
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:49,559
Idiot demon boy saves
ex-centerfold nun.

1511
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:50,359
Now, everything's fine.

1512
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,260
I'm not a nun.

1513
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,061
No?

1514
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,231
Does that mean you're...

1515
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,032
What?

1516
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:57,066
Celibate?
No.

1517
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:57,867
Are you?

1518
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:58,668
Hell no.

1519
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,004
I gave that up for Lent.

1520
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,839
Are... you wanna...

1521
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:08,812
You're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that.

1522
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:09,879
Oh, I will.

1523
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:53,056
[Shouting]

1524
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,724
Polo?

1525
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:55,525
Mr. Dare!

1526
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,627
Marion!

1527
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,696
Sorry about trying to kill you.

1528
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,164
What are you doing here?

1529
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:02,231
I'm here to save my soul.

1530
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,634
Well, it's a strange
place for that, lad.

1531
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,035
This is Hell.

1532
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,437
Are you dead too, then?

1533
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,339
I don't... I'm not dead!

1534
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,307
Neither are you!

1535
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:12,576
You got sucked down
here when I did!

1536
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:13,810
Sucked down into Hell?

1537
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,546
I don't remember that.

1538
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:20,049
All I remember is fighting,
fighting, fighting!

1539
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,251
I've taken over
this whole level!

1540
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,319
It's mine now!

1541
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:24,621
I reign supreme!

1542
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:27,957
Polo McCrimmon's level in Hell!

1543
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:30,326
How do you like it?

1544
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:31,427
It's terrific.

1545
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,063
It's a... it's a real
fixer upper opportunity.

1546
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:35,364
But do you know
where the souls are

1547
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,100
So that we can get out of here?

1548
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:37,901
Souls?

1549
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:39,535
Ah, I think so.

1550
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:42,772
But, uh... oh, I don't remember.

1551
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:46,776
But I'll help you find them,
or I'm not Polo McCrimmon

1552
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:47,977
Of the Clan McCrimmon!

1553
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:48,778
Yeah!

1554
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,180
Yeah!

1555
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,584
Welcome to the romper room.

1556
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:55,551
Kuric?

1557
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,621
Where can he be?

1558
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:00,056
Kuric, do you read me?

1559
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,191
Sir, more bad news.

1560
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,227
It's Mistress Gambada for you.

1561
01:16:04,327 --> 01:16:06,195
Oh, what does she want?

1562
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:11,701
Ah, oh my dear, dear Gambada.

1563
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:14,503
You look positively
radiant today.

1564
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:16,640
Ooh.

1565
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,274
I like what you've
done with the place.

1566
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:21,711
Shut your shithole and
listen good, Beezley Bubba.

1567
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:22,646
I'm not radiant.

1568
01:16:22,746 --> 01:16:24,080
I'm radiated!

1569
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,248
And can you guess why?

1570
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:28,384
Perhaps it was that volley
of missiles your boys just

1571
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:29,585
Shot at my palace.

1572
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:30,987
Hmm?

1573
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,457
Well, let me tell you this, you
stupid sack of maggot sputum.

1574
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:37,927
In 16 minutes, you're going
to be crying for mommy,

1575
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,562
Because I'm going to
pump enough labidium

1576
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:42,999
Warheads up your tiny lying
ass to fill the Durham Canyon.

1577
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,300
How do you like me now?

1578
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:07,924
That's Cardinal Ponti!

1579
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,829
Why are they doing this to him?

1580
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,630
He's been conditioned.

1581
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:16,565
Converted into one of
Beezley's supreme guard,

1582
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,702
There's a ton of warriors.

1583
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:22,038
Those are the same warriors
that Mr. Dare and I saw

1584
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,808
In that bright green field
on that fine summer day,

1585
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:25,608
Long, long ago.

1586
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:26,409
You remember.

1587
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:27,576
Isn't that sweet?

1588
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:28,812
You remember that.

1589
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:31,480
Why can't you remember
where the fucking souls are?

1590
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,817
Shh!

1591
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:39,522
Why would he... he, a man
of God... end up here?

1592
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:41,891
You know those little
miracles Ponti did?

1593
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,360
He made a deal with Beelzebub.

1594
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,096
Didn't keep his
end of the bargain.

1595
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:49,365
I can't believe he sold out.

1596
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:50,366
Buck up, little trooper.

1597
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,369
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

1598
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,171
Always be brave and true?

1599
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:58,341
Always side with
the powers of good?

1600
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:02,478
Always read the fine print.

1601
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:03,379
Wanna bring your earplugs.

1602
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,789
[Shouting]

1603
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:23,900
BOB (ON INTERCOM): Ahem.

1604
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,403
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your leader speaking.

1605
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:29,739
In just under six minutes,
this palace will be

1606
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:32,041
Vaporized by incoming missiles.

1607
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,743
That is the good news.

1608
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:36,212
The bad news is that
since this is Hell,

1609
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:39,148
We will all survive and spend
the next several centuries

1610
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:42,485
Healing and then rebuilding
the palace from scratch.

1611
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:43,652
Lock and load?

1612
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:44,888
Missiles away?

1613
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:46,622
Sounded like a good idea!

1614
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,824
Quit bitching!

1615
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:49,192
Start running!

1616
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,626
BOB (ON INTERCOM): By the way,
if the renegade mortals wish

1617
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,896
To know, this excludes them.

1618
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:55,298
They will evaporate for
all eternity, wiped clean

1619
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,233
From all metaphysical slates.

1620
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:00,870
No afterlife, no
reincarnation, no nothing.

1621
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,038
So screw you, Dare.

1622
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:03,139
I win anyway.

1623
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,340
Oh, Mr. Dare.

1624
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,642
When I killed the Satono,
captain on the level...

1625
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,178
On Polo McCrimmon's
level of Hell...

1626
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:12,882
I overheard something
about the chamber of souls!

1627
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,317
Which is?

1628
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,318
A chamber!

1629
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,285
Yes?

1630
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,287
Where the souls are kept!

1631
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:19,688
I know that, you moron!

1632
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:20,489
Where is it?

1633
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,892
Um, level 92!

1634
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:26,329
[Laughter]

1635
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:32,168
[Explosions]

1636
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:38,174
Not a chance in Hell, Dare.

1637
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,243
In four minutes, you
and your earthly friends

1638
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:43,412
Will be scattered to the
winds of Hell. [Inaudible]

1639
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,447
For all eternity.

1640
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:45,849
While despite your
great efforts,

1641
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:48,651
Things will go as they always
have here, with me in charge,

1642
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,920
And fools like you
cowering at my feet.

1643
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,089
Only four minutes?

1644
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:54,657
Oh, three minutes, 40 seconds.

1645
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:57,026
That doesn't leave much
time for me to kick your ass.

1646
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:57,827
You!

1647
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:00,063
You tricked my boss!

1648
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:01,865
And stole my soul!

1649
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,332
And have a really
sloppy palace!

1650
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,868
I'll have to
redecorate extensively

1651
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:08,537
When I take it over!

1652
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,506
Your enthusiasm is priceless.

1653
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:11,841
It really is.

1654
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:13,943
Pointless, but touching.

1655
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:20,850
For those about to
rock, we salute you.

1656
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:24,287
[Gunshots]

1657
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,094
Come on.

1658
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:33,262
Come to me, you
little mortal prick.

1659
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:36,765
[Screaming]

1660
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:44,773
[Groaning]

1661
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,283
[Shouting]

1662
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:07,763
Oh!

1663
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:30,753
[Scream]

1664
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:35,258
[Shouting]

1665
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:41,264
[Screaming]

1666
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:51,774
[Screaming]

1667
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:59,282
[Shouting]

1668
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:01,284
Do you have anything
left, lassie?

1669
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,754
Just holy water.

1670
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:06,755
Throw it!

1671
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,261
[Screaming]

1672
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:42,758
Dare, come on!

1673
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:45,761
That can't be right.

1674
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:49,265
[Explosion]

1675
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,267
Oh, no!

1676
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,268
God, who cares?

1677
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:54,270
Put that back.

1678
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,272
Oh, that can't be good.

1679
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:58,474
Oh, they're all messed up!

1680
01:22:58,574 --> 01:22:59,275
No.

1681
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,477
It's going in.

1682
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:02,278
Quiet.

1683
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:03,279
This'll work.

1684
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:05,981
I know it will.

1685
01:23:06,082 --> 01:23:06,782
Ew.

1686
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:10,753
Bleh!

1687
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,767
Brother, run!

1688
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,269
[Laughing]

1689
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,504
Agent Tango.

1690
01:24:01,604 --> 01:24:04,140
I should've known that you'd
be associating yourself

1691
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,609
With these devil worshippers.

1692
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,377
Who are you?

1693
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:11,480
Cardinal X, also known
as Father Ignatius Khan,

1694
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,782
And the Archbishop of Brooklyn.

1695
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,051
And the man who arranged
his own assassination

1696
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:18,354
Of Cardinal Ponti.
Very good.

1697
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:20,923
You always were a quick learner.

1698
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,992
But you see, Cardinal Ponti
was in league with Lucifer.

1699
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:28,297
Uh, Beelzebub, actually.

1700
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,333
He had to die
before he could rise

1701
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,601
To leadership of the Holy See.

1702
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:34,203
Thou shall not kill!

1703
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:39,375
Except, it is the way
that it has always been.

1704
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:41,710
Then I'll take my information
to the... to the press.

1705
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,612
You already have.

1706
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:46,549
And who are you?

1707
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,985
I'm the big bad wolf. [Howl]

1708
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:58,861
I will give you one more
chance to get back with us.

1709
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,466
No reprimands.

1710
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:05,434
Just resume your
duties, and we can

1711
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:09,938
All get on with our business.

1712
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,474
It's your business.

1713
01:25:11,574 --> 01:25:13,942
It's not my business anymore.

1714
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,211
Fine.

1715
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,214
Then I will file for the
order for your excommunication

1716
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:19,047
From this church.

1717
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:20,916
Ooh, now we're really scared!

1718
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:22,451
[Groan]

1719
01:25:23,519 --> 01:25:25,754
You don't have a
case, Miss Tango.

1720
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:35,398
Oh, Mr. Dare, what's it like
to be kicked in the groin

1721
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:37,300
By a holy man!

1722
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,535
Like this!

1723
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:40,303
Not much different.

1724
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:43,972
OK, everybody.

1725
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:45,073
We made it.

1726
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:46,475
Cake and ice cream for everyone!

1727
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,644
I'll get to the A car!

1728
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:49,445
Whoo!

1729
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,685
Well, we made it.

1730
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:57,953
Barely.

1731
01:25:58,053 --> 01:25:58,754
Aye.

1732
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:00,556
But I knew we would.

1733
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,090
Why?

1734
01:26:02,191 --> 01:26:04,327
Because we're the
good guys, lad!

1735
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:06,862
What about all that Polo
McCrimmon's level of Hell

1736
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:07,896
Stuff?

1737
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,633
A man can dream, can't he?

1738
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:12,368
Sorry about getting
you excommunicated.

1739
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:13,168
Yeah.

1740
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:15,504
What does that mean, anyway?

1741
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:19,208
Uh, well, I can't get
married in a Catholic church.

1742
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:20,008
That's OK.

1743
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,578
We can do it somewhere else.

1744
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,714
Well, it's over now.

1745
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:28,317
I wonder what
happened to Beezley.

1746
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:30,185
I dread the events
of the future,

1747
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:32,421
Not in themselves,
but in their results.

1748
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,123
I shudder at the thought of
any, even the most trivial

1749
01:26:35,224 --> 01:26:37,893
Incident, which may operate
upon this intolerable

1750
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,895
Agitation a soul.

1751
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:41,497
What?

1752
01:26:41,597 --> 01:26:42,865
Not but this, my
little rosebud.

1753
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:44,733
Not but this.

1754
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,403
Anticipating cruel pleasures
and sweet blasphemies

1755
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:50,205
To wreak upon our
naughty little behinds.

1756
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:52,541
Mr. Dare, are you all right?

1757
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:53,609
I... I don't know.

1758
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:57,513
I... I... I wish my
brother George was here.

1759
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:10,459
[Coughing]

1760
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:21,103
De Sade, Poe, Edgar, Liberace?

1761
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:24,573
[Laughter]

1762
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:30,746
[Rumbling]

1763
