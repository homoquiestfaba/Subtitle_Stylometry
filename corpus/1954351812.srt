1
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,226
# When the sky is dark, #

2
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,184
# and the moon aglow, #

3
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:27,451
# and the morning star
burning from afar #

4
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,241
# enters into view. #

5
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:34,259
# All that I can say, #

6
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:39,226
Ugh.
# all that I can know #

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,790
# is that I'll be dreaming #

8
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,614
# pieces of you. #

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,760
# When the clouds are gray, #

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,180
John, are you in there?

11
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:58,268
# and the angels low, #

12
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,455
Where is your little son lost, John?

13
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,338
# and a daffodil bends  #

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,058
John, unlock the door.

15
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:07,938
# against its will,
what am I to do? (What am I to do?) #

16
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:10,204
# All that I can say, #

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,640
Tamara!

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,231
# all that I can know, #

19
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,632
Tamara!

20
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:18,545
# is that I'll be dreaming #

21
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:20,935
Come on, baby, it won't happen again.

22
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,128
# pieces of you. #

23
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,396
#  Cast my reverie, back into the sea.  #

24
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,103
# Underneath my pillow, #

25
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:37,289
#where it's meant to be. #

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,719
#  When the wine is gone
(Oh, it's gone, yes, it's gone),  #

27
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,381
# and the carriage goes
(Oh, it goes, yes, it goes) #

28
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,551
Open this door!

29
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:49,824
# All the spirits turn. #
John, unlock the door.

30
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:54,859
# To the night, adjourn
bidding no adieu. (Bidding no adieu) #

31
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,604
Open this door. It's the police.

32
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:04,124
Tamara, I'm not gonna ask you again.

33
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,322
Open the fucking door!

34
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:08,938
John,

35
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,840
you're scaring me.

36
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,254
I'm gonna give you to the count of three.

37
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:15,981
One!

38
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,801
The place is surrounded. Open the door!
Two.

39
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:20,636
John!

40
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:22,314
Three.

41
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,761
# All my little troubles
haven't got a prayer#

42
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:47,886
# Heaven's all around you
when you haven't got a care. #

43
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:56,222
Confetti!

44
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:08,687
Daniel?

45
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,367
Where will your little son sleep, John?

46
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,103
Hello?

47
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:15,957
Hello?

48
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:34,578
What am I wearing?

49
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:40,206
Hello?

50
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:52,332
Hello?

51
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,755
Listen up, everyone, listen up.

52
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:56,063
There are three acts scheduled
for tonight's performance.

53
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:58,759
Featured performers will include:

54
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,766
Painted Doll,

55
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:20,477
The Twin,

56
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,384
Hobo Clown,

57
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:40,989
The Scorpion.

58
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,995
Has anyone seen The Scorpion?

59
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,434
A rebel in hell.
How original.

60
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,082
Doll,

61
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:59,243
would you please find and
cage that boy for me again?

62
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:04,134
Give him time to reflect
on punctuality.

63
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay, that's it, folks.
That's all for tonight.

64
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,056
Who's a guy gotta mystify to
get in on tonight's action?

65
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,086
Enough of that, you people.
Need I remind you of the rules?

66
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,295
The boss is personally getting involved

67
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,872
with tonight's play.

68
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:30,292
Shall I send word

69
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:34,984
that you'd like him to step down
so that you can take his place?

70
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:39,351
Uh, n-no, that's okay.

71
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,013
Okay everyone, places.

72
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,598
It's showtime!

73
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,635
We was robbed, mister bunny!

74
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,718
One, two, three, four!

75
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:01,102
What fool dare snub his rightful lord?

76
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:03,569
Five, six, seven, eight!

77
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,136
I'll slay the culprit on your plate!

78
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:33,292
Ow! You horrible little man!
Our guests have arrived, sire.

79
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:34,878
I know.

80
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,920
We're ready whenever you are.

81
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:15,346
Hello?

82
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,710
Hello?

83
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:36,657
Hello?

84
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:47,814
Daniel?

85
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,522
Where the hell am I?

86
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,793
# You're in The Devil's Carnival. #

87
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,397
# Come one, come two, come all!
Devil's Carnival! #

88
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,550
# You're in The Devil's Carnival. #

89
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,978
# Come one, come two, come all!
Devil's Carnival! #

90
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:14,807
# Ha-ha-ha! Welcome to my gates,
you gay and lucky souls! #

91
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,780
# Get your tickets!
Form a line! #

92
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,231
# You can't help but fall
for my humble hole. #

93
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:25,239
# Though those grapes look green
hangin' down from heaven's vine. #

94
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:30,481
Take only what you need? 
Well, I need it all!

95
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,010
# You're in The Devil's Carnival!
Come one, come two, come you! Devil's Carnival! #

96
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,513
I serve ordinary sinners
and extraordinary ones!

97
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,874
# Bring your brothers!
Bring your fools! #

98
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:48,387
# And daughters if you've got 'em,
they're a lot of fun. #

99
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,727
# Bring the whole damn family
cause my belly's never full. #

100
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,079
# You're in The Devil's Carnival! #

101
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,374
# Come one, come two, come all!
Devil's Carnival! #

102
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,387
# You're in The Devil's Carnival! #

103
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:05,098
# Come one, come two, come all!
Devil's Carnival! #

104
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:09,115
# Run, little blind mice,
scurry down the trail. #

105
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,511
# Chop! Goes the farmer's knife,
coming for your tails! #

106
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,432
# I've bedtime tales and fables
for your greedy hearts! #

107
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,265
# Some have razors! #

108
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,005
# Some have keys! #

109
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:22,341
# How they end depend on
how you play your part. #

110
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:26,235
# Unfortunately, how you played your part
has got you here. #

111
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:29,168
# Sing a song of sixpence,
a gift for our king! #

112
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,563
# Sire, let me hold the reigns
while you pluck your fiddle strings. #

113
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,382
# Nah-nah-nana-nah! #

114
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,678
# Keep your hands and arms and legs
and head about you at all times. #

115
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,253
# Use discretion!
Stay alert, #

116
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:44,710
# and pick the pace up tortoise
as the gate smacks your behind! #

117
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,681
# Welcome to eternity!
Now eat your just desserts! #

118
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:50,881
- Help me. Help me, help me, they're coming for me.
- Who's coming for you?

119
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,513
- There's no time. They're coming.
- Who's coming for you?

120
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,357
Walk with me, walk with me. Move.

121
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:01,628
# You're in The Devil's Carnival!
You can't help but fall! Devil's Carnival! #

122
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:04,245
# You can't help but fall! #

123
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,273
# Devil's Carnival! #

124
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,273
Good evening.
Tickets, please.

125
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,968
- We're together.
- Outstanding.

126
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:19,309
Shall I train you to our
most popular attractions?

127
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:21,205
I'm sorry, we're...
we're in a bit of a rush.

128
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:29,524
If you like those,
you'll love this.

129
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,772
- Is it as big as it looks?
- Bigger.

130
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,778
I need to collect my son.

131
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:41,693
He, he's lost.
If you'll just excuse me...

132
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,577
You'll have to wait your turn, sir.

133
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:46,122
- There are rules.
- What rules?

134
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,479
Rules of nature.

135
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,739
Rules of man.

136
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,511
Why, even ticket booths have rules.

137
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,157
# There's a chaos that reigns
at the heart of this beast. #

138
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,605
# Yes, our carnival here's
a well-oiled machine. #

139
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,976
# All six hundred sixty-six
rules are policed. #

140
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,001
# All six hundred sixty-six
rules you must heed. #

141
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:10,659
# It's my duty to advise you of the
ordinance in place chiefly designed #

142
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,330
# to keep our operations mean
and fine-tuned. #

143
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,151
# Every cog is mal- aligned. #

144
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,916
# As you'll note,
The Rules are clearly stated, #

145
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,923
# even illustrated and enumerated, #

146
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:22,362
# on this staunchly dense,
yet never complicated, #

147
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,441
# cautionary little guide. #

148
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,290
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

149
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:31,330
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

150
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,170
# As Keeper, it's my humble pleasure #

151
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,651
# to first castigate and
then admonish you  #

152
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,297
# that "cutting" breaks rule
number sixty-two. #

153
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,391
# And breaking rules,
it just won't do. #

154
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,272
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

155
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:49,609
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

156
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:53,344
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

157
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,273
# Six hundred sixty-six. #

158
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:07,759
# There are consequences,
morbid consequences, #

159
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,364
# Crueler than ever imagined. #

160
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:17,644
# Oh, yes, there are consequences,
bloody consequences #

161
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,594
# when you don't follow the rules
Psst. #

162
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:30,278
Wanna help me out here?
I'm locked in this stupid cage.

163
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:33,019
-  If you get me out, I'll protect you.
- What can I do?

164
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,344
The knife.

165
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:39,953
C'mon, I'm not gonna bite.

166
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,267
My savior.

167
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,280
What is this place?

168
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,268
Where are we?

169
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,209
You're not gonna need this.

170
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:23,382
Wow!

171
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,441
Did you like that?

172
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,692
Cover my eyes.

173
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:34,356
What?

174
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,290
Cover my eyes.

175
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,281
That's so boss.

176
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,526
Yeah, I used to have an act,

177
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:53,353
but I lost my wheel gal.

178
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,685
What happened?

179
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,610
It doesn't matter.

180
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,549
You're prettier anyhow.

181
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,768
I don't even know you.

182
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:05,985
Trust me.

183
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,181
Okay.

184
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,894
Daniel?

185
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:50,804
Daniel?

186
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:00,722
Daniel!

187
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:23,272
Hey!

188
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,545
Hey.

189
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,448
# Missed me, missed me, now you
have to kiss the girls! #

190
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,741
# Kiss the girls! #

191
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,986
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hellharmonic!

192
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:53,190
# Here is the hive, where are the bees?
Buzzing around where nobody sees them. #

193
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,380
# Here is the church, open the steeple.
Ready or not, sting all the people. #

194
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,007
# One for the priest, two for the dame,
Three for the sweet little boy lost #

195
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,725
# in the rain. Rain, go away.
Little Johnny wants to #

196
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:06,495
# kiss the girls! #

197
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,531
# Kiss the girls! #

198
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,388
Please, lady, tell me how
to get out of here.

199
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,215
No, lady, I'm not...
I'm not here for the games.

200
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:15,968
Please, I just need to find my boy.

201
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,346
This is ridiculous.

202
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,528
Can you help me find Daniel?

203
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,463
Do you know where he is?

204
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,032
Where?

205
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:26,863
Where is he?

206
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,022
Where did you get this?

207
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,365
Where did you get it?

208
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,678
Ow!
To hell with you people!

209
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,690
Hello?

210
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,820
Daniel!

211
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:40,779
Don't ever do that to me again.

212
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,048
Ah!
You're just in time for a story.

213
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,365
This one's called:
"The Dog and her Reflection".

214
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:21,726
It happened one day that a Dog was
carrying some jewels in her mouth,

215
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,711
across a plank,
over some running water.

216
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,345
So enamored with what
she saw in the water,

217
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:36,764
the dog failed to recognize
her own reflection.

218
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,995
Hello?
Do you work here?

219
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,075
I'm trying to find this diamond.
This map is completely confusing.

220
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:56,581
Fetch me a supervisor at once!

221
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,632
There's some change in it for you.

222
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:07,609
Littering breaks rule number
one hundred twenty nine.

223
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,417
Your map is utterly useless.

224
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,257
Rules, ma'am, rules.

225
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,923
Lashes, lashes, we all fall down.

226
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:28,879
Help!

227
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:31,411
Help!

228
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:33,091
Hello?

229
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:38,450
- Did you see what those animals did to me?
- Yes, they can be so cruel.

230
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:39,822
Come up,

231
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,682
stay a spell.
Let me lighten your load.

232
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,413
Let me take all of you in.

233
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,074
Are these real?

234
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:46,944
Are yours?

235
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,314
Nothing but aces

236
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:51,709
Well, then cast an eyeball at this.

237
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:55,185
That's the one, that's
the one from the brochure!

238
00:22:57,535 --> 00:23:02,598
# Reckless creatures,
always one another find. #

239
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:07,842
# Stealing features,
each a diamond to be mined. #

240
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,484
# There are facets to snake. #

241
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:12,165
# And crooks in our neck,
we're like moths to the flame. #

242
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,426
# Get ready and set. #

243
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:15,846
# Now tarry no longer.
Let's burn one another. #

244
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:19,336
# We're one and we're twain.
Now let's play a game. #

245
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:31,532
# Hello, hello, hello, beautiful stranger. #

246
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:35,838
# How familiar the danger, #

247
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:41,381
# slipping into the shallows. #

248
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,391
Horsefeathers!

249
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,212
The diamond looks much smaller in person.

250
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:52,145
# 'Tis true, 'tis true, 'tis true, #

251
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,936
# celebrities always do. #

252
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:59,553
# Us in our shadows, too, #

253
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:04,533
# Us in our shadow-s-s-s. #

254
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:18,492
Nice trick.

255
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,632
# High stakes, three shakes, no breaks, #

256
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,625
# triple the wager. #

257
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:29,377
# Three clicks in the chamber, #

258
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:34,377
# three chances to claim her. #

259
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:36,000
And if I miss?

260
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,298
# By the book, by hook, by rook. #

261
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,867
# Shadow takes all, my pet. #

262
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:46,767
# My, what a strange duet. #

263
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,504
# Shadow takes all. #

264
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:51,897
These games are rigged.

265
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:59,473
# Cunning creatures.
Slither front and slither back. #

266
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:04,383
# Double-dealers.
Double up for the attack. #

267
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:07,986
# I could say that I'm hurt,
but it wouldn't be true. #

268
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,761
# The knife in my back,
it reminds me of you. #

269
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:13,243
# You're my beautiful stranger.
The game is afoot. #

270
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:16,109
# It's the shadow's domain
So don't pussyfoot. Shoot! #

271
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:19,494
So I'm actually supposed to throw these
coins in that egg? This is ridiculous.

272
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:21,488
Fine.

273
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,715
Don't touch me!
My jewels!

274
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:39,765
Stop it! I'll sue!

275
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:41,554
- C'mon!

276
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:42,754
You animal!

277
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,148
Shadow takes all.

278
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:02,895
Okay.

279
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,962
Beware, lest you lose the substance

280
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,464
by grasping at the shadow.

281
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:21,365
# Let me tell you a tale for a penny,
one that you cannot hear anywhere else, #

282
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:22,985
# not anywhere else #

283
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:25,564
# I heard from a birdie it
doesn't end purdy, #

284
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,292
# it doesn't end well.
No, it never ends well. #

285
00:26:28,948 --> 00:26:30,999
# Let me spin you a yarn for a cent. #

286
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:39,165
# Lord, would it not be a sin for you
to deny yourselves a tale? #

287
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,288
# A penny, a penny, #

288
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:46,987
# A penny for an old
beggar man's story, #

289
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,304
#  a story. #

290
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:50,717
# A penny for a tale #

291
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,199
# There once was a doggy. #

292
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,819
Arf! Arf! Arf!

293
00:26:57,067 --> 00:27:02,279
# She pranced in the moon with a
mouthful of shiny red pennies. #

294
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:04,785
# She leapt and she wagged #

295
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:08,789
# so proud of her shiny red pennies. #

296
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,920
# Yipping with glee, #

297
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,443
# she trotted by the river. #

298
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,000
# Trot! Trot! Trot! #

299
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,230
# And oh, bless my soul,
she saw her reflection in the water. #

300
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,891
# A pup with a jaw full of shiny
red pennies in the water. #

301
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:33,063
# She trotted as she plotted to
pirate those pennies. #

302
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,936
# Oh, how they teased! #

303
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:42,165
# Lord, Lord!
That greed, it'll kill ya. #

304
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,496
# Lord, Lord!
Go on, pass the hat, will ya? #

305
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:49,409
# Your purse strings are tight,
bleed for a sinner. #

306
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:54,122
# I just need a few pennies more, #

307
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,488
# a few pennies more. #

308
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:57,873
No!

309
00:27:58,367 --> 00:27:59,017
No!

310
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,175
# But greedy, so greedy. #

311
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,098
Me! Me! Me!

312
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:08,048
# She snarled as she swiped and struck
at the mutt in the water. #

313
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:12,735
# A foolish pooch loots from
herself in the water. #

314
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,259
# Her reflection struck back! #

315
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,990
# Lord, I wanna go on with the song. #

316
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:23,554
# But don't make me bring up
what she did to that pup, #

317
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,697
# that cute little pup.
I just might well up. #

318
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:29,861
# But I'll continue my rhyme
for a dime, #

319
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:32,394
# or a penny is fine.
These are difficult times. #

320
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:33,838
# Yes, difficult times. #

321
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,760
# Thank you, sirs, you're too kind. #

322
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,951
# Lord, Lord!
That greed, it'll kill ya.#

323
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:43,495
# Lord, Lord!
Go on, pass the hat, will ya? #

324
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:47,438
# Your purse strings are tight,
bleed for a sinner. #

325
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:52,733
# I just need a few pennies.
Lord, Lord! That greed, it'll kill ya. #

326
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:56,206
# Lord, Lord!
Go on, pass the hat, will ya? #

327
00:28:56,512 --> 00:29:00,026
# Your purse strings are tight,
bleed for a sinner. #

328
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:04,901
# I just need a few pennies more, #

329
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,233
# a few pennies more. #

330
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,629
# And so did our doggy. #

331
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:13,137
Bad! Bad! Bad!

332
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:17,653
# She'd kill for a bite at those
shiny red pennies. #

333
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:23,125
# She leapt and she barked at
that dog in the water. #

334
00:29:24,903 --> 00:29:26,555
# But her pennies, her pennies, #

335
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,907
#  they dropped, down, down. #

336
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,943
# And after them she shot,
down, down, #

337
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:38,938
# down in the waters below. #

338
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:43,451
# God rest her soul! #

339
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:52,632
Would you like to hear another story,
young Daniel?

340
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:55,044
Good, good.

341
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:02,148
Ah, this is one of my favorites,
"The Scorpion and the Frog."

342
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:05,490
A scorpion and a frog meet on
the bank of a stream.

343
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:12,338
Will ya look at that?

344
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,071
One sec'.

345
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,659
It's for saving me earlier.

346
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:37,101
Now let me return the favor.

347
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,660
Do you trust me?

348
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,033
Yes.

349
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:00,666
I'll be right back.

350
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,610
Wait!

351
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:26,439
Where'd you go?

352
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,449
C'mon, you're starting to scare me.

353
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:46,188
Oh.

354
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:47,843
I'm sorry.

355
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:50,687
No, that's okay.

356
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,030
It's all part of the act.

357
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:54,688
No, I... I better go.

358
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,560
Okay.

359
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:58,858
Okay?

360
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:00,446
Oh.

361
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,033
Well, bye.

362
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:04,588
Liar!

363
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:10,264
You said you trusted me.

364
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,883
I, I trust you.

365
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,700
What was that?

366
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:19,807
I trust you.

367
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:34,301
# You're a tough little
tadpole to love, #

368
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,743
# naughty lilies and lures. #

369
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,425
# Oh, I was knocked to the floor. #

370
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:44,001
# Never tasted as sweet a
poison as you have. #

371
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:47,936
# You're an urge that can
never be cured. #

372
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:52,812
# You're a bad little love,
and I'm yours. #

373
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,799
# So trust me, #

374
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,907
# trust me, darling dear. #

375
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,912
# I'm so sincere, #

376
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:02,505
#  there's no need to tear. #

377
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,988
# Trust me, trust me, honey, do. #

378
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:10,676
# Just like I trust you. #

379
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,437
# Babe, you're a hard
game to catch. #

380
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:20,243
# You fight and refuse.
Oh, you're a wild little bruise. #

381
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,047
# Never tasted as sweet a
poison as you have. #

382
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:28,984
# You know you never can hide. #

383
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,004
# You're a bad little love, #

384
00:33:32,124 --> 00:33:33,450
# and you're mine. #

385
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:38,818
# So trust me, trust me, darling dear. #

386
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:40,998
# I'm so sincere, #

387
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,249
# there's no need to tear. #

388
00:33:43,595 --> 00:33:45,865
# Trust me, trust me, #

389
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:47,963
# darling, do. #

390
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:51,507
# Just like I trust you. #

391
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:53,552
The frog asks:

392
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:55,350
How do I know you won't stab me?

393
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,736
The scorpion replies:

394
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,556
Because my act is dead without you.

395
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:12,533
# So don't cry, cry baby, #

396
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:14,580
#  all dressed in green. #

397
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:18,681
# How many kisses do you need? #

398
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:21,329
# One for your tummy, #

399
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,558
#  one for your cheek, #

400
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:26,298
# one for the devil #

401
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:29,150
# inside #

402
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,329
# of #

403
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,895
# me. #

404
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:41,292
Never trust a scorpion,

405
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,383
lest you be pricked!

406
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:47,488
# Black, #

407
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:49,223
# black #

408
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,216
# is love's potion. #

409
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,699
# We drink, #

410
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:56,147
# we drink from its well. #

411
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:58,908
# And in their name, #

412
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:01,361
# let's drink to true love, #

413
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:04,786
# where a toad and scorpion fell. #

414
00:35:05,441 --> 00:35:07,424
# Yes, in their name, #

415
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:09,612
# let's drink to true love. #

416
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:13,455
# For true love can break the spell. #

417
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:17,909
# For true love can break the spell. #

418
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:21,915
# Awake from your dream,
frog maiden. #

419
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:25,766
# Skin green as the Emerald Sea. #

420
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:29,918
# Let me tell you a tale
of a love that had failed. #

421
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:34,456
# Prick, prick, prick #

422
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:38,156
#  goes The Scorpion's Tale. #

423
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,820
# She blushed as she woke by the water, #

424
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:46,358
# having known him the evening before. #

425
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:50,655
# She liked how he spoke,
but aware of his poke. #

426
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:55,123
# Prick, prick, prick #

427
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,846
#  goes the scorpion's tail. #

428
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,748
# Oh, love, it is foolish and green,
my love. #

429
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:07,722
# How quickly we forget the sting,
my love. #

430
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,484
# What a pretty, yet dangerous line,
my love. #

431
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:16,922
# What bitter, yet delicious wine,
my love. #

432
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,985
# With a flick of his prick
he surprised her, #

433
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:24,932
# Shell red as the rose in his teeth. #

434
00:36:25,237 --> 00:36:26,805
# Fair maiden, join me, #

435
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,678
#  let us ride out to sea. #

436
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,816
# Prick, prick, prick #

437
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:36,651
#  goes The Scorpion's Tale. #

438
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,695
# She pondered if his love was poison, #

439
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,522
# but he pricked her so gently
she swooned. #

440
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:49,565
# His words poured like wine
as their fates intertwined. #

441
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:53,757
# Prick, prick, prick #

442
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:57,937
#  goes the scorpion's tail. #

443
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:02,494
# Oh, love, it is foolish and green,
my love. #

444
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,296
# How quickly we forget the sting,
my love. #

445
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,290
# What a pretty, yet dangerous line,
my love. #

446
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:16,800
# What bitter, yet delicious wine,
my love. #

447
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:23,307
# She offered her back quite demurely. #

448
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,874
# He climbed and they swam out to sea. #

449
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:31,517
# She stroked and she smiled,
and his stinger went wild. #

450
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:36,954
# Prick, prick, prick!
Prick, prick, prick! #

451
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:41,827
# Prick, prick, prick!
Prick, prick, prick, #

452
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:49,971
# goes The Scorpion's Tale! #

453
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,970
# Black, #

454
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,405
# black is love's potion. #

455
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,820
# Take heed, #

456
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,956
# take heed of the thorns. #

457
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:04,588
# Don't scream #

458
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,951
# when it stings. #

459
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,056
# Remember #

460
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:10,357
# that #

461
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:13,871
# you were warned. #

462
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:15,110
# Come #

463
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:31,159
# Drink! #

464
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:37,586
# Drink a cup of my scorn! #

465
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:48,279
This is our final story, Daniel,

466
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:52,795
"The Devil and his Due".

467
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:28,953
Didn't I warn you that cutting
was against the rules?

468
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,691
I lost my son.

469
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:44,891
I know you people aren't going
to help me find him,

470
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,110
so you stay the hell away from me!

471
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:59,191
I always find the best way to
uncover something lost

472
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,931
is to retrace my steps.

473
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,580
Answers wait inside, sir

474
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:44,278
# Where is your little son lost,
John? #

475
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,843
# Tears, John, #

476
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:48,940
# tears, John. #

477
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,526
# Bruised in the rain #

478
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:54,041
# with his overalls torn. #

479
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,549
# With one shoe off #

480
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:59,032
# and one shoe on. #

481
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,210
# Tears, John, #

482
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:03,327
# tears, John. #

483
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:13,108
# And where will your little son sleep,
John? #

484
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:15,461
# Under the smokestacks, #

485
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,722
# under the heap, #

486
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:23,290
# Under the tent where
the canopy leaks?

487
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,003
# Tears, John, #

488
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:27,446
# tears, John. #

489
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,753
# You're drowning in the grief
of Jupiter's water. #

490
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,678
# Let me open my teeth #

491
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:41,919
# and cradle you there. #

492
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:46,613
# There's a bed for the boy
and a rope for the father, #

493
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:53,310
# Both orphaned by heaven
where no child is spared. #

494
00:41:56,664 --> 00:42:01,141
# To who will your little son pray,
John? #

495
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,666
# Dark are the strangers
that sleep on the train. #

496
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:11,097
# There's blood on their cots
and bones on their plate. #

497
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,101
# Tears, John, #

498
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,577
# tears, John. #

499
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,390
# Who then will tend to the sheep,
John? #

500
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:30,065
# While he treads in the place where
the vicious gods preach, #

501
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:35,122
# Where claws come in sharpened on
wolves in white fleece. #

502
00:42:35,418 --> 00:42:37,056
# Tears, John, #

503
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,448
# tears, John, #

504
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:41,646
# tears, John, #

505
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:44,272
# tears, John. #

506
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,975
# You're drowning in the grief
of Jupiter's water. #

507
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:51,307
# Let me open my teeth #

508
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,791
# and cradle you there. #

509
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:58,559
# There's a bed for the boy
and a rope for the father, #

510
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:04,985
# Both orphaned by heaven
where no child is spared. #

511
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,986
# Swing from my limb #

512
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,236
# and render your tears. #

513
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,586
# The more that you shed, #

514
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:23,101
# the deeper he nears. #

515
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,903
# His two little hands #

516
00:43:25,248 --> 00:43:27,746
# push the chair from your feet. #

517
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:33,361
# Drown in your beautiful grief. #

518
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,120
Daniel!

519
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,430
Oh my god!

520
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,838
Don't you ever run away from me again,
do you understand that?

521
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,946
Have you come to give Grief her due?

522
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:49,836
What is this place?

523
00:43:51,148 --> 00:43:52,198
Who are you?

524
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:55,075
My dear, petty man.

525
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,383
I've been called many things,

526
00:43:58,085 --> 00:43:59,485
"The Chaos in the Story"

527
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,536
"The Anarchy in Your Thoughts".

528
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:03,530
But for you, John,

529
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,691
I am the excuse you give

530
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,127
give when you can not
follow the rules.

531
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:12,976
You stay away from my boy,
you hear me?

532
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:14,861
Your boy?

533
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,337
No! No!

534
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,450
Where's...?

535
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:25,469
Daniel?

536
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:27,914
Daniel?

537
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:31,507
- The boy died a good, clean death.
- No!

538
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:34,895
If you hurt my son, so help me god,
I will kill you.

539
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,556
Watch your tongue!

540
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:40,171
I'm not in the business of
murdering innocent children.

541
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:42,474
That's God's jurisdiction.

542
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:44,970
I deal only with the guilty,

543
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:47,344
guilty John.

544
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:53,177
You surrendered to delicious Grief.

545
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:06,571
Now grieve, John.

546
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:08,332
- No, no.
- Grieve.

547
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:11,371
Please, help me find my son,

548
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:13,519
- please.
- No.

549
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,589
Where is he?

550
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:16,816
Questions. So many questions.

551
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:19,008
I won't give up on my son.

552
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:21,781
What kind of father would I be?

553
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:22,801
Indeed.

554
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:26,001
I just need to retrace my steps.

555
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:28,550
Stories often outlive their authors,
John.

556
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:31,125
Especially the good ones

557
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,087
- I... I told him not to leave!
- Will you tell him?

558
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:37,251
No, not I.
For if I do, he's sure to cry.

559
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:39,336
He shouldn't have been here.
He shouldn't...

560
00:45:39,648 --> 00:45:41,034
He shouldn't have been here!

561
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:43,311
He shouldn't have been born, he...!

562
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,790
No,

563
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:47,562
no, Daniel.

564
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:50,956
I didn't mean that, buddy.

565
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:52,984
Please,

566
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:56,342
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean it!

567
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:00,018
I don't want to grieve.

568
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,810
I don't want to grieve.

569
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:09,586
Damn.

570
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:14,353
And I was so looking forward to having
you as a guest in my carnival,

571
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,530
over and over again.

572
00:46:21,576 --> 00:46:23,676
Send heaven my regards.

573
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:48,391
What are you doing here?

574
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:07,492
You let one of them go, sire?

575
00:47:10,003 --> 00:47:11,201
It would appear so.

576
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,213
To heaven?

577
00:47:17,994 --> 00:47:18,891
But, the rules?

578
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,190
My friend,

579
00:47:23,749 --> 00:47:24,806
the rules

580
00:47:25,454 --> 00:47:26,748
are changing.

581
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:31,217
# A sheep has left the fold,
Hoof beats go a-trotting, trodding, #

582
00:47:31,337 --> 00:47:32,988
# up to heaven, bold. #

583
00:47:33,108 --> 00:47:35,158
# At the gates a- knocking, knocking, #

584
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:36,946
# sheep in wolfish clothes. #

585
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:40,659
# Holy jaws a- dropping.
Up in heaven's hold. #

586
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:43,527
# Plant my hooves, my hooks, my books. #

587
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,063
# Once upon a time #

588
00:47:45,183 --> 00:47:49,143
# Heaven was a tower, tower
tethered in its pride. #

589
00:47:49,465 --> 00:47:51,087
# Cast us grapes as sour, sour. #

590
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:53,364
# Thought the ink was dried. #

591
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:56,589
# But hellish gardens flowered.
Ivy to be climbed. #

592
00:47:56,905 --> 00:48:00,273
# Spread my filth, my wings,
my weeds, my weeds. #

593
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:03,492
# My fairest wheels are turning Hark! #

594
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:07,773
# The angels wail.
Bedtime ears a-burning, burning. #

595
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:11,863
# We've got grace for sale.
How the worm is turning, turning. #

596
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:13,561
# Lay you down to sleep #

597
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:15,353
# with wicked little stories. #

598
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:18,740
# Count your missing sheep.
Shed my skin, my fleece, #

599
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:20,690
# my sin, my worms. #

600
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:23,698
# They burrow up the lines. #

601
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,027
# Serpents in the branches, branching #

602
00:48:26,147 --> 00:48:27,643
# up those crooked vines. #

603
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:29,789
# Vultures of a feather hatching. #

604
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:33,991
# Circus lullabies,
carousels a-ramping #

605
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,739
# up to heaven,
I Raise my hell, my Cain,

606
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:38,439
# my stakes, my snakes. #

607
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,451
# Tongues, tongues,
slither in the mud. #

608
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:42,957
# That's how a carnival grows,
my son. #

609
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:45,111
# Tongues, tongues,
slither in the psalms. #

610
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:47,342
# That's how a carnival grows. #

611
00:48:47,462 --> 00:48:49,322
# All these fickle beasts #

612
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:51,190
# heaven hath rejected, lapping, #

613
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,314
# glory from our teats. #

614
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,984
# Each of them is tested, blessed. #

615
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,175
# Cast down for your sin?
Come here for redemption. #

616
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:02,530
# We've got grace for cheap.
We've got grace for cheap. #

617
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:05,694
# Lest you end up bested,
lost and torn to shreds, #

618
00:49:05,814 --> 00:49:07,005
# dissected. #

619
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,009
# Tongues, tongues,
slither in the mud, #

620
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,237
# slither in the mud,
slither in the mud. #

621
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:13,598
# That's how a carnival grows,
my son. #

622
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,683
# That's how a carnival grows. #

623
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:18,318
# Tongues, tongues,
slither in the psalms, #

624
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,627
# slither in the psalms,
slither in the psalms. #

625
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:23,101
# That's how a carnival grows,
my son. #

626
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:25,366
# That's how a carnival grows. #

627
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:26,836
Listen up, everyone.

628
00:49:31,274 --> 00:49:32,224
Tomorrow

629
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,549
there's going to be

630
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:38,338
some renovations
made to the carnival.

631
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,837
We're putting heaven out of business.

632
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:45,754
Get ready for war.

633
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:47,702
# Fa la la,
it's off to hell we go. #

634
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:49,779
# Cross your heart and
hope to die. #

635
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:51,457
# It's off to hell we go! #

636
00:49:51,577 --> 00:49:54,557
# Fa la la,
it's off to hell we go! #

637
00:49:55,137 --> 00:49:57,225
# Stick a needle in your eye, #

638
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:59,122
# it's off to hell we go! #

639
00:49:59,242 --> 00:50:02,217
# Fa la la,
it's off to hell we go! #

640
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:05,531
# Cross your heart and hope to die.
It's off to hell! #

641
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:06,486
Hello?

642
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,550
Hello?

643
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:10,284
Where am I?

644
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:24,097
# The ship, it swayed.
Heave-ho, heave-ho! #

645
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:26,663
# On the dark and stormy blue. #

646
00:51:27,278 --> 00:51:29,879
# And I held tight to the captain's might #

647
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:32,055
# as he pulled up his trews. #

648
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:35,974
# You haven't slept,
heave- ho, he said, #

649
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,593
# in many suns and moons. #

650
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:42,075
# Oh, I will sleep when we
reach shore, #

651
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:44,624
# and pray we get there soon. #

652
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:46,705
# He said,
now hush, love. #

653
00:51:46,921 --> 00:51:49,765
# Here's your gown,
there's the bed, #

654
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:51,194
# lanterns down. #

655
00:51:51,299 --> 00:51:53,649
# But I don't want to go to sleep, #

656
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,796
# in all my dreams I drown. #

657
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:00,263
# The captain howled,
heave-ho, heave- ho, #

658
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,159
# and tied me up with sheets. #

659
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:05,707
# A storm is brewing in the south. #

660
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:08,672
# It's time you go to sleep. #

661
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,825
# His berth, it rocked.
Heave-ho, heave-ho. #

662
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,453
# The ocean gnashed and moaned. #

663
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:18,097
# Like Jonah, we'll be swallowed whole, #

664
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,751
# and spat back teeth and bones. #

665
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:22,970
# He said,
now hush, love. #

666
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,415
# Here's your gown,
there's the bed, #

667
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:27,305
# lanterns down. #

668
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:29,767
# But I don't want to go to sleep, #

669
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,768
# in all my dreams I drown. #

670
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,525
# Captain, #

671
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,120
# captain, #

672
00:52:36,461 --> 00:52:38,733
# I will do your chores. #

673
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:42,062
# I will warm your cot at night #

674
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:44,767
# and mop your cabin floors. #

675
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,908
# Scold me, #

676
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:48,110
# hold me, #

677
00:52:48,468 --> 00:52:50,740
# I'll be yours to keep. #

678
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:53,714
# The only thing I beg of you, #

679
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,714
# don't make me go to sleep. #

680
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:59,816
# The sky, it flashed.
Heave-ho, heave-ho. #

681
00:53:00,162 --> 00:53:02,694
# His pillow dulled the brink. #

682
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:06,076
# The curtains ran between my legs #

683
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:08,396
# As we began to sink. #

684
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,920
# I closed my eyes.
Heave-ho, heave-ho. #

685
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,469
# As the ship was rent and felled. #

686
00:53:15,457 --> 00:53:18,032
# Eddies in the water #

687
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:20,415
# headed to the mouth of hell. #

688
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,224
# Hush, now hush, love. #

689
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:25,724
# Here's your gown,
there's the bed, #

690
00:53:25,984 --> 00:53:27,285
# lanterns down. #

691
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,695
# I'm begging you,
please wake me up. #

692
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:32,227
# In all my dreams I...#
