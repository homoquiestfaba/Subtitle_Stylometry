1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,992
<i>I got out of the truck in this two-bit town. </i>

2
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,958
<i>I got no money and no prospects. </i>

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,716
<i>What I need right now is a stiff drink,</i>
<i>a cold shower and a hot broad. </i>

4
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,038
<i>I'll take 'em in any order they come. </i>

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,958
<i>Oh, yeah, one other thing I need: An angle. </i>

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,159
<i>If it weren't for bad luck,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have any luck at all. </i>

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,311
Can I help you?

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,154
<i>Either my luck had just changed,</i>

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,437
<i>or fate just bought me</i>
<i>another round of trouble. </i>

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,513
The house needs a few repairs. It's small...

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,595
<i>She kept yammering the whole time,</i>
<i>but her hips were doing all the talking. </i>

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,311
We haven't had a man
around here for so long that...

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,869
<i>It couldn't have been any clearer</i>
<i>what the set-up was. </i>

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,634
<i>- The next move was up to me... </i>
- Stop.

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,512
Hold it. Stop. Don't tell me.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,639
That's all the time we have. Sorry.
Next time.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,348
- I have 18 minutes.
- I don't wanna hear any more today.

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,999
Why not?

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,757
- Mr. Follett, do you trust me or not?
- I don't know. I've only seen you for...

20
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,199
- Without trust, you might as well not come.
- I didn't say I didn't wanna come.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,510
Good. Then go.

22
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,150
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Doc.

23
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,673
Doc, you're early. What happened?

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,479
- My patient had to leave early.
- Who?

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,552
Does "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?

26
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,792
I think it's like... inquisitive?

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,952
- It was Henry Follett.
- You see him a lot.

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,272
It's wrong of you to reveal it.
Next you'll reveal his problem.

29
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,115
- What do you wanna know?
- I'm never telling you anything.

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,193
- Hey, Doc. How's it going?
- Fine, Elizabeth. You?

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,352
Mumford, how long
have you been in this town?

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,479
- I don't know.
- Four months, two and a half weeks.

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,030
You've got more patients
than the other two shrinks.

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,876
- I don't think even you could know that.
- Look at that guy.

35
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,110
You know who that is, don't you?

36
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,716
You really don't?
That's Skip Skipperton, man.

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,671
- He gets hit by a truck, the town shuts.
- Oh, so that's him, the Panda man?

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,628
What makes you so popular?
What's your secret?

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,275
You like me. How come?

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,591
I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

41
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,954
I'm watching Brokaw, and they've got
some astronomer, this limey know-it-all.

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,831
He says with this Himball telescope they've
discovered 400 million more galaxies.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,992
I guess that's supposed
to make me feel small?

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,709
I'm supposed to feel insignificant?
Is that the point?

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,950
'Cause I'll tell ya, it didn't!

46
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,752
Lionel, since this is our first session,
you can sit up and look at me if you like.

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,673
Tell me about what brought you here.

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,912
Kind of impatient
for a big-time headshrinker.

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,834
How about you let me explain it my way,
OK? Thanks.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,675
So, in my dream, it's always the same.

51
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,434
I wake up in my room when I was a kid

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,309
and I realize
it's the day of the big exam at school.

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,510
Which is no problem for me because I'd
attended every class, so I'm totally prepared.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,277
<i>Then I see myself running down the hall</i>
<i>at school. This is very interesting, I think. </i>

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,752
<i>It's not really my school. </i>
<i>It's the school from the next district. </i>

56
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,434
- Go on!
- Even though I arrive early,

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,593
<i>everybody is already there,</i>
<i>but the surprising part is... </i>

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,036
<i>I'm the only one who's prepared. </i>

59
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,872
- You'll have to get out.
- You can't do this.

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,917
Sure I can, Lionel.

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,313
I am a criminal lawyer. You think
I like my clients? I can't stand most of them!

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,437
But I don't kick them out.

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,072
That sign says, "We can refuse service
to anyone. " I don't wanna see you back here.

64
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,470
Do you at least have a back door?

65
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,872
Come out this way, Lionel.
No shame in therapy, is there, Althea?

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,679
Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,673
Maybe some of us don't need this crap.

68
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,309
And it's the Hubble Telescope,
not the Himball.

69
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,472
- Jeez, what an asshole!
- (SHE LAUGHS)

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,991
What do they want from me?

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,555
What have I done that's so wrong?

72
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,269
They act as if they don't have
their own peculiar things.

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,991
Everybody's got something
they're not so proud of. Even you, probably.

74
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,039
- Me more than most.
- Why are they ganging up against me?

75
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,228
- I think they're worried about you.
- It's the kids. It isn't Jeremy.

76
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,077
He had nothing to do with my coming to you,
except pay. He's always willing to pay.

77
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,959
He's extremely generous.

78
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,718
I am so humiliated that my own children
would threaten me.

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,996
How did they threaten you?

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,154
They said if I didn't get help,
they wouldn't deal with me any more.

81
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,957
- What do you think of that?
- Good kids.

82
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,633
- (MUMBLES)
- Hmm?

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,031
You must come to the house
for dinner on Thursday.

84
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,713
Really? You think so?

85
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,557
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend,
and you can meet the kids.

86
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,430
How are you doing, Ainge?

87
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,319
- Evening, Lily.
- Hey, Doc.

88
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,471
Ainge.

89
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,835
<i>Tonight on "Unsolved Mysteries"... </i>

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,676
<i>She loved horses, but even though</i>
<i>Shelly Malone was an expert rider,</i>

91
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,276
<i>witnesses claim</i>
<i>she died in a freak riding accident. </i>

92
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,830
<i>Shelly's family thinks</i>
<i>the truth is very different. </i>

93
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,596
<i>In Indiana, a sudden storm</i>
<i>spells trouble for a motorcyclist. </i>

94
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,029
<i>Tragedy seems inevitable until a mysterious</i>
<i>lady in black appears from out of nowhere. </i>

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,120
<i>Join me. Perhaps you may be able</i>
<i>to help solve a mystery. </i>

96
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,990
He had the tattoo that said "Naomi for ever",

97
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,630
but they're broken up,
so he has to have it removed.

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,635
But while it's healing, or whatever
you call it when a tattoo's removed,

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,759
he meets Heidi,
and it's serious, immediate love.

100
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,598
In no time he's gone from the most beautiful
actress to the most gorgeous model.

101
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,796
What do you mean, "In no time"?

102
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,793
- Three or four issues.
- Weekly or monthly?

103
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,069
Monthly. God!
How shallow do you think Brad is?

104
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,516
Why do I waste my time
telling you this stuff?

105
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,716
Why do you think you tell me?

106
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,271
Don't do that thing. Please, I beg of you.

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,638
- That shrink thing.
- It's a big part of the show.

108
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,199
You really need to let people smoke in here.
It's perverse.

109
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,635
What do they pay you to see me?

110
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,712
School doesn't pay you? What deal is that?

111
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,394
- It's called pro bono.
- Pro boner?

112
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,477
There was this article my friends and I read.
It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed".

113
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,473
- It was very fascinating.
- Where was this?

114
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,358
<i>The "New York Times".</i>

115
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,992
The first one was, he handles produce well.
Which we already knew.

116
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,314
- You have a lot of the signs.
- Been watching me in the supermarket?

117
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,552
Have women found you attractive?

118
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,591
I knew you wouldn't answer.

119
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,196
I've been thinking
about what you said the last time

120
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,592
about me trying to lose weight
and constantly not.

121
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,880
You said people would be happier
if they accept that some things don't change,

122
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,919
that it'd be some kind of a relief
or something.

123
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,434
Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch,
but how depressing is that moment?

124
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,229
The moment when you give up.

125
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,519
Skip's in!

126
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,870
Hi, Skip.

127
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,113
Hi.

128
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,669
You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.

129
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,150
- How are you?
- Fine. OK. Pretty good.

130
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,313
I've been hoping we'd meet.
I've heard a lot about you.

131
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,995
Do you think we could...
Can I buy you a drink?

132
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,079
Sure.

133
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,956
"Find the need and fill it,"
my dad used to say.

134
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,352
I guess a lot of dads say that,
but I did and it just took off.

135
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,876
No kidding. Panda Modem -
where did that come from?

136
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,952
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas.

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,989
I've seen them in the wild.
That's the kind of thing I can do... now.

138
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,517
I can do pretty much anything
I wanna do these days.

139
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,231
So now we make 23% of the modems
in the market, which is pretty good.

140
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,040
When I was growing up, the timber business
was playing out. The town was dead.

141
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,111
Panda Modem changed all that.

142
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,479
Now just about everybody in town
works for me or depends on the company.

143
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,835
Which is kinda the problem.

144
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,718
Would you like another... whatever that is?

145
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,759
- No, I'm all right. It's grapefruit juice.
- Far out!

146
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,911
I'm gonna get another beer.

147
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,911
All right.

148
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,755
You want me to be your friend,
but that's not what's really going on.

149
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,595
You have some problems
and you want some therapy,

150
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,118
but it would be bad for Panda Modem stock
if word got out you had head problems.

151
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,556
- Can I ask a personal question?
- That's what I want.

152
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,996
- Have you thought about getting a wife?
- Yeah.

153
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,870
When Panda started to happen,
I was dating women from New York, LA...

154
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,670
They came out of the woodwork -
models, actresses, venture capitalists.

155
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,879
Not the kind who were interested in me
before I hit it big.

156
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,909
And I discovered that these girls
did not love me for myself.

157
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,950
The majority didn't even like me. But
they'd have gladly become Mrs. Skipperton.

158
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,910
Can you imagine that? Marrying somebody
just because they've got money?

159
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,878
I gotta pee.

160
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,838
Can I ask you something?
This town is called Mumford.

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,235
Been that way since 18... 180... 1813, right?

162
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,072
Here's the question.
Your name is Mumford too.

163
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,037
Is that the question?

164
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,638
You moved here from back east
and your name is the same as this town?

165
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,279
Far out!

166
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,353
Don't think I want you to do this for free.

167
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,149
We play it like friends,
but I'll pay you like a doctor.

168
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,880
- I understand.
- I have a lot of money.

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,396
- Know how much?
- I won't tell you what I've got.

170
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,757
- I've got three big ones.
- I'm impressed.

171
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,639
I couldn't make $3 million ever.

172
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,678
No, no. I have $3 billion.

173
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,556
- There you go.
- Thank you.

174
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,553
- Dr. Mumford.
- Mr. Crisp. I was looking for a ladder.

175
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,109
Could you come with me, please?

176
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,075
I should have come to your office.
I was gonna, but you walked in here.

177
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,798
That's all right.

178
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,838
My daughter, Sofie. She's got a problem.

179
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,036
- What's that?
- We're not sure.

180
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,715
We've been to doctors.
They all say different things:

181
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,396
Epstein-Barr virus,
Chronic Fatigue Symptom...

182
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,036
- Syndrome. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
- That's it.

183
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,273
- You know all about it?
- A little. There's debate about it.

184
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,193
Some people think it's all in her head.

185
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,717
It's been so bad, she had to move back
to Mumford and live with us.

186
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,758
- I'm not sure that's the best thing.
- Why?

187
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,472
A lot of reasons. Several different factors.
Would you see her, Doc?

188
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,390
Sure. Why don't you bring her
to my office at three tomorrow afternoon?

189
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,348
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood.

190
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,670
You ever go to somebody's house?

191
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,198
Generally it doesn't work. Sends the wrong
message to people who need to change.

192
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,552
This is great. This is exactly what I wanted.

193
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,792
Skip, you must have people
to throw ball a with.

194
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,590
You'd be surprised. Most guys
have kids or wives or girlfriends.

195
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,910
It's not as easy as you think.

196
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,757
- You're the head. Are they busier than you?
- Like I said, everybody works for me.

197
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,436
It's not the same asking someone
to throw a ball. It's like an order.

198
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,516
Would you say... Let me think how to put
this... Is your problem that you're lonely?

199
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,630
- Don't you like this?
- Sure.

200
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,315
Most guys would kill
to have someone to do this with.

201
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,871
- Have you got a lot of friends?
- Lily and I talk a bit.

202
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,478
- You know Lily who runs the coffee shop?
- No. I've seen her. Good-looking woman.

203
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,349
- She's probably ten years older than you.
- Good-looking.

204
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,399
She lives downstairs from me.
Got a dog named Danny Ainge.

205
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,190
Really? Danny Ainge? I'm the only
person I know that likes Danny Ainge.

206
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,751
- Outside of Celtic fans and Phoenix.
- Well, there's Lily.

207
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,872
Did you know he was drafted
by the Blue Jays?

208
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,397
Know what kind of athlete you have to be
to be in the NBA and the majors?

209
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,516
- Amazing.
- Unbelievable.

210
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,194
Lily named her dog after him? Far out!

211
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,033
What kind of person
do you have to be to do this?

212
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,794
- What?
- This.

213
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,709
I would have traded any of it
to have made the Mumford High varsity.

214
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,996
- So, Henry Follett is a patient of yours?
- Yeah.

215
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,478
- He's my pharmacist.
- The guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

216
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,756
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail.
Nothing hard core.

217
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,075
Old-fashioned ones, from back when people
cared about atmosphere and character.

218
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,997
His fantasy life's better than his actual one,
so he's disappointed in the real thing.

219
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,951
- His wife got sick of it and left, took his kids.
- I wondered what happened to her.

220
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,955
But there's something powerful going on
I don't get. We've got work to do.

221
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,509
It's hit to the warning track!

222
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,871
In these fantasies, Henry Follett is played
by a handsome guy with biceps.

223
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,476
Can you image that?
Where his self-esteem has to be?

224
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,471
I'd like to move the guy to the point where
he gets to appear in his own fantasies.

225
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,797
- Dr. Mumford.
- Mr. Crisp.

226
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,110
This is my daughter, Sofie.

227
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,591
Have a seat.

228
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,399
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.

229
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,953
I'd better not. I'll fall asleep. It's too soon
for me to be sleeping with you.

230
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,149
- What can you tell me about this?
- Oh, Lord.

231
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,676
It's too exhausting
to tell you about my exhaustion.

232
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,278
I didn't wanna come. I'm not hopeful
but I couldn't take the look on my dad's face.

233
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,278
When did you start to feel this way?

234
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,752
About six months ago, I guess it is now.
God, it seems like years!

235
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,275
I'm embarrassed by it.

236
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,118
Before this, when I'd hear people talk about
this kind of thing, I thought it was bullshit.

237
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,875
What?

238
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,555
You think that now.
You think it's a bunch of baloney.

239
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,111
- No.
- I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

240
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,071
That's OK. Maybe it is.

241
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,633
My mother always says, "Everything
that's wrong with you is in your head. "

242
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,791
I suppose that's true.

243
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,033
When this started,
was there anything unusual in your life?

244
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,351
Change of job, living situation, a loss?

245
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,117
No, but it started one year to the day
after my divorce became final.

246
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,748
That's not too suspicious, is it?

247
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,471
It wasn't like I was feeling bad
about the divorce. Just the opposite.

248
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,757
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

249
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:16,114
As in, that's interesting. With enough clues
it's possible to figure these things out.

250
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,589
Even if you don't think it's real?

251
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,595
I don't know what's real and what isn't.
That's never been my strong suit.

252
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,993
But if you've had to give up the life
you were living, it's worth trying to fix.

253
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,709
- Maybe I can help you do that.
- What would you do?

254
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
We. We would try several things,
but I need to see you a lot.

255
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,197
I don't know. I barely made it today.

256
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,714
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
We'll take it slow. You'll handle it.

257
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,793
I don't think I can afford it.
I don't want my dad paying.

258
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,791
We'll work it out.

259
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
You have the best answer for everything.

260
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,112
You seem so hopeful.
Are you always this sunny?

261
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,390
No one ever thought so.

262
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,995
- You must bring it out.
- Hmm.

263
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,551
I'm so happy that you came.

264
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,836
I'm so glad you invited me.

265
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,468
Sorry everything's in such an uproar.

266
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,510
Lots of big occasions coming up
and Christmas... is only eight months away.

267
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,435
I don't know what's keeping Jeremy.
He stays in the city three nights a week.

268
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,238
I guess I explained that.

269
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,439
I know Katie's here,
but I am not so sure about Martin.

270
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,110
I'm making dinner myself tonight,
so I'll have to leave you, I'm afraid.

271
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,312
I'm awful,
but could you please help yourself?

272
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,476
I just got a new copper saucière and it'll be
the death of us if I don't get back in there.

273
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,470
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- You must be Katie.

274
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,870
Come here.

275
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,031
Quick! Come on.

276
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,238
Smith & Hawken, Scully & Scully,
Cuddledown, Linen & Lace,

277
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Plow & Hearth, Victoria's Secret,

278
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,236
Wolferman's, Neiman Marcus,

279
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,392
Coldwater Creek, Norm Thompson, J Crew,

280
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,553
Sharper Image, Garnet Hill,
Hammacher Schlemmer.

281
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,711
You must be Martin.

282
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,188
- Is this him?
- I showed him.

283
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,670
Do you get it now? This is no joke.

284
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,116
Hi, kids.

285
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,477
Ah, hi! Jeremy Brockett.

286
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,315
- You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford.
- Nice to meet you.

287
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,792
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was a motherfucker. Have a drink.

288
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,393
It's exciting when it all comes to me.

289
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,951
Sometimes I order double
so I can see what I'll send for gifts.

290
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,432
- So now I have two of everything!
- Think you're gonna like this.

291
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,353
You know much about Cuban cigars?

292
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,873
Nope.

293
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,151
I'll be back.

294
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,118
Makes the whole thing that much better.

295
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,670
Hold the flame a little bit below the end.

296
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,515
That's it. Now turn it slowly while you draw.

297
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,035
- You a man who likes to treat himself right?
- I've had my moments.

298
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,877
I am and I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody's
last words were, "I treated myself too well. "

299
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,555
"I should have spent more time at the office. "

300
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,350
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office.
You only go round once.

301
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,671
So, like the Zens say, "Be here now. "

302
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,631
- What do you do?
- Althea didn't tell you?

303
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,394
We've been talking about her, mostly.

304
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,032
Well, in '85, four of us left our firms and
formed an investment banking venture.

305
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,318
- We have 23 people working for us now.
- You've done well.

306
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,792
We've done very well.
You know anything about addiction, Doc?

307
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,959
A little.

308
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,592
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say, when
you're in the red zone, you gotta score.

309
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,274
So, what do you think?

310
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,878
- Tastes good.
- No. I mean about Althea.

311
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,190
About her... behavior.

312
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,672
- Think you can fix her up?
- What do you think's wrong with her?

313
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,913
She's gone weird, is what's wrong.
She's out of control.

314
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,039
Probably from living out here
in Mayberry RFD.

315
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,712
But you're the doctor. What do you think?

316
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,553
She seems very unhappy.

317
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,598
I think we all knew that, Professor.

318
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,480
The question, the real questionie is why?

319
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,149
- Do you know how to drive?
- Sure.

320
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,311
Got a license?

321
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,679
- But no car?
- Don't need it.

322
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,308
I just got my license two weeks ago.

323
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,517
- You're good.
- I been driving since I was 12.

324
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,318
That would explain it.

325
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,952
- Can you help Mom?
- I'm trying.

326
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,037
Got to.

327
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,351
Nessa Watkins, she comes to you,
doesn't she?

328
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,511
You're treating her, right?

329
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,196
- What's wrong with her?
- Is she a friend of yours?

330
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,828
No. Sort of.

331
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,914
She's so screwed up. Always
starving herself when she's already skinny.

332
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,835
She could be cool, but all she does
is get wrecked and do all the guys.

333
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,993
A person's gotta hate themselves
to act like that.

334
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,713
You ever met a bigger shithead
than my stepfather?

335
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,358
- Thanks, Martin.
- Ainge! Ainge!

336
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,632
- Ainge!
- That's OK. Jeremy won't mind.

337
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,392
Do we run into the street?
No, I didn't think so.

338
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,994
Nice car! How's that place?

339
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,196
It's a pretty piece of land.

340
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,920
- And the Brocketts?
- Horror show.

341
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,278
- What did you do tonight?
- It was insane around here, man.

342
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,635
I had to call in the National Guard.

343
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,509
- Then I did my laundry and watched "20/20".
- And...?

344
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,151
It was shocking. Did you know
that the government is wasteful?

345
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,237
You heard it here first. And being a
supermodel, Mumford, is no walk in the park.

346
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,678
- Why do you watch?
- There's no gentleman caller, Doc.

347
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,549
Not that I care. I've had it with men.

348
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,837
They're so fascinated by their own crap.

349
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,470
It took me four years to get the last one out.

350
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,991
These days, my idea of a hot date
is a long shower by myself before bed.

351
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,914
Now that, that feels good!

352
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,432
And you don't have to do all that listening.

353
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,474
Sorry, that's very insensitive.
I guess that's the story of your life.

354
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,313
- I'm not making any promises.
- We can turn back any time.

355
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,869
Oh, boy, this should be interesting.

356
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,159
Mother, I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.

357
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,757
- Mumford? Like the town?
- Yes. It's a pleasure meeting you.

358
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,832
- What's happening?
- We're going for a walk.

359
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,629
- Do you think it's a good idea?
- Dr. Mumford does.

360
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,794
I've put myself completely in his hands...
for today, anyway.

361
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,714
- What kind of doctor are you?
- PhD, psychologist.

362
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,075
Oh, not a real doctor.

363
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,189
- That's right, the fake kind.
- We better go, or I'm liable to bail out.

364
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,476
Nice meeting you.

365
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,671
Mom's such a cutie (!)

366
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,673
Usually people don't hate me
till they know me.

367
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,593
- You caught her in a good mood.
- Wow.

368
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,276
Doesn't bother me any more.
It's my dad and brother I worry about.

369
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,592
Maybe, but you're the one
whose ass is dragging.

370
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,390
- Is that the technical description?
- Is she against you getting help?

371
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,597
- We don't discuss it.
- Something's bothering her.

372
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,436
We've all disappointed her.
Me, especially, but my dad, of course.

373
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,434
She thinks my brother's OK,
but she didn't expect much.

374
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,434
It's what happens
when you "marry beneath yourself".

375
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,398
- Please forgive me.
- What?

376
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,556
Negative thinking makes everything difficult.
We have to talk only about positive things.

377
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,789
OK, then. Are you positive
your mother's a bitch?

378
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,271
Just kidding.

379
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,835
- Is this the treatment?
- Sorry.

380
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,391
'Cause, I'll tell ya,
none of the others have tried this approach.

381
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,230
- Just do it.
- I want you to tell me all your symptoms.

382
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,915
- I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
- Be specific.

383
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,315
I'm tired all the time, obviously.
But then if I try to sleep, I have trouble.

384
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,393
My muscles ache, and my joints.
I feel like an old person.

385
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,394
Or like I did
back when I used to work out too hard.

386
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,879
What else?

387
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,678
- Sore throat?
- Uh-huh.

388
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,118
Low-grade fever, painful lymph glands...

389
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,159
Irritability? Forgetfulness? Depression?

390
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,039
Yes, yes and definitely yes.

391
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,791
Also, I get confused.

392
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,669
Yeah. Most people have that.
It's confusing here.

393
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,673
- Where?
- Life.

394
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,317
Did I mention the headaches?

395
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,153
- Did you get headaches before?
- Yeah.

396
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,197
More now? Or more severe?

397
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,194
They're about the same.
My marriage was one long headache!

398
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,150
The headaches may not
even be a part of this.

399
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,950
- I can give myself a headache instantly.
- Is that like a party trick?

400
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,999
All I need is
two conflicting thoughts at the same time.

401
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,073
Like I'll think,
"Taking these walks will help Sofie. "

402
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,951
Then I think, "Mumford, you just enjoy it.
You're kidding yourself about the benefits".

403
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,759
There. I've given myself a real whopper.

404
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,629
You actually address yourself by name
in your thoughts?

405
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,474
You think two opposing ideas
in your head causes damage?

406
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,749
Sometimes, yeah. Pulling in two different
directions makes tiny tears in our fabric.

407
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,912
Then my life has been
some kind of huge rip.

408
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,795
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey, Doc.

409
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,350
We're not supposed
to get together until Thursday...

410
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,114
That's all right. What's on your mind?

411
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,279
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?

412
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,990
Six. And it's been good.

413
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,709
Like we're two buddies,
hanging out, shooting the shit.

414
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,199
Yeah.

415
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,793
This is really hard.
Everything I wanna say is hard.

416
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,270
We're like friends, almost,
who trust each other.

417
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,638
I wanna tell you something,
but I need to ask you a question.

418
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,032
For me to tell you this thing...
I haven't told anybody about it.

419
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,078
It's the biggest secret I've got.

420
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,199
Sometimes it's best
to keep a few things for ourselves.

421
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,990
- You're a shrink. Can't I tell you everything?
- It's just a thought.

422
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,948
That relates to what I wanna ask you.

423
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,591
I've noticed that sometimes,
when we're hanging out,

424
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,799
throwing the ball or when we went bowling,
sometimes you'll...

425
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,232
...tell me things about your other patients.

426
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,269
Maybe that's all right. I don't know much
about psychology or therapy or ethics.

427
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,477
So, maybe there's something I missed.

428
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,154
You're concerned I can't be trusted.

429
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,437
I trust you. Definitely. No question.

430
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,357
But I'm concerned. You're not meant to tell
anyone your patients' problems, are you?

431
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,431
That is correct, Skip.
I'm gonna have to take a long look at that.

432
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,590
- OK, then. What I was gonna tell you...
- Knowing what you just said...

433
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,276
I trust you. You've listened to me
better than anybody, maybe ever.

434
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,638
- This secret, I can't stand it any more.
- OK.

435
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,198
I'll tell you as simple and direct as I can.

436
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,716
You understand this is a big secret,
between us?

437
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,998
You know I've got this gift
for certain kinds of machines?

438
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,879
You are Panda, monarch of modems.

439
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,952
Even though I make
23% of the world's modems,

440
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,352
I cannot make a connection
with a woman who could love me.

441
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,876
- Let's say that for now.
- It's true. Believe me.

442
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,956
So, do you know what I've been doing,
all alone in my workshop for two years?

443
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,399
Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill-It.
How I spend my every solitary hour?

444
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,357
Guess.

445
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,872
Go ahead. Guess.

446
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,757
- Jerking off?
- No! Although that's a good guess.

447
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,834
No, what I've been working on,
what no one has been able to create:

448
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,512
A virtually lifelike humanoid,

449
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,911
gender specific, anatomically functional...

450
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,439
...sexual surrogate slash companion.

451
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,199
- Slash what?
- Sexual surrogate slash companion.

452
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,157
- A doll?
- No, Doc, not a doll!

453
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,393
I am Panda Modem.
I'm talking about much more than a doll.

454
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,031
The world has never seen what
I'm talking about except in the movies.

455
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,199
- How's it coming?
- You don't think I'm insane?

456
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,480
- That's your secret, like a trade secret?
- No, Doc, a private secret.

457
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,350
It's psychotic. It's pitiful.
What am I? Dr. Frankenstein?

458
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,157
- Aren't you repulsed?
- Sounds like a good idea.

459
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
- Really?
- Definitely.

460
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,638
Skip... that's not much of a secret.

461
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,153
It's not?

462
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,029
It's OK. It's just not something
to be ashamed of.

463
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,034
Maybe you don't want people knowing,
and it's safe with me,

464
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,876
but on the scale of dirty little secrets,
it'd give it a two.

465
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,509
You wanna know a secret?

466
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,989
I'll tell you a secret. This is just between us.

467
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,510
The secret, Skip, is this:

468
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,670
I am not now, nor have I ever been...

469
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,872
a psychologist.

470
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,708
We'd better get going. Just follow my light
and, Skip, watch your step.

471
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,556
- Who else knows?
- Just you.

472
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,076
It's time you did some talking, Dr. Mum...

473
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,198
Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?

474
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,068
Damn! What is your name?

475
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,033
- It doesn't matter. Call me Doc.
- It matters to me.

476
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,830
- I've told you a lot of private stuff.
- I can tell you anything else.

477
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,117
What about everything else?
How did this happen?

478
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,718
Every species of mammal has found some
way to drug, inebriate or anaesthetize itself,

479
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,111
even if it's just banging its head
against a rock.

480
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,398
Seems to be some natural urge
to get away for a while.

481
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,478
I've had it for as long as I can remember.

482
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,518
<i>When I got a scholarship to go to college,</i>

483
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,195
<i>I was the first in my family</i>
<i>to go beyond high school. </i>

484
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:22,118
<i>My folks looked like a normal couple, which</i>
<i>they were 10% of the time, out in public. </i>

485
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,393
<i>My roommate was from a planet</i>
<i>I had never heard of, called Scarsdale. </i>

486
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,596
Come on in, bro!

487
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,832
<i>The other kids</i>
<i>seemed to know things I didn't. </i>

488
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,879
In four years, I never got over feeling
that I'd sneaked in

489
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,431
and was about to be exposed
as the hillbilly and impostor I was.

490
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,038
<i>The thing that always made those feelings</i>
<i>go away was fun: Drugs, sex. </i>

491
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,593
<i>The only problem I had with degenerate</i>
<i>behavior was I couldn't get enough of it. </i>

492
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,915
<i>Over the next few years,</i>
<i>I had some challenging jobs. </i>

493
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,514
Pump jockey, pizza delivery,
pipe fitting, pest control.

494
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,913
Lots of jobs that started with a P.
For some reason, I kept losing these jobs.

495
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,914
Eventually, doing all these jobs,
I noticed something.

496
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,232
For some reason,
probably because I was too stoned to talk,

497
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,278
everywhere I went, people would talk to me.

498
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,432
My brother started molesting me.

499
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,989
<i>They'd tell me everything. </i>

500
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,311
My real dad? Who have I been living with?

501
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,393
<i>Their problems, their innermost thoughts. </i>

502
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,192
<i>Sometimes they'd pretend they needed</i>
<i>advice, but most wanted someone to listen. </i>

503
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,432
Told you she left me?
She'd just eat away at me.

504
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,072
Anyway, one day I was spraying
for termites, when I had a vision.

505
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,198
<i>It was time to use my degree</i>
<i>and get a job with a desk. </i>

506
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,911
<i>I took the civil service exam</i>
<i>and found myself working at the IRS,</i>

507
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,231
<i>district 14, Central Administrative Office. </i>

508
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,676
<i>I started as a clerk,</i>
<i>but I took advancement tests. </i>

509
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,559
<i>There was more money to be made. </i>

510
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,599
It appealed to me because,
though I was sure I could stop any time,

511
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,231
I had developed an addiction to cocaine -
the best hobby I ever had.

512
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,356
That is allowed!

513
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,833
<i>But I didn't wanna be a revenue officer</i>
<i>where you were getting abused all day. </i>

514
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,515
<i>And being one of the collection cowboys</i>
<i>had no appeal. </i>

515
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,231
<i>But there was one job</i>
<i>that looked like it might be fun: Investigator. </i>

516
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,472
Your last job
before becoming a psychologist

517
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,076
was an investigator
for the Internal Revenue Service?

518
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,438
- Everybody has a story.
- Seems like you got the variety pack.

519
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,958
What it felt like was a series
of separate, unconnected lives.

520
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,394
Every time I left a life, it felt good.
Whatever problems I had were gone.

521
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,635
I had no friends, didn't talk to my family.
The only constant force in my life was drugs.

522
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,439
An IRS investigator with a drug problem.

523
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,434
<i>I got teamed</i>
<i>with this fanatic named Gregory. </i>

524
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,515
<i>He always got his man, whether</i>
<i>they deserved it or not. He was a closer. </i>

525
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,038
<i>Then the collection guys would clean up. </i>
<i>Our specialty was sleazy skulking. </i>

526
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,830
<i>We were a great team. I was a dope addict</i>
<i>and Gregory was insane. </i>

527
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,074
<i>Him being insane didn't make it OK</i>
<i>that I fell in love with his wife, Candy. </i>

528
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,992
<i>(SKIP) Holy shit!</i>

529
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,833
Get to know your therapist.

530
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,709
- You were messed up, man!
- Things got a lot worse.

531
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,873
<i>The way to get money out of taxpayers</i>
<i>is to intimidate them,</i>

532
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,149
<i>which meant building up a convincing case</i>
<i>whether they'd done anything wrong or not. </i>

533
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,838
<i>Our manager was pushing us hard to make</i>
<i>a case against a furniture maker, Warris. </i>

534
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,072
<i>Gregory started acting</i>
<i>more and more irrational. </i>

535
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,633
<i>We were breaking into their warehouse,</i>
<i>files, doing things that were over the line. </i>

536
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,475
<i>Looking back, I'm sure</i>
<i>Gregory knew about Candy and me. </i>

537
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,234
<i>It probably made him even crazier. </i>

538
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,996
<i>What was scary was, on our team,</i>
<i>I had become the responsible one. </i>

539
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,274
<i>When the case looked like collapsing,</i>

540
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,752
<i>the manager put the squeeze</i>
<i>on Warris's accountant, Gorbeck. </i>

541
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,436
<i>Few accountants have nothing</i>
<i>to worry about. Gorbeck decided to help. </i>

542
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:33,152
<i>Warris said he'd done nothing wrong</i>
<i>and threatened to fight it all the way. </i>

543
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,630
<i>He didn't expect his accountant</i>
<i>to turn on him. </i>

544
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,189
<i>The manager stepped up the pressure. </i>

545
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,069
We didn't know
that Edmund Warris had a story, too.

546
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,358
He'd been fighting
chronic depression for 30 years.

547
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,035
<i>During the investigation,</i>
<i>he fell off his medication. </i>

548
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,309
<i>One Tuesday morning, he went down</i>
<i>to the factory, wrote his family a letter... </i>

549
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,273
<i>then used a. 9mm automatic</i>
<i>they kept there to kill himself. </i>

550
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,559
<i>The district manager decided to blame us. </i>

551
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,110
<i>He started proceedings</i>
<i>to get rid of Gregory and me. </i>

552
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,113
<i>Gregory went home drunk</i>
<i>and beat up Candy. </i>

553
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,757
<i>Candy said she didn't wanna see me again. </i>
<i>She hated us and was leaving us both. </i>

554
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,480
<i>It made perfect sense to me. </i>

555
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,633
<i>A decent man was dead</i>
<i>and some of it was my fault. </i>

556
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,238
<i>Whatever this was, it felt like... the bottom. </i>

557
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,591
<i>I wanted to leave, too, just like Candy,</i>
<i>get as far away from... </i>

558
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,195
<i>... me as possible. </i>

559
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,751
And so you did.

560
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,309
- And the drugs?
- Harder than I thought.

561
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,711
<i>On my third try,</i>
<i>I found a place in the desert</i>

562
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,440
<i>that was run by an order of monks. </i>

563
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,238
<i>And it worked. </i>

564
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,236
What about the name? Mumford. Why pick
the name of the town you were going to?

565
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,076
You got it backwards. I had the name
when I started looking for a place.

566
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,755
When I saw the town on a map,
I thought it was a sign.

567
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,630
<i>See, Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's</i>
<i>kindergarten class with me. </i>

568
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,669
<i>He was killed with his parents</i>
<i>on their way back from a Steelers' game. </i>

569
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,595
<i>He was only six. </i>
<i>There's a birth certificate but not much else. </i>

570
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,228
<i>(SKIP) A birth certificate is enough?</i>

571
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,790
<i>It all flows from that. </i>
<i>What doesn't can be purchased. </i>

572
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,875
<i>My IRS training helped. There's not much</i>
<i>data you can't access and use. </i>

573
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,233
<i>In a free society,</i>
<i>you are who you say you are. </i>

574
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,632
<i>If you've screwed up one life,</i>
<i>sometimes you get another shot. </i>

575
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,677
Be back.

576
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,868
But you studied psychology?
Did the training, just never get the degree?

577
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,634
- No. No training.
- Psych major?

578
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,358
English Lit.

579
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,875
Jeez, man! But you're good at it.

580
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,512
I understand what it's like to wanna leave
a problem behind. That's all people want.

581
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,319
Mainly, I listen.

582
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,236
(RUNNING WATER)

583
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,791
- Somebody's taking a shower down there.
- That'd be Lily.

584
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,353
I wish I could live in the shower.
I'd take five a day, if I had the time.

585
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,638
I went to this spa in Germany
up on this mountain.

586
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,635
- The great thing, they kept you wet all day.
- Who'd you go with?

587
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,915
That's not good.

588
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,229
So, we get onto this steam-engine train
that runs up into the mountains,

589
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,517
and this trip is everything
it's supposed to be.

590
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,233
We're chugging along in this open car,
great views, mountain air blowing through.

591
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,358
We'd been married, at this point, four years.

592
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:34,152
He turns to me and for a second
he looked the way he did when we first met,

593
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,757
and he says how he likes it better
when I wear my hair back.

594
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,191
That wasn't so good.

595
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,951
You're doing great.

596
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,397
- Don't know if I'll make it the whole way.
- It doesn't matter. Go on.

597
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,237
This makes me sound irrational, but
there was something about him saying this.

598
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,794
It was the millionth time he'd told me about
some preference, and I was so tired of it.

599
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,398
Seems like my whole life someone has been
telling me I'm just not getting it right.

600
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,596
Can we rest for a second?

601
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,558
You're purposely
making me talk while we do this,

602
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,678
because you think this is good for me.

603
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,310
- And you're a sadistic bastard.
- Yes.

604
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,233
Who thinks there's nothing wrong with me.

605
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,599
There's something wrong, especially
after hearing about your Roto-Rooter dream.

606
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,718
- That was pretty bad.
- Disgusting.

607
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,792
I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing?

608
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,919
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.

609
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,073
I hate those dreams
where everything means something.

610
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,797
- Is that when you split up?
- No.

611
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,636
A good story, but it was just the beginning.
We went on for a year.

612
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,351
- Whose route is this?
- Brady Peck's. 14 years old. Lives next door.

613
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,036
- And he's where?
- Down state at Jamboree, five days. Why?

614
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,760
A gal could make a living doing this.

615
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,276
How hard could it be
squeezing out some 14-year-old?

616
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,874
- You like it?
- It's all right.

617
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,793
Then expect me tomorrow morning at 5.30.

618
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,080
- This is legitimate therapy?
- Hell, no. I just don't wanna do it alone.

619
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,156
There's no way this behavior
can be seen as anything

620
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,630
but completely inappropriate
and unprofessional.

621
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,997
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your businesses...

622
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,151
- Practices.
- Whatever.

623
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,790
Six months ago,
you were the only shrinks in town.

624
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,317
I'm a psychiatrist. Dr. Sheeler
is a psychologist, like Dr. Mumford.

625
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,755
Oh, that's fascinating.

626
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,995
My point is, the value of your practices
could be seriously undermined by this bozo.

627
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,799
There are only so many head cases.

628
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,635
- What would you have us do, Lionel?
- Protect your turf.

629
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,792
Check this guy out. I smell a rat.

630
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,511
Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco
shares my gratitude for your concern,

631
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,434
but you misunderstand
our calling to mental health.

632
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,674
We're not in some widget business
trying to crush our competition.

633
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,229
What the hell is a widget?

634
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,229
Why do I waste my time?

635
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,391
What an asshole!

636
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,431
Ernest, what do you think?

637
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,037
I think he's got a point.

638
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,359
<i>I found work my first day out, down</i>
<i>at old man Sutter's gas station and diner. </i>

639
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,270
<i>Back at the boarding house,</i>
<i>I heard a load of yelling</i>

640
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,230
<i>and I got my first look</i>
<i>at the landlady's daughter. </i>

641
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,392
Don't walk away from me, young lady!

642
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,952
<i>Lucky for me she was plenty upset</i>
<i>but not too careful. </i>

643
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,237
<i>Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all. </i>

644
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,719
(DOC) Mr. Follett.

645
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,873
<i>For I saw the beginning</i>
<i>of a vixen's smile and I knew... </i>

646
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,600
- Henry!
- What?

647
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,274
- Stop now.
- Why? I'm paying for this.

648
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,716
- Not me, you're not.
- You find it distasteful.

649
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,872
Doesn't matter how I feel. It's how you feel.

650
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,430
I enjoy it. Does that make me
some kind of deviant?

651
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,071
- Just because I have a rich imagination?
- You didn't come for that.

652
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,915
- No?
- You came because it's taking over.

653
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,799
- You're in its grip.
- I never said that.

654
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,671
Where's your wife, Henry?

655
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,271
- Where's your wife?
- Go to hell.

656
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,431
I didn't hear you.

657
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,592
I thought we were talking about me.

658
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,791
We got divorced.

659
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,637
I had to get rid of her.
She couldn't satisfy me.

660
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,392
What?

661
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,514
I was never satisfied.

662
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,875
Now we're back on track.

663
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,268
- (MUMBLES)
- What's that?

664
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,271
You are so mean.

665
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,394
- That is such a wicked look.
- (DOC) What is it, Nessa?

666
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,235
(NESSA) Look at those legs.
This chick is 12 feet tall!

667
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,710
That's the body I'm getting. I've ordered it.

668
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,589
Whoa! This dress
has to be surgically applied.

669
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,593
Where is this beach
where everyone has good teeth?

670
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,878
- What do you want me to see?
- Just chill for a second.

671
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,397
Look at this guy. Gorgeous,
although clearly not of this earth.

672
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,950
Excellent pecs, mutant cheekbones...

673
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,272
Where are you going? I'm showing you
something. I just need to find the thing.

674
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,036
- If you don't want a session, it's OK.
- I wanna have the session.

675
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,399
I thought I'd show you things that interest
me. We could share, as they say.

676
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,120
But I guess not, which we already knew.

677
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,840
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

678
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,915
- Did something happen at school?
- These appointments were not my idea.

679
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,469
True. Should we stop them?

680
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,835
I don't think
you know what you're talking about.

681
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,155
This shrink school you went to,
did you hear about it on an infomercial?

682
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,750
I wanna live in the world
that these people are in.

683
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,754
No one ever says anything in there.
Have you noticed? So they're all very cool.

684
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,309
Like they're all really deep.

685
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,638
It's when people start talking
that everything goes to shit.

686
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,551
There's this kid at school - Martin Brockett.

687
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:10,032
He has some gigantic idea of himself
that no one else shares.

688
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,115
You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me.
Who appointed him my guide?

689
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,912
If he has everything so figured out,
how come his best friend's a. 22 rifle?

690
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,308
And why does he spend all his time
chasing after me?

691
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,918
- Probably thinks I'll give him a hummer.
- Do you think that's what he wants?

692
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,071
No.

693
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,710
I don't know what he wants,
but I know I don't like being watched.

694
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,431
No one's ever paid any attention
to what I did and I liked it fine.

695
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,752
Where does he get off telling me
I disrespect myself? Fuck him!

696
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,275
Look in the mirror, bozo!

697
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,117
(GREETS THEM IN JAPANESE)

698
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,077
Hello. Good to see you.

699
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,231
I'm Lily.

700
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,351
What's the deal?

701
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,950
Hey. They come through several times
a year. Good to see you again!

702
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,193
- Where am I supposed to eat?
- You're on your own today.

703
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,678
Skip!

704
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,548
- Hey, Doc.
- I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.

705
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,678
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Me too.

706
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,035
- I was at your house.
- Oh?

707
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,433
Upstairs with Doc. It's a very nice place.
I heard your shower.

708
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,512
I see you going by on your board.
You're so young to be so...

709
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,319
- What?
- So rich?

710
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,436
So accomplished.

711
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,388
I may be young, but Doc can tell you,
I'm very immature.

712
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,952
- So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
- I'd better go. Sorry.

713
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:19,638
- That's a lot of people all at once.
- They pre-order. Choice of three entrées.

714
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,711
What are they?

715
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,156
Meatloaf, turkey quesadillas
and Salade Niçoise.

716
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,757
- Salad Niçoise? I love Salade Niçoise!
- You do?

717
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,639
- Well... Come on in.
- Far out!

718
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,231
Dr. Mumford.

719
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:50,677
- Dr. Delbanco. Nice to see you again.
- This is Dr. Sheeler, the other therapist here.

720
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,071
- I've heard great things about you.
- Thank you.

721
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,631
You never got back to me.
We'd like to take you out for a meal.

722
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,635
- Kind of a professional welcome.
- Forgive me, please. We must do that.

723
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,554
- When?
- I'll call you when I have my calendar.

724
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,269
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Right now?

725
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,754
...annihilation anxieties
because of a depriving mother,

726
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,276
but either way,
no one can escape the fear of death.

727
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,399
It is, as William James put it,
"the worm at the core".

728
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:33,750
Try as we may to ignore our own mortality,
"the skull will grin in at the banquet".

729
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,672
I've run on. We're here to talk about you.

730
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,831
Are we?

731
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:49,033
What Ernest means, I think, is
we're very interested in other methodology.

732
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,636
We're great believers
in learning from each other.

733
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,076
I've learned so much from Ernest.
Dr. Delbanco.

734
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,798
And I from Phyllis.

735
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,509
So, the University of Kentucky,
who runs the programme?

736
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,355
My mentor was an amazing teacher
named Benton Mandlebaum.

737
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,195
Died quite tragically
in the collapse of a gazebo.

738
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,874
Your extended training
was at an institution in that area?

739
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,917
Lots of institutions.

740
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:22,076
My graduate advisor believed we should
experience prisons, clinics, halfway houses.

741
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,233
For a while I was chief therapist
at a shopping mall.

742
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,554
- Interesting approach. What was his name?
- Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman.

743
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,395
She passed last year in a train wreck.

744
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,516
Damned Amtrak.

745
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:49,156
I trained in the east. Cornell. Whatever
anyone says, there are regional differences.

746
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,756
I found the state certification exams
here harrowing.

747
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,436
Oh, yeah, very tough, but I guess that's good.
Keep out the quacks.

748
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,912
- Which examiner did you have?
- Wallace Franklin from Greensburg.

749
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,877
That was a terrible thing.

750
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,794
I don't know why hang-gliding
is even considered a sport.

751
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:17,710
We're interested in new therapies.
How would you characterize your approach?

752
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,158
- My approach?
- Yes, your particular approach.

753
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,508
I don't have one, really.
Most of the time, I'm faking it.

754
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,389
There's not much that can be done
about most problems.

755
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,358
They're too deep-rooted
by the time I hear them.

756
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,559
The most I can do, usually,
is look and listen real closely

757
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,952
and try to catch some glimpse
of the secret life everybody's got.

758
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,513
If I can get a sense of that, then maybe,
just maybe I can help them a little.

759
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,198
I see.

760
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,829
- The argument had nothing to do with it.
- What was it about?

761
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,151
I'd ordered
the 100 greatest books ever written.

762
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,959
- What are they?
- All the great writers.

763
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,953
Shakespeare, Dickens, Moby Dick.
Those people.

764
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,716
- 100 books?
- It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with it.

765
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,474
- What happened?
- We argued on Sunday.

766
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,837
He went to work on Monday
and stayed in the city,

767
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,675
but on Thursday,
when he normally comes home, he didn't.

768
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,355
- He didn't call till Saturday.
- You were concerned.

769
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,117
It's happened before.
I am shocked by how little I'm feeling.

770
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,271
I don't understand this.

771
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,513
I'll probably have
a complete depressoid collapse soon.

772
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,114
- Won't I?
- Doubtful. What did he say?

773
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,071
He said he wasn't coming back. He said
it hadn't worked for him for quite a while.

774
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,629
Do you know what I regret the most?

775
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,475
I am sorry I let him
make the kids take his name!

776
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,428
He was an acquirer.
He liked to acquire things.

777
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,830
You think that has
something to do with my problem.

778
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,120
Ordering all those things.
Like I was on a campaign to out-acquire him.

779
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,115
If I was just an acquisition to him
and he lost interest once he had me...

780
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,636
Can't be it. It's too simple. And I still like it.

781
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,920
This morning,
I ordered a marble turtle cheeseboard.

782
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:30,359
Can I tell you something? You know how
assholes look at a woman with problems

783
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,671
and say,
"What she needs is a good schtupping!"

784
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,709
There may be something to that.
Jeremy didn't keep up his end.

785
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,394
What difference does it make?

786
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,356
Why do I feel elated?

787
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,630
Am I in denial?

788
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,075
You know what this feels like?

789
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,954
- Time's up, but I've gotta get this out.
- Take your time.

790
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,192
In high school, the thing that I wanted most,

791
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,194
the thing I was desperately
in pursuit of, was a hall pass.

792
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:11,117
I loved moving freely around the school
while everybody else was trapped in there.

793
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:19,233
That's how I feel right now,
like I have some giant all-day hall pass.

794
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,998
My God. Did it just get hot in here?

795
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,632
I'll see you next time.
I'll probably be a basket case by then.

796
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,794
- You can use the back if you like.
- No shame in getting a little therapy.

797
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,871
Hello, Mr. Follett.

798
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,591
Have a good session.

799
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,399
Henry?

800
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,311
Henry.

801
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,231
Hey, Doc!

802
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,189
Hey, Doc.

803
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,432
Thanks, Jennifer. I'll take him from here.

804
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,831
I'm glad you came.
I've never brought anyone down here before.

805
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,991
I'm honored.

806
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,079
It's just me, Dino.

807
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,713
Skip, I've got a problem and I need advice.

808
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,713
You want my advice?

809
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,871
Far out!

810
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,711
I hope nothing you're about to see
will shake your faith in me.

811
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,471
Pretty creepy, huh?

812
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,351
Are you totally disgusted?

813
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,795
Skip, you're a visionary.
That can be a burden.

814
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,916
This doesn't seem perverse?

815
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,197
Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.

816
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,754
<i>I'm really not comfortable here. </i>
<i>Can we go somewhere... more private?</i>

817
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,595
- It's not gonna be me. I'm giving it up.
- Really?

818
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,069
<i>Skip, you are so amazing!</i>

819
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:44,075
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours,
I've completely lost interest.

820
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,471
- What did I do?
- Lily.

821
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,749
Lily?

822
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,480
- That's great! You and Lily?
<i>- Far out!</i>

823
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:00,398
She doesn't know yet. Of the two of us,
I'm the only one in love, but I'm really stoked.

824
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,869
Doc, how can I be of help to you?

825
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,712
(MACHINE HUMS)

826
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,476
Sorry.

827
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,959
Wow.

828
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,396
- I'm here for you, Doc.
- Skip...

829
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,120
You know that it's improper, unethical,

830
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:25,229
for a psychologist to have a romantic
relationship with one of his patients?

831
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,234
- I guess that makes sense.
- Yes. Yes, it does.

832
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,913
You've fallen in love
with one of your patients?

833
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,159
- Doc, it's not me, is it?
- What?

834
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,470
No, Skip, it's not you, but I like you a lot.

835
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,355
Doc, what about this?

836
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,432
You're not really a licensed psychologist.

837
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,514
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help.
I see where you're going here. It's a mess.

838
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,599
Yep.

839
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,313
Everyone who could corroborate his story
has recently died some exotic death.

840
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,870
- They're neither recent nor exotic.
- They are dead.

841
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,237
And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.

842
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,188
It could happen.
The certification exams seem in order.

843
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,070
What's easier than hacking into a state
computer and putting in numbers?

844
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,755
- Maybe he didn't even take the exams.
- That's true.

845
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,115
I don't know it's that easy...

846
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:41,229
Doctor, it sounds like you've bought his story
hook, line and bull-twaddle!

847
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,996
You seem more disposed to him
than I understand. Did I miss something?

848
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,712
For God's sakes, we have no reason to
doubt him! Are we listening to Lionel now?!

849
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,120
Phyllis... Phyllis...

850
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,555
Phyllis.

851
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,875
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout.
- No, no. It is I who am sorry, Dr. Delbanco!

852
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,312
I am sorry to have wasted your time...
with such...

853
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,559
Phyllis...

854
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,991
Stop it! He's a kid. I'm old enough to be his...

855
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,595
...his big sister!

856
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:04,198
- Dr. Mumford. Please come on in.
- Hello. I was wondering if Sofie was around.

857
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:10,879
(TV) <i>The wood is different here. </i>
<i>It's not as consistent as it is in some events. </i>

858
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,430
- Did you have a session?
- It's spur-of-the-moment.

859
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,591
Look who's here!

860
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,194
- You've met Sofie's mother.
- Mrs. Crisp.

861
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,272
- We've met.
- And this is our son, Ben.

862
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,673
- It's a real honor. Have a seat.
- Actually, I can't. Could I see Sofie?

863
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,914
- I insist. I've been wanting to meet you.
- Sofie's not here.

864
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:38,234
Her friend from the city took her to dinner.
First time she's been willing.

865
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,437
We owe it to you. She has perked up a lot.

866
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,309
- What do you want?
- There's something we need to talk about.

867
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,959
- What?
- Elizabeth!

868
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,111
- We have a right.
- We do not!

869
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:54,070
- Keep it zipped, Ben!
- Is there something we need to know?

870
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:00,708
Yes, I guess I should tell you.
I don't think I can treat Sofie any more.

871
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,077
- Finally, some common sense.
- What do you mean?

872
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,117
- You know.
- No, I don't.

873
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,599
- You do.
- Tell me.

874
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,356
- Go to hell. It's a bunch of nonsense.
- I'm telling you, stop.

875
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,159
You're telling me? That's rich!

876
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,837
I'd better go.

877
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,913
Why can't you see Sofie?
The treatments are working.

878
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,117
- The problem is...
- You're a big fake!

879
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,636
You haven't got a clue
what's wrong with that girl.

880
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,349
- Wow, you're something.
- Take a hike, Dr. Quack.

881
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,149
Doctor, what is the problem?

882
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,399
Problem? Uh, I guess there is no problem.

883
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:51,752
- This friend, where did he take her?
- She. Roxy. I think they went to the Lantern.

884
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,673
Oh, Roxy. Excellent.

885
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,799
Roxy!

886
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,671
Hi. Is Mr. Follett around?

887
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,911
- What is it?
- It's a thought I had.

888
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,071
Should I open it now?

889
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,749
Let me say something.
I have no idea if this'll help.

890
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,037
What exactly is it supposed to do?

891
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,476
Some imagery is haunting you
and getting in your way.

892
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,474
- I don't necessarily agree.
- But you did come to me.

893
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,758
These images were burned
into your brain when you were young.

894
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,789
If we could nail down the exact fantasies,
maybe you could get past them.

895
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,275
- Anyway, I thought we'd try an experiment.
- The experiment's in here?

896
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,759
Yep.

897
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:30,509
I think this was a dumb idea. I just heard
myself and realized I'm unqualified for this.

898
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,114
- Let's just forget it.
- Whoa, whoa.

899
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,510
I wanna know what's in here.

900
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:40,117
There's no reason to think
this is gonna have any impact on you.

901
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:46,268
You don't know what you're talking about.
That's what I said all along.

902
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:52,356
I can guarantee that looking at the Lost Ark
here won't mean diddly to me.

903
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,919
But if you think I'll let you walk out
without seeing what's in this box,

904
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,753
then you don't know Henry A Follett.

905
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,390
- Mr. Follett?
- What?

906
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,870
What is so important
I can't have five minutes?

907
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:27,433
It's her, sir. You told me to get you
when she came to pick up her prescription.

908
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,153
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...
I really appreciate what you...

909
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,432
- I can't thank you enough.
- My pleasure.

910
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,911
I'll see you on...

911
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,039
Whatever.

912
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,514
- Hello, Henry.
- Hello, Mrs. Brockett.

913
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,750
Oh, please. Althea.

914
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,552
When I was in high school,
we used to come up here and make out.

915
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,553
- I liked to watch the sun go down.
- I like that.

916
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,678
- Which thing?
- Either one.

917
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,515
Why did you come to the house?

918
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,070
I thought I had something to tell you,
but I didn't.

919
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,233
- My brother said you were firing me.
- That's one way to put it.

920
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:42,997
I know what changed your mind. My mother.
She's so horrible, you couldn't desert me.

921
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,436
She made me appreciate your father.
He's my new hero.

922
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,955
He was, actually, a hero.

923
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:55,070
My dad, when he was in the coast guard,
risked himself to save three people.

924
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,357
I know why you were gonna quit seeing me.

925
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:05,189
You feel like a fake, an impostor,
as if you don't know what you are doing.

926
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:10,388
Everybody feels that way sometimes,
like we're not who we're supposed to be.

927
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,829
But, I have to tell you, Dr. Mumford,
you have been a tremendous help to me.

928
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,510
- Yeah?
- I admire you. You're very insightful.

929
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,989
I feel like you've seen me clearly.

930
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,392
I never used to admit how horrible
my mother is. You made that possible.

931
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,358
- That's good?
- Yes. And my ex-husband.

932
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,795
He never accepted me for who I was.

933
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,635
You've helped me understand
what a dick he is!

934
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,793
You're shockingly honest.
That's what makes you great.

935
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,954
I've never had a man treat me this way.
With you, I feel really listened to.

936
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:58,154
Can I tell you something? It's embarrassing,
but I feel unguarded with you.

937
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,675
Of course.

938
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,472
Thanks to this therapy...
I now know what I am looking for.

939
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,870
I need to find a man like you.

940
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,269
Not one who's treating me, of course.

941
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,558
And I'm gonna do it, damn it!
You have given me the confidence.

942
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,470
Sofie... that makes me very happy.

943
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,714
Doc, the dude is seriously deluded.
I said that to him.

944
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,556
"If you think I'll do that shit for you,
you are seriously deluded. "

945
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,633
- What did he say?
- He said, "Which we already knew. "

946
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,828
- What did he want you to do?
- First he tells me to stop smoking.

947
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,629
I told him, "Abso-fucking-lutely no",
as you can see.

948
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,519
Then he says stop smoking dope. No again.

949
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,434
Then he says he doesn't want me
going with any other guys.

950
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,070
What balls on this guy!
Are we going steady? Jesus!

951
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,153
- No again?
- I said I'd consider it.

952
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,676
The last thing was insane.

953
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,389
I don't know why,
but he wants me to give up magazines.

954
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,836
- Really?
- I don't know if I can quit.

955
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,470
We're gonna try it together,
like AA or something.

956
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:21,317
I made him give up his. 22. No more
sneaking round with this fucking nut gun.

957
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,790
- He agreed?
- He's pitiful, Doc, a goddamn puppy.

958
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,838
I don't know how long I can put up with it.

959

962
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,832

- How are you?

963
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,279

- I didn't notice you there. Can I help you?

966
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,992
My name's Gilroy.
I'm from the State Certification Board.

It's all right. It won't bite you.

970
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,074
- Do you wanna come in?
- No, thanks.

971
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,994
Plenty of time for that
when we're a little further along.

972
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,559
Mr. Gilroy?

973
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,356
- What brought this on?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

974
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:44,878
Sometimes it's just routine. Sometimes
it's a complaint. We'll be in touch.

975
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,519
When you said at lunch
about everybody having a secret life,

976
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,716
something snapped inside me.

977
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,476
I knew I could no longer continue
my relationship with Dr. Sheeler.

978
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,279
Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed.

979
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,468
What started as a genuine respect
for each other's professional abilities,

980
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,074
and became a personal attraction,

981
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:20,633
had somehow migrated
into a rather torrid sexual relationship that...

982
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:26,636
I won't get into that today, although, if we
continue these sessions, and I hope we will,

983
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,634
there are some aspects of that
I'd like to take a look at.

984
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,395
I've listened to enough people
giving me the juicy...

985
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,908
At any rate, I wanted to acknowledge the
catalyzing effect your comment had on me.

986
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:46,950
I just hope it doesn't come roiling back
upon you like some dreadful undertow.

987
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,713
- How do you mean?
- Well...

988
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,718
You see, when I broke it off with Phyllis,
she was upset,

989
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:01,432
and she became even more determined
to pursue certain doubts she's harbored.

990
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,433
- What kind of doubts?
- About you.

991
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,880
Your background, your qualifications.

992
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:12,397
I'm afraid Phyllis somehow
got you mixed up in her fury with me

993
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,711
and took the whole issue to the State Board.

994
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,279
I see.

995
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,874
- There's good news, though.
- What?

996
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,510
Phyllis has decided
to pursue her practice in the city,

997
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,990
which leaves you
the only psychologist in town.

998
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,436
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford?
Sorry to hear that.

999
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,990
As you can imagine,
my own feelings are mixed...

- Something is very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
- You're upset.

How intuitive. That must take
years of training right there.

- Is it something you've heard about me?

No, it is not something... Is there something
I should have heard about you?

Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

1048
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,711
- May I?
- Sure.

1049
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,793
I'm just gonna come right out and say this.

That's what your shrink is for,
to say what's bothering you.

First of all,
I have been feeling much better.

or if it's run its course,

than when I came to you.

- Given that...

- I'm not going to judge things properly.
- I don't follow you.

I'm saying
that since I am doing so much better,

1057
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,000
which I attribute to you, I am liable
to misinterpret some of my feelings.

1058

- And one concept I remember very well.
- What was that?

1063
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,877
Transference.

1064
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,351
- Transference.
- Yes, and that is what I have got right now.

1065
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:23,072
I have taken my feelings of gratitude
and relief and transferred them onto you.

1066
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,232
I have taken
all those warm, grateful emotions

1067
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,073
and confused them with feelings for you,

1068
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,674
so now I am under the delusion that...

1069
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,111

is to go walking in the woods

Do you understand how I might be resentful,

1078
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:19,840
knowing that this so-called love I'm feeling
is totally bogus

1079

Well, look who's here!

1137
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,198
- Good evening, Mrs. Crisp.
- Who is here?

1138
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,920
- Can I see Sofie, please?
- You cannot.

1139
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:01,438
I wouldn't know who to say it was. I saw
through you from the start, you impostor!

1140
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,309
- I know what you're after!
- Mother!

1141
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,109
- What do you think I'm after?
- Sofie! It's so obvious!

1142
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,078
You're after my daughter!

1143
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:19,033
I gotta say, Mrs. Crisp, you're right.

1144
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:25,196
- It'll never happen. You're in big trouble!
- Mother. Go away!

1145
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,958
- I guess you saw the show?
- Which show?

1146
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,793
- Sofie.
- Part of it.

1147
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,793
We were watching "ER" till someone called.

1148
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,315
You probably got the idea.

1149
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,112
- Do you know what a betrayal this is?
- Yes.

1150
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,034
- How violated I feel?
- Yes. You're not the only one.

1151
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,919
- You feel violated?
- Not me.

1152
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,914
My other patients.
I smelled tar and feathers on the way here.

1153
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,833
- You deserve it!
- You're right.

1154
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,991
I should be irate!

1155
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,472
I am irate!

1156
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,553
- But?
- But nothing!

1157
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:22,953
- This is a terrible thing you've done.
- Please believe me, I know that.

1158
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,596
There's just one thing I want you
to consider before you write me off.

1159
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,672
- What?
- Will you think about it?

1160
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,594
- I don't know. I'm in a bad mood.
- I love you...

1161
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,594
more than I've ever loved anyone
or anything in my life.

1162
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,078
Oh.

1163
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,994
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you,
my real life.

1164
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,993
But I don't know if you feel the same way.

1165
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,635
I sort of do.

1166
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:03,111
- But first you have to tell me something.
- Anything. Just ask.

1167
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,429
What is your name?

1168
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,756
The defendant will rise.

1169
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,631
Sit down, Lionel.

1170
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,314
Do you understand
how serious are these crimes?

1171
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,799
I do.

1172
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,954
Do you realize how insidious it is
to invade the most private thoughts

1173
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,157
and secret lives of unsuspecting people,

1174
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:33,077
people who have come to you with the faith
that you know what you're doing

1175
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,231
and are who you say you are?

1176
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,799
Yes, Your Honor.

1177
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,715
Many of your patients
have come forward with praise for you

1178
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,599
and your therapeutic skills.

1179
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,356
- That means nothing to me. Understand?
- Yes.

1180
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,913
I am frustrated
that the Criminal Code in this state

1181
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,152
allows a maximum sentence
of only six months

1182
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:02,313
and a maximum fine of only $2,000.

1183
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,391
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1184
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,634
- I'm sorry you're frustrated.
- Are you disrespecting this court?

1185
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,475
No, ma'am. I was empathizing. Sorry.

1186
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,518
Maybe you can empathize with this.

1187
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:22,118
Maximum fine, three months in jail,
three months house arrest.

1188
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,910
Sentence to begin immediately
at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility.

1189
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:30,470
Case closed. This court is adjourned.

1190
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,313
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.

1191
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:36,199
- Thanks, Lionel.
- Congratulations, Doc.

1192
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:39,272
- Mr. Crisp.
- I'll have him out in half the time.

1193
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,671
I'm very impressed by all that you've done.

1194
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,516
- You got off easy.
- Will you wait for me?

1195
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,796
We're only talking about weeks.

1196
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,110
- Will you be here?
- I'll be here.

1197
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:57,875
I haven't got the energy
to get out of town that fast.

1198
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,313
Get comfortable. We got a three-hour drive.

1199
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:10,199
I'm fine.

1200
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:13,591
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- No, not really.

1201
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,469
- But you do therapy?
- Not any more.

1202
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,074
You've helped people in this town?

1203
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,070
I couldn't really say,
but that's all over now.

1204
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,439
I tell you, Doc, the wife and I,
we got a bit of a problem.

1205
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,955
Mind if I just ran it by you?

1206
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,477
