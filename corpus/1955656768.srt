1
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:52,920
Maya! Maya!

2
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,356
Open the door!

3
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,758
Open the damn door!

4
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,035
Didn't I say I'm sorry, huh?

5
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,139
Damn it!

6
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,610
Maya, I'm so tired of your shit.

7
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm so tired of it.

8
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,422
How could you make
me do it again?

9
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,326
I love you, baby.

10
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,772
Listen to me.

11
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,133
Blush, floss, rinse,
repeat just to be sure.

12
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,136
Good dental hygiene
is very important.

13
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,061
If we move the couch,

14
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:32,866
the rug will last another
2 years, at least.

15
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:57,257
Bye, Grandma. I'll see
you at... lunch time.

16
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,453
Hello.

17
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,562
Why do you guys lock the freaking bathrooms?

18
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:12,900
You think we're gonna steal
your high-class toilet paper?

19
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,437
Hey, Magellan, you think
you can pick it up?

20
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,574
I got to pee like a racehorse.

21
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,864
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

22
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,704
Is anybody home?

23
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,475
I just wanted to use your phone.

24
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,154
Oh, my gosh.

25
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,601
Get out, asshole.

26
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,102
Get out!

27
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,564
You live in this thing?

28
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,777
I had to brush my teeth.

29
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,145
It's 10:30 am.

30
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,413
What's that?

31
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,948
It's a 1987 delivery truck,

32
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,483
manufactured my Chevy, V12.

33
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,551
The VIN number is 08027614.

34
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,154
Why is there a bed in it?

35
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,057
So I can sleep.

36
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,196
Are you - Are you angry?

37
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:33,533
I don't see angry very well.

38
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,768
Do you know who I am?

39
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,103
You're the lady with a gun.

40
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,237
Are you a boxer?

41
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,806
That lady at the house -

42
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,640
- is that your grandmother?

43
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,076
I can draw you a map if you
tell me where you're going.

44
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,379
Maps tell us nearly everything.

45
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,649
I'm Duncan. Nice to meet you.

46
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,051
Where are you going?

47
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,587
I'm going to freaking Sri Lanka.

48
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,589
Hmm, I don't have a map to there.

49
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,258
I'm in a hurry. Okay?

50
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,593
How can you be in a hurry
if you don't have a destination?

51
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,430
It's an expression.

52
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,664
I don't like expressions.

53
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,033
If you're gonna
be a pain in my ass,

54
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,368
you can just walk back
to town with your brush.

55
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,536
What do you mean?

56
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,872
I'm annoying you?

57
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,875
Am I hurting your butt?

58
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,847
Expressions.

59
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,016
I have to go to the bathroom.

60
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,551
I read it's bad to hold it in,

61
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,019
so I go 7 times a day.

62
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,422
In the summer I go
8 times.

63
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,725
It's time to make
lunch for Grandma.

64
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,661
Tuesday's wheat toast,
tuesday's a turkey sandwich.

65
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,063
She's, umm -

66
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,097
Turkey and Swiss cheese.

67
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,631
I have to go.

68
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,567
Can you - I don't know
how to drive my truck.

69
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,971
Can you - Can you -

70
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,572
I have 1 blue pill
and 2 purple pills.

71
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,907
Can you take me home?

72
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,541
I have to go to the bathroom

73
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,709
and I have to make a sandwich.

74
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,479
Yeah, okay!

75
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,584
Okay.

76
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,590
I'll drive you back there.

77
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,526
We can figure it out with
your grandmother, okay?

78
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,861
That's nice.

79
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,498
But, that's it. Get in the car.

80
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,043
I'm sorry.

81
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,878
Why?

82
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,881
About your grandmother.

83
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,183
What about her?

84
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,253
She died.

85
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,190
She was 82.

86
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,691
Based on current
census statistics,

87
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,061
she lived 23% longer
than the average person

88
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
in this part of the country.

89
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,033
That's good.

90
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,569
You're not sad?

91
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,242
Yes, it would have been
better if she lived 25% longer.

92
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,777
You're not gonna miss her?

93
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:08,956
I know the correct answer is yes.

94
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,993
Nice, Duncan.

95
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:46,994
Yes.

96
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,696
Nothing. Let's go.

97
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,815
911, what's your emergency?

98
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,052
Hello! 911, what
is your location?

99
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,794
Time to go to the bathroom.

100
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,527
You don't even like your mother.

101
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,263
We have gone this way -

102
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,970
Do you need one of these?

103
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,672
Do you have a blue one?

104
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,808
Thank you.

105
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,424
So, who's James Richards?

106
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,701
He sends his
money, but we can't visit.

107
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,703
Why?

108
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,974
We can't fit it all in.

109
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,209
Okay. You go this way,

110
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,477
you can travel this speed limit,

111
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,082
see your parents and still
get to Reno by Friday.

112
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,059
James Richards, is he your dad?

113
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,094
Yes.

114
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,462
We should find him.

115
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,463
I have to eat now.

116
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,730
I have to eat food right now.

117
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,666
Keep your voice down.

118
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,534
I was already supposed
to have food inside me.

119
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,471
Hey!

120
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,155
This is a family establishment.

121
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,990
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

122
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,593
I've had a really, really bad day

123
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,894
and you don't want
to make it worse.

124
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,129
Look, young lady.

125
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,830
Do I look like a lady to you?

126
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,899
My friend is on a schedule

127
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,768
and he needs to eat right now.

128
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,670
And as soon as we're
done, we'll go.

129
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,240
We don't want any trouble.

130
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,712
Get off of him! Stop!

131
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,889
I need more paper.

132
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,259
He likes to draw,

133
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,861
so we're gonna take
some paper towels too.

134
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,862
Anybody have a
problem with that?

135
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,930
Can I take both of them?

136
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,232
Yep.

137
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,612
This better get a whole
lot easier real soon.

138
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,881
Are you sad?
- I need you to act like a normal person

139
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,784
for like 5 minutes
and not freak out.

140
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:09,822
We just need to find your dad.
Do you know where he is?

141
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,168
Please slow down.

142
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,071
I get motion sickness, is why -

143
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,939
That's why I walk, I don't -

144
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,509
That's why we don't
drive the truck.

145
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,878
Thank you.

146
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,684
Were there potholes?

147
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,162
Where are you going?

148
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:52,732
I'm going to a place
I know, to see somebody.

149
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,147
This things been
blinking for like a hour

150
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,783
and I have no idea
where a gas station is.

151
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,151
There's one coming up on the right,

152
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,921
but I don't think we're -

153
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,925
No way. Come on!

154
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,493
Yep.

155
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,454
You gonna get out
and help me or what?

156
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,989
Help you do what?

157
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,459
Just get your ass
out here, right now.

158
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,500
Come on, Duncan, just push.

159
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,706
We have to have, like, a plan B.

160
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,608
How many plans are there?

161
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,143
Is plan B better than plan A?

162
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,113
Does plan B include food?

163
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,019
Okay, look, we're just
gonna go to the gas station,

164
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,889
get the gas container
and bring it back here.

165
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,890
Okay? Let's go.

166
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,558
I can't leave the truck.

167
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,761
One out to of 27 vehicles
in this region are stolen,

168
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,530
are stolen in this region, in
this region they're stolen.

169
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,066
We're not be gone
for more than 10 minutes.

170
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,636
Duncan, let's just go, okay?

171
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,970
Just come with me.

172
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,473
I can't.

173
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,743
Okay, you know what?

174
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,945
Mm-hmm.

175
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:50,650
And I'm gonna go
and I'll be right back.

176
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,051
Don't go anywhere, okay?

177
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,820
Okay.

178
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,188
Just go brush your teeth or something.

179
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,924
Okay.

180
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,993
Just try not to make
things too complicated.

181
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,629
How much complication
is too much complication?

182
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,964
What you normally do,
it too much complication,

183
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,667
so just try to do the opposite.

184
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,511
Hey! Hey!

185
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,990
Whoa, whoa, hey, that's my car.

186
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,024
Get in.

187
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,092
No, I want you to get out.

188
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,761
Either get in or I'm leaving.

189
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,777
So what's your name?

190
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:28,448
Tony Sanchez Rodriquez
'Filerberto Sanchez the 3rd.

191
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:32,084
There's 2 Sanchez's
there. I don't know why.

192
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,085
I'm gonna give your car back

193
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,821
as soon as I get
back up to mine.

194
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,123
Yeah.

195
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,393
Do you like to drive fast, man?

196
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,530
It's cool.

197
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:47,099
Is this your first time stealing
a car at the gas station or -

198
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,069
That was a stupid question.

199
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,005
Do you like to drive fast?

200
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,575
I like to do a lot of things fast.

201
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,485
Duncan, roll down the window.

202
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:08,154
Roll down the window.

203
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,425
Duncan, stop the car.

204
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,026
Left pedal, stop the car.

205
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,128
Press it really hard. Okay?

206
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,497
Stop the -

207
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,832
No, no. Not the horn. The pedal.

208
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,167
Stop it.
Please stop the car.

209
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,168
Stop the car, Duncan, please.

210
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,504
Stop the car, Duncan!

211
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,752
What the hell do you
think you were doing?

212
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,854
You could have killed yourself.

213
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,392
What are you doing?

214
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,595
I'm fixing the sign.

215
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,864
It was wrong. See.

216
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,070
What does this mean?

217
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,142
The world is tough.

218
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,513
Take it. Be tough.
Don't show weakness.

219
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,180
The world is tough.
Take it. Be tough.

220
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,484
Don't show weakness.
Don't show weakness.

221
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:13,052
The world is tough.
Take it. Be tough.

222
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,588
Just don't ever
leave me like that again.

223
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,624
Don't show weakness.
Don't show weakness.

224
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:29,035
Maryland is 2,046 miles away.

225
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,739
How the hell did you
even get the truck started?

226
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,073
I used the gas from the gas cans

227
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,776
in the truck, for emergencies.

228
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,244
Was that too much complication?

229
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,879
Yeah.

230
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,916
You didn't think to
mention that earlier?

231
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,352
You forgot to ask.

232
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,026
You coming?

233
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,872
I've haven't seen the
sunset in forever.

234
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,975
But, it happens every night.

235
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,912
What's this mean?

236
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,248
It means, fuck you.

237
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,653
That's a good thing, then?

238
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,755
It can be.

239
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,124
I'll let you know when.

240
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,860
Okay. Thank you.

241
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:43,643
Last night I dreamt a
racehorse peed in my bathroom.

242
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,618
What's wrong?

243
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,352
Nothing.

244
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,993
Has anybody ever told
you that you're different?

245
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,069
Not so different.

246
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,110
Man, I'm hungry.

247
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,049
It's funny you should
say that, Maya,

248
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,786
because I'm pretty hungry too.

249
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,988
What should we do, Duncan?

250
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,459
I don't know. Maybe we could
find a restaurant somewhere.

251
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,361
Oh, that's a great idea, buddy.

252
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:39,231
What a fantastic
traveling partner you are.

253
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:51,811
Come on. Come on let's go.

254
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,280
Let's go.

255
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,976
They named a town after you.

256
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,628
Hey, Duncan. Duncan.

257
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,998
You have to stay close to me.

258
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,599
Okay?

259
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,502
Okay?

260
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,038
Just go back to sleep.

261
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,240
Yeah, I love you too.

262
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,043
I don't have time for this.

263
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,616
I need -

264
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,652
I want to draw.

265
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,854
Okay.

266
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,121
Can you see if
they have paper towels

267
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,357
in the bathroom,
brown paper towels.

268
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,860
Okay.

269
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,062
I need to draw.

270
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,263
Yeah.

271
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,468
Hey buddy.

272
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,171
How you doin'?

273
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,673
You hitting that?

274
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,809
No, but she hit me earlier.

275
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:33,012
Yeah? That's kinky.

276
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,549
What are you? You a fruitcake?

277
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,919
No.

278
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,755
You're a little timid
there, aren't you?

279
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,624
Huh? Yeah.

280
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:52,865
You know what's really gonna
make her feel like a woman?

281
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,500
I want you to walk behind her,

282
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,435
put your arms around her

283
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,471
and grab her tits real hard.

284
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,041
Trust me, dude. She'll love it.

285
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,876
Here, don't worry about it.

286
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,278
Just have a drink.

287
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:10,116
Drink it up. There you go.

288
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,183
What the hell are you doing?

289
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,185
Why can't he have a drink?

290
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,486
You okay?

291
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,156
He's fine.
Don't worry about anything.

292
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,859
Am I fruitcake?

293
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:23,229
No.

294
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,764
I like those little scars on your arm.
- Paper.

295
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,666
Here. Why don't we
go back to the truck, okay?

296
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,402
Yeah, go back to the truck.

297
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:43,115
No! No! No! No!

298
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:48,120
No! No! Oh, get off! No!

299
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,790
Bitch.

300
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,927
Oh, oh, man. Ahh.

301
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,400
I used my dental pick.

302
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,102
Take it back.

303
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,470
I can't. I don't want it anymore.

304
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,838
I can't use it anymore,
it's got blood on it.

305
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,506
Just take it back anyway.

306
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:17,917
Don't show weakness.
Don't show weakness.

307
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,386
Don't show weakness.

308
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,717
You left the door open.

309
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,420
Where'd you put my alarm clock?

310
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,899
Everything's everywhere.

311
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:45,938
Where'd you put my alarm clock?
Why are you yelling?

312
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,209
Why'd you do that?

313
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,411
I didn't do anything.

314
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,416
I have to go to work.

315
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,518
What?
- Today's my day to go to work.

316
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,188
What are you talking about?
- Look. Okay? Okay?

317
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,723
Okay. Okay.

318
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,658
Oh, Maya, look. Okay?

319
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:07,659
What?

320
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,129
Look, Maya.
- What?

321
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,297
Look.

322
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,501
Okay. Okay.

323
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:23,242
We're right here and we
got to take me to work.

324
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:28,147
We're gonna go from here,
all the way to here.

325
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,715
What are you doing with my maps?

326
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,684
You have to take me to work.

327
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,554
What are you doing with my maps?

328
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,758
You shouldn't put
them on the ground.

329
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,717
Where's that piece?

330
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,453
Where's that piece?

331
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,556
Duncan, where is it?

332
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,824
You don't understand.
I have to go to work.

333
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,760
You think you could draw
that part of the map for me?

334
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,728
What do you think? Huh?

335
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:17,796
You left the doors open

336
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,531
and it got too hot in here

337
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,799
and all my
books came off the shelf

338
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,101
and everything's everywhere.

339
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,537
Duncan, I just need you -

340
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,673
You can do all of that. Okay?

341
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,007
You have to take me to work!

342
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,110
Hey, listen to me right now!

343
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,111
You understand me?

344
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:34,213
We are not going home!

345
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,981
You do not have a home anymore,

346
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,450
your grandma is gone! Do you
understand? You're not going back!

347
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,585
There's nothing to go back to!

348
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,053
You do not have a job anymore!

349
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,221
Do you understand me?

350
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,555
I need you to draw a map,

351
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,690
so we can find your dad,

352
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,092
so I can take you there.

353
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,726
Okay?

354
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:50,696
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

355
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,732
I need you to help
me find your dad.

356
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,035
Do you understand, Duncan?

357
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,704
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

358
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,406
Are you hearing me?

359
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,475
Where are we gonna go now?

360
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,130
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

361
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,047
Are you sick?

362
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,856
Well, looky here. It's Mutt n Chop.

363
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,328
Funny you say that.

364
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,795
Why's that?

365
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,797
I bought this hat and
I wanted you to let me know

366
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,433
if it brings out my chops.

367
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,670
You got some weird feathering
going on up here,

368
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,841
but entirely intentional.

369
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:17,976
It looks kind of nice.

370
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,011
Stock joke number 27.

371
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,447
I'm running out of ideas.

372
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,814
What do you expect?

373
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:27,185
I'm just gonna jump right into, BAM!

374
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:32,190
Look at that fine
looking creature I am.

375
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:34,460
Feel no shame for what you are.

376
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,928
That's what I always say.

377
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,865
You look all right, for a cowboy.

378
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:45,671
Ain't you gonna say anything?

379
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:50,208
Oh, look, look, I said I was sorry.

380
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,211
I'm sorry I lost your horse.

381
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,746
Maya.

382
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,158
I missed you.

383
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,168
What's so funny?

384
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,071
I don't know.

385
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,342
I guess I just didn't think,

386
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,613
I didn't think it'd be
so hard to talk to you.

387
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,132
Her name's Candice.

388
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:50,702
I don't really
want to know her name.

389
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,742
Are you happy?

390
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,043
I don't know if I'm comfortable

391
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,112
with you asking that question.

392
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,785
I made a mess of
everything, didn't I?

393
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:11,757
Sometimes the world
ain't ready for your splendor.

394
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,930
I don't feel very splendid.

395
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,705
You're safe now.

396
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,078
But you're here,

397
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:37,749
you might as well take
the time, just rest.

398
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,619
We're staying here,

399
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,421
because Maya is very tired

400
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,055
and the people are very nice,

401
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:46,758
except for one drunk man

402
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,827
who keeps calling me Chauncey

403
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,796
and wants me to
work on his garden.

404
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,731
Dave says he's drunk.

405
00:38:52,764 --> 00:39:00,472
They bring me food and
Ramone really likes my maps.

406
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,994
She didn't answer
yesterday either.

407
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,589
Shit.

408
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,928
No! No!

409
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,195
Stop.

410
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,565
No! No! No!

411
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,538
No!

412
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,520
Hi, Dave.

413
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,554
Good morning.

414
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,724
Hi. Good morning.

415
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,892
How's Maya?

416
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,428
She hasn't left yet.

417
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,664
She's still in the room, 7 days now.

418
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:49,367
Okay. I'll check in on her.

419
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,169
Okay.

420
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,372
I was thinking you
two might take a ride today.

421
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,242
You know, fresh air
might do her some good.

422
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,510
Fresh air.

423
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,419
Birds don't need roads.

424
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,758
Their maps look very different.

425
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:16,227
Yeah, I guess it would
look different, wouldn't they?

426
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,031
Someone told me that
if you go up high enough

427
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:24,703
that there's no such
thing as east or west.

428
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,873
Is that true?

429
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,307
I don't know.

430
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,409
I think there'd still
be an east and west.

431
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,144
I wonder what we
look like to them?

432
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:36,715
Small tiny birds with no wings.

433
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,155
You like that, huh?

434
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:50,595
I didn't know you were so funny.

435
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,232
So, are you all right, buddy?

436
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:57,235
Is there anything I can get you?

437
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:04,242
Can I use you shaving cream again?

438
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,946
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

439
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,581
Okay.

440
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,118
Anything else?

441
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,185
No. Thank you.

442
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:17,122
Okay.

443
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,759
Am I dismissed?

444
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,069
I can stay here, if you like.

445
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:34,572
I'm okay.
- Oh, okay.

446
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,075
Do you want to?

447
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,377
I was going to check in on Maya,

448
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,783
but it's up to you, buddy.
- Okay, yeah. Okay.

449
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,484
Okay.

450
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,387
Hey, maybe you could a -

451
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,991
maybe you could draw me
a map of the grounds.

452
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,928
Would you do that for me?

453
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,630
Yeah.

454
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,631
That's excellent.

455
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:01,699
I would appreciate that.

456
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,134
Yes.

457
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,011
Wow.

458
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,680
Stop.

459
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,583
I looked a lot better
when I was high.

460
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,422
I think Duncan misses you.

461
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:27,525
I saw him on the way.

462
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,996
I don't know why.

463
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,163
I gotta find his dad.

464
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,565
How much of this
is really about him?

465
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,534
What do you mean?

466
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,869
I mean, you could
have gone anywhere.

467
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:40,371
You could have driven up
the Coast of San Francisco,

468
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,308
but you come back here.

469
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,011
My car broke down.

470
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,948
It did.

471
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,952
What about them,
your mom and dad?

472
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,887
Shouldn't you see them?

473
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,956
It's been a long time.

474
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,958
Yeah.

475
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,496
It's the one good thing
he ever gave to me.

476
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,832
I never want to
see his face again

477
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:09,835
after what he did.

478
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,640
I just don't think I can.

479
00:46:19,544 --> 00:46:22,914
Maya, when I
woke up that morning

480
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,883
and saw that letter in
place of you on that pillow

481
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:29,454
next to me, my whole
world lost shades of color

482
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:33,791
I don't think I
will ever get back.

483
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,093
In the back of my mind I knew,

484
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:38,229
I knew this town was
too small for you,

485
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:43,168
I knew I was too
lucky to have you.

486
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:46,204
No you weren't.

487
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:51,442
I want to give you something.

488
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,378
This is long past due,

489
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:57,482
but I couldn't get
myself to give it to you,

490
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:01,452
because I couldn't have myself
keep you from your dreams.

491
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,728
The world will embrace
you one day, Maya,

492
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,899
and I will forever
be proud of you.

493
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,376
You owe me for your folks.

494
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,512
You owe me for my
wife.

495
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:34,953
That comes to $74,700.

496
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,089
Have you met my sister?

497
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:41,026
She's single and she owns a cow.

498
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:44,695
Hell, everybody's met your sister.

499
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,367
Dave: Ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,003
I have a very special
surprise for you.

501
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:28,006
All the way from Las
Angeles, California,

502
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,907
one of the dearest friends
of the Buckcorn Opry,

503
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:32,610
I bring to you Maya.

504
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,394
I saw myself together

505
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,862
Through the holes in my sweater

506
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:54,132
Once you flash your smile to me

507
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,567
Yes, I know you
think you're clever

508
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,070
Go on, steal my sick away

509
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:01,406
And give me whatever's left

510
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,774
Come on, get down
from your throne

511
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:06,111
'Cause we all know what we own

512
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:10,215
And I won't let you stay

513
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:16,421
I gave you my time
and 16 second chances

514
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,790
And you got no follow through

515
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:21,792
I'm not going back

516
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:25,963
Under these circumstances

517
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:30,768
I say, I don't mind,
I close my eyes

518
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,938
I say, I don't mind,

519
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:40,478
Do you realize how I
tried to forget you

520
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,681
I say, I don't mind

521
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,817
You make me wish I was back

522
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,554
I came through your eyes
through your lenses

523
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,789
They disguise your
worst intentions

524
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,159
Does the fire in your whiskey

525
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,627
Make you feel the
burn to kiss me

526
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,930
Don't you stand seductively
and turn around

527
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:01,599
And bare your teeth

528
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,734
Every move that you make

529
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,771
Feels like you're
dancing on my grave

530
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:11,442
I say, I don't mind,
I close my eyes

531
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:14,445
I say, I don't mind

532
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:21,152
Do you realize
how I tried to forget you

533
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:23,921
I say, I don't mind

534
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:34,031
You make me wish I was back

535
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,770
Now I wonder round the city
trying to figure out what hit me

536
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:42,507
As I'm reliving all the scenes

537
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,775
What could I've done differently

538
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,011
If I gave myself

539
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,414
Would you know what
you were missing

540
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,782
If I gave myself permission

541
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:54,685
Would you get out of my system

542
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,689
Why do you have Christmas
lights in the truck?

543
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,658
They put the lights in
the store November and December

544
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,160
and then in the back closet

545
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,994
next to the toilet paper and
bleach for the rest of the year,

546
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:07,064
so now I put the lights in the
truck for the other 10 months.

547
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:08,166
Am I a thief?

548
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,434
No.

549
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,270
I never asked you, why
do you live in the truck.

550
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:18,042
Grandma's walls
are too complicated.

551
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:20,745
And, the truck got
very good safety

552
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,213
and fuel economy ratings.

553
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,981
Yeah?

554
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,583
Yes.

555
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:28,653
Can we go sledding in Colorado?

556
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:31,722
Why Colorado?

557
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,725
There's snow.

558
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:38,963
Well, we could go
sledding in the sand.

559
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,167
Is that a metaphor?

560
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,002
I understand -

561
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,806
I don't like when one
thing means another.

562
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,476
Lots of things mean
lots of different things.

563
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:03,421
Ow. Oh, my -

564
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,192
Duncan.

565
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:08,959
If you're sick, you go to the doctor,

566
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,128
like Grandma.

567
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:28,479
There's a lot of damage,
scar tissue, inflammation.

568
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:29,980
Usually, when I see
things like this,

569
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:33,751
it's consistent with
childhood trauma.

570
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,153
So, what does that mean?

571
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,522
I don't see that it's likely

572
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:40,791
that you will be able to conceive.

573
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,829
You were supposed to love me.

574
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:27,004
Get off!

575
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,939
What are you doing?

576
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:37,047
What the hell
are you doing with that girl?

577
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,054
Hey, dumb ass.

578
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:45,923
Yo, chief, what the hell

579
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,358
do you think you're doing? Huh?

580
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,159
No!

581
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:50,861
Wait a minute.

582
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,861
Duncan!

583
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,166
Duncan!

584
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:09,607
Hi. Excuse me. Can you
help me real quick?

585
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,809
My friend, he was outside.

586
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,378
Are you a member of his family?

587
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,514
I need to go see him.

588
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,458
Maya.

589
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,727
Hey, buddy.

590
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:37,034
They don't have
brown paper towels here.

591
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,274
I'll have to get you some then.

592
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,811
Okay.

593
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,038
You ever celebrate 4th
of July with your grandma?

594
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,607
We sell fireworks
and hotdogs at the store

595
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,476
and potato chips
and potato salad.

596
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:19,510
But, I don't like potato salad,

597
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:20,811
because I don't like mayonnaise,

598
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:22,847
but I do like eggs, which
Grandma thinks is weird.

599
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,881
But, she has to shave.

600
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,082
That's how I learned
how to shave.

601
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,419
I think that's weird.

602
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,788
Yeah.

603
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,658
Do you like fireworks?

604
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:35,359
Roughly 400
Americans lose their eyesight

605
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,095
due to fireworks, every year.

606
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,397
I take that as a no, then.

607
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:43,133
I want to go sledding in Colorado

608
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,336
where it snows.

609
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:49,974
Have you ever seen the snow?

610
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,710
I have something for you.

611
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,585
What is this?

612
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:04,188
It's the missing piece in the middle.

613
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,310
Based on your map,

614
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:27,512
it says he should live
right around here.

615
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,779
I don't think we should bother him.

616
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:32,049
I'll be with you the whole time.

617
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:34,084
Okay?

618
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,825
That house must have
a lot of bathrooms.

619
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:48,232
I'm gonna wait in the truck.

620
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:51,869
I think I want to draw.

621
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,070
We came all this way.

622
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,540
Are you sure you
don't want to go in?

623
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:14,024
Hi. Can I help you?

624
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:17,194
Yeah, does James Richards live here?

625
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,665
Is he expecting you?

626
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:23,467
Not exactly.

627
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,836
My name is Maya.

628
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,939
Hi. Jeff Richards.

629
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:31,075
You must be his son.

630
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:35,646
Yeah. Can I ask
what this is regarding?

631
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,049
You know, it's probably
better if I talk to your dad.

632
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,417
Is he home?

633
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,653
Hey, thanks to everyone who donated

634
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:44,388
to help our friends in Honduras.

635
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:47,124
I want to give a special
thanks to Reverend Peters

636
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,093
for all of his guidance.

637
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:52,162
His sermons have been such
a comfort to Kendra and me

638
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,163
over the years.

639
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,298
Thank you, sir.

640
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,365
Yes, thank you.

641
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:57,635
Seeing that the world needs our help,

642
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:01,071
my wife and I have sponsored
several children from Honduras

643
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,973
and several of you
have pictures of these,

644
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,776
just beautiful, beautiful,
adorable children.

645
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,144
We'll send these around.

646
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,713
Thanks for your donations.

647
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:12,216
Keep giving and there's
more champagne in the back.

648
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,218
Thanks enjoy.

649
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,587
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

650
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:20,224
Thanks.

651
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:21,626
I'm gonna show Reverend.

652
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,060
Great.

653
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:26,664
Dad, this is Maya. She
was hoping to speak with you.

654
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,365
Oh, of course, hi.

655
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,234
Are you a new member here?

656
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,368
Not exactly.

657
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,469
I was hoping maybe you and I

658
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,171
could speak in private.

659
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:35,640
Oh, of course.

660
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:38,542
Oh, is this a friend of yours?

661
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,311
Yes. This is Duncan.

662
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:52,489
You know what?

663
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,891
I forgot to check
on your sister.

664
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,459
Would you do that for me?

665
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:56,927
Okay.

666
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:57,995
Nice meeting you, Maya.

667
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,264
You as well.

668
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:06,270
Hello, Duncan.

669
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,906
Hello.

670
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,712
Um, what is this?

671
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,346
What are you talking about?

672
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,348
What is he doing here?
- I thought you would want to see your son.

673
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:20,217
Why would you think that?

674
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,418
Why don't you come with me?

675
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,519
Why don't we talk
about it inside?

676
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,354
I'd rather not talk
about it outside.

677
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,690
Come on, Duncan, follow us.

678
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,591
Come on. Come on.

679
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,660
Come and follow us.

680
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,899
I thought you'd want to see him.

681
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,001
His grandmother died.

682
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:41,038
Oh, she lasted longer than I expected.

683
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,639
How did you find him?

684
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,041
I mean, why is he with you?

685
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,642
I don't quite understand this.

686
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,044
I ran into him in.

687
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,312
You know, I thought
it would be nice

688
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,114
if we came and found you.

689
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,449
You came all this way,
so he can find me.

690
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,418
I mean, you seem to be
quite the humanitarian.

691
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,786
You found me. Here I am.

692
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,188
So, what would
you like me to do?

693
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:02,359
Hey, buddy, you want
to step outside for a minute?

694
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,360
Right now?

695
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,963
Yeah. Thank you.

696
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,465
You have a great kid out there.

697
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,034
I'm just glad he doesn't
know what a shit you are.

698
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,769
Just tell me how much?
- What?

699
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,303
To take care of him,
how much do you want?

700
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,772
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

701
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,406
I came here because you're
the last person he has in the world.

702
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,642
Really? And now he
has you and he has my money

703
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,644
and so you'll be all set.

704
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,679
Right?

705
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:23,881
I'm coming back in now.

706
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:25,615
I don't like it out there.

707
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,751
It's okay.

708
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:28,485
Close the door.

709
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,054
Close the door. It's cold.

710
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:31,756
Just close the door.

711
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,992
You're letting the heat out.
You're letting the heat out.

712
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,994
Your wife and your
kids have no idea, do they?

713
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,228
If you don't want my money

714
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:40,130
then there is nothing
that I can do for you.

715
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:41,231
Do you understand me?

716
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:42,833
You live like this
and he's been in a truck

717
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:43,868
waiting for you for 20 years.

718
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,669
Just how much?

719
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:53,710
$74,700 and I want the globe.

720
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,815
All right, maybe
we can work something out.

721
01:01:57,848 --> 01:01:59,083
Oh, you don't think
he's worth that much?

722
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:00,517
No. I don't have that right now.

723
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,154
James, is everything all right?

724
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:05,522
Yeah, everything is fine.

725
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,057
Why don't you check
on the guests.

726
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,059
Darling, everyone's
waiting for you to cut the cake.

727
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,660
Honey, I'm sorry.

728
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,063
I just need a few
minutes please.

729
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,231
Are you friends of Jeff's?

730
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,501
I asked you to leave!

731
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:22,572
Well, I'll be outside then.

732
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,777
Maya, I found Sri Lanka.

733
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:29,213
I found it.
It's really tiny.

734
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,415
It's 9,750 miles away,

735
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:34,618
give or take 200 miles.

736
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:40,124
I am sorry for the
circumstances as you see them.

737
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,893
He won't fit into my life

738
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,328
and it's best for him
to find a simpler life.

739
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,363
I have done my fair share of
supporting him over the years.

740
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:48,598
What, checks in the mail?

741
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:50,534
Yeah, that makes a really
great family photo album.

742
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:51,601
You're outrageous.

743
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:53,037
You flaunt your
way into my house.

744
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,638
You find some kid who doesn't
know shit about the world

745
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,606
and you con him
into taking my money

746
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,177
and you are judging me!

747
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,478
He's from another time!

748
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,013
He's from another world

749
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:04,581
and he doesn't fit in here.

750
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,350
I don't know what I'm
doing here talking to you.

751
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:07,517
You want to know what I think?

752
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:08,986
I don't give a shit what you think.

753
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,654
What do you think your
little society buddies out there

754
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:13,858
would think, if they
knew what you did to him?

755
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,725
He's your son.

756
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,161
How do you think Duncan feels?

757
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:19,129
He doesn't feel.
He doesn't know any better.

758
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,497
Quit fooling yourself.

759
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,399
You have no idea.

760
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,401
Take my money, take him

761
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:29,239
and go back to whatever life
you dug your way out of.

762
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:33,110
I'm being generous.
I'm being extremely generous.

763
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,779
Accept and disappear.

764
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,414
The world is tough.

765
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:42,052
Take it. Be tough.
Don't show weakness.

766
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,154
You don't want a
chance to get to know him?

767
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:45,990
Take it. Take it.

768
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,824
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

769
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:49,894
I can have it?
- Yes, you can.

770
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,909
Hey, Duncan.

771
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:11,148
You said I was from a different life.

772
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:22,159
My life is in a different place.

773
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,829
I like it.

774
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,473
Thank you for the world.

775
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:47,817
Who was that?

776
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:06,570
I'm glad we did that.

777
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,705
Yeah?

778
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,041
Yes. It felt good.

779
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,677
Now, let's go see your dad.

780
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,399
Do I not fit in your life?

781
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,535
What?

782
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,603
Like what my dad said,

783
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,039
he said I don't fit in his life.

784
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,773
I don't know how to fit
into a person's life.

785
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:49,779
If I don't fit right, will
you tell me what to do?

786
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,489
You fit just right, Duncan.

787
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:05,562
That's good.

788
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:17,874
You -

789
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:29,753
You are my favorite singer.

790
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,438
Thank you.

791
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:01,785
What is that?

792
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:04,521
I don't know!

793
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,356
Look like snow.

794
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,694
Ahh!

795
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:57,441
The wind here is like
an ocean, it has currents.

796
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,677
You know, this used
to be the ocean floor.

797
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:04,681
That must have been a long time ago.

798
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,683
Well, yeah.

799
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:10,420
Otherwise, we'd be under water.

800
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:18,061
How do I show wind on a map?

801
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,698
You can't see it just
by looking at it.

802
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,541
My maps are flat, right?

803
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,010
You've seen them, they're flat.

804
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:37,881
Right, north, south, east,
west, northwest, southwest,

805
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,816
southeast, northeast?

806
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:44,020
But, now, I need maps
with roads that go up.

807
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:46,390
Yeah.

808
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,825
Does your dad
have a big house too?

809
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:50,227
No.

810
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:55,865
Where does he live?
Can we go see him?

811
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,135
Uh-oh.

812
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,070
Uh-oh!

813
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,673
Stay here and I'll get it.

814
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,709
Stay here, Duncan.

815
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:07,711
Uh-oh, Maya!

816
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:10,614
Uh-oh!

817
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,421
Maya, this is like sledding.

818
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,404
Whoa.

819
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:42,246
Let's do it again.

820
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,864
Francine really likes
the strong, silent type.

821
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:04,834
You've seen, you know, those
guys on TV with your grandma?

822
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:06,636
Okay.

823
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,439
It's like this.

824
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:12,175
You just gotta stand up real tall

825
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,512
and kind of puff your chest out.

826
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,681
Yeah, like that.

827
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:21,117
Keep your arms
down by your sides

828
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,686
and keep your elbows out,

829
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,055
almost like your arms are
so big they can't touch.

830
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,858
Yeah, just like that.

831
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,196
Just don't say anything unless
someone asks you something.

832
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,399
Okay.

833
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:03,192
You.

834
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:19,008
Your daddy's gone, dead.

835
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:23,680
His ashes are taking
up space on the shelf

836
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,850
if you want to
pay your respects.

837
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:32,922
Meet me out back.

838
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,794
You don't have
to hold your breath.

839
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:40,263
Ohhh, okay.

840
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,768
You're doing good.

841
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,902
I think you were right.

842
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,904
I think she likes me.

843
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,474
Yeah. Come on.

844
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:10,427
Hey. Would you like some wine?

845
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:17,166
Hey, you, give me
that can over there.

846
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,769
Yes.

847
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:25,475
You know what your daddy said

848
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:28,445
before he did this
world a favor?

849
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,652
You've come all
this way out here

850
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,687
and your daddy's dead,
so why don't you just

851
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:41,625
take his rotten ashes?

852
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:58,074
Why the hell do you still have this?

853
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:04,814
Why?

854
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:06,750
You're just gonna sit there

855
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:09,953
and pretend like
nothing happened,

856
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:13,089
like you didn't know
exactly what was going on?

857
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,592
If you didn't like it,

858
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:19,596
why didn't you say
no, like I did?

859
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:23,467
But, I guess one of
us had to take it.

860
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:31,240
What the hell is this?

861
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,543
It's not loaded.

862
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:37,481
Oh, like I would
shoot my own fucking daughter.

863
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:43,186
Hey, buddy, why don't you
go wait for me out in the car?

864
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:46,022
Okay.

865
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,495
Is was nice to meet you, Mrs Maya.

866
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:58,367
What's with the retard with you?

867
01:13:58,401 --> 01:14:00,904
Don't you ever say that word.

868
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,908
You shacking up, huh?

869
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,477
He do you good?

870
01:14:07,511 --> 01:14:10,514
You know, after that waste
of spit, dad of yours died,

871
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:14,818
I went around and I picked
up all of the photographs

872
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:17,186
of you and him.

873
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:22,559
I have just been waiting for
the right time to burn them.

874
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:25,829
You know, a nice little
family gathering?

875
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:27,396
Why, we could do it together,

876
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:31,134
just my bitch daughter and me.

877
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:32,702
You're pathetic.

878
01:14:32,736 --> 01:14:37,574
No, dear, we're pathetic.

879
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,919
You hate your momma? Huh?

880
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,889
You know what it's
like to lose a man

881
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:58,628
and not to another woman,
but to your own daughter?

882
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:04,233
You, you just get on by with
your pretty little smile

883
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:06,970
and your pretty little ways.

884
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,974
Do you know what it is
like to slowly decay away

885
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,477
into the shadows?

886
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,015
Dreams die in a crumbling
old house of dirty memories,

887
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:22,351
drinking cheap beer and
watching your life turn moldy

888
01:15:22,385 --> 01:15:25,755
like an old piece of cheese.

889
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:35,464
That man, that man
buried me in this life

890
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,970
and you come back
here, out of the blue

891
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:44,874
and you start preaching to me.

892
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,178
Well, you have a future.

893
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,379
You stand there with
a future ahead of you

894
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:52,348
and I have nothing!

895
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,751
I have nothing!

896
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:59,656
I am all done, gone and wasted!

897
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:17,874
I hate you!

898
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:23,847
I hate you for what
you took from me!

899
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:35,759
I'm sorry that your life

900
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:39,062
doesn't meant that much to you.

901
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:43,032
Mine does.

902
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,269
Mine does now.

903
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:49,605
Fuck.

904
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:07,390
You fiend.

905
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,727
Get out!

906
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,623
Are you leaving?

907
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,993
Where are you going?

908
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05,541
Aren't you gonna pee?

909
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,079
Are you leaving?

910
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:15,985
It's okay, go ahead.
I'll wait for you.

911
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,828
Don't go.

912
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,069
I'm up here.

913
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:23,812
Don't say a word.

914
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:27,250
That man deserves nothing.

915
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,691
Is it a good time to do this?

916
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:38,861
Yeah.

917
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:53,742
Hey, Duncan.

918
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:57,113
Yes.

919
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:01,017
Thank you.

920
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:31,947
Feel no shame for what you are,

921
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:34,350
is what I always say.

922
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:28,237
Good morning, sleepy head.

923
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:33,709
I'm a sleepy head?

924
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,712
Not really.

925
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,816
Where are we going?

926
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,818
I have a surprise for you.

927
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,087
What is it?

928
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,989
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.

929
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,557
Okay.

930
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:50,359
All right, get ready.

931
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:51,560
Can you close the curtain?

932
01:23:51,594 --> 01:23:53,429
Yeah.
