1
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,106
What are you doing?

2
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:04,890
I told you
not to come around here.

3
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:08,198
Honey, I'’m home!

4
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,418
- Dad, what'’s going on?
- Go back to bed, son.

5
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,028
Everything'’s okay.

6
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,772
I told you before,
this is not your house,

7
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,861
and we are not your family.

8
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,603
You'’re wrong.

9
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,214
I'’m sorry things didn'’t
work out, I really am.

10
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,911
But the things you did,

11
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:29,611
the things that you'’re doing,
it'’s crazy!

12
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,874
Don'’t come here again!

13
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,571
Your loss!

14
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,225
Goodbye!

15
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:59,075
You two are up early.

16
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,208
No, you'’re up late.

17
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,298
What are you talking about?
It'’s...

18
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,430
How'’d it get to be
7:30 already?

19
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:09,912
It'’s okay. I'’m making lunches,
and your phone'’s by the door.

20
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,698
Thank you for the coffee.

21
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:16,832
Hey, why don'’t you take a break
for a second there?

22
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,356
I just wanna finish
making these lunches.

23
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,924
Yeah, I know. I appreciate
everything you'’ve been doing

24
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,491
since your mom passed.

25
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:26,189
- Dad, I don'’t mind.
- I do mind, okay?

26
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,886
I want you to take a break.

27
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,933
There'’s something I want
to talk to you both about.

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,456
Okay. What'’s up?

29
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:36,156
Look, I know
the last few years

30
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,940
have been really difficult
on all of us,

31
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,942
and there'’s been
some serious adjustments

32
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,378
that we'’ve had to make,

33
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:44,903
and I appreciate so much
the responsibilities

34
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,210
that both of you
have taken on around here.

35
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,126
But I am concerned that you
haven'’t been spending time,

36
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,911
you know, on yourselves,

37
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,913
being a kid or a teenager,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,828
doing fun stuff.

39
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,484
And for me too.

40
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:04,532
I feel like there'’s something
missing there for me.

41
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,838
And I met someone.

42
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,840
What'’s that mean?

43
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:13,715
Daddy has met a lady

44
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:17,501
who is kind of like
more than a friend, you know?

45
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,070
Who is this person?

46
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:23,115
Her name is Maddie.

47
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,118
We met on a dating app.

48
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,555
A dating app?

49
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,992
It is totally not like me
at all.

50
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,125
Look, I understand
that this is new territory.

51
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,172
For all of us, okay?

52
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,783
I figured, what the heck?

53
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,829
I'’ll invite her
to dinner tonight.

54
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,919
Tonight? Don'’t you think

55
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,008
this is something
you should'’ve talked to us about

56
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,315
before springing it on us
the day of?

57
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,143
You are absolutely right.
You'’re absolutely right.

58
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,624
I should have, and I'’m very
sorry for not doing that.

59
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,497
I don'’t want to keep seeing her
until she meets you both

60
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,890
because you two are
the most important people

61
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,979
in my entire life.

62
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,026
Is that okay?

63
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,942
Yeah, it is.

64
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,770
I think it'’s cool.

65
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:11,642
You'’re late.

66
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,124
All right, okay.

67
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,695
- Thanks for understanding.
- Of course.

68
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:21,783
Love you both.

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,524
Bye. Love you.

70
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:34,926
All right, kiddo, let'’s go.
I don'’t want us to be late too.

71
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,233
Is it time to go already?

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,931
I swear, you are
your father'’s daughter.

73
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,759
If we didn'’t go
to the same school,

74
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,587
I'’m convinced
we'’d never be on time.

75
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:44,632
Come on.

76
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:20,276
Aha! I heard rumors
you were in the copy room.

77
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,932
Well, well, well,
look who'’s late again

78
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,586
I swear, if it wasn'’t
for my daughter,

79
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,327
I'’d never make it.

80
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,851
Gonna be a long day today?

81
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,896
That'’s an understatement.

82
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,768
The Keller account wants
a whole new ad slick,

83
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,900
and they want to see new numbers
by Monday.

84
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:39,774
- What?
- But if we run over,

85
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,124
maybe we can grab a bite
at that new Italian place

86
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,560
right up the street.

87
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,780
- Um...
- What do you say?

88
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,216
I would love to, but I can'’t.

89
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:51,133
I got, you know,
like a dinner-movie thing

90
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,439
with the girls tonight.

91
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,528
Okay, yeah.

92
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,225
Rain check?

93
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,532
Sure.

94
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:01,143
All right.

95
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,667
I'’m gonna go grab
a quadruple espresso

96
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,713
to get this day started right.

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,279
You want something?

98
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,934
- No, I'’m good, thanks.
- Come on.

99
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:13,590
Doppio cappuccino,
two sugars?

100
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,766
Well, I'’m gonna get one
for you anyway.

101
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:20,292
You'’re gonna love it.
You'’re gonna drink three of '’em.

102
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,258
So who is she?

103
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,000
I don'’t know, honestly.
We'’re meeting her tonight.

104
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,785
How very Guess Who'’s
Coming to Dinner.

105
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,396
He'’s literally.

106
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,310
How you feeling?

107
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,965
Honestly, I don'’t love it.

108
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,012
- Did you tell him that?
- No. I mean, I can'’t.

109
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,231
Why not?
Lily, this is the first girl

110
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,277
your dad'’s brought around
since your mom passed.

111
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:51,498
I think he'’d understand if
you'’re feeling a little wonky.

112
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,761
What I'’m feeling wonky about is
that he'’s had her over already

113
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,023
and didn'’t tell us.

114
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,460
What do you mean?

115
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,157
I saw a woman leaving
this morning.

116
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:01,159
She was sneaking out.

117
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,900
He'’s been having her
stay over.

118
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,989
Way to go, Mr. S.!

119
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:06,904
I don'’t like it.

120
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:09,124
It'’s not like him
to keep stuff from us.

121
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,213
Maybe he wanted to really
make sure he liked her

122
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,041
before he introduced you.

123
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:16,218
It'’s a big deal for him
just as much as it is for you.

124
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,176
It'’s a new chapter.

125
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,178
Yeah, maybe you'’re right.

126
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,659
I mean, he'’s put everything
aside lately.

127
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,096
If he'’s not at work, he'’s making
sure my sister and I are happy,

128
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,534
and he deserves to be happy too.

129
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,883
That'’s the spirit.

130
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:34,845
Hey, shouldn'’t you two
be off to class?

131
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,326
Give a kid a chance,
why don'’t you?

132
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,329
You forget I'’ve seen your
permanent record of chances.

133
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,765
You'’ve had plenty.

134
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,072
- Hi, Ms. Price.
- Hi.

135
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,814
So I'’ll see you two
at SAT prep this afternoon?

136
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,817
Of course.
Lily won'’t let me not go.

137
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,296
That'’s my girl.

138
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,690
How'’s your admission essay
going?

139
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,344
Okay. Good.

140
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,172
Honestly, I don'’t know.

141
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,261
I'’ve been looking at it so long,
I'’m not sure anymore.

142
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,393
I just want it to be perfect.

143
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,005
Don'’t overthink it.
Just write from the heart.

144
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,354
I guess.

145
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,530
Look, I know a lot
has happened

146
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:08,792
these past few years.

147
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,359
I think you'’re getting caught up

148
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:13,449
on the whole academic minutiae
of this essay,

149
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,712
when, in fact, you just need
to let the university

150
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:18,106
know who you are.

151
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,848
Your mom, she had a big impact
in your life, right?

152
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,240
Yeah.

153
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,981
That'’s what the essay
should be about.

154
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,288
Show them you.
Show them your heart.

155
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,377
Thanks. You'’re right.
I'’ll try.

156
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,813
Good. We can talk about it
more this afternoon

157
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,336
- if you want.
- Okay.

158
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,251
I believe you have
the potential to get into

159
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,253
any school of your choosing.

160
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,516
Both of you.

161
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,734
Shucks.

162
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,997
Stop it. Now off to class.

163
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,392
Still stressed about that essay?

164
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,960
A bit,
and I'’m sure this whole

165
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,789
"Dad'’s got a girlfriend thing"
isn'’t going to alleviate things.

166
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,705
It'’ll be fine.
If you need to talk, I'’m here.

167
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,707
Thanks.

168
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:56,448
And I mean, who knows?

169
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,450
How bad can she be?

170
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,110
Coming!

171
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,377
Hi. Am I too early?

172
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,466
No. You are just in time.

173
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,164
Maddie, this is
my daughter Lily.

174
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,469
Lily, it'’s such a pleasure.

175
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,732
I'’ve heard so much about you.

176
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,299
- Yeah. Pleasure.
- My gosh.

177
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,171
Is this her?

178
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:26,653
Wow. You'’re even prettier
than he said

179
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,743
Maddie, this is
my younger daughter, Nicole.

180
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,397
Well, you'’re such a delight.

181
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:35,662
We haven'’t had
anybody new over in so long,

182
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,708
let alone a woman
with a sense of style.

183
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:41,058
I need your opinion
on so many things.

184
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,233
Okay.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,235
What do you think?

186
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,890
Yeah, yeah, sure.

187
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,110
I know.
It'’s new for me too, okay?

188
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,852
All right, I better go
save her from Nicole

189
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,723
before she talks
both of her ears off.

190
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,333
Good luck.

191
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,906
I cannot have
another bite.

192
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,039
But everything was so good.

193
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,041
Yes, and I can guarantee you

194
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,173
that it was all
made from scratch,

195
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,479
right here in our house,

196
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,263
definitely not ordered
last-minute

197
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,875
from Nicole'’s favorite
takeout place on Main Street.

198
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:17,660
Well, wherever it was from,
I loved it.

199
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:22,839
So my dad tells me you guys met
on an online dating website.

200
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:25,276
Yeah.

201
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,411
I didn'’t have much luck dating
out in the real world.

202
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,108
I figured if I went
on the Internet,

203
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,458
I could control
my interactions with people.

204
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,243
You can never be too sure.

205
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,332
There'’s so many weirdos
out there.

206
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,815
But thankfully,
I found the exception.

207
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,599
Aww!

208
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,776
Well, what about you, Lily?
You'’re in high school.

209
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,343
Any boys?

210
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,302
No, no.
This is not dad conversation.

211
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,741
Come on, Michael.
She'’s practically a woman.

212
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,438
You know, when I was her age,

213
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,223
I noticed a basketball player
or two in the halls.

214
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,617
You did, did you?

215
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,314
Don'’t be jealous.

216
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,316
Well, Lily?

217
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,449
No. No boys.

218
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,407
I guess I just have
different priorities.

219
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:10,626
Maybe in college.

220
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,237
What about Patrick?

221
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,067
Patrick?

222
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,461
Patrick'’s a boy,
but not that type of boy.

223
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,376
He'’s just a friend.

224
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,335
Nicole'’s just being stupid
as little sisters tend to be.

225
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,556
Well, I do appreciate
your commitment to your studies.

226
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:31,038
Do you have your sights set
on a particular school?

227
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,605
Yeah, yeah,
I'’m hoping to go to Brown.

228
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,610
Brown.
Wow. That'’s so far away.

229
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,657
You don'’t want to go anywhere
closer to home?

230
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,790
I mean, I know
it'’s across the country,

231
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,182
but it'’s an Ivy League school,

232
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,924
and they have
a lot of good programs.

233
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,057
And it'’s where my mom went.

234
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,149
That'’s a nice goal.

235
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:58,892
All right, well, I guess
it'’s time for me to clean up.

236
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,371
I will be in there
in just a moment.

237
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,504
Anything that I can do?

238
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,724
Yes, as a matter of fact.

239
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:08,510
You can sit right there,
relax and be beautiful.

240
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,381
Actually, do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

241
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,993
- I just want to freshen up.
- Sure, yeah.

242
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,908
Nicole, you want to show her
where the bathroom is?

243
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,606
No, you don'’t have to do that.
You finish eating your food.

244
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,564
Don'’t give me
any special treatment.

245
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,349
Just point the way.

246
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,568
Right upstairs,
center of the hall.

247
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:24,961
Okay, thank you.

248
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,736
Psst! Honey,
you playing with that,

249
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,955
or are you finished?

250
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,391
I'’m all done.

251
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,567
Well... kitchen.

252
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:51,526
Will do.

253
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,336
I'’m back!

254
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:54,763
What are you doing?

255
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,159
I heard a beep,
and I thought it was my phone.

256
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,813
But I think this was your dad'’s.
Someone named Cynthia?

257
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,599
Yeah, they work together.

258
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,035
Well, then you better
get it to him.

259
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,909
- Dad?
- What you got there, Lily?

260
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,823
It'’s Cynthia. Work'’s calling.

261
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,000
Never ends.

262
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,182
- Dishes.
- Yeah.

263
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,792
This was a lovely night.

264
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,707
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:28,362
Gave me a good reason
to break out the fine china.

266
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,190
We have fine china?

267
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,888
- It was great to meet you both.
- You too.

268
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,977
- It was fun.
- Likewise.

269
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:38,198
Will you come back soon?

270
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,897
If your dad says I can.

271
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,812
I will work something out.

272
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,857
Good night.

273
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,164
Good night, girls.
See you soon.

274
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,738
All right, up to bed.

275
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,221
Tell me everything.

276
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,049
What do you
want me to say?

277
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,354
Give me the details.

278
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:07,836
She'’s nice, I guess.
Pretty.

279
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,446
Nicole really liked her.

280
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,144
And you?

281
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,929
I don'’t know. It'’s weird.

282
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,800
But my dad really lights up
when she'’s around,

283
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,411
so that'’s kind of cool to see.

284
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,195
That'’s cute.

285
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,371
Yeah. There'’s
just something about her

286
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,592
that'’s not really
connecting yet.

287
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,768
That'’s to be expected.

288
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,336
I guess, but it'’s
not really like that.

289
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,338
I mean, I don'’t like the fact

290
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,080
that my dad was sleeping
with her before we even met her.

291
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,560
It feels manipulative.

292
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,302
But it'’s like when she'’s
around, she'’s super nice.

293
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,304
It'’s almost like she'’s
too good to be true.

294
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,741
I thought I caught her snooping
through my dad'’s phone though.

295
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:46,527
What, you'’ve never
peeked at someone else'’s phone?

296
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:50,096
Yeah, but this
feels different.

297
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,140
Lily, it'’s not.

298
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,577
- Fine.
- Trust me.

299
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,492
She'’s probably more
uncomfortable than you.

300
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,886
I bet she was just trying
extra hard to impress you.

301
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,020
- You think?
- Yeah, I do

302
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,979
'’cause I know how hard you are
to impress.

303
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,981
Good night, Patrick.

304
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,591
Night, amiga.

305
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:12,335
Who you talking to?
Is that Patrick?

306
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah.

307
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,599
Did you give him a good report?

308
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:16,557
Were you listening?

309
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,080
No.

310
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,603
Just curious.

311
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,865
There were
minimal complaints.

312
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,304
Well, thanks for tonight.

313
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:25,609
Of course.

314
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,568
- Night, honey.
- Night, Dad.

315
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,398
Are you sure you'’re okay?

316
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,747
I'’m fine.

317
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,792
All right, all right, okay.

318
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,975
I thought the library
was tomorrow night.

319
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,108
No, it'’s tonight.

320
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,153
Then what'’s
tomorrow night?

321
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,416
Technically, also the library.

322
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,113
It'’s just this admissions essay.

323
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,333
- I just want to get it right
- Honey, I told you.

324
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,770
You gotta spend some time
on yourself.

325
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,946
Hey, Cynthia'’s here.

326
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,775
Hey, everyone.
Hope I'’m not interrupting.

327
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,385
No, come on in.

328
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:06,346
Did I forget that we'’re
carpooling today or...

329
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,175
Yeah, we have
the Keller presentation.

330
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,177
Remember we'’re supposed to go
to their office together?

331
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,221
That'’s today?

332
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,614
Come on, Michael.

333
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,529
No. I'’m ready for it.

334
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,271
I just forgot.
Let me grab my jacket.

335
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,402
I don'’t know how
you put up with him.

336
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,012
You'’re preaching to the choir.

337
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,276
So how'’s it been?
Keeping your dad in line?

338
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:26,583
I'’m trying. It'’s not
an easy task, as you know.

339
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,543
Aw, come on, honey,
it'’s not so bad.

340
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,631
You know where my phone is?

341
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,285
In your usual spot.

342
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,330
Yes, yes, yes.

343
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:37,986
It'’s going fine.
Nothing crazy. Just school.

344
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:40,336
I know you'’re preparing
for your college prep.

345
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,686
I admire that.
Perseverance pays off.

346
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,905
Thanks.

347
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,515
So how was dinner last night?

348
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,735
It was great.
Dad ordered food

349
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,737
from that place
off of Main Street,

350
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:52,479
and it'’s always fun
to have someone new over.

351
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,134
Did you have some friends
from school over?

352
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,485
- He didn'’t tell you?
- Tell me what?

353
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,096
We'’re gonna be late.
Come on.

354
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,447
Okay, yeah,
if the crosstown traffic'’s bad.

355
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:05,753
Dad...

356
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,189
Later, later on.

357
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,496
- Love you both.
- Talk to you guys later, okay?

358
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,150
So good to see you both.

359
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:28,776
Yeah, totally. I don'’t know
how she gets away with it.

360
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:31,082
I know. I was like that too.

361
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
I just never worried about it.

362
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,109
I'’m sorry.
You can'’t park here.

363
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,329
I'’m sorry.
I didn'’t realize.

364
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,550
I was just making sure my girls
made it to school safely.

365
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,508
That'’s sweet, hiding back here

366
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,684
because the kids don'’t want
to see Mom dropping them off.

367
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,558
Yes. I'’m their mom.

368
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,169
I see it all the time.
These kids want to look cool.

369
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,780
Don'’t want mom
creeping up on their style.

370
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,347
They'’re lucky to have you
looking out for them.

371
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,045
They have no idea.

372
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:22,960
- Thank you.
- Don'’t mention it.

373
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:34,972
That was great.
And the look on Keller'’s face.

374
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,061
When you dropped the projected
market totals on him,

375
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,889
he was like...

376
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:41,065
And the fact you used
his own analytics

377
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:44,112
in the argument against him,
it'’s priceless.

378
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,679
I don'’t want to brag.

379
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,463
I don'’t know how you do it.

380
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,379
I'’ve never met a computer code
I couldn'’t crack.

381
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,295
I love the challenge of
discovering its secrets.

382
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:56,429
And that is why I never let you
use my computer in a meeting.

383
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,867
We make a good team?

384
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:03,784
Yeah, I guess we do.

385
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,700
- So, um, big plans tonight?
- Tonight?

386
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:10,443
No, no, just the usual.

387
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,619
You know, hang out with kids,
go over all those reports

388
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,447
for the meeting tomorrow,
that'’s for sure.

389
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,710
Yeah. What was it that you
were gonna tell me earlier?

390
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,451
Something about dinner.

391
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,149
No, I don'’t remember anything.

392
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,412
Must not have been a big deal.

393
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,763
One second.

394
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,112
Shoot.

395
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,419
I gotta grab this.

396
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:33,161
Later though.
We'’ll catch up later, all right?

397
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,206
- Sure.
- Hey, again, great job today.

398
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,860
- Fantastic.
- Thanks, yeah.

399
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,906
See ya.
Yeah, this is Michael.

400
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,912
Can you believe
this selfie Amber posted?

401
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:48,611
Nobody loves the pretzel kiosk
at the mall that much.

402
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,744
I just don'’t know
what my dad sees in her.

403
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,008
I don'’t know why
he'’s so head over heels.

404
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:58,142
- About Amber?
- No. Maddie.

405
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,840
You still fixating on that?

406
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,756
He'’s my dad.
I'’m allowed to fixate on it.

407
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,671
I just don'’t know
if I like her yet.

408
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,325
You don'’t like anybody.

409
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,936
That'’s not true.
I like you.

410
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:12,722
True. That'’s how I know
you'’re not totally hopeless.

411
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,333
But you have to admit,

412
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,073
you do tend to have
a harsh judge of character.

413
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,119
There'’s nothing wrong
with being discerning,

414
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,947
something you could learn
to be better at.

415
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:25,561
Hey!

416
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:31,045
Lily'’s in there with her friend,
and I didn'’t wanna interrupt.

417
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,874
Listen, the first thing you
gotta realize about parenting

418
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,006
is you don'’t ever worry
about interrupting.

419
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,269
Well, you gotta share
your secrets.

420
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,794
I will. Later.

421
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,456
Is that why you'’ve got Saturday
detention for an entire month

422
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,632
because you let Steve from
the track team convince you

423
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,982
it would be a good idea
to egg the principal'’s house?

424
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,115
You and my parents are not gonna
let me live that down, are you?

425
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,640
Hey, we all have devils
on our shoulder,

426
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:03,338
and it was a lapse in judgment.

427
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,122
It'’s in the past.

428
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,560
What are you two talking about?

429
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,344
Something scandalous?

430
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,956
Do you mind? We were having
a private conversation.

431
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,916
I'’m sorry. I just couldn'’t help
but overhear

432
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,745
that you'’ve gotten into trouble
over a peer pressure situation.

433
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,791
I just want you to know
that'’s okay.

434
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,925
We'’ve all had
our misbehaved moments.

435
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,841
You must be Patrick.
I'’m Maddie.

436
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:30,278
A pleasure.
If you don'’t mind, though,

437
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:33,107
I don'’t really like
talking about it.

438
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,326
Of course.
I meant no harm.

439
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,940
Hey, hey, hey!
What'’ve you two been up to?

440
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:43,160
Patrick was just leaving.

441
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:50,080
Um, yeah. Bye, Mr. S.

442
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,386
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you.

443
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,214
- Bye.
- Bye.

444
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,478
I miss something?

445
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,222
Want a drink?

446
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,615
Sounds great.

447
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:32,166
Wow.

448
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,300
Who was that?

449
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:39,478
It'’s work. It can wait.

450
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:43,569
This has been
a great night so far.

451
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,353
And it'’s not over.

452
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,596
Michael?

453
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,121
Is someone here?

454
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,906
There shouldn'’t be. Um...

455
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,693
- Cynthia.
- Hey.

456
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,695
We have plans
that I forgot about or--

457
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:25,611
You left these at the office.
I wanted to bring them to you

458
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,438
'’cause I know you needed them
for the project.

459
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,485
I tried calling. You weren'’t
picking up your phone.

460
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,575
I can'’t believe
that I forgot these.

461
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:37,405
Yes. Thank you so much.
You are lifesaver.

462
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,624
I know.

463
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,061
I don'’t believe we'’ve met.

464
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,325
Hi. I'’m Cynthia.
I work with Michael.

465
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:47,589
I'’m Maddie,
Michael'’s girlfriend.

466
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,896
Girlfriend.

467
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,289
You'’ve heard me talk about
Cynthia, my business partner.

468
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,943
Yeah, I know.

469
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,945
It'’s such a pleasure
to meet you, Cynthia.

470
00:25:56,032 --> 00:26:00,297
Likewise, although I'’m afraid
you have me at a disadvantage.

471
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,952
Well, you'’re welcome to join us
for a glass of wine.

472
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,042
No, no, no.
I have to get back to work.

473
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:09,132
- What a shame.
- Yeah.

474
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:10,656
But it was nice meeting you.

475
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:11,918
Likewise.

476
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:16,052
- I'’ll see you at the office?
- Yes.

477
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,576
Sure.

478
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,059
Will you excuse me
just for a minute?

479
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,539
Yeah.

480
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,813
Cynthia, Cynthia!

481
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,162
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

482
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,603
Walk with me for a minute.

483
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:49,172
I...

484
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,698
I owe you an apology. Um...

485
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:57,050
I know this is really weird.

486
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,053
I didn'’t mean for you
to find out about it this way.

487
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,316
That'’s for sure.

488
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:06,581
I just don'’t know why you
couldn'’t have told me yourself.

489
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,845
I mean, is this the reason
why you'’ve been dodging me,

490
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,847
avoiding more than
surface inquiries?

491
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,415
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,114
I wanted to tell you,
believe me.

493
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,203
I just didn'’t know how.

494
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,033
You know, you and Amy,

495
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,428
you were such close friends
for so long,

496
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,474
I thought that it might be...

497
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:33,869
strange for you
to see me with somebody new.

498
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:37,090
Wait. So you didn'’t tell me
because of Amy?

499
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:40,876
Yeah. You two have always been
so close that this...

500
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:46,273
Yeah, me and Amy were close,
but you and I are close too.

501
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,754
We'’ve been in each other'’s lives
for a long time.

502
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,887
I just don'’t know
why you couldn'’t have told me.

503
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,193
I wanted to.

504
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,067
I just...

505
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:01,331
I just think that
maybe it felt like...

506
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:03,333
Because I felt like
if I told you

507
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,641
that it would suddenly
become real,

508
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,513
like if I did,

509
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,515
then I would have
to admit to myself

510
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:15,476
that I was finally over her
or that I had moved on.

511
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,872
CYNTHIA; So you'’re happy?

512
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,485
Yeah.

513
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:27,401
Forgive me?

514
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,405
Yeah.

515
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:32,536
Dad?

516
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,061
Cynthia, are you leaving?

517
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,150
Yeah, I'’m afraid so.

518
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,413
I was just
dropping something off.

519
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,415
Can I talk to you for a second?

520
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,460
Okay with you?

521
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,593
Of course.

522
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,422
Have at it.
I'’ll see you at the office.

523
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,424
Sure. See you tomorrow.

524
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,125
- So...
- Yeah?

525
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,344
You met her.

526
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:00,129
I did.

527
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,914
How are you doing?

528
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,872
What do you think
about the situation?

529
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:04,960
Of her?

530
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,483
I don'’t know.

531
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,358
She seems nice,
but something'’s off.

532
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,316
Off?

533
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,144
It'’s strange.

534
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,929
I don'’t know.
Maybe it'’s just me.

535
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,061
I mean,
it'’s a strange situation.

536
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,281
Well, maybe I'’ll
do some digging,

537
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,370
put some concerns to rest.

538
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,720
Okay.

539
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,333
Hey, listen, if you need
anything, anything at all,

540
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,900
you just call me, okay?

541
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:34,033
Okay. Thank you.

542
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,512
You'’re welcome.

543
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,531
There you are.

544
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,664
Looking all over the office
for you.

545
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:58,797
You got a minute?

546
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

547
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,670
I'’m just going over some emails.
What'’s up?

548
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,151
I just wanted to make sure
that we were cool.

549
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:07,980
I know you said that everything
was fine last night,

550
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:11,070
but honestly,
you were absolutely right.

551
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,463
I should have told you
about Maddie a long time ago.

552
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,684
Look, it'’s fine.
I mean, you'’re not obligated

553
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,773
to tell me every detail
of your life, Michael.

554
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,950
I know, I know, I just--

555
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:24,083
I trust you.
I know you would'’ve told me

556
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,649
when the time was right.

557
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:28,478
It was just a...
It was just a shock, that'’s all.

558
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,264
I know.

559
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:32,395
You'’re the best.

560
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,529
Rigby'’s office in ten?
Conference call?

561
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,705
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just finishing up some emails,

562
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,185
so I'’ll be right behind you.

563
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:08,910
"With the strategic
and objective--"

564
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:11,304
Strategic and objective?
Lily, you'’re writing an essay,

565
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:14,176
not planning
a military campaign.

566
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,264
Focus.

567
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,614
Remember, write from the heart.

568
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,709
Hello? Hello?

569
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,711
Yeah.
Hey, what'’s up? What'’s up?

570
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:31,672
That was great. I haven'’t seen
an afternoon movie in ages.

571
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,850
Yeah, well, once I found out
I had the rest of the day free,

572
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,591
I figured I might as well
surprise you.

573
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,810
You did.

574
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,247
Sorry it wasn'’t
a better movie.

575
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:44,250
It was perfect
because I was with you.

576
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,167
You gonna stay for dinner?

577
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,864
You sure?

578
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,997
Yeah. I'’ll order some pizza.
Keep it simple.

579
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,172
Girls will love that.

580
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,130
Deal.

581
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,353
- Work?
- Yes.

582
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,658
I'’m gonna take this
in the other room.

583
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:02,746
Okay.

584
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,796
Hello.

585
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:12,278
Yeah, yeah, the presentation
couldn'’t have gone better.

586
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,454
They loved our numbers,
I'’ll tell ya that.

587
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,717
Figures looked great.

588
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,328
Sure, I'’ll be happy
to crunch it again,

589
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:22,549
probably come in under budget,
absolutely.

590
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,500
What are you doing?

591
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,677
I was ordering pizza.

592
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,026
I didn'’t think you'’d mind.

593
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,462
Were you reading
my social media?

594
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,986
No!

595
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,989
Hey, wh-what'’s this?

596
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,903
She was going through
my social media.

597
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,514
She was reading
my private messages.

598
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:15,994
I can explain.

599
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,343
You better start.

600
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:21,216
We said we were gonna
order pizzas for dinner,

601
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:24,306
and I thought I would use
your computer to order them

602
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,786
and surprise your dad.

603
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,876
Yeah, of course you can use it
to order pizza.

604
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:30,965
So why don'’t use
your phone then?

605
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,488
This seems really deliberate.

606
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,360
It was an honest mistake.

607
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,927
In what world was this honest
or a mistake?

608
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,365
I know that
you don'’t like me, Lily.

609
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,714
And so you thought this was
gonna make it better?

610
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,020
I thought that
if we could find

611
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,282
some common ground,

612
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,153
we can move past
this awkwardness.

613
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,895
I thought that if I could find
something that you like,

614
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,505
we could bond over that.

615
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,638
Don'’t be--
You'’re not serious.

616
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,988
I mean, you don'’t believe that,
do you?

617
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,513
Honey, I don'’t think she was
doing anything on purpose, okay?

618
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,212
You'’ve got to be kidding me.

619
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:06,392
- I--
- Lily.

620
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,656
I-I was just trying--

621
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:12,963
Don'’t worry about it, okay?
I got this. Just...

622
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,497
- Lily.
- You didn'’t knock.

623
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,629
Yeah, I don'’t have to.
I happen to own the house.

624
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:31,243
Dad, you can'’t even pretend
like what she did was okay.

625
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,114
I'’m not going to do that.

626
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:34,550
She knows what she did
was wrong,

627
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,986
and she feels really bad
about it.

628
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,423
Yeah, well, she should!

629
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,424
Lily, she'’s trying.

630
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,469
Yeah, she made a mistake.

631
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,124
That'’s why she made it because
she'’s trying to get to know you,

632
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,821
to see if you have
anything in common.

633
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,432
Come on!

634
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,739
Lily, this is not
how you behave.

635
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,480
She is at least
putting in an effort.

636
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:55,267
- You could do the same.
- I don'’t want to put in effort!

637
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,530
- Why should I?
- Because I'’m your father,

638
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,097
and I'’m asking you to.

639
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,102
Your mother and I didn'’t
raise you like this.

640
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,540
I expected you
to be better than this.

641
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:10,108
Why can'’t you see
why this hurts me?

642
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:13,198
I do, I do.
Honestly, I really do, honey,

643
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,766
but you also have to see this
from my point of view.

644
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,942
This is somebody
that I care about.

645
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,770
I'’m in this for the long haul.

646
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:24,731
If I ask her to become part
of this family, and she accepts,

647
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:28,169
I would hope that you would
welcome her into this house.

648
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:31,564
Wait a second.
For the long haul?

649
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,348
You know what I mean.

650
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:36,743
And you thought this,
of all times,

651
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,223
was the time to tell me
that you think

652
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,268
you may want to
marry this woman?

653
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,183
- Lily--
- Really?

654
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,926
- I'’m not saying that.
- No. No.

655
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:50,626
I need you to leave.

656
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:51,845
Seriously?

657
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,543
I just need a minute.

658
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,723
Yeah, okay, okay.

659
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,161
I understand. All right.

660
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,168
What is going on?

661
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:51,861
Who are you?

662
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,629
Thanks again for today,
and I'’m sorry about earlier.

663
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:23,893
That'’s all right.
She'’ll get over it.

664
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,504
If you don'’t mind my saying so,

665
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,724
she doesn'’t seem to be
handling this very well.

666
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:32,685
Well, you know.
I mean, it is an adjustment.

667
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:35,862
The stress of college, you know?

668
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:38,604
I can'’t believe she wants
to go to school so far away.

669
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,302
If I can'’t be near my family,
that would bother me.

670
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,391
You don'’t really talk
about your family much.

671
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,480
I already told you.

672
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:49,615
My mom died when I was little,
and then my dad left,

673
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:54,054
then I bounced around for a bit
and ended up at my aunt'’s.

674
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:57,231
I'’m sorry. I didn'’t mean
to bring up bad memories.

675
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,973
I just didn'’t know if you
still thought about them.

676
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,194
In a way, I'’m never
not thinking about family.

677
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,718
When I was growing up,

678
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,024
all I ever wanted was
the perfect family,

679
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:11,811
just like all the other
kids had, like on TV.

680
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,682
A mom, a dad.

681
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,642
It seemed so simple,
yet so unobtainable.

682
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,470
Babe...

683
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:22,430
And then when I grew up,
I realized that...

684
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,738
if I can'’t have the perfect mom,

685
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:31,047
then maybe one day
I could be the perfect mom.

686
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:33,876
The perfect wife.

687
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,835
The perfect stepmother.

688
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,012
You will be.

689
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,754
That'’s what I'’m hoping.

690
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,805
Bye.

691
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,120
Wow.

692
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,060
Hello.

693
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,453
Are you Tyler Bridges?

694
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,761
Yeah. What'’s this about?

695
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,632
I know you don'’t know me,
but I was wondering

696
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,808
if I could ask you
a few questions about a woman.

697
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,767
Look, I keep myself to myself,

698
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,246
and I don'’t really know
a lot of people,

699
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,944
so I can'’t help you.

700
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:26,902
Do you know her?

701
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,557
Maddie Sawyer.

702
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:33,126
Yeah, I do,
but her name isn'’t Maddie.

703
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,041
At least when I knew her.

704
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:39,915
It was Claire Sullivan,
and she'’s trouble.

705
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:41,613
Can I ask what happened?

706
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:44,964
It was years ago,

707
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,923
but that lady was
a real piece of work.

708
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,273
She moved in with my uncle,
tried to marry him.

709
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,363
When my uncle discovered she was
getting intense with his kids,

710
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,235
he tried to kick her out,

711
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,063
and she didn'’t want
to go quietly.

712
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,022
She would show up in the middle
of the night at his house,

713
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:02,024
claimed it was her house.

714
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:05,419
Squatter rights
even gave her a decent case.

715
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,377
The resulting chaos
left my uncle broke

716
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,988
and drove him out of town.

717
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,772
It was a mess.

718
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,340
He barely answers calls anymore,
afraid it might be her.

719
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:16,299
I'’m so sorry.

720
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:19,259
Do you know what happened
to her? Claire, was it?

721
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:22,480
No. When she didn'’t get what she
wanted, she just disappeared.

722
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,352
And let me give you some advice
if you'’re looking for her.

723
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,702
It'’s best she stay gone.

724
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,704
That is one lady
you don'’t want to find.

725
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,967
Anyway, my family
worked really hard

726
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,491
to leave Claire Sullivan
in the past.

727
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,276
I suggest you do the same.
Have a good day.

728
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:38,191
Wait, wait, wait!

729
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:00,474
I'’m not happy, Cynthia.

730
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,085
You'’re sticking your nose
where it doesn'’t belong.

731
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,478
How did you get into--

732
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,654
Do you always take
such an active interest

733
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,918
in the personal lives
of your coworkers?

734
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,314
Michael is more than
just a coworker to me.

735
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:18,710
We'’ve been in each other'’s lives
for a really long time, okay?

736
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,450
I'’ve watched his kids grow up,

737
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,540
and his late wife
was a friend of mine.

738
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,586
So he can'’t move on
without your permission?

739
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:28,807
He can absolutely do
whatever he wants,

740
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:31,331
but when I find out
the person he'’s involved with

741
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:34,595
isn'’t being entirely truthful,

742
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:36,945
I think I'’m a right
to be concerned.

743
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,120
Isn'’t that right, Maddie?

744
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,080
Or is it Victoria?

745
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,517
Or is it Claire?

746
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:45,606
If you'’re hiding something,
Michael deserves to know.

747
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:49,479
You want to talk about deserve?
What about what I deserve?

748
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,090
What are you talking about?

749
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:55,877
I deserve happiness
and a chance for a family

750
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:59,228
without people like you
interfering.

751
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,366
I think you should
get out of my car.

752
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:09,978
And I think you should
get out of my business.

753
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:13,416
You want him,
but you can'’t have him.

754
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,462
And now you want
to come between us

755
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:17,725
because he didn'’t choose you.

756
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,772
Well, this is my family.

757
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,904
Do you hear me? Mine!

758
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:48,930
Look, l told you.
I don'’t wanna talk about--

759
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:51,237
Claire?

760
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:54,806
You should be careful with the
things you tell people, Tyler,

761
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,851
or it might just
come back and get you.

762
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:06,121
She'’s a bit much,
but it kinda seems like

763
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:07,862
you'’re looking for
a reason to dislike her.

764
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,690
Are you kidding me?

765
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:12,040
This social media thing seems
like a pretty good reason to me.

766
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:14,521
Parents snoop, okay?
It'’s what they do.

767
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:17,524
I'’m just happy I know more about
computers than my mom and dad.

768
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:20,266
- She'’s not my parent though.
- You know what I mean.

769
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,835
Excuse me. I still haven'’t
received your admissions essay.

770
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,575
I know. I'’m so sorry.

771
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,665
I'’m just putting the finishing
touches on it, I swear.

772
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:30,537
Remember what I said:
Don'’t overthink it.

773
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:33,409
The essay should be about you,
where you come from,

774
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,759
what'’s important to you.

775
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:37,109
- My mom.
- Your mom.

776
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:38,719
Thank you.

777
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:39,981
Just get it to me
by Saturday morning, okay?

778
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:41,026
- You got it.
- All right.

779
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,771
That'’s the third time
you checked your phone.

780
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:47,902
Am I missing something?

781
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,817
I'’m just waiting on a message.

782
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,907
Just don'’t get busted.

783
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:54,387
Remember when Mr. Hawkins
caught that kid

784
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:55,780
messing with his phone in class?

785
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:56,911
That was you.

786
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:58,478
Details!

787
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,045
You'’re right though.

788
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:11,883
Hey.

789
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,450
How long you gonna be
hiding out for?

790
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,149
I'’m not hiding out.
I'’m working on my essay.

791
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,241
It is the weekend.
You can give it a rest.

792
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,243
Ms. Price said
she'’d be around tomorrow

793
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,811
if I wanted
to turn it in, so...

794
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,078
Lily, um...

795
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:35,602
- Is she here?
- No, she'’s not.

796
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,343
She'’s out running some errands.

797
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,780
I figured it would be
a good time for us to talk.

798
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,827
Talk about what?

799
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:45,568
She'’s trying, Lily.
She really is.

800
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:48,528
Would it kill you
to try as well?

801
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,443
You really care about her,
don'’t you?

802
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,360
Yes, yes, I do very much.

803
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:57,493
And she'’s been through a lot.

804
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,757
I know this isn'’t easy.

805
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,934
And I know what it seems like,
but I can promise you,

806
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:05,719
she is not trying
to replace your mother, Lily.

807
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:08,069
No one can replace Mom.

808
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:09,810
She just--

809
00:46:09,897 --> 00:46:11,638
She'’s just trying to be
a friend, that'’s all.

810
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:13,335
Yeah, sure.

811
00:46:15,337 --> 00:46:16,861
Lily...

812
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,038
Yes, I care about her.

813
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:24,825
And yes, I care about you
and your sister so much.

814
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:27,610
And this is very difficult
for all of us.

815
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:30,265
But if there is some way
that you can manage

816
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:33,312
to try and get along with her
even a little bit,

817
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:35,575
it would help me out a lot.

818
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,058
I mean, is that
too much to ask?

819
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:41,494
Maybe a little.

820
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:50,416
All right. I'’ll try.

821
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:54,333
Really?

822
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,249
But not for her.
For you.

823
00:46:57,336 --> 00:46:59,338
I may not like everything
that Maddie does,

824
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,296
but if she'’s telling the truth,

825
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,211
that she'’s doing
all of this for you,

826
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:06,084
then I guess I can try
and meet her halfway.

827
00:47:07,955 --> 00:47:10,044
Besides, I can'’t have her
showing me up.

828
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:12,177
You are my dad, after all.

829
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:15,963
Thanks.

830
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,530
No promises.

831
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:23,928
It'’s a start.

832
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:41,989
I can'’t focus.

833
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:44,426
Of course not, when you keep
checking your phone.

834
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:46,559
Hey, you'’re on your computer.

835
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,300
Yeah, watching cat videos,

836
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:52,086
not deconstructing the ethics
of 18th century France

837
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,480
or whatever you'’re doing.

838
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:58,527
Okay, I'’ll relax my way,
and you relax yours.

839
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,617
Okay, what'’s up?

840
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:03,750
It'’s this whole Maddie thing.

841
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:05,970
I mean, we don'’t even know
anything about her.

842
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:07,493
And that might be okay
with my dad,

843
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,625
but I, however, want to know
what kind of woman

844
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:12,846
is coming into my house
and into my life.

845
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,282
Fair.

846
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:17,677
You said they met
on a dating site, right?

847
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,548
Yeah.

848
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:20,680
Show me.

849
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:29,297
There. That'’s it.

850
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:33,432
What are you doing?

851
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,174
I am logging in as your dad.

852
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:38,437
Wha-- Can you even do that?

853
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:42,702
Just did.

854
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,357
How'’d you-- What?

855
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:48,403
I love a good challenge
when it comes to computers.

856
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,016
And your dad'’s had
the same email address for years

857
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,539
and never changes his passwords.

858
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,454
Patrick!

859
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:58,631
Patrick, you need to log out
of my dad'’s dating profile.

860
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,808
This is so beyond not okay.

861
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:05,246
- There we--
- Patrick, I'’m not kidding.

862
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,380
And there you go.

863
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,338
Wait, what is this?

864
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:12,993
That'’s Maddie'’s profile.

865
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,040
I found the messages
that she and your dad exchanged,

866
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,738
did a reverse search,
landed on her page,

867
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,784
and then dug into
her account info.

868
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:25,353
Right there is the address
that she used to pay from,

869
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,877
so that'’s where she lives.

870
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,358
Are you even allowed to do that?

871
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:32,360
- Who'’s to say?
- Patrick...

872
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:36,190
What? You said you wanted
to know things, so here you go.

873
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,236
I can'’t believe I'’m doing this.

874
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:40,194
Live a little.

875
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:43,371
Done.

876
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,731
Whoa, what'’s all this?

877
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:58,821
Maddie?
Of course you'’re here.

878
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,085
Yes. Maddie and I were supposed
to have a date last night,

879
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,564
but she got caught up with work,

880
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,349
so she decided to come over
after the gym

881
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:06,133
and do a morning date.

882
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,570
And I volunteered
to make breakfast.

883
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:12,052
That was very nice of you.
Thank you.

884
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:14,707
This looks pretty good.

885
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,883
Pretty good? It'’s amazing.

886
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,364
It'’s way better they eating
soggy cereal in the kitchen,

887
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,061
while you make sandwiches.

888
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:22,758
You love those sandwiches.

889
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:24,151
Meh.

890
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,805
I think what she'’s trying to say

891
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,154
is that it'’s just nice
to let somebody else

892
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,547
make breakfast for a change,
right?

893
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:30,201
Can argue with that.

894
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:33,987
I forgot the white toast.

895
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:37,164
It'’s a white toast
kind of morning.

896
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,906
Well, looks like you woke up on
the right side of the bed?

897
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:43,475
It'’s this admissions essay.
I finally got it done.

898
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,259
I mean, I feel cross-eyed
from proofreading all night,

899
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:48,697
but now all I have to do
is get it to Ms. Price.

900
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:50,395
That'’s great.

901
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:52,701
It must be a real weight
off your shoulders?

902
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:54,529
Honestly, yeah,

903
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:58,316
and I was thinking
that maybe we could celebrate.

904
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:02,233
It'’s not every day that I turn
in the biggest paper of my life,

905
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,104
and on a Saturday, no less.

906
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,410
Absolutely.
It'’ll have to wait

907
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:08,021
until the afternoon
or evening.

908
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:10,502
I got a bunch of stuff I gotta
do around the house today.

909
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:13,200
But you know
what you should do?

910
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,637
Maddie'’s taking Nicole to go
check out that new coffee truck

911
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,117
down on Main Street
after breakfast.

912
00:51:17,204 --> 00:51:18,684
You should go with them.

913
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:22,775
Yeah, sure, why not?

914
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:25,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

915
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:28,824
Well, in that case I am going
to make myself look presentable.

916
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:31,740
You girls don'’t need to be
seen with me looking like this.

917
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:33,090
You finish breakfast.

918
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,657
I'’m gonna go get ready, okay?

919
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:37,137
Okay.

920
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:40,923
What can I say?
She makes good white toast.

921
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,709
I'’ll be the judge of that.

922
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:11,824
"My hero is my mother."

923
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,743
Well, that won'’t do.

924
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,746
That won'’t do at all.

925
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:30,277
Girls?

926
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:33,062
There you are.
We thought we'’d lost you.

927
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,630
Now, girls, you know a good
beauty regimen takes time.

928
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:36,805
Are you ready?

929
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:40,157
Yeah, I'’m all done.

930
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:47,947
Your girls are so sweet.

931
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:49,514
Thank you. I'’m very proud.

932
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,646
Aw, well,
I see where they get it,

933
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,300
especially the little one.

934
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:54,867
You have a similar sparkle.

935
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,912
That is so nice.

936
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:59,132
You know,
ever since she was born,

937
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:01,874
people have remarked
about how similar we are.

938
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:04,442
I think it'’s that
mother-daughter bond.

939
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:06,835
She'’s my perfect little angel.

940
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,750
Well, it'’s a beautiful thing.

941
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:10,665
Thanks, Maddie.

942
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,754
There'’s that sparkle.

943
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,234
Sparkle?

944
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:17,237
Well,
you have a nice day now.

945
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,936
You too. Hey, take care
of your mother now, you hear?

946
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,938
I'’m sorry.
What did you just say?

947
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:25,202
Did you just call her
our mother?

948
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:30,424
Mother!
She said she was our mother!

949
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:33,427
Lily, calm down.

950
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,648
Calm down? How is this
even remotely okay?

951
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:38,215
I said I was sorry.

952
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,433
I don'’t care!

953
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,348
- Lily!
- I told you.

954
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,002
The woman was being very nice,

955
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,960
and I didn'’t want
to correct her.

956
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:46,919
I don'’t see
what the big issue is.

957
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:49,704
It'’s not an issue. Lily is
blowing this out of proportion.

958
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,663
Out of proportion?

959
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,056
You know what?
Nicole and I had a mother,

960
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:56,058
and she is not her,

961
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:58,670
a fact that I'’ve haven'’t
forgotten, even if you have!

962
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:00,062
Hey, wait a minute!

963
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:02,021
I don'’t wanna
listen to this anymore!

964
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:06,678
Michael, Michael,
just give her a minute, okay?

965
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:26,828
Hey.

966
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:29,222
You okay?

967
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:31,398
I guess.

968
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:36,055
Maybe we should
get out of the house,

969
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,622
get our minds off of it,

970
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:38,536
go out to dinner?

971
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:40,320
Sure.

972
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:46,021
I can make a reservation.

973
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:50,635
Okay. My phone'’s in my purse,
so I'’ll be right back.

974
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:51,723
Okay.

975
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:38,944
I know you'’re up to something.

976
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,598
I just know it.

977
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,098
Patrick, I need you
to come over.

978
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:04,230
Now.

979
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:11,716
You'’re sure this is
Cynthia'’s handwriting?

980
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,892
I'’ve been getting birthday
and Christmas cards from Cynthia

981
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:15,589
since I was a baby.

982
00:56:15,676 --> 00:56:17,504
- I'’m positive.
- It doesn'’t make any sense.

983
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,376
Why would this be
in Maddie'’s purse?

984
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,552
What is all this?
It'’s a lot.

985
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:23,075
Something'’s not right.

986
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:26,034
The snooping,
the pretending to be my mom,

987
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,341
that'’s one thing, but this?

988
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,038
This feels real bad.

989
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,866
I mean, the fact that this
was in Maddie'’s purse,

990
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,259
that can'’t be a coincidence,
can it?

991
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:34,695
You need to tell your dad.

992
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:36,218
I don'’t know
that he'’ll listen to me.

993
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:38,046
He already thinks
I have it out for Maddie,

994
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:40,658
and he hasn'’t exactly been
objective about her lately.

995
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:42,660
You need something
more concrete,

996
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,618
something more than this.

997
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,666
Who even is this Tyler guy?

998
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,756
I don'’t know.
That'’s why I called you.

999
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,714
You'’re good with computers
and stuff, right?

1000
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,412
I was hoping you could help me.

1001
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:58,240
I'’m good with computers,
but not as good as Cynthia.

1002
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:01,330
If this is anything deep,
I don'’t know what use I'’ll be.

1003
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,158
Will you at least try?

1004
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,031
Yeah.

1005
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,163
This is weird enough.
Now I need to know.

1006
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,469
Do you need this?

1007
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,384
No, you hang onto it.

1008
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:14,126
I'’ll see what I can find out.

1009
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,650
In the meantime,
I should probably get going

1010
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,086
before my parents flip.

1011
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:19,305
School night and all.

1012
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,833
Look, try not to get
too stressed, okay?

1013
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,792
I'’ll see if I can dig up
anything solid about Maddie

1014
00:57:27,879 --> 00:57:29,533
for your dad.

1015
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,405
Thanks, Patrick, for coming
and for listening.

1016
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:33,711
I really owe you one.

1017
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:49,161
I'’ve been up
following leads all night,

1018
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:51,816
and Maddie'’s name isn'’t attached
to this Tyler at all.

1019
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:54,471
- What about Cynthia?
- No.

1020
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,907
There'’s gotta be a connection.

1021
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:58,344
Why else would Cynthia
be digging around?

1022
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,433
- I don'’t know. Maybe she'’s--
- Ms. Price!

1023
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,044
- Yes.
- Did you get my essay?

1024
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:07,919
I did, and I have to admit
I was surprised by its contents.

1025
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:09,790
- What? Why?
- I thought we discussed

1026
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:11,357
writing an essay
from the heart,

1027
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,967
about someone
who influenced you.

1028
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:14,491
But I did.

1029
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,970
I didn'’t realize
your stepmother

1030
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,016
had such an impact
on your life.

1031
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:20,061
You'’ve never even bothered
to mention her before.

1032
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,934
- My stepmother?
- Yes. Your essay

1033
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,632
about the woman your dad married
after your mom passed away

1034
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:28,635
and how her presence has had
such an impact on your life

1035
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,985
and how she'’s really
been there for you.

1036
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,422
Now, it was heartfelt,

1037
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,382
but I'’m surprised it lacked
your usual organization.

1038
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:37,862
Ms. Price,
I didn'’t write that.

1039
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,125
Well, I don'’t know
what to tell you.

1040
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,996
It came from
your email address, dear.

1041
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,390
What? That'’s impossible.

1042
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:46,610
I have to be honest with you.

1043
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:49,264
You'’ve been noticeably
distracted lately,

1044
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:50,831
and whatever'’s
going on with you,

1045
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:52,659
it'’s definitely
affecting your work.

1046
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,835
Ms. Price,
I swear I didn'’t write that.

1047
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:57,621
You'’re free to write your essay
on whatever subject you'’d like.

1048
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,753
I just have to confess.

1049
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,539
I was surprised
and a bit disappointed.

1050
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:05,890
Lil, listen...

1051
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:09,197
It was her, Patrick.
I know it was her.

1052
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,854
Nicole, you should
put that away.

1053
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,117
It'’s family time.

1054
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:19,556
It was you.

1055
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:22,907
I don'’t know how,
and I don'’t know when,

1056
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,257
but she changed
my college admissions essay.

1057
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:26,650
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

1058
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:28,434
My essay! She changed it!

1059
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,088
The contents were changed.

1060
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,570
I wrote about mom, my real mom,
and she messed with it.

1061
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:34,919
Michael, I don'’t even know--

1062
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:36,921
You do! You did!

1063
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:39,227
Okay, honey, that does sound
a little crazy.

1064
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:41,969
Crazy? You know
what'’s really crazy?

1065
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:44,842
My new essay sings the praises
of my stepmother.

1066
00:59:44,929 --> 00:59:48,497
That'’s what'’s crazy. Who do you
think could'’ve done that?

1067
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:53,807
Okay, I looked at your essay,
and you did a great job.

1068
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,766
It was just a little bit flat,

1069
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:57,985
so I made a few edits
to improve the writing.

1070
00:59:58,072 --> 01:00:01,772
I was just trying to help.
I'’m always just trying to help.

1071
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,730
I just want what'’s best
for this family.

1072
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:06,603
God!
This is not your family!

1073
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:12,783
- It'’ll be fine.
- Michael, I--

1074
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:33,499
That bitch.

1075
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:38,373
I was just trying to help.
Honest, I was.

1076
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,549
Look, I get it, okay?

1077
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,161
I understand that that'’s
what you were trying to do,

1078
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,293
but I mean,
you can'’t do that!

1079
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,994
Doing additions to her essay?

1080
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:53,127
There'’s got to be
some boundaries.

1081
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:58,002
And especially when it comes to
stuff about their mother, right?

1082
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,572
She'’s trying. She really is.

1083
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,880
But you'’re gonna have to
give her some space here.

1084
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:09,404
I'’m sorry.

1085
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:12,494
I'’m so, so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1086
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,761
Hey, I do, I do,

1087
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:21,242
but it'’s not me
you need forgiveness from.

1088
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,121
- Let me see how she is.
- Okay.

1089
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:35,387
What did I say?

1090
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:38,259
I told you not to play with
your phone during family time.

1091
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:40,044
It'’s disrespectful!

1092
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:43,482
I'’m sorry. I was just
talking to my friends.

1093
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:47,268
When I was a little girl,
I would'’ve given anything

1094
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:50,010
to have a nice afternoon
with family.

1095
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:51,446
You'’re being selfish.

1096
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:53,057
Dad doesn'’t mind.

1097
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:56,669
Well, mommies and daddies
do things differently,

1098
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,540
and I'’m not your daddy.

1099
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:00,412
Dads are good with discipline.

1100
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:02,675
You need to learn some respect.

1101
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,721
But...

1102
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:08,768
And it'’s rude to ignore
your mommy during family time.

1103
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:12,990
And you don'’t wanna be rude,
do you?

1104
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:14,687
No.

1105
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:17,298
That'’s what I thought.

1106
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:28,527
Bingo.

1107
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,488
What have we got?

1108
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,012
Possible lead.

1109
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,536
What are you gonna do?

1110
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:40,582
At this point,
whatever I have to.

1111
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:42,193
Okay. Keep me posted.

1112
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,934
I'’d better go.
Let me know if you need backup.

1113
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:44,891
Thanks.

1114
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:15,139
I thought you'’d be
burned out on homework.

1115
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,010
What are you doing in my room?

1116
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:19,534
Now, Lily,
there'’s no need to be rude.

1117
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:22,102
There'’s every need.

1118
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:24,670
What you did,
what you'’ve been doing,

1119
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:29,501
you might have my dad fooled,
but I'’m not buying it or you.

1120
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:32,983
You'’ve been lying,
and I'’m gonna prove it.

1121
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,116
I haven'’t the slightest idea
what you'’re talking about.

1122
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:39,337
I came here to offer
an olive branch.

1123
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:43,471
I would do anything
to keep this family together.

1124
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:47,171
Again, not your family.

1125
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:48,912
We'’ll see.

1126
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:52,480
Get out.

1127
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,047
Fine.

1128
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,789
I'’ll leave,
but just so you know,

1129
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:59,400
I'’m not going anywhere.

1130
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,453
Can I have my phone back now?

1131
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:12,152
I promise I won'’t use it
during family time.

1132
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:14,763
I don'’t think so.
Not today.

1133
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,069
You need to learn.

1134
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:18,028
That'’s not fair!

1135
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:23,729
Life'’s not fair.

1136
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:35,175
I'’m outside.

1137
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:36,742
Is she there?

1138
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:38,875
I don'’t think so.
Her car'’s not here.

1139
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:54,107
It'’s locked.

1140
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,110
Of course it is, Lil.
Check the windows.

1141
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,642
I don'’t think I can do this,
Patrick.

1142
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:10,645
I get it. Breaking the rules
isn'’t really in your skill set.

1143
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,647
But if you think
Maddie'’s up to something,

1144
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:14,388
sometimes the only way
to combat that

1145
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:16,390
is to get up to something
yourself.

1146
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:17,957
I mean, this could be
your chance to figure out

1147
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,828
what she'’s been hiding.

1148
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,582
- Okay, I'’m in.
- Call me when you'’re out.

1149
01:08:20,922 --> 01:08:22,881
Well?

1150
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:25,449
Patrick, she had photos of us
all over the dining room table.

1151
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:27,799
What do you mean,
she had pictures of you?

1152
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:32,412
Photos of me, my sister, my dad.
She even had photos of my mom.

1153
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,458
Okay, you better tell your dad.

1154
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:36,373
I can'’t. He'’s gonna know
I was at Maddie'’s house,

1155
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,157
and who knows
how he'’s gonna take that.

1156
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:39,419
He doesn'’t believe me.

1157
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,682
Did you get anything?

1158
01:08:44,946 --> 01:08:45,947
Maybe.

1159
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,009
- Dr. Harris?
- Yeah.

1160
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:06,446
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a second.

1161
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,969
I didn'’t make an appointment
or anything.

1162
01:09:08,056 --> 01:09:10,450
I'’m a high school student.

1163
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:12,539
I don'’t really know
how any of this works.

1164
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:16,630
Um, I really shouldn'’t
without an appointment,

1165
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:19,329
but, um...

1166
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:20,634
Sure, come in.

1167
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:21,679
Thank you.

1168
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:26,988
It must be
so overwhelming

1169
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:29,643
when you just are
under so much pressure.

1170
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,993
Well, that'’s an understatement.

1171
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,083
You know, it'’s not unusual
for people of your age

1172
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,216
to have anxiety attacks.

1173
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:39,131
I mean, you'’re at that point

1174
01:09:39,218 --> 01:09:42,178
where you'’re trying to make
big decisions about your life

1175
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:46,225
and come up with the answers
to everything.

1176
01:09:46,312 --> 01:09:48,184
Trust me.
Don'’t worry if you can'’t

1177
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:50,838
because most of us don'’t.

1178
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,884
No, I know that.

1179
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:56,104
And indecisiveness has never
really been a problem for me.

1180
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,237
I mean, I'’ve always known
what I wanted.

1181
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:00,326
Maybe that'’s part of the issue
with your anxiety.

1182
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:03,590
Maybe you need to learn to be
a little more, um, flexible.

1183
01:10:03,677 --> 01:10:04,983
A little more patient.

1184
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,680
How do you mean?

1185
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:09,335
You just shared with me
that you lost your mom,

1186
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:11,381
and that is profound.

1187
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:14,775
In a person'’s healing journey,

1188
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:16,690
that is a very intimate thing,

1189
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:19,954
and for some people,
it can take considerable time.

1190
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,827
Your dad'’s found this new woman.

1191
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:25,917
You have very complicated
feelings towards your own mom

1192
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:28,093
that you haven'’t processed yet.

1193
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,051
Of course this newcomer
in your environment

1194
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:31,749
is gonna feel like a threat.

1195
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:36,536
New is scary sometimes,
but it doesn'’t have to be.

1196
01:10:36,623 --> 01:10:38,799
It can also be good.

1197
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:40,801
I don'’t think
that you'’re listening.

1198
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:45,110
This woman that my dad is
seeing, she'’s dangerous.

1199
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:48,853
She feels dangerous because
you have a loyalty to your mom.

1200
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,159
No, that'’s not it at all.

1201
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,510
I don'’t even know why I told you
all of that other stuff.

1202
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,947
It'’s distracting you
from the point.

1203
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:59,385
You told me that other stuff
because you need to get it out.

1204
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:00,908
I'’d listen for another hour,

1205
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,997
but I'’ve got
another patient coming.

1206
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,435
Do you want
to schedule something?

1207
01:11:05,522 --> 01:11:08,438
The problem is
the woman that my dad is dating.

1208
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:11,832
Yes, I know, and I promise
everything is gonna work out.

1209
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:15,836
So many people are in
the same place that you are.

1210
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:17,490
Dr. Harris,
please listen to me.

1211
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:21,929
The woman that my dad is seeing
was a patient of yours.

1212
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:25,019
Her name is Maddie.
Madeline Sawyer.

1213
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:27,239
Maddie?

1214
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:31,765
Um, you do have reason
to be concerned.

1215
01:11:31,852 --> 01:11:34,115
Because of doctor-patient
confidentiality,

1216
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:35,900
I really can'’t
tell you any more,

1217
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:39,120
just that Maddie and trouble
travel in the same circles,

1218
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:41,471
so you need to be careful.

1219
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:44,778
- Dr. Harris, if you could--
- I'’m sorry, I can'’t.

1220
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:48,216
Listen, Lily, if you ever
need anything at all,

1221
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,349
call me, all right?

1222
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:52,395
- I will.
- About anything.

1223
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,354
- I will. Thank you.
- All right.

1224
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,300
Maddie.

1225
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:32,043
Um, I don'’t think we have
an appointment, do we?

1226
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,872
We don'’t have
an appointment today.

1227
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,090
Maddie, Maddie!

1228
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:48,059
You better be right
about this.

1229
01:12:48,146 --> 01:12:49,974
Skipping school
and taking a bus two towns over

1230
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,889
is a lot for a hunch.

1231
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:53,934
If you'’re right,
and Maddie'’s been hiding stuff,

1232
01:12:54,021 --> 01:12:56,197
this is serious,
and we need some proof.

1233
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:58,112
I know she'’s been
hiding stuff.

1234
01:12:58,199 --> 01:12:59,984
I just don'’t know
how far this goes

1235
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:01,986
or what Maddie'’s capable of.

1236
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:03,683
Let'’s nail her.

1237
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:07,078
For you, for your dad,
for your mom.

1238
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:09,123
Just report back to me
on what you find,

1239
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:12,300
and in the meantime, I'’m gonna
hack into Cynthia'’s email

1240
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,606
and see what she'’s working on.

1241
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:14,955
Can you do that?

1242
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,957
I won'’t tell if you won'’t.

1243
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,703
I'’m about to find out.

1244
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,742
Gotcha.

1245
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:11,969
No way.

1246
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:16,887
My God.

1247
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:59,538
Come on, come on.

1248
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:02,541
- Patrick.
-Lily.

1249
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,848
He'’s not home, Patrick.
This was a waste.

1250
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:06,153
Never mind that.

1251
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,155
You need to listen to me
very carefully.

1252
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:16,424
Hey, Cynthia, you didn'’t
show up to work again.

1253
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,253
This is Michael,
and...

1254
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:23,475
It'’s just really isn'’t
like you, Cynthia.

1255
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:25,738
I'’m getting very, very worried.

1256
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:28,698
Is there something I did?
Is it...

1257
01:15:28,785 --> 01:15:33,790
Does it have to do with me
and Maddie or...

1258
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:38,185
Look, just please call me
and let me know you'’re okay.

1259
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,144
All right? If I if I don'’t
hear from you by tonight,

1260
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:43,190
I'’m gonna call the police,
all right?

1261
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:46,542
So just call me.

1262
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,370
Okay, bye.

1263
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:03,559
Hey there.
Um, are you a teacher here?

1264
01:16:03,646 --> 01:16:05,517
No. I'’m a guidance counselor.
Can I help you?

1265
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:06,910
As a matter of fact,
you can.

1266
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:08,607
I'’m here to pick up
Nicole Stone.

1267
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:10,391
I was informed that her father

1268
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,089
was already on the way
to pick her up.

1269
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:14,004
Some sort of family situation.

1270
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:17,616
Well, yes.
I'’m here to do it instead.

1271
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,357
I'’m her mother.

1272
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:21,533
No, you'’re not.

1273
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,754
Excuse me?
I think I would know.

1274
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:27,408
You are not
Nicole Stone'’s mother.

1275
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:29,280
I know my students.

1276
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:31,412
Nicole Stone'’s mother
has passed away.

1277
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:34,590
Well, I'’m seeing
her father, and--

1278
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:36,461
I know who you are,

1279
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:37,984
and I know what you did
to Lily'’s essay.

1280
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:39,769
I'’m not impressed.

1281
01:16:39,856 --> 01:16:43,250
You'’re not a role model,
and you'’re hardly a mother.

1282
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:46,036
Based on what I'’ve seen,
you'’re trying so desperately

1283
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:47,864
to convince those girls
and yourself

1284
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,735
that you'’re a good fit.

1285
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:51,563
Well, I'’ve got news for you.

1286
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,652
You'’re the wrong stepmother

1287
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,176
because no woman with
any type of maternal instincts

1288
01:16:56,263 --> 01:16:58,439
would do what you did
to that girl.

1289
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:01,921
Now, I can'’t control what
happens outside of the school,

1290
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:04,228
but as long as
you'’re on this property,

1291
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,970
you are not getting my
permission to get Nicole Stone.

1292
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,668
Fine.

1293
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:16,066
Michael?

1294
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:19,635
- Nicole!
- Maddie?

1295
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,637
- We gotta go.
- No! Maddie, where we going?

1296
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:23,551
- Come on!
- Hey, Maddie!

1297
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,989
- Get in the car.
- You'’re hurting me!

1298
01:17:26,076 --> 01:17:27,555
- Come on!
- Maddie!

1299
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,875
I guess she'’s
had it rough from the start.

1300
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:45,835
Well, her dad
tried to leave her mom,

1301
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:47,532
and her mom killed him.

1302
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:49,577
- That'’s awful.
- Yeah, I guess.

1303
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,841
She was shuffled into
the system after that.

1304
01:17:51,928 --> 01:17:54,017
That makes me almost sad
for her.

1305
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:55,671
That'’s what I felt too,

1306
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:57,498
until I found out that
what your research suggested

1307
01:17:57,585 --> 01:17:59,370
turned out to be true.

1308
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:02,808
She has a very particular way
of working out her mommy issues.

1309
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:05,158
Then it'’s all true.

1310
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:07,639
It'’s not just true.
It'’s worse.

1311
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,295
Lily?

1312
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:14,994
Lily!

1313
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:17,257
Home from school so soon?

1314
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:21,871
I know all about you, Maddie.

1315
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:24,090
Patrick and I,
we did some digging,

1316
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,701
and we found out some stuff
about you,

1317
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:27,267
some not very nice stuff.

1318
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:29,966
You have no idea
what you know.

1319
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:31,837
You don'’t know a thing.

1320
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:35,928
I know that you need to let go
of my little sister right now.

1321
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:38,409
Nicole! Lily!

1322
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:39,715
Honey!

1323
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:44,458
What'’s going on?

1324
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:48,941
I just got a frantic phone call
from Ms. Price.

1325
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:53,380
Why don'’t you ask her?
Look at this.

1326
01:18:53,467 --> 01:18:55,774
What?

1327
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,689
Maddie here was married before,

1328
01:18:57,776 --> 01:18:59,909
except back then,
she was going by Claire,

1329
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:03,086
and Claire had inherited
a lot of money from her husband,

1330
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:05,044
who died under
accidental circumstances,

1331
01:19:05,131 --> 01:19:07,699
and that made her inherit
a lot of money.

1332
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:10,223
But no, wait, there'’s more
because before that,

1333
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,834
she was known as Victoria,

1334
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:15,838
and Victoria also had a husband
and three nice stepkids,

1335
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:17,535
but there was a problem
because Victoria had arrived

1336
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:19,406
under false pretenses.

1337
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:22,018
She had stalked them
and fabricated her past

1338
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:23,976
to get them to fall for her.

1339
01:19:24,063 --> 01:19:25,282
When they found out about that,

1340
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:26,892
they weren'’t too happy,
naturally,

1341
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:28,328
so what did she do?

1342
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:31,810
She kidnapped them
and held them hostage.

1343
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,464
Isn'’t that right, Maddie?

1344
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:35,466
Or Claire or whoever you are.

1345
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:37,860
Or did I miss something?

1346
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:42,952
Come on!

1347
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:45,215
Really, Michael?
Are you hearing this?

1348
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:48,566
I mean, I knew the girl
didn'’t care much for me,

1349
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:50,350
and we'’ve had
our share of issues.

1350
01:19:50,437 --> 01:19:54,746
But assumed identities?
Hostages?

1351
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,879
I mean, come on!

1352
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:59,751
All I'’ve been trying to do
was fit in,

1353
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:02,841
and every move,
she'’s just resisted me.

1354
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,191
You gotta admit,
this is too far.

1355
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:06,802
All the evidence
is right there, Dad.

1356
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:08,804
Yeah, I can see that.

1357
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:11,023
You want to explain this to me?
What is it?

1358
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,508
It'’s fabricated, of course.

1359
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:19,466
Hey, you get back here!

1360
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:23,035
Now...

1361
01:20:23,122 --> 01:20:26,299
you are going to do
exactly what I say.

1362
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,172
Fine. Whatever you want.

1363
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:32,392
Finally!
We agree on something.

1364
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,007
911, emergency.

1365
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:41,532
Um, please send help.
Hurry!

1366
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:46,319
I really don'’t know
what the hell you'’re up to.

1367
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:47,973
What do you want from us?

1368
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,541
Why are you doing this?

1369
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:52,238
Who are you?

1370
01:20:52,325 --> 01:20:54,414
Who am I?

1371
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:56,025
I'’m-- I'’m no one.

1372
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:59,680
And I want
what you take for granted.

1373
01:20:59,767 --> 01:21:02,945
A family.

1374
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:06,557
A family of kindness and love.

1375
01:21:08,124 --> 01:21:10,648
Not hate.

1376
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:15,392
Hatred is what
drove my family apart,

1377
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:19,962
and all I wanted was
togetherness.

1378
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:22,834
But people never understand,

1379
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:28,231
and they always want more,
and they always leave,

1380
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:33,062
forcing me to become the thing
that I hate the most.

1381
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:36,717
And all I wanted was
a fairy tale ending.

1382
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:42,288
But instead, you treated me
like the wicked stepmother!

1383
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:45,509
Okay, just--

1384
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:50,340
Just calm down, all right?

1385
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:53,430
Calm down.

1386
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:54,474
Give me the knife.

1387
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,089
Dad!

1388
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:01,568
Not this time!

1389
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:05,224
This time I'’m gonna
do this my way!

1390
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:07,966
I have spent way too much time,

1391
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:11,143
and I'’m gonna lose
another family!

1392
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,451
So we are gonna set up
some ground rules,

1393
01:22:14,538 --> 01:22:17,410
and if you follow them,

1394
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,456
then everything
is gonna be just fine.

1395
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:21,980
You'’re crazy!
What would make you think

1396
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:24,635
we would do anything with you
after all you'’ve done?

1397
01:22:24,722 --> 01:22:28,726
Lily, I think you'’re forgetting
the situation that you'’re in.

1398
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:33,252
I'’m holding all the cards here
and the knife.

1399
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:37,126
So if I can'’t have
a perfect family,

1400
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:40,956
I am gonna damn well make one!

1401
01:22:47,658 --> 01:22:49,399
Your loss!

1402
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:54,578
Daddy! He'’s bleeding!
Are you okay?

1403
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,511
Do you two ever sleep in?

1404
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:17,035
Good morning, Dad.

1405
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:18,994
How you healing?

1406
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:22,998
You know, I'’ll be okay.
It'’s just...

1407
01:23:24,477 --> 01:23:27,306
First day back to work and all,
you know?

1408
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,221
You'’re gonna be okay without...

1409
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:32,094
Cynthia?

1410
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:35,488
I don'’t know. It'’s gonna be
a hell of an adjustment.

1411
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,100
Hey, um...

1412
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:41,233
I want to talk to you both
before I leave.

1413
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,930
What'’s up?

1414
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,630
Don'’t tell me you found
someone else online to date.

1415
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:52,636
No, no, I definitely did not,
and I'’m not going to,

1416
01:23:52,723 --> 01:23:54,246
I can promise you that.

1417
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:57,423
That will never, ever
happen again, okay?

1418
01:23:57,510 --> 01:24:02,080
I just want you both to know
how proud I am of you,

1419
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:03,560
how important you both are,

1420
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:06,258
and how much I love you both.

1421
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,782
And I know your mom
would be so proud of you.

1422
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:13,004
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

1423
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,138
Now you'’re gonna be
late for work.

1424
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:22,318
Nope. I am exactly
where I need to be?

1425
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:27,530
Gotcha.

1426
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:36,756
No way.

1427
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,674
My God.

1428
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:24,326
Come on, come on.

1429
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:27,329
- Patrick.
-Lily.

1430
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:29,635
He'’s not home, Patrick.
This was a waste.

1431
01:27:29,722 --> 01:27:30,941
Never mind that.

1432
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:32,943
You need to listen to me
very carefully.

1433
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:41,168
Hey, Cynthia, you didn'’t
show up to work again.

1434
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,041
This is Michael,
and...

1435
01:27:46,565 --> 01:27:48,263
It'’s just really isn'’t
like you, Cynthia.

1436
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:50,526
I'’m getting very, very worried.

1437
01:27:50,613 --> 01:27:53,485
Is there something I did?
Is it...

1438
01:27:53,572 --> 01:27:58,577
Does it have to do with me
and Maddie or...

1439
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:02,973
Look, just please call me
and let me know you'’re okay.

1440
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,931
All right? If I if I don'’t
hear from you by tonight,

1441
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:07,978
I'’m gonna call the police,
all right?

1442
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:11,286
So just call me.

1443
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,158
Okay, bye.

1444
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:28,346
Hey there.
Um, are you a teacher here?

1445
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:30,305
No. I'’m a guidance counselor.
Can I help you?

1446
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:31,697
As a matter of fact,
you can.

1447
01:28:31,784 --> 01:28:33,395
I'’m here to pick up
Nicole Stone.

1448
01:28:33,482 --> 01:28:35,179
I was informed that her father

1449
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,876
was already on the way
to pick her up.

1450
01:28:36,963 --> 01:28:38,791
Some sort of family situation.

1451
01:28:38,878 --> 01:28:42,404
Well, yes.
I'’m here to do it instead.

1452
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:44,144
I'’m her mother.

1453
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:46,321
No, you'’re not.

1454
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:49,541
Excuse me?
I think I would know.

1455
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:52,196
You are not
Nicole Stone'’s mother.

1456
01:28:52,283 --> 01:28:54,067
I know my students.

1457
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:56,200
Nicole Stone'’s mother
has passed away.

1458
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:59,377
Well, I'’m seeing
her father, and--

1459
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,248
I know who you are,

1460
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,772
and I know what you did
to Lily'’s essay.

1461
01:29:02,859 --> 01:29:04,556
I'’m not impressed.

1462
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:07,994
You'’re not a role model,
and you'’re hardly a mother.

1463
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:10,823
Based on what I'’ve seen,
you'’re trying so desperately

1464
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:12,651
to convince those girls
and yourself

1465
01:29:12,738 --> 01:29:14,523
that you'’re a good fit.

1466
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,351
Well, I'’ve got news for you.

1467
01:29:16,438 --> 01:29:18,440
You'’re the wrong stepmother

1468
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:20,964
because no woman with
any type of maternal instincts

1469
01:29:21,051 --> 01:29:23,227
would do what you did
to that girl.

1470
01:29:23,314 --> 01:29:26,709
Now, I can'’t control what
happens outside of the school,

1471
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:29,015
but as long as
you'’re on this property,

1472
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:31,757
you are not getting my
permission to get Nicole Stone.

1473
01:29:32,889 --> 01:29:34,456
Fine.

1474
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:40,853
Michael?

1475
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,422
- Nicole!
- Maddie?

1476
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:46,424
- We gotta go.
- No! Maddie, where we going?

1477
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:48,339
- Come on!
- Hey, Maddie!

1478
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:50,776
- Get in the car.
- You'’re hurting me!

1479
01:29:50,863 --> 01:29:52,343
- Come on!
- Maddie!

1480
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,663
I guess she'’s
had it rough from the start.

1481
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:10,622
Well, her dad
tried to leave her mom,

1482
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:12,319
and her mom killed him.

1483
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,365
- That'’s awful.
- Yeah, I guess.

1484
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:16,628
She was shuffled into
the system after that.

1485
01:30:16,715 --> 01:30:18,804
That makes me almost sad
for her.

1486
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:20,458
That'’s what I felt too,

1487
01:30:20,545 --> 01:30:22,286
until I found out that
what your research suggested

1488
01:30:22,373 --> 01:30:24,157
turned out to be true.

1489
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:27,596
She has a very particular way
of working out her mommy issues.

1490
01:30:27,683 --> 01:30:29,946
Then it'’s all true.

1491
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:32,427
It'’s not just true.
It'’s worse.

1492
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:36,082
Lily?

1493
01:30:38,563 --> 01:30:39,782
Lily!

1494
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:42,045
Home from school so soon?

1495
01:30:44,743 --> 01:30:46,615
I know all about you, Maddie.

1496
01:30:46,702 --> 01:30:48,878
Patrick and I,
we did some digging,

1497
01:30:48,965 --> 01:30:50,488
and we found out some stuff
about you,

1498
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:52,055
some not very nice stuff.

1499
01:30:52,142 --> 01:30:54,753
You have no idea
what you know.

1500
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,625
You don'’t know a thing.

1501
01:30:56,712 --> 01:31:00,716
I know that you need to let go
of my little sister right now.

1502
01:31:00,803 --> 01:31:03,196
Nicole! Lily!

1503
01:31:03,283 --> 01:31:04,459
Honey!

1504
01:31:07,853 --> 01:31:09,246
What'’s going on?

1505
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:13,729
I just got a frantic phone call
from Ms. Price.

1506
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:18,168
Why don'’t you ask her?
Look at this.

1507
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:20,562
What?

1508
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:22,477
Maddie here was married before,

1509
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:24,696
except back then,
she was going by Claire,

1510
01:31:24,783 --> 01:31:27,873
and Claire had inherited
a lot of money from her husband,

1511
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,832
who died under
accidental circumstances,

1512
01:31:29,919 --> 01:31:32,487
and that made her inherit
a lot of money.

1513
01:31:32,574 --> 01:31:35,011
But no, wait, there'’s more
because before that,

1514
01:31:35,098 --> 01:31:36,621
she was known as Victoria,

1515
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:40,625
and Victoria also had a husband
and three nice stepkids,

1516
01:31:40,712 --> 01:31:42,322
but there was a problem
because Victoria had arrived

1517
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:44,194
under false pretenses.

1518
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:46,805
She had stalked them
and fabricated her past

1519
01:31:46,892 --> 01:31:48,764
to get them to fall for her.

1520
01:31:48,851 --> 01:31:50,069
When they found out about that,

1521
01:31:50,156 --> 01:31:51,680
they weren'’t too happy,
naturally,

1522
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:53,116
so what did she do?

1523
01:31:53,203 --> 01:31:56,598
She kidnapped them
and held them hostage.

1524
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:58,251
Isn'’t that right, Maddie?

1525
01:31:58,338 --> 01:32:00,210
Or Claire or whoever you are.

1526
01:32:00,297 --> 01:32:02,647
Or did I miss something?

1527
01:32:06,172 --> 01:32:07,739
Come on!

1528
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:10,002
Really, Michael?
Are you hearing this?

1529
01:32:10,089 --> 01:32:13,353
I mean, I knew the girl
didn'’t care much for me,

1530
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,138
and we'’ve had
our share of issues.

1531
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:19,534
But assumed identities?
Hostages?

1532
01:32:19,621 --> 01:32:21,666
I mean, come on!

1533
01:32:21,753 --> 01:32:24,539
All I'’ve been trying to do
was fit in,

1534
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:27,629
and every move,
she'’s just resisted me.

1535
01:32:27,716 --> 01:32:29,979
You gotta admit,
this is too far.

1536
01:32:30,066 --> 01:32:31,589
All the evidence
is right there, Dad.

1537
01:32:31,676 --> 01:32:33,591
Yeah, I can see that.

1538
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:35,811
You want to explain this to me?
What is it?

1539
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,252
It'’s fabricated, of course.

1540
01:32:42,339 --> 01:32:44,254
Hey, you get back here!

1541
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:47,823
Now...

1542
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:51,087
you are going to do
exactly what I say.

1543
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:53,959
Fine. Whatever you want.

1544
01:32:54,046 --> 01:32:57,180
Finally!
We agree on something.

1545
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:02,794
911, emergency.

1546
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:06,319
Um, please send help.
Hurry!

1547
01:33:06,406 --> 01:33:11,107
I really don'’t know
what the hell you'’re up to.

1548
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:12,761
What do you want from us?

1549
01:33:12,848 --> 01:33:15,328
Why are you doing this?

1550
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:17,026
Who are you?

1551
01:33:17,113 --> 01:33:19,202
Who am I?

1552
01:33:19,289 --> 01:33:20,812
I'’m-- I'’m no one.

1553
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:24,468
And I want
what you take for granted.

1554
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:27,732
A family.

1555
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:31,344
A family of kindness and love.

1556
01:33:32,911 --> 01:33:35,435
Not hate.

1557
01:33:35,522 --> 01:33:40,179
Hatred is what
drove my family apart,

1558
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:44,749
and all I wanted was
togetherness.

1559
01:33:44,836 --> 01:33:47,622
But people never understand,

1560
01:33:47,709 --> 01:33:53,018
and they always want more,
and they always leave,

1561
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:57,849
forcing me to become the thing
that I hate the most.

1562
01:33:57,936 --> 01:34:01,505
And all I wanted was
a fairy tale ending.

1563
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:07,076
But instead, you treated me
like the wicked stepmother!

1564
01:34:09,252 --> 01:34:10,296
Okay, just--

1565
01:34:10,383 --> 01:34:15,127
Just calm down, all right?

1566
01:34:15,214 --> 01:34:18,217
Calm down.

1567
01:34:18,304 --> 01:34:19,262
Give me the knife.

1568
01:34:22,787 --> 01:34:24,876
Dad!

1569
01:34:24,963 --> 01:34:26,356
Not this time!

1570
01:34:26,443 --> 01:34:30,012
This time I'’m gonna
do this my way!

1571
01:34:30,099 --> 01:34:32,754
I have spent way too much time,

1572
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:35,931
and I'’m gonna lose
another family!

1573
01:34:36,018 --> 01:34:39,238
So we are gonna set up
some ground rules,

1574
01:34:39,325 --> 01:34:42,198
and if you follow them,

1575
01:34:42,285 --> 01:34:44,243
then everything
is gonna be just fine.

1576
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:46,768
You'’re crazy!
What would make you think

1577
01:34:46,855 --> 01:34:49,422
we would do anything with you
after all you'’ve done?

1578
01:34:49,509 --> 01:34:53,513
Lily, I think you'’re forgetting
the situation that you'’re in.

1579
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:58,040
I'’m holding all the cards here
and the knife.

1580
01:34:58,127 --> 01:35:01,913
So if I can'’t have
a perfect family,

1581
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,743
I am gonna damn well make one!

1582
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:14,186
Your loss!

1583
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:19,365
Daddy! He'’s bleeding!
Are you okay?

1584
01:35:37,514 --> 01:35:39,298
Do you two ever sleep in?

1585
01:35:39,385 --> 01:35:41,823
Good morning, Dad.

1586
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,781
How you healing?

1587
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:47,742
You know, I'’ll be okay.
It'’s just...

1588
01:35:49,265 --> 01:35:52,094
First day back to work and all,
you know?

1589
01:35:52,181 --> 01:35:54,009
You'’re gonna be okay without...

1590
01:35:54,096 --> 01:35:56,881
Cynthia?

1591
01:35:56,968 --> 01:36:00,276
I don'’t know. It'’s gonna be
a hell of an adjustment.

1592
01:36:01,407 --> 01:36:02,887
Hey, um...

1593
01:36:02,974 --> 01:36:06,021
I want to talk to you both
before I leave.

1594
01:36:06,108 --> 01:36:07,718
What'’s up?

1595
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:11,417
Don'’t tell me you found
someone else online to date.

1596
01:36:14,464 --> 01:36:17,423
No, no, I definitely did not,
and I'’m not going to,

1597
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,034
I can promise you that.

1598
01:36:19,121 --> 01:36:22,211
That will never, ever
happen again, okay?

1599
01:36:22,298 --> 01:36:26,868
I just want you both to know
how proud I am of you,

1600
01:36:26,955 --> 01:36:28,347
how important you both are,

1601
01:36:28,434 --> 01:36:31,046
and how much I love you both.

1602
01:36:31,133 --> 01:36:33,570
And I know your mom
would be so proud of you.

1603
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:37,792
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

1604
01:36:39,402 --> 01:36:40,925
Now you'’re gonna be
late for work.

1605
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:47,105
Nope. I am exactly
where I need to be?

1606
01:37:15,438 --> 01:37:17,614
Bye, baby, I'’ll see ya.

1607
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:22,358
Hi there.
What'’s your name?

1608
01:37:22,445 --> 01:37:23,881
Hi. I'’m Scarlet.

1609
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,102
Hi, Scarlet.
Where'’s your mom and dad?

1610
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:29,844
My mom'’s in heaven,
but my dad'’s over there.

1611
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:31,323
- Hey there. Hi.
- Hi.

1612
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:32,498
You have a new friend?

1613
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:34,152
Yeah.
My name is Josie.

1614
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,545
Josie, I'’m Steve.

1615
01:37:35,632 --> 01:37:36,720
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
