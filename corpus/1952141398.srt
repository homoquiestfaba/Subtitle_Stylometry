Glad to hear it' miss.

24

I've been sent on an errand
by my grandfather.

25
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,806
He shouldn't have sent you anywhere
at this time of night.

26
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,111
He said it Was urgent.

27
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,112
- I'll always be here for you' miss.
- I knoW you Will' Kit.

28

You should take more care' sir.
It's dangerous' this end...

(Door closes)

45
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,144
I could never stand in awe of a man
as your daughter does' Mrs. Jiniwin.

46
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,182
- Are you listening to this advice' Betsy?

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,367
For Daniel Quilp.

51
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,737
He's the greatest monster
that ever lived. (Slurps)

52
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,211
He's a tyrant.

53
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,212
And my daughter is such a passive soul.

54
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,281
She hasn't the spirit
to stand up to such a hideous'

55
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,852
vindictive' ugly little ma...

56
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,988

Oh' Mr. Quilp. Didn't hear you come in.

58
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,329

Go on' ma'am' you Were sayin'.

60
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,700

Oh' Mrs. Quilp' hoW delightful.

62
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,606
You've invited a neighbor to supper and
sent out for something light and palatable.

63
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,980
I didn't invite anybody to supper' Daniel.

64
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,615
- It Was Ma...
- Hush' child.

65
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,616

So soon? Why not stop for breakfast?

69
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,296
There's nothing dishonest
in a bit of supper' Mr. Quilp.

70
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,901
My daughter has the right to do
as she pleases.

71
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,902
- You'd like to think so' ma'am.
- (Groans)

72
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,373
Oh' you look ill' Mrs. Jiniwin.

73
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,279
You been overexciting yourself.

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
- It's a Weakness in old Women. Get to bed.
- I shall go to bed When I please' Quilp'

75
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,485
- and not before.
- Please to go noW' Mrs. Jiniwin.

76
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,588
- No.
- Upstairs' I say!

77
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I feel in a smoking humor' Mrs. Quilp...

78
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,471

79
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,241
I'd like you to sit With me
and move not an inch in case I Want you.

80
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,146
Yes' of course' Daniel.

81
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,983
Oh' a Word of advice' my dear.

82
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,187
Should you ever listen to those harpies again'
do you knoW What I'll do to you?

83
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,325
No' Daniel. What Will you do to me?

84
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,864
I'll bite you.

85
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,537
(Dog barks)

86
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,863
Erm' I'm going to need your help again' Nell.

87
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,070
Must I?

88
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,071
Yes' I'm afraid you must.

89
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,174
Our future depends upon it.

90
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,311

96
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,541
Betsy my dear' What are you doing sat there?

Oh! What a vision of loveliness.

This Way.

108
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,736
Seven pounds spent already.

109
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,737
- What has the old man done With it?
- I do not knoW' sir.

110
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,011
Are you lying to me' Nell?

111
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,047
- No' sir.
- I believe you.

112
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,684
Who Wouldn't?
Such a sweet and honest face.

113
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,024
You're looking pretty today' Nell.

114
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,827
Charmingly pretty.

115
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,068
HoW'd you like to be my Wife?

116
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,506

Mrs. Quilp.

118
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,881
(Chuckles)

119
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,055
(Groans)

120
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,056
She's a clapped-out creature.

121
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,095
Hm.

122
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,096
You'll be just the proper age
for me in a couple of years.

123
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,100
What do you say?

124
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,604
I have nothing to say' sir.

125
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,605
Well...think about it.

126
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,943

129
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,663
Your grandfather' Nell.

130
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,366
He's an astute man of business' isn't he?

131
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,240
I-I suppose so.

132
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,241
All this money I'm investing
by Way of these loans.

133
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,979
- They Will make my fortune' Won't they?
- Might I go' sir?

134
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,650
Grandfather's told me to return
directly I had an answer.

135
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,654
But you haven't one' Nell.

136
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,657
You can't have one
till I'm ready to give it.

137
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,463
You'll come With me.

138
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,464
Come along.

139
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,604
I thought you said We Were
going to see my grandfather' sir.

140
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,605
Have patience' Nell' have patience.
I've a little business to attend to.

141
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,842
- What kind of place is this?
- Mm?

142
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,945
It's a debtor's prison. A place for people
Who borrowed money and never paid it back.

143
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,216
Excuse me.

144
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,988
- (People clamoring)
- (Woman) Mr. Quilp!

145
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,989
Mr. Quilp!

146
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,306
(Quilp) Nell? Nell?

147
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,678
Come along. We don't Want to keep
your grandfather Waiting' do We? (Chuckles)

148
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,653
I tell you again' Grandfather'
I Wish to see my sister.

149
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,622
The one you keep cooped up'
poisoning her mind against me.

150
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,225
You Were given every chance in life.

151
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,226
I brought you and your sister up' alone'
to be decent and honest.

152
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,629
And hoW did you repay me?
By your scandalous misconduct about town.

153
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,511
Why are they all so upset With you' Mr. Quilp?

154
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,512
No one likes a moneylender' Nell.
Specially When it's time to pay him back.

155
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,727
You've squandered everything I gave you.

156
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,728
Listen to him' SWiveller'
he's a bitter old man and a liar too.

157
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,832
It is a devil of a thing' gentlemen'
When relations fall out and disagree.

158
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,639
Why not shake hands' forget about the past?

159
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,108
- Hold your tongue.
- Sir' don't interrupt the chair.

160
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,777
I say it With the utmost respect.

161
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,778
What do you say' Grandfather? You're saving up
a pile of money here for my sister.

162
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,584
Why not hand over
a reasonable amount to me

163
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,519
and make everything friendly between us?

164
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Oh my God!
Why do you hunt and persecute me?

165
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,894
Freddie!

166
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,895
Oh' Quilp! Thank God! This boy
Would murder me given half a chance.

167
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,867
What have you been saying' Fred?

168
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,102
Nothing.

169
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,103
Well noW' hoW are you? I suppose
the old man teaches you to hate me?

170
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,175
Grandfather never speaks to me
about you' Fred.

171
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,176
Yes' I can believe you there.

172
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,749
Lend us a shilling.

173

Come' SWiveller' our visit's ended here.

00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,620
For the time being.

175
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,621
- I thought you Wanted to see your sister.
- I've seen her' haven't I?

176
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Charmed' I'm sure.

177
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,666
Good day.

178
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,804
So much for family relations.
Thank God I acknowledge none.

179
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,409
- Erm...
- I kneW I could depend on you' Quilp.

180
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,913
A moment' please.
Nell' Would you excuse us?

181
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,325

00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,326
- Sign? What is it?
- Oh' read.

183
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,696
It's a...bill of sale.

184
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,733
Correct. This is the last money
I Will give you

185
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,170
and I make this loan on the understanding
that you Will pay me back everything

186
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,341
With my numerous investments
doubled or even trebled.

187
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,746
Should you fail to do so'

188
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,915
I Will have the authority to...

189
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,916
call into being certain legal powers
Which you cannot presume to question.

190
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,621
Everything I own becomes yours?
To do With as you see fit?

191
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,693
- Stock and property.
- The Old Curiosity Shop?

192
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,732
Why do you ask me
to sign such a document noW? I've-I've...

193
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,937
Haven't I always paid you back?

194
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,938
Your debts are mounting' sir'
and I need some kind of surety.

195
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,145
Well' I Will not do it' Quilp.

196
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,146
Everything I own is for Nell's future.

197
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,550
Very Well. There's nothing more to say.

198
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,268
Wait.

199
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,269
I must have some ready cash
to bridge my investments.

200
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,377
Oh. Then sign.

201
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,450
Is there no other Way?

202
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,889
(Sighs) Very Well.

203
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,394
You leave me no option.

204
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,231
Well' I Will not ask in What good investments
all my supplies are sunk.

205
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,573
You are a deep man' sir.
Keep your secrets close.

206
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,578
Yes' you're right there.
I keep my secrets close.

207
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,883
Very close.

208
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,336
- Where shall We eat?
- Well' dinner last night closes Long Acre to us.

209
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,241
- Beg pardon?
- I enter' in this book'

210
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,242
the names of streets We can't
Walk down While the shops are open.

211
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,479
- Due to our strained credit?
- Correct.

212
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,583
Damned nuisance' sir.

213
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,584
But I've a plan to make our fortune
With very little trouble' SWiveller.

214
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,822
You've showed me too many already' Freddie.

215
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,823
And What have I got
to shoW for it? Nothing.

216
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,795
Ah' but this plan is different.

217
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,796
NoW' do you think my sister has a pretty face?

218
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,799
Yes' she has a pretty face.

219
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,571
Very pretty face.

220
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,572
- Fine girl for her age.
- Exactly. She's still only 14.

221
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,376
- Oh.
- And that's all the better.

222
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,377
If I take Nell in hand
and bend her to my Will'

223
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,547
What' With a little coaxing'
to prevent your marrying her?

224
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,352
She's 14' Freddie.

225
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,154
- I don't mean noW.
- No.

226
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,789
Say' in two years' time.

227
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,790
Marry my sister and you Will be
the sole inheritor of my grandfather's Will.

228
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,063
HoW very inviting.

229
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,064
- I suppose there's no doubt his being rich?
- None.

230
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,468
What do you say' Dick?

231
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,905
Well' I could give it a Whirl' I suppose.

232
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,075
No harm in a bit of Wooing' is there?

233
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,445
- I'm a damned handsome felloW.
- Quite.

234
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,582
Ah' I'm afraid I have to dash' SWiveller.

235
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,819
I might be gone some time.

236
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Possibly a very long time'
if you understand my meaning.

237
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,303
Oh' What a touching little scene.

238
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,874
- Where is he?
- Who' sir?

239
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,977
- Your grandfather' Nell' the old Wastrel.
- He's upstairs' sir.

240
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,782
- But he's sleeping' sir.
- Well' this document Will Wake him.

241
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,587
- Can't go up there' it's private.
- Mr. Quilp does What he likes in his own shop.

242
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,424
- But this isn't his shop.
- Oh it is' Nell' it is. Or Will be.

243
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,462
May I introduce my lawyer' Mr. Brass.

244
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,968
What do you have here?

245
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,969
There must be something hidden
in this junk to pay your debts.

246
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,205
Gambled away' everything of Worth. A fortune.

247
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,643
Oh. Then you and the child are truly lost.

248
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,449
- Where Will We go' Quilp?
- That is no concern of mine.

249
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,956
- Unless...
- Yes? What? Tell me.

250
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,862
I'm at your mercy. Anything you Want.

251
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,863
Just ask and I'll...agree to it.

252
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,136
I need a serving maid.
A young girl to do for me.

253
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,509
What are you suggesting?

254
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,446
A mere child!

255
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,950
Nell is not for sale.

256
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,322
Might I ask What you're searching for'
Mr. Quilp?

257
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,323
Anything of value' and I've no intention
of leaving the old man till I find it.

258
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,529
(Door opens)

259
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,368
Hello' my duck of diamonds.

260
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,205
(Brass) Such a treasure' Mr. Quilp.

261
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,575
Who asked you for your opinion' Mr. Brass?
Be quiet.

262
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,945
Of course' sir. HoW presumptuous of me.

263
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,983
- I need to give grandfather his supper' sir.
- Oh. May I?

264
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,891
Oh.

265
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,464
(Slurps noisily)

266
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,465
What a remarkably pleasant Way he has
With children. It's most affecting.

267
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,804
It's quite a treat to Watch him.

268
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,805
(Quilp snorts and gulps)

269
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,475
- Thank you.
- Good night.

270
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Hmm. Hmph!

271
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,621
(Horse neighs)

272
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,992
(Nell) Let us leave here tonight.

273
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,993
But Where Will We go' Nell?

274
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,133
The countryside' grandfather.

275
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,134
Let us run away.

276
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,038
I love the shop as much as you do...

277
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,208
but We can make a home anywhere
if We need to.

278
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,045
Like beggars?

279
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,382
Yes' like beggars.
It is possible' grandfather.

280
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,321
If We Want it badly enough.

281
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,958
- (Door opens)
- (Men laugh)

282
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,863
Let us be free of Quilp tonight.

283
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,067
(Snores)

284
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,038
(Snorts)

285
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,039
(Mutters)

286
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,223
(Brass snorts)

287
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,545
(Door closes)

288
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,994
(Gulls)

289
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,519
What's the matter' child?

290
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,288
It's Nell and her grandfather.

291
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,891
Run away.

292
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,527
(Footsteps)

293
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,528
Nell?

294
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,665
Little Nell?

295
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,301
Where are they?

296
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,737
Brass.

297
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,406
Wake up' you drunken fool.

298
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,407
- You seen 'em?
- Seen Who' Mr. Quilp?

299
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,623
Good morning' sir.
Is the little lady of the house at home?

300
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,295
She's flown.

301
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,296
- Flown?
- Gone' both of 'em.

302
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,266
Vanished in the night.

303
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,201
But Where have they gone' sir?

304
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,071
You tell me' sir.
Where's that brother of hers?

305
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,072
Freddie? Ah' noW there's a problem.
I'm afraid he's done very much the same.

306
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,177
Ran off to France. Got himself into a spot
of bother With a girl dancing in the halls.

307
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,782
Not dancing any more' I'm afraid.
Far from it.

308
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,719
Little Nelly Won't be Wanting these' then.

309
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,089
Perhaps the sly old fox has made his fortune
and gone off to live in a tranquil spot

310
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,727
With a distant vieW of the changing sea.

311
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,731
(Quilp) Careful!

312
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,167
You nincompoop!

313
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,803
What's this here' sir?

314
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,505
Looks like a secret hiding place.

315
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,641
- Let me see.
- Worthless papers' sir.

316
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,977
Nothing but outstanding debts and bills.

317
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,978
- A jewelry box!
- Give that here.

318
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,249
Empty.

319
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,919
Might have known.

320
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Everything of value gambled away.

321
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,257
Well' I Won't be made a fool of
by a young girl and a thief.

322
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,463
If the old swindler gets away With this'
others Will do the same.

323
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I must have justice.

324
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,705
Revenge.

325
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,980
Maybe We should rest' Nell.

326
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,915
You look tired.

327
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,916
I'll never feel tired again
noW We're rid of Mr. Quilp.

328
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,420
(Grandfather chuckles)

329
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,226
Here...

330
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,962
Take charge of that.

331
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,963
That's the last of our money.
A feW gold coins.

332
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,099
Oh' should I ask or even beg...

333
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,272
for their return'

334
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,242
you must refuse me.

335
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,778
Do you promise me?

336
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,779
I promise.

337
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh' there's something else
I Want to give you.

338
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,999
Here.

339
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,171
- My mother's locket.
- Yes.

340
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,240
She always meant you to have it
When you became of an age.

341
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,977
Hm? For the sake of her love.

342
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,985
Thank you.

343
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,986
It'll remind you of home...and of everything
that is good in the World.

344
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,495
Yes' all is Well noW.

345
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,933
(Grandfather) Freedom.

346
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,203
Is it very much further' Mr. Quilp?

347
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,239
The air is exceedingly dry' and I suddenly
feel in need of a light refreshment.

348
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,878
Oh' Well' We are very near' Mr. SWiveller.

349
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,848
It's a moment's Walk away.

350
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,849
Pity. I hope this Work you're offering me
Won't be too taxing.

351
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,087
I'm not usually an early riser.

352
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,088
Oh! I had the sun very strong
in my eyes last night.

353
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,227
Think of the rewards
our joint venture Will bring' sir.

354
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,830
You keep an eye on my business dealings
With Mr. Brass

355
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,267
and I promise to find Miss Nelly Trent
and bring her back here to you' sir.

356
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,807
You'll be married When
the girl becomes of age. I promise.

357
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,842
That's the Worst of it' Mr. Quilp.

358
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,843
Miss Trent's fortune' in perspective'
looks such a long Way off

359
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,280
and I have no immediate readies.

360
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,852
Caution is the Word' sir.

361
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,957
And caution is the act' sir.

362
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,896
Why do you think
Mr. Brass cannot be trusted?

363
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,098
(Boy) Please' sir!

364
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,099
Any man Who chooses
to be my legal representative' sir...

365
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,604
- Need I say more?
- Mm. Quite' Mr. Quilp.

366
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,933
Ah' there she is.

367
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,934
The strong arm of the laW'
Miss Sally Brass.

368
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,771
The only Woman in the World With all the charm
of her sex and none of their Weakness.

369
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,077
Hold your nonsense' Mr. Quilp.

370
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,078
I Wonder you're not ashamed of yourself'
talking before a strange young man.

371
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,749
This strange young man

372
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,750
is himself too susceptible to your feminine
charms not to agree With me' Sally.

373
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,189
- Oh' is he indeed?
- I am?

374
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,558
- You are.
- Oh' yes' I am.

375
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,994
Good afternoon' sweet...

376
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,896
lady.

377
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,897
Pray' might We not be introduced properly'
Mr. Quilp?

378
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,003
This is Mr. Dick SWiveller' sister.

379
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,942
A gentleman of good family Who is content'
for a While'

380
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,943
to fill the humble situation
as our neW solicitor's clerk.

381
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,350
- By Whose authority?
- (Quilp) Mine.

382
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,819
If you Want my continued business.

And We are very happy.
Very' very happy indeed.

384
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,257
I propose Mr. SWiveller
enters upon his duties at once.

385
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
- And Where Will he sit' Mr. Quilp?
- On your chair' ma'am.

386
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,032
Until you can buy another.

387
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,167
- Mine?
- Of course.

388
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,137
HoW charitable of Mr. Quilp
to suggest such a thing.

389
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,138
Sally's chair fairly vibrates
With the power of the laW.

390
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,775
It'll be your guide' your companion...

391
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,613
- and your friend.
- (Sally) Oh' Will it?

392
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,448
(Quilp) Yes' ma'am.

393
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,449
It Will.

394
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,788
Well...

395
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,093
You'd better take it... (Slams chair)

396
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,830
..Mr. SWiveller.

397
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,907
(Door closes)

398
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,883
Keep an eye on Mr. SWiveller' sir.
As a friend of the brother

399
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,486
- I Want him to lead us to the child.
- 'Course' Mr. Quilp.

400
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,132
(Clears throat)

401
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,374
Good Lord' Who are you?

402
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,375

There's a gentleman come about the
advertisement. Will you shoW him the lodgings?

404
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,384
I have nothing to do With them.
ShoW him yourself.

405
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,385
- Miss Sally said I Wasn't to' should she be out.
- Why not?

406
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,889
Cos people Wouldn't believe the maid service
Was any good if they saW hoW small I Was.

407
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,664
They think they've been short-changed.

408
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,532
Very Well.

409
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,533

(Tapping)

418
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,871
Hm. (Shrilly) That's the Way to do it.

424
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,723
We're playing a shoW at the country fair.

425
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,724
Wouldn't do to let 'em see the present
company undergoing repairs' Would it?

426
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,995
- I suppose not.

I don't eat babies. I don't like 'em.

We Want you to let me knoW!

(All) It's behind you!

504
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,750
There's no crocodile there. You must have
got it mixed up With something else.

505
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,755
- NoW' it's very important you tell me Where...
- (All) Behind you!

It's no longer safe here.

508
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,965
Come' my child' We must leave.

509
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,769
(Punch) Give us a kiss!
(Judy) Ooh' a kiss? On the lips?

510
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,572
- Yes. Whack!

511
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,573

(Punch) Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

512
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,779

- (Crocodile growls)

513
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,216
(Cheering)

514
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,687
- Thank you' boys and girls.
- Thank you.

515
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,688
- Please give generously.
- You're so kind.

516
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,691
- Where they gone?

517
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,900
- Mind yourself!
- Excuse me!

518
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,901
- Get out the Way!
- Excuse me!

519
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:44,974
Where have they gone?

520
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,844
- We've lost 'em' you clod!
- You Were meant to look after them!

521
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,845
- Don't shove me!
- Watch the face!

522
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,770
(Thunder)

523
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,053
- What you doin'' Sally?
- Shh!

524
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,188
(Whispers) Peeping.

525
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,857
- On our lodger?
- Of course.

526
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,259
We don't knoW Who he is. I don't trust him.

527
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,260
It'd be an extremely unpleasant circumstance
if he Were to bounce out suddenly' my dear.

528
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,934
- SWiveller' fetch a bedpan.
- Bedpan?

529
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,603
And stand against that Wall.

530
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,239
- In case of violence.
- (Sighs)

531
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,573
Yes' sir.

532
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,574
Of course' I'd be more than a match for him
but I'm the master of the house

533
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,313
and the laws of hospitality
must be respected.

534
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,083
(Squawking)

535
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,084
What's that frightful noise?

536
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,522
- Might I possibly...
- What is your business here?

537
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,523
(Bird squawks)

538
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,993
Come in.

539
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,067
(Lodger) You have news of Where they are?

540
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,271
Stand aside.

541
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Let a Woman's fortitude prevail.

542
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,222
We'll rest here tonight' eh' Nell?

543
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,458
Make a fresh start in the morning.

544
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,910
(Neighing)

545
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,911
(Driver) Yah! Come on!

546
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,952
(Cackles)

547
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,632
What's the matter?

548
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,633
If only I'd gone on for a little bit longer.

549
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,403
My luck Would have turned' I knoW it.

550
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,212
Lose today' Win tomorroW.

551
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,017
HoW much money have We got left?

552
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,622
If We spend the money made at the fair'
enough to eat and sleep Well tonight.

553
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:52,026
What about the money
I gave you for safekeeping?

554
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,302
It's here.

555
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,303
Good.

556
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,482

557
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,331
(Clinking)

558
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,746
(Door creaks' closes)

559
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,785
Ah! (Laughs)

560
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,023
Gentlemen' let us gamble.

561
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,096
For everything.

562
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,097
(Man) Ooh!

563
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,378

564
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,952
Bags! Careful!

565
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,228

566
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,953

This Way' sir.

Top of the stairs' sir.

571
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,632
(Birdsong)

572
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,896
(Sighs) Nectar.

573
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,902
Hello' there.

574
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,905
Don't look so startled' I'm being friendly.

575
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,609
Who Won the Helter-Skelter horse race?

576
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,047
- The Helter-Skelter' ma'am?
- Yes' child.

577
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,151
The Helter-Skelter horse race at the fair.

578
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,152
- Horse...
- We don't knoW' ma'am.

579
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,424
Don't knoW? But you Were there.

580
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,425
I saW you With my own eyes' yesterday.

581
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,695
You Were in the company of a Mr. Punch.
A very loW and vulgar Wretch.

582
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,134
I think you may have been mistaken' ma'am.

583
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,135
(Coughs) I mistake nothin'' child.

584
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,405
You Were Workin' With two...showmen.

585
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,811
Do you knoW the two gentlemen' ma'am?

586
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,749
No.

587
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,750
Do I look like I'd mingle
With the likes of the puppetry trade?

588
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,456
We beg your pardon' ma'am.

589
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,491
Granted. Granted.

590
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,492
Still' I can understand you being ashamed
of Working With such vagabonds.

591
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,103
Come back here.

592
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,104
Come' come. Close' I say.

593
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,982
You'd better have some breakfast.

594
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,983
You both look like you're in need of it.

595
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:49,323
An old man and a girl' you say?

596
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,128
Yes' sir. They left Without payin'.

597
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,134
(Muffled) Disgustin'.

598
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,107
(Belches)

599
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,108
Salt.

600
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,086
What direction did they go' landlord?

601
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,087
I've no idea' sir' more's the pity.
Just up and left.

602
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,530
Well...

603
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,866
It's bad manners.

604
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:44,914
Quite.

605
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,915
Eat and drink as much as you like.
Don't spare anything.

606
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,619
It's a lovely knuckle of ham.
HoW do you find it' Grandfather?

607
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,591
Very tasty' ma'am. Mm!

608
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,592
What kind of business are you in' ma'am?

609
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:02,363
Read that' child.

610
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,336
- Jarley's Waxworks?
- Aye.

611
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,337
That is me.
I am the World-famous Mrs. Jarley.

612
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,509
Jarley's is the delight of the nobility'
and of the royal family.

613
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,282
Oh' yes. They've all patronized me.

614
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,020
Do you...Do you knoW?
I've never seen a Waxworks ma'am.

615
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,857
Is it funnier than Punch and Judy?

616
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,360
Funnier' sir? HoW dare you?

617
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,930
- My collection' sir' is not funny.
- Oh' please forgive me.

618
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,267
No jokings and squawkings
like your rickety-booth players. No' no.

619
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,772
Jarley's hysterical and famous Waxworks
is exhibiting at the Royal Assembly Rooms.

620
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,412
Ah.

621
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,847
I dare say We'd like to visit' ma'am.

622
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,848
- But I'm not certain.
- No' We are poor people' ma'am.

623
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,685
We have no Work as yet and I only Wish We had.

624
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,425
You amaze me more and more.

625
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,426
NoW' What line are you in?
What do you...What do you call yourselves?

626
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,731
- Beggars.
- (Splutters) Nell!

627
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,732
Beggars? Oh! Oh' pass me the teapot.

628
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,470
Do my eyes' nose and ears deceive me?

629
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,015
But you can read and that' Well' that's a mercy.
And Write too' I shouldn't Wonder.

630
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,255
Of course.

631
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,256
You'll journey With me today' I hope?
Grandfather?

632
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,261
But that's marvelous' marvelous.
And in the meanwhile'

633
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,262
We'll talk about finding you
some respectable employment.

634
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,736
(Pouring)

635
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,737
You're browned by the sun' I see.

636
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,411
Have you been traveling far?
Pretty nigh all over the West Country' sir.

637
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,983
I've talked to travelers and fairground folk

638
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,984
from most parts of England
but none from the West Country.

639
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,456
I pray you can help me
With the information I'm seeking.

640
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,457
- We'll do our best' sir.
- You can depend upon us' sir.

641
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,560
Especially...

642
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,561
- If you make it Worth our While...
- Sir.

643
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,165
(Footsteps)

644
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,568
(Door opens)

645
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,341
Been at Workhouse.

646
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,676
D'you see this?

647
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,677
Right. Don't say you never get
any meat here.

648
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,417
Thank you' miss.

649
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,418
Don't answer back.

650
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,824
(Clicking)

651
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,030
You knoW them' the old man and child?

652
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,101
Tell me' Where are they?

653
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,578
Here.

654
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,579
Sovereign apiece.

655
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,291
Er... Hm...

656
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,292
(Coughs)

657
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,531
(Clinking)

658
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,704
- Thank you' sir.
- Much obliged' sir.

659
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,106
- Where are they?
- The last time We saW them'

660
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,107
- the old man and the girl...
- They Were traveling in that direction...

661
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,711
There!

662
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,181
- Do you knoW Where they've gone' sir?
- I think I do' ma'am.

663
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,518
And it's my hope to travel
to the old gentleman and child today.

664
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,923
But first I need to ask...

665
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,924
- Will you let your son come With me?
- Me' sir?

666
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,528
I'm not sure the old gentleman
Will Want to see me.

667
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,933
Your presence' Kit'
Would assure Nell of my friendly intentions.

668
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,934
Why shouldn't he Want to see you' sir?

669
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,772
There Was a disagreement
between us a long time ago

670
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,375
Which has banished us
from meeting for many years.

671
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,376
- You been away' sir?
- Yes' ma'am.

672
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,813
- I made my fortune living abroad.
- But We still don't knoW Who you are' sir.

673
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,285
Why should We trust you if you Won't say?

674
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,286
- I cannot say.
- (Sighs) Then my son cannot help you' sir.

675
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,692
Very Well.

676
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,603
If I Were to tell you my full history...

677
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,940
perhaps then you might help me.

678
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,979
Perhaps We may' sir.

679
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,487
(Applause)

680
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,356
(Nell) Ladies and gentlemen.

681
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:57,357
Mary' Queen of Scotland'
you have been found guilty of high treason.

682
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,194
You must take your punishment
before the great British public.

683
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:02,765
(Drum roll)

684
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,766
(Audience gasps' applauds)

685
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,510
Here' sir. Yours and the child's Wages.

686
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,749
Is anything the matter' sir?

687
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:29,022
(Splutters) No. No' ma'am.

688
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,503
- Another game' perhaps?
- You've taken all the money I have.

689
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,176
- You are your own master' I hope?
- NoW' don't jest With me' sir.

690
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,048
Could always borroW some' I suppose.

691
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,920
BorroW?

692
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,921
And When you're able' pay it back again.

693
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,157
And Who do you propose
that I should borroW from?

694
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,896
Well...

695
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,335
If the good lady Who keeps
the Waxworks has money

696
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,336
and keeps it' I believe'
in a tin box under her bed...

697
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,509
- but does not lock her door for fear of fire...
- You mean rob Mrs. Jarley' sir?

698
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,316
BorroW' sir.

699
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,951
BorroW.

700
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,952
Where's the harm in that?

701
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,589
Think about it' sir.

702
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,193
The delights of bright' shining golden coins
clinking into your pocket.

703
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,034
Money' sir.

704
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,106
Winning...sir.

705
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,612
Game of cards' sir?

706
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,656
Nell?

707
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,328
What are you doing here?

708
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,329
Mm? Is there something Wrong?

709
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,709
Do you think...

710
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,710
gentlemen Who spend
their time playing cards are honest men?

711
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,519
Why do you ask?

712
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,520
Why shouldn't they be honest men?

713
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,125
I lost some money While staying at the inn.

714
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,464
Unless it Was taken by somebody'
only in jest.

715
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,135
Who Would take money in jest?

716
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,638
Those Who take it' take it to keep.

717
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,613
Then it Was stolen.

718
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,818
Wasn't it?

719
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,221
Well...

720
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,222
Tell nobody about it
and perhaps We'll find it again.

721
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,759
All the losses that Were ever made
are not Worth any tears.

722
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,598
Why should they be...
When I can Win them back again?

723
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,539
I had a dreadful dream.

724
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:36,076
A dream of an old man in a darkened room'
robbing sleepers of their gold.

725
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,386
No' child.

726
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,387
- No.
- Yes.

727
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,893
The dream Was real.

728
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,664
Too real.

729
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,801
We must leave here
before that dream comes true again.

730
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,938
- No. Nell' no' I...
- Yes' Grandfather.

731
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,476
We must.

732
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,549
(Mrs' Jarley) l can't understand it, sir

733
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,550
Nell and her grandfather have vanished
like Winter smoke off an old maid's chimney.

734
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Why should they do that' ma'am? By your
accounts they Were happy and content here.

735
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,657
I'd like to think so but you can never tell
With travelers. They have restless souls.

736
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,694
- Any idea Where they might have gone?
- I'm afraid not. That poor girl.

737
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,465
What Will become of her?

738
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,466
I did have my suspicions about
the old gentleman's state of mind.

739
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,803
He seemed' Well' rather agitated at times.

740
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,574
A caring man for the child' no doubt' sir.

741
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,777
- But not happy Within himself. He's a...
- A liar and a thief.

742
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,181
Good heavens! What you doin''
hidin' behind Mrs. Fanny Firkins?

743
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,885
Do you Want to cause us all a fright?
My heart is thumping' sir!

744
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,622
- Good day' sir. We meet again.
- What is your business here' Quilp?

745
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:00,393
Well' same as yours. I'm looking
for the old man and his granddaughter.

746
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,965
I hope you're satisfied' sir. Your behavior's
reduced the old man and child to beggars'

747
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,271
driven them from house and home.

748
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,573
Why should that concern you?

749
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,574
Oh' the old miser
owes you money too' I bet.

750
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,712
- Your talk is offensive' sir.
- He's a thief' and the girl's no better.

751
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,383
If you shoW any more impudence
you Will oblige me to beat you'

752
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,753
- you little monkey.
- What'd you say?

753
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,725
In the name of common sense'

754
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,726
have you any idea
of the old man's Whereabouts?

755
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,062
What do you take me for' sir?
A gypsy conjurer?

756
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,099
Then We have nothing more
to say to each other. Good day.

757
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,903
Is that so?

758
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,172
Yes. Pray' leave us.

759
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,173
I Won't have my Waxworks contaminated
With interference! Oh dear' no.

760
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,312
Get out of here.

761
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,313
Oh' I go Willing' sir' but remember this -

762
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,752
Wherever that old man and child have gone'
they cannot hide forever.

763
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,658
I'll make it my chief duty to find them
and When I do...

764
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,296
may God help 'em both.

765
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,701
(Quilp Whistles tune)

766
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,786
Lean on me' Grandfather.

767
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,787
Oh...I can't Walk any further' child.

768
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,361
We'll have to... We'll have to rest.

769
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,168
But Where are We to go?

770
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:49,004
We don't knoW anybody here.

771
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,005
Well' We'll seek out...
the kindness of strangers' Nell.

772
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,016
I don't understand you' Grandfather.

773
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:04,017
You must...

774
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,620
You must beg' child.

775
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,831
Beg?

776
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,832
Yes' child' at once.

777
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,399
One...gentleman's hat.

778
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,170
Found floating in the river' sir.

779
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,274
By his counting house.

780
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,644
It looks...
very much like my husband's hat.

781
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,882
But...We cannot be certain.

782
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:12,252
HoW long has Mr. Quilp been missing'
Mrs. Jiniwin?

783
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,555
Oh' disappeared Without a Word
four days ago' ma'am.

784
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,193
Nobody has seen him'
including those Who owe him money.

785
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,798
If he turns up anywhere he'll...float ashore
somewhere in Deptford tomorroW morning.

786
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,472
Just in time for the flea market.

787
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,473
(Betsy) Oh...poor Daniel.

788
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:37,043
NoW...to the descriptive announcement
of his death in the newspapers.

789
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,083
Isn't that a little presumptuous'
Mr. Brass?

790
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,953
Not if you Want his life insurance' ma'am.

791
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,954
We must not alloW grief
to freeze our faculties.

792
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,958
Well' erm...I Would describe Mr. Quilp

793
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,662
as' erm...legs crooked...

794
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,936
short' er' body...

795
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,170
Erm...

796
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,206
Nose?

797
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,807
Pinched?

798
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,742
No. Flat.

799
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,612
(Shouts) Aquiline!

800
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,613
Aquiline' you old hag!

801
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,850
Do you call this flat? Do you?

802
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:20,286
Do you? Eh?

803
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:23,656
Risen! From a Watery grave!

804
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,227
(Thunder)

805
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,228
Excuse me... Excuse me' please...

806
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,965
- Please...
- Out of my Way.

807
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,935
- Please...
- No. No.

808
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,806
Please. Please.

809
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:46,946
(Neighing)

810
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,786
I have some urgent business
for you both.

811
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,391
Certainly' sir.

812
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,127
Private business.
Put away your book' Mr. Brass.

813
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,128
- I don't Want anything in Writing.
- Oh' nothing in Writing.

814
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,367
We understand you' Mr. Quilp.

815
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,368
It concerns that boy's
neW-found friendship With your lodger.

816
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,405
Christopher Nubbles.
An extremely pleasant child.

817
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,808
- I don't like him.
- Nor I.

818
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:19,612
The boy...thwarts me.

819
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,652
I owe him a grudge.

820
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,187
And this neW friendship With your lodger

821
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:29,188
makes him a greater threat
to our finding the old man and child.

822
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,959
HoW eloquent is Mr. Quilp.
Remarkable man of language.

823
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,996
Hush' brother.

824
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,997
Come to the point' sir.

825
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,869
The boy insults my importance.

826
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,805
- He's a menace.
- Precisely.

827
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,806
Devise your own means
of keeping him away from the lodger.

828
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:51,377
Then I Will pay you handsomely
for your pains.

829
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,516
- Anything for you' Mr. Quilp.
- Of course' Mr. Quilp.

830
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,162
Thank you.

831
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:15,601
- Please' ma'am...
- Get out of my Way.

832
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:29,048
(Sobs)

833
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,466
Nobody cares' Grandfather.

834
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,467
Bid to their mercy' Nell.
We must eat tonight.

835
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,105
I...I...I can't' Grandfather. I...

836
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,106
If you loved me' Nellie'
you'd find us money.

837
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,379
- Please don't make me.
- I need money to exist!

838
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,414
- Please don't...
- To invest! I...

839
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,449
- Just do it!
- No!

840
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,450
Can't you see I'm desperate?

841
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,888
Please...

842
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,529
Please. Please.

843
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,475
(Coughs)

844
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,922
Nell! Oh...

845
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,692
Oh' my God!

846
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,697
Nell!

847
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,338
Will nobody help us?

848
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:32,507
In God's name!

849
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,508
Please!
Please' somebody help us! Please!

850
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,779
(Neighing)

851
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,447
Oh' please help us!

852
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,448
For God's sake' stop the carriage.

853
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,722
Let me help you' sir.

854
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,723
Try to stand' child. Can you stand?

855
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:56,929
(Whispers)

856
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,235
Oh' Kit.

857
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,303
Come in' come in.

858
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,304
A Word' if I may.

859
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,844
- Is anything the matter' sir?
- Matter?

860
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,980
No. Why should anything be the matter?

861
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,981
You look like you're in pain' sir.

862
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,417
Oh' pooh-pooh. I never felt better.
Mere fancy.

863
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,822
NoW' I've been thinking.

864
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,491
- Your mother's a WidoW' is she not?
- Yes' sir.

865
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,693
A harder Working or better Woman
never lived.

866
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,694
Aah' poor young WidoW
struggling to maintain her family.

867
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,931
It's a delicious picture of
human goodness' don't you think?

868
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,369
Put your hat down' Kit.

869
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,370
- Thank you' sir' but I have to get going.
- No' no' no' put it down. Stay a While.

870
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,112
NoW' What's to prevent us giving
this good young Woman' your mother'

871
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,149
a nice Wage in return for a little light
dusting and Washing? What do you say?

872
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,022
See any objection?

873
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,524
HoW can I see any objection
to such a kind offer' sir?

874
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,259
Very Well' then.

875
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,794
It's done.

876
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,729
We'll say no more.

877
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,232
- Sammy?
- Er' yes' sister?

878
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,233
- Come here and help me.
- Of course.

879
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:10,303
Will you excuse me...Kit?

880
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,708
I got him Wrong' sir.
He seems a generous' honest man.

881
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:19,445
Does he?

882
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,858
Well' sir' if that's all' I-I'd best be off.

883
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,661
Yes' you run along' honest young felloW.

884
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,662
And tell your mother all We discussed.

885
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,073
Oh' dear me. Dear me.

886
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,074
- What have you lost' Sammy?
- A #5 note.

887
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:55,448
I laid it down here.

888
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,719
- Oh' God bless me.
- What?

889
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,755
- It's gone.
- #5?

890
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,992
Well' never mind. What's #5?

891
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,097
The boy's honest' you knoW.
Very honest.

892
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,098
Yes. It's far too mean to suspect him.

893
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:35,187
(Sighs)

894
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,730
Kit Nubbles' come back here!

895
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,943
(Bell chiming)

896
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,722
We need help here!

897
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,723
Blankets. Get some blankets.
And get a fire lit.

898
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,668
- Well' Sammy?
- Nothing here.

899
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,938
- All is perfectly satisfactory.
- Told you so. I Wish you'd believed me.

900
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,109
The boy is innocent' Mr. Quilp.
My examination proves it.

901
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,614
Very Well. He may go.

902
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,584
But first...

903
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,454
- Search his hat.
- His What?

904
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,455
The hat. Mr. SWiveller' if you please.

905
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,895
Inside the lining.

906
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:50,896
- The lining?
- The lining.

907
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,909
Oh... I kneW it.

908
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:07,113
Like his master.
The boy's a liar and a thief.

909
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,385
I never did it.
Please' you've got to believe me.

910
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,054
Oh' miserable miscreant.

911
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,055
Is this the boy Who Was going to benefit
from my benevolence?

912
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,892
Please. Sir.

913
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,893
Honest' sir' I never stole nothing.

914
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:25,297
A constable' if you please.

915
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,777
Stop struggling' lad.

916
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,546
I never Wronged anyone
of a farthing' sir. Honest!

917
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,982
I only Wish I could doubt
the evidence of my senses'

918
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,651
but the dispositions are unimpeachable.

919
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:46,120
A moral funeral.

920
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:48,589
Help is at hand' Kit' I promise.

921
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,590
I'm afraid you Won't be able
to help each other noW' sir.

922
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,060
Oh...What a disappointment
for your mother

923
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,165
and this kind gentleman
Who has trusted you so much.

924
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,568
Such...treachery.
I can hardly believe it myself.

925
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,839
You...little monkey.

926
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,111
- Drive on' Coachie!
- (Neighing)

927
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:31,032
Your good health.

928
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,033
Cheery be' Mr. SWiveller.

929
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,905
- (Coughs)
- What does your mistress call you?

930
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,542
- A little devil.
- Really?

931
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,215
Well' to make this evening
seem all the more real and pleasant'

932
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:50,216
I think I shall call you...

933
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,920
the Marchioness.

934
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,655
Oh' sir' yes.

935
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,625
Oh' hoW I should like that so very much.

936
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,626
It makes everything between us so...
properly...dignified' don't it?

937
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,899
It does.

938
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,670
Tell me' do they often leave you
locked up down here?

939
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,671
Almost always.

940
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,774
At least' she Would...
if I didn't own her ladyship's spare key.

941
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:21,413
HoW very ingenious of you'
Marchioness!

942
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,063
Marchioness' it occurs to me
that you must be in the constant habit

943
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:39,064
of airing your eye at keyholes
to knoW all you knoW.

944
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:42,067
Oh' yes' sir.

945
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,070
I hear things through chinks and keyholes
that Would make your hair curl.

946
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:50,643
Still...I never thought them
capable of such an evil deed.

947
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,682
That poor boy.

948
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,486
What are you talking about'
Marchioness?

949
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,292
(Shouting)

950
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,827
- In!
- Please' sir...

951
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:09,828
Well...congratulations'
you...false Witness.

952
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,434
(All chuckle)

953
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:16,435
You...perjurer.

954
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,873
You...suborners of evidence.

955
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,011
He's the richest of humors'
don't you think' Sally?

956
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:27,012
- Most amazing vein of comicality.
- Very droll' brother.

957
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:30,549
Well' I...I'm pleased you think so.

958
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,286
The fact is' sir' any...allusion
to these little...conspiracies of ours...

959
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:39,126
What conspiracies
are you talking about' Mr. Brass?

960
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,596
Exactly' sir. Caution. Caution.

961
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,565
Don't talk to me of your conspirings.

962
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:47,566
Do I knoW anything about you
and your sister's lies?

963
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,371
- I haven't conspired With anybody.
- Quite right' sir.

964
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,277
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

965
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:59,246
All is forgotten.

966
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,247
Good.

967
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,955
(Door opens)

968
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,626
(Footsteps receding)

969
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,429
(Outer door closes)

970
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,906
(Whistling Wind)

971
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:16,789
(Man) Aces.

972
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,561
Take two back' sir.

973
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,331
Luck might change.

974
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:35,074
Nell.

975
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:38,477
Nell!

976
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,050
Nell.

977
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,124
Forgive me.

978
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,125
God forgive me.

979
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,097
She's tired herself out' sir.

980
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:01,867
No' Reverend. She's tired of life.

981
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:08,273
I've broken her heart.

982
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,111
With my false promises.

983
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,851
Then...repent' sir.

984
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:19,353
For good.

985
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,354
Before it's too late.

986
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,894
Confess the truth.

987
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,895
Your serving girl is our Witness.
She saW and overheard everything.

988
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:33,067
- The girl's a liar.
- Still' brother' keep your reserve.

989
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,468
I congratulate you' ma'am.

990
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:37,469
You have the honor of being sister to
one of the greatest rogues that ever lived.

991
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,507
If I may venture to say' miss' you are
in every respect quite Worthy of him.

992
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,179
HoW dare you suggest
I had any kind of dealings...

993
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,848
In league With you both
is' I believe' a third party.

994
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,849
- A felon by the name of...
- Quilp.

995
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:54,054
Hold your tongue' Workhouse.

996
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:56,390
Quilp is the prime devil
of this Whole affair' isn't he?

997
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,926
Be careful' sir. What you say is slander.

998
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:01,762
HoW very true' brother.
A scullery-maid's Word

999
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,763
against two honorable members of the
legal profession. Who Would believe her?

1000
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,404
- Give that back to me!
- He Writes everything down' sir.

1001
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,806
Hush your mouth!

1002
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,175
He keeps a list
of all the evil doings he's done.

1003
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,176
I've seen it all. Through my keyhole.

1004
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,614
Here is your evidence' sir.

1005
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:23,615
Every Word Written down for
all the World to see. The man's a rogue.

1006
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,453
- Oh' Sally!
- Restraint.

1007
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,454
- Mr. Quilp told you to Write nothing down.
- To cover his own tracks.

1008
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:32,459
- Why should I listen to him?
- Oh' Sammy...

1009
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:35,095
There's enough evidence here
to lock you both away for life.

1010
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:38,065
(Whispers) Oh' let us confess.
Let us make it easier upon...

1011
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:40,134
- ..upon ourselves.
- What are you doing?

1012
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,135
Sally' these gentlemen are offering us
some kind of pardon if We help them.

1013
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,605
- Are you not?
- Hardly that' sir.

1014
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,376
But I suppose your good faith
might be acknowledged

1015
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,445
When considering your crimes.

1016
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,848
Did you hear that' sister?

1017
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,883
Very Well' then.

1018
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,884
My answer to all these crimes'
and more...

1019
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:01,455
is...

1020
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,456
- Quilp.
- No.

1021
