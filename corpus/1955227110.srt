00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,373
[Phone ringing]

2
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,374
RICHIE (ON PHONE): Hello?

3
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,175
JOEY (ON PHONE): Hoo!

4
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,210
Hey, Richie!

5
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,711
Yoohoo!

6
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,346
I'm getting married!

7
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,514
RICHIE (ON PHONE): Is this Joey?

8
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,482
JOEY (ON PHONE): Liz and
I are tying the knot.

9
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,118
Everyone's coming back
into town for a huge bash.

10
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,552
RICHIE (ON PHONE): It's
4:00 in the morning

11
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,254
And you're calling
about a goddamn wedding?

12
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,355
Yeah.

13
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:55,656
I'm telling you, buddy,
it's gonna be great.

14
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,590
Yeah.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,858
Liz is gonna
decorate the garage.

16
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:02,230
We're gonna have everything...
Kegs, booze, hot dogs.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,964
RICHIE (ON PHONE):
Big get together, huh?

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,699
Yeah, party's Saturday night.

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,535
I expect everyone to have
a hangover for the wedding,

20
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,469
You got it?

21
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,303
RICHIE (ON PHONE):
I can't believe

22
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,104
You're gonna marry that broad.

23
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,539
Yeah, she finally broke me.

24
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,040
But hell, after six
years of going out,

25
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,475
You kind of run out of excuses.

26
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,111
RICHIE (ON PHONE): Joey, I gotta
get up for work in two hours.

27
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,746
Listen, I gotta go, OK?
RICHIE (ON PHONE): Good night.

28
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,548
Yeah, it's gonna be great to
see you and the whole gang.

29
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:21,715
All right?
RICHIE (ON PHONE): Bye.

30
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,516
OK, bye.

31
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:36,797
[Inaudible] Lola.

32
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,166
I gotta tell you.

33
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,900
You and your girls have done
a hell of a job tonight, man.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,237
Really.

35
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,872
You've really
outdone yourselves.

36
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,809
I wanted your last night
to be very special with us.

37
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,146
Yes, you've been a
loyal customer, Joe.

38
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,715
You have been so
loyal that we are

39
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:59,019
Going to put you in our hall
of fame scrapbook, Joey.

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,820
Pictures?

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,255
Cool!

42
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,958
I've come to bury
Caesar, not to praise him.

43
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:09,730
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,234
The evil that men
do lives after them.

45
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:17,371
The good is often
interred with their bones.

46
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,373
So let it be with Caesar...

47
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,348
[Barking]

48
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,832
What did he do?

49
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,200
Knock you up or something?

50
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,269
Shut up, Carol.

51
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,104
Will you look at
the size of it?

52
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,739
How'd Joey pay for that?

53
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,575
Oh, he put it on
Mom's credit card.

54
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,876
Top line cubic zirconium.

55
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,418
What's that freak doing here?

56
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,486
She comes in here every day.

57
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,589
Hi.

58
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,324
Can I help you?

59
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,458
Um, yes.

60
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,761
I... I'd like to see the, um...

61
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,562
The ring?

62
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,898
The, um... yes.

63
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:51,699
Sure.

64
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,472
Are you actually
going to buy it today?

65
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,440
Or do you just wanna look it?

66
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,608
I just wanna look at it.

67
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,419
Thank you.

68
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,920
Eww.

69
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,755
Next time, try washing
your hands, you

70
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,624
Little piece of trash.

71
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:17,658
Hey.

72
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,459
I'm sorry, honey.

73
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,693
I didn't mean you.

74
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,494
Yeah, whatever.

75
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,332
Hey.

76
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,132
Can I have 50 bucks?

77
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,685
Hi.

78
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,220
Mr. Thatcher's math class.

79
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,555
You were in the first row.

80
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,728
Cassandra.

81
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,665
Cassandra Heimlich?

82
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,900
Holmbeck.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,234
You used to be so smart.

84
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,776
You used to be different.

85
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,379
Want a chocolate?

86
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,179
Oh god.

87
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,589
Mother of baby Jesus!

88
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,390
Do you hear that?

89
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,558
I'm sorry, Daddy.

90
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,358
Do you?

91
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,593
I'm sorry, Daddy.

92
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,730
That's what I found the
radio tuned to this morning.

93
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,897
Now get in the car!

94
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,837
And take off those
ridiculous stockings.

95
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,481
God be with you.

96
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,961
You're going home
to pray, young lady.

97
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,028
No, Daddy.

98
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,964
I'll teach you the
meaning of discipline.

99
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,432
But I was only talking.

100
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,434
LUTHER: Talking
leads to touching.

101
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,435
And touching leads to doing.

102
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,807
Hi, Joanie.

103
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,776
And here are your films.

104
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,745
You're welcome.

105
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,247
[Singing]

106
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,296
No!

107
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,998
You know, this
is gonna be great.

108
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,901
You know, just getting out
of the city for a while,

109
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,869
Spending a nice,
relaxing weekend

110
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,005
In the sleepy little
hamlet where I grew up.

111
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,474
Still can't believe they
gave you the weekend off.

112
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,910
Only been working here
for a couple of days.

113
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,313
Let's just not
talk about that, OK?

114
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,781
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

115
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,582
You're not.

116
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,617
I

117
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,586
I can't believe you
lost another job.

118
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,055
Do you know how much you
owe me in back rent alone?

119
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,624
Oh come on, for Christ's sakes.

120
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,758
No, it was a stupid video store!

121
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,726
No!

122
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,160
I have too much
education for that.

123
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,095
Besides, they had a
lousy foreign section.

124
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:42,896
Oh god.

125
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:43,831
What?

126
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,632
All right.

127
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:45,499
How much is it?

128
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,968
[Horn beeping]

129
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:05,886
Listen, Liz.

130
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,887
We're gonna split now.

131
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,389
Yeah.

132
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,525
Ah, and speaking of split,
don't forget about the league

133
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,359
Tonight.

134
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,763
Mark's picking us up at 8:00.

135
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,098
Bowling tonight?

136
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,368
I thought you were gonna be
with me when the guests arrive.

137
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,237
I'll give you a call later.

138
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,740
Listen, tiger, I got work to do.

139
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,841
Come on.

140
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,176
How about a little,
uh, afternoon delight?

141
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,780
No, Sloppy.

142
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,281
Someone's gotta start
paying for that honeymoon.

143
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,649
Oh, come on.

144
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:42,690
Haven't had my recommended daily
allowance of, uh, Vitamin F.

145
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,593
Here, but promise me
no more bets, Joey.

146
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,963
And don't forget to
clean up the kitchen

147
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,699
Before the guests arrive.
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,906
Oh my goodness, baby.

149
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:02,876
Look what you've done to her!

150
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,544
Ow!

151
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,345
Damn it.

152
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:11,819
Mom, what is it?

153
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,245
Hey.

154
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,881
Can you tell me where I
can get a beaver license?

155
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,717
I said, can you tell me where
I can get a beaver license?

156
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,118
I hear there's good
to beaver hunting

157
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,488
Up near where the river meets
Trogsden, Trogsden High School.

158
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,028
Are you gonna just sit
there all day or what?

159
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,434
Yeah, sorry.

160
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,803
My trunk release is broken.

161
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:03,603
You know how it is.

162
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:10,944
Whoops.

163
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,913
Sorry about that.

164
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,247
Come on, buddy.
Get the lead out.

165
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:14,915
Come on.
Let's go!

166
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,800
Just try to have
a good time, OK?

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,600
Sure.

168
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,534
Please?

169
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,435
Oh, come on.

170
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,937
Look.

171
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,406
Have a little more consideration
for my stuff, all right?

172
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,373
Is that too much to ask?

173
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,612
Damn it.

174
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,047
Stop complaining
just for one minute.

175
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:47,981
I don't care.
Look.

176
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,116
Just for one weekend.

177
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,550
Oh my god.

178
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,351
Look at this.

179
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,224
Great.
What?

180
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,058
Great.

181
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,928
Please, just for me... hah-hah!

182
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,830
Sloppy Joe!

183
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,630
Man.

184
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:04,431
Man.

185
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,532
How you doing?
Great.

186
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,333
Couldn't be better.

187
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,134
Couldn't be better.

188
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,669
Looking good.

189
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,407
Oh, this must be
your better half.

190
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,876
We're... we're just friends.

191
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,310
Oh, come on, honey.

192
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,578
She's just kidding.

193
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,181
We've had sex many times.

194
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:21,982
I'm glad.

195
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,925
So, tell me, Goon.

196
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,026
What you better
up to, old buddy?

197
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:33,861
Huh?

198
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,296
Huh?

199
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,765
Nothing, huh?

200
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,232
That's great.

201
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,233
That's great.

202
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,034
Real proud of you.

203
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,008
Where is everybody, man?

204
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,310
I thought everybody would
be rocking here by now.

205
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,712
Well, Stumpy should
be here any minute.

206
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,847
Grease got here this morning.

207
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,616
I sent him to pick up
Goon at the bus stop.

208
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,417
Wait, wait, wait.

209
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,119
Ted is here?

210
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,654
I thought Ted was
killed in South America.

211
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,524
No, he was just
missing for a while.

212
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,325
Great.

213
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,997
So come on, man.

214
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,231
How's New York?

215
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,333
You still writing poems?

216
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,267
No way.

217
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,168
Poetry's dead.

218
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,303
Yeah?

219
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,438
I'm working on a pretty
major novel, actually.

220
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,809
Cool title... Days of
Blood, Nights of Sin.

221
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,276
I love it, man.

222
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,114
Got a lot of violence,
lot of sex in there?

223
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:27,915
No.

224
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:28,715
No, actually.

225
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,519
Well, you know what?

226
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,021
I better get on KP before
little Dink gets home.

227
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,588
If I know her, she'll
have a goddamn cow

228
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,723
If she sees all of this.

Get the bastard, Liz.

00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,633
Get him!

234
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,903
Liz, baby, take it
easy on those tires.

235
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:50,838
Uh, Cliff's here.

236
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,638
Remember him?

237
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:52,439
How you doing, Liz?

238
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,540
Good to see you.

239
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,708
You cocksucker.

240
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,578
You motherfucking cocksucker!

241
00:12:58,678 --> 00:12:59,446
Liz, stop her!

242
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,313
A whorehouse?

243
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,949
A whorehouse and
you have my Liz?

244
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,017
I'll kick you in the balls.

245
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,986
Kick him in the johnson, honey.

246
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:06,920
Kick him in the johnson.

247
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,027
Asshole!

248
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,399
MOTHER: Did you kick
him in the johnson, Liz?

249
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,001
I told you to kick
him in the johnson.

250
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,903
LIZ: Mother, shut
up and move over!

251

kick him in the johnson!

What is it?

254
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,165
Que pasa, amigos?

255
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,436
Shit.

the shitkickers

00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,218
You feel all right, man?

Is that Stumpy?

265
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,005
I don't believe it.

266
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:32,940
She got thin.

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,907
Hi, everybody!

268
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,881
I just can't believe
this, Emmett.

269
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,551
I mean, this document's
such a betrayal of trust.

270
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,522
Is she reading Shakespeare?

271
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,431
Uh, excuse me.

where the bathroom is?

Uh, sure.

274
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,637
It's, uh, back down the
hall, past the kitchen

275
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,107
And to your right.

276
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,275
Be careful though.

always clear the bowl.

turns have been stressful.

from becoming an editor.

been together with someone

you're out there working

night before in "Hustler"

the type of freedom

That irresponsible
behavior can bring.

penetrate a pair of whores.

absolutely right.

on cable TV and pornography,

Now can we?

353
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,716
I mean, what modern society just
doesn't want to admit, Paula,

354
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,019
Is that deep down inside,
we're all still animals.

355
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,724
And the male is, by
nature, a polygamist beast.

356

Ask any anthropologist
and he'll tell you.

talking about you.

yourself at home, Felix.

Sloppy Joe out, you know?

365
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,320

mind, if you haven't noticed.

366
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,721
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,057
Well, you know, we had a real

I think I got him coming around.

00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,479
Fact... many were called here

to make the journey!

Why don't you take Mark's turn.

00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,895
No thanks, Carol.

552
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:09,862
I don't need your charity.

Thanks a lot, Liz.

She attacked me, Joey.

560
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,134
I swear.

561
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,401
I had nothing to do with it.

Excuse me, sir, but we're
in the middle of game.

a more convenient time?

How can you do that?
Huh?

How can you kiss him like that?

Liz, you didn't even give
me a chance to explain.

You marched up to the house
like some sort of crackpot.

get a word out,

the implication

Of what they call tactile
presence, if you get my drift?

707
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,932
Sounds good.

708
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,600

look at this part right here?

it on kind of thick, Scoop.

can't hold a job for more

00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,110
Than two weeks, Grease?

729
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:16,748
That I have been paying the
rent for the last seven months?

730
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:21,387
Every morning I wake up to
slave away in Manhattan,

731
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,456
And old Cliff is blissfully
sleeping off last night's

732
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,592
Heavy duty writing session.

733
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,328
[Inaudible] just
happen, you know?

734
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:30,529
OK?

735
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,798
You can't just spit it out
of a computer terminal!

736
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,835
No, just out of trendy cafes
and half empty vodka bottles.

737
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:38,437
Right, Cliff?

738
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,239
Agh!

739
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,874
GREASE: Whoa, score a few
points for Paula there.

740
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,376
Butt out, Grease!

741
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,177
Gimme the keys.

742
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,178
I'm going with Mark.

743
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:46,978
Oh.

744
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:47,779
The key.

745
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,081
OK. Well, here.

746
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,550
Give me the keys, Cliff.

747
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,518
No.

748
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,453
Gimme the keys!

749
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,922
Give me my fucking keys!

750
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,390
Was he like this in high school?

751
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,858
All the time, honey.

752
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,092
Just suck a dick then!

753
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,761
You asshole!

754
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,396
Gimme the keys!

755
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,231
You [inaudible] bitch!

756
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,265
Gimme the key!

757
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:10,101
You can just peddle
your ass home OK?

758
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,137
You want me to be
creative, Cliff?

759
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,272
Huh?

760
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,541
You give me those goddamn
keys, or I'll give

761
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,076
You something to write about.

762
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,012
I'll find a creative way to
make you a soprano, you pussy.

763
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:24,550
Give me the keys.

764
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:32,090
If you want a ride, be
outside in five minutes.

765
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,459
Don't do me any favors, OK?

766
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:39,865
Yeah, I'm kinda bushed.

767
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:40,966
Think I'm gonna head
on home, Sloppy.

768
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,235
You coming?

769
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:47,273
Think, uh, Cliff and I could,
uh, close this joint up?

770
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,374
Sure.

771
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,174
OK, man.

772
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:49,975
Be careful.

773
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,828
Oh, honey.

774
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,964
You're getting puke on yourself.

775
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,765
Here, come on.

776
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,506
Man, I got a lotta calls
to make tomorrow morning.

777
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:23,609
Call all the relatives.

778
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,176
Tell 'em the wedding's off.

779
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,878
Listen, can we just
stop talking about

780
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,980
The stupid wedding already?

781
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,148
Big deal!

782
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,383
Right?

783
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:32,484
I mean, so what?

784
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,919
So Uncle So and So and
Auntie This and That

785
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,588
Can't take pictures and
get drunk at the wedding?

786
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,324
Oh, the world's
gonna stop revolving!

787
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:42,894
Perhaps you're right.

788
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,801
So, um, what's up with
you and Paula, huh?

789
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,636
Oh please.

790
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,037
You two ever think about, uh...

791
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,138
[Whistling]

792
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:53,939
Oh yeah.

793
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,841
Right.

794
00:37:55,941 --> 00:38:00,211
Oh, that emotional vampire.

795
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,848
I can't... that is the
one reason I can't get

796
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,584
Any of my work published.

797
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:09,455
She's just a... shit!

798
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:13,191
You know, It's not easy pouring
your soul into something

799
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,826
When she's in the
background complaining

800
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:15,994
About the freaking phone bill!

801
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,332
You know what, Scoop?

802
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,834
Kind of admire you a little bit.

803
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:23,669
Why?

804
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,737
Oh, because I'm a writer.

805
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,906
No, because you, uh, got
out of this dump, you know?

806
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,107
You made something of yourself.

807
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,185
Shit.

808
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:46,291
Vodka.

809
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,125
Yes, ma'am.

810
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,894
Rocks.

811
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:49,861
Twist.

812
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,329
Yes, yes, ma'am.

813
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,399
Who the hell's that?

814
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,199
Lola.

815
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,073
Oh my god.

816
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,709
Is that Ted?

817
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,510
Oh my god.

818
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,011
He looks so young.

819
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,917
Oh, and that's you.

820
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,386
You had such pretty eyes.

821
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,021
Oh, and there's Cliff
before he moved away.

822
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:22,461
You know, I'm sorry
about tonight, Paula.

823
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,930
I feel like it was all my fault.

824
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,964
Oh no.

825
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,099
No, it was nobody's
fault but his own.

826
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,101
He's a total baby.

827
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,804
Before he moved in with me, I
used to listen to his drunken

828
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,073
Soliloquies for hours.

829
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,576
I actually thought he was deep.

830
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,077
Yeah, it's odd.

831
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,880
I used to think that Cliff
was so aware in high school,

832
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,350
So open-minded, always
listening to Ornette Coleman,

833
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,353
You know, quoting William Blake.

834
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:49,821
[Laughter]

835
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,322
Did he try to hit
on you tonight?

836
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,298
Well, um, I think he really
just wants to get published.

837
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:07,506
Ladies.

838
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,811
Coming for you, man.

839
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,812
She's got your number.

840
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:30,696
So, Joey, I've heard some very
sad news about your wedding,

841
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:31,897
Ja?

842
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:35,634
Well, your pictures didn't
help matters very much.

843
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:39,771
That is the least of
my concerns now, Joey.

844
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:40,572
Hi, Lola.

845
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,544
What is it?

846
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,413
I call it. Uh, Cosmic Grease.

847
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,315
It's a mystical
lubricant I concocted

848
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,783
Three years ago
while playing tennis

849
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:52,918
With some businessmen in Japan.

850
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,789
Oh lord.

851
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:58,590
I have to go to bed.

852
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,896
OK.

853
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:05,697
Whatever.

854
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,640
Mmm.

855
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,907
It's really good.

856
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:16,708
Mhm.

857
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,309
What's in it?

858
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,311
Lola, I'm very tired.

859
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,948
Believe me, I've
had a very long day.

860
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,251
We're going straight home.

861
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,853
We're closing up, people.

862
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,055
[Whiplash]

863
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,027
Lola's very tired too, Joey.

864
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:41,032
Tired of bounced checks
and bad credit cards, yeah?

865
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:44,469
Well, about that, I mean, I
was gonna go to the bank, see

866
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,338
You in the morning and... I go...

867
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,507
You owe me money, Joey.

868
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,614
Lots of money.

869
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:59,184
And I want it by tomorrow, ja?

870
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,825
Entschuldigung, Joey.

871
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,777
Aren't you having any?

872
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,815
Well, I got my own poison.

873
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:30,716
Drink up.

874
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:31,516
It's good.

875
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:42,493
So tell me, Grease,
about all these nicknames.

876
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:50,235
I mean, like, Goon, Sloppy
Joe, I feel like I'm dealing

877
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,269
With the mob or something.

878
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:14,693
But, like Cliff, how
did he get his nickname?

879
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:20,565
Well, Cliff probably thinks he
got his nickname 'cause he used

880
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,702
To work for the school paper.

881
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,872
But I actually call him Scoop
because he used to scoop

882
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:30,676
Girls' asses in school.

883
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,678
What?

884
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:33,712
Scooping girls' asses?

885
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,914
What's that?

886
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,182
You never heard of scooping?

887
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,650
No.

888
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,651
- Get out.
- No.

889
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:40,451
What is it?

890
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:45,657
I'll show you.

891
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:46,457
Come here.

892
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:47,458
What?

893
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,227
Come here.

894
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,028
Turn around.

895
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,664
Turn around.

896
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,465
What is it?

897
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,467
This is scooping.

898
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,336
Hey!

899
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:00,872
Let me go.

900
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,673
Make me.

901
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,578
And Goon?

902
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,546
How'd that come about?

903
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,617
Well, he just looks like goon.

904
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,423
What about Margaret?

905
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:24,362
Well, she used to be
fat, really, really fat.

906
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:28,499
You know, short and
squatty, like a tree stump.

907
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,334
And Grease?

908
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:40,211
Because of my Machiavellian
schemes, I guess.

909
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,546
Am I one of your
Machiavellian schemes?

910
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,018

00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,707
OK.
All right.

1099
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:23,508
Shit's going down.

1100
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:24,408
Shit's going down.

1101
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:25,910
What do you do?

1102
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:26,844
[Gunshot]

1103
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:27,778
Jesus

1104
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:28,746
What was that?

1105
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:29,547
Sounded like gunfire.

1106
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:32,717
What are you?

1107
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:33,651
Nuts?

1108
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,285
Maybe it was a
couple of hunters.

1109
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,420
It's not hunting season.

1110
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,922
Sounded like it
came from out back.

1111
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:38,723
Come here.

1112
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:39,524
Come here.

1113
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:40,991
Come here!

1114
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,693
Get down.

1115
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,094
Get the fuck down!

1116
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,564
POLICEWOMAN (ON RADIO):
127 Rosco to 92 Parker.

1117
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:47,765
92, go head.

1118
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:49,133
POLICEWOMAN (ON
RADIO): Complaints

1119
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:52,336
Of a car stuck in an open septic
tank down in Hilltop Farms.

1120
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:53,804
Over.

1121
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,405
You guys there?

1122
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:56,206
Roger.

1123
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,274
Be right over.

1124
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,676
Looks like this'll
have to wait till later.

1125
00:57:58,776 --> 00:57:59,476
We'll be back.

1126
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,556
Well, at any rate, I
wouldn't be doing any bowling

1127
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:12,557
For a while, Sloppy.

1128
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:14,491
Yeah, especially
not on ladies' night.

1129
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,261
Thanks for the advice, guys.

1130
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:20,097
Hey, isn't that Ted
Condosta down there?

1131
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,098
Thanks a lot, man.

1132
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:22,066
Thanks a lot.

1133
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:22,933
Hey.

1134
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,401
Hey, Ted!

1135
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,202
Hey.

1136
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,313
[Siren wails]

1137
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,283
A fucking restraining order?

1138
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,084
I can't believe it.

1139
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:43,453
Fucking bitch.

1140
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:44,589
I'm gonna kill her, man.

1141
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,956
[Mumbling]

1142
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,428
Hey, man.

1143
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,097
They coming back here or what?

1144
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,399
Can you believe that bitch put
a restraining order on me, huh?

1145
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:56,433
The fucking nerve!

1146
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,371
Wow.

1147
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,840
What a bitch.

1148
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,475
Uh, technically, she
can't actually have one...

1149
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:08,412
Shut the hell up goon!

1150
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,080
Goddamn it.

1151
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,483
I feel like I'm just gonna...

1152
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:16,220
I know what you feel like, man.

1153
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,825
I know exactly what'll make you
and me feel a whole lot better.

1154
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:22,993
What?

1155
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:25,329
Whirly.

1156
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,997
Whirly.

1157
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:35,606
Whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly,
whirly, whirly, whirly, whirly!

1158
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,442
I haven't flushed yet, guys!

1159
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,910
Aw, shit!

1160
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,947
Whirly, whirly, whirly!

1161
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,048
Listen.

1162
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,083
I don't care if she
already picked it up.

1163
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,417
No.

1164
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,620
There's no way I'm paying for
that fucking wedding cake.

1165
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,922
Do you hear me, huh?

1166
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:52,757
No way!

1167
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:58,595
Please, Cliff.

1168
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:02,099
You have no idea how
much light hurts me.

1169
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,901
Well, all I can say
is if somebody wants

1170
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:05,836
Their stupid
sunglasses back, they'd

1171
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,874
Better sit down and just take a
few moments to look at my work.

1172
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:10,675
OK?

1173
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:24,121
God, I have such a hangover.

1174
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:27,024
Yeah, probably used
too much bourbon.

1175
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:27,958
I'm sorry.

1176
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,559
I hope you don't
think I was trying

1177
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,495
To take advantage of you.

1178
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,463
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1179
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,833
You were wonderful last night.

1180
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:38,302
Oh yeah?

1181
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:41,405
Well, I guess I have picked up
a few things over the years.

1182
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:45,209
That's the first time
I've ever cheated on Cliff.

1183
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,043
Wait a minute.

1184
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,078
You wanted it just as bad as me.

1185
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:51,048
And it's not cheating unless
you actually do it, OK?

1186
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,449
No, no. You don't get it.

1187
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,785
Have you ever gotten
completely shit-faced

1188
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,453
And then made out with
someone you're not

1189
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:59,623
Even remotely attracted too?

1190
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:00,891
Yeah.

1191
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:04,394
It's so fucking liberating.

1192
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,696
Wait a minute.

1193
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,531
What's that supposed to mean?

1194
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,967
You know, you should
get some sleep.

1195
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:10,835
You look like shit.

1196
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,142
Hey, wait a minute!

1197
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,254
Morning, everybody.

1198
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,155
How we all doing?

1199
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,189
One hell of a night.

1200
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,395
ANSWERING MACHINE: Joey,
this is Aunt Merkie.

1201
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,464
What's this I hear
about a whorehouse?

1202
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:42,099
You used to be such a nice boy.

1203
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,941
Don't...

1204
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,509
ANSWERING MACHINE:
Joey, Uncle Sal.

1205
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,544
We're getting drunk over here
on account of your troubles.

1206
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,247
And we just wanna know, can
we return our gifts yet?

1207
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,091
Wait to go, killer.

1208
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:23,373
Hello?

1209
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:24,809
May I help you?

1210
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:25,609
Yeah, hi.

1211
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:28,178
Can I speak to Liz, please?

1212
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:31,148
She doesn't wanna to talk
to you, you fucking creep!

1213
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,617
Oh, just put her
on the phone, bitch!

1214
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:34,551
Asshole!

1215
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,354
Mother, give me the phone!

1216
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:38,155
What?

1217
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,091
Listen, I want a truce, OK?

1218
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,528
I wanna talk about getting
things back on track.

1219
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:45,662
Are you out of your mind?

1220
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,865
Oh come on, Dink.

1221
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,600
You know you still want me.

1222
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,169
Oh, Dinkie, in a
week or two, you're

1223
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,770
Gonna be climbing the wall.

1224
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,973
I am hanging up now, pig.

1225
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:56,841
Oh, wait, Liz.

1226
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:57,641
Wait.

1227
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:04,514
I'm sorry.

1228
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,515
OK?

1229
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,316
Oh man.

1230
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:12,522
Look, Joey, forget it.

1231
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,792
I am not marrying you.

1232
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,995
Blow it up your ass,
you fucking creep!

1233
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,868
Thanks a lot, God!

1234
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:24,734
Come off it, Joey.

1235
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,270
There is no God.

1236
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,504
Sorry, Cliff.

1237
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:28,973
I can't take this anymore.

1238
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:30,207
This book is absurd!

1239
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:33,878
And your attitude is
just as bad, Joey.

1240
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,679
I'm going right
now to talk to Liz.

1241
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:36,847
No, you're not.

1242
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:38,182
All right.

1243
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,984
The next person who doesn't
get along in here gets shot.

1244
01:03:40,084 --> 01:03:41,385
Put that away, you cokehead.

1245
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,953
What is going on in here?

1246
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,554
Stumpy, you can't go see Liz.

1247
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,956
You two don't get along.

1248
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,457
Yeah, she hates
your fucking guts.

1249
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,159
And besides, I
think someone would

1250
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,161
Rather keep her
nose clean and spend

1251
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,762
The afternoon with a good book.

1252
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,599
Paula, I usually abhor
violence, but could you?

1253
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,101
Cliff, you son of a...

1254
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,168
No, stop it!
Stop it!

1255
01:03:58,268 --> 01:03:59,103
Stop it!
Stop it!

1256
01:03:59,203 --> 01:03:59,904
Stop it!

1257
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:07,344
So if you don't mind my
asking, what's the bad blood

1258
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:10,780
Between you and Liz?

1259
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,917
Oh, actually, none
of us got along

1260
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,284
With Liz when we were kids.

1261
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:16,586
It wasn't until years
after high school

1262
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,355
That Joey started
going out with her.

1263
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:23,961
Oh man.

1264
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:28,632
It's beautiful and all tax-free.

1265
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:30,901
Some good tit, huh?

1266
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,036
Hey, aren't you
afraid those guys

1267
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:34,204
Might come looking for you?

1268
01:04:34,304 --> 01:04:35,305
In this town?

1269
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,642
They got bigger fish to fry.

1270
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,210
I wish I sold drugs.

1271
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,312
It's more complicated
than that, Scoop.

1272
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,848
I don't just sell drugs, OK?

1273
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,217
But you still hate her.

1274
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:50,287
Well, Liz and her friends
used to taunt me all the time

1275
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,888
About my weight in high school.

1276
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:55,025
You know, prank phone calls
in the middle of the night,

1277
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,194
Spraypainted pigs on my locker.

1278
01:04:57,294 --> 01:04:59,396
That's horrible.

1279
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:02,099
Yeah.

1280
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,800
It must have caused more
than one suicide attempt.

1281
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,371
Oh, but hey.

1282
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,338
That's all in the past.

1283
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,383
What do you say, gentlemen?

1284
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:21,051
Ready to blast off?

1285
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,851
Yeah.

1286
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,469
Hi, can I help you?

1287
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:43,873
Hi, Liz.

1288
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:49,446
Well, well.

1289
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:51,415
It's been a long time, Stumpy.

1290
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,717
Come here to gloat?

1291
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,220
No, I came here to help.

1292
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,289
I think that we
can work this out.

1293
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,090
Oh.

1294
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,625
How sweet.

1295
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:03,994
We're quite the saint
today, aren't we?

1296
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:05,962
Who are you?

1297
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,398
Paula.

1298
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:10,034
Love your earrings.

1299
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:10,867
Love your cake.

1300
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:16,206
Take a a walk, you freak!

1301
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,246
Yes, it was a nice cake.

1302
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,314
It used to symbolize
something, something sacred!

1303
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:32,589
Let's get married.

1304
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:33,523
Oh, yes.

1305
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:35,425
I love you so much.

1306
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,394
Let's get married.

1307
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,428
OK.

1308
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,996
But first let me go
over here and fuck

1309
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,232
This broad one last time.

1310
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,700
Hey, baby.

1311
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,169
I'm getting married.

1312
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:47,171
How about a little
Vitamin F, huh?

1313
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,004
Ooh.

1314
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:48,872
Ooh.

1315
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:49,673
Ooh.

1316
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:50,507
Ooh.

1317
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,008
Ooh.

1318
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,977
Ooh, yeah!

1319
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:54,944
Ooh!

1320
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,146
Ooh!

1321
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:56,946
Ooh!

1322
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,491
Hmm.

1323
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:08,292
Mmm.

1324
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:10,860
It's good.

1325
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,562
You want some?

1326
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:13,930
Liz, we need to talk.

1327
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:20,904
[Shouting]

1328
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,659
Damn, can't believe
you still got that kite.

1329
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:43,460
What?

1330
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,261
Are you kidding me?

1331
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:45,262
I'd never get rid of it.

1332
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:46,430
Does it still fly?

1333
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,397
Heck yeah.

1334
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,765
Geez.

1335
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,367
I remember when the old man
used to take us up in it, man.

1336
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,702
Those were some good times, eh?

1337
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,105
He used to sweep down
on our Little League team

1338
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:56,640
And practice strafing runs.

1339
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,441
I know.

1340
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,408
You guys deserved it.

1341
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,709
You sucked.

1342
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,044
So have you talked to him?

1343
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:02,078
Nah.

1344
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,714
Well, a couple years
ago when Mom died,

1345
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,284
He had some big construction
deal or something

1346
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,619
Going on in Antigua.

1347
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,356
So wait a minute. He doesn't
know about the wedding?

1348
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:13,123
I mean, [inaudible]

1349
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,724
Nah, man.

1350
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,594
Funerals and weddings,
old man can't stand 'em.

1351
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:18,562
Well, who can?

1352
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:19,696
Guys, come here!

1353
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:20,497
Look at this!

1354
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,534
You know what this is?

1355
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:25,402
Yeah, I know what it is.

1356
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:27,204
It's for Mr. Costos's garden.

1357
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:28,705
Put 'em back, Scoop.

1358
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,274
Morning glory seeds.

1359
01:08:30,374 --> 01:08:31,408
So?

1360
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:33,443
Natural hallucinogens!

1361
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,812
God given psychedelics!

1362
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:36,946
No shit.

1363
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:37,747
Yeah.

1364
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:38,548
Really?

1365
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,088
Oh.

1366
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,723
Oh God.

1367
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:48,725
This is very good.

1368
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,827
This always makes
me feel better.

1369
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:51,761
Have some fries.

1370
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,363
You eat like a bird.

1371
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,666
Oh, I stopped eating for
pleasure a time ago, Liz.

1372
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,803
What's that supposed to mean?

1373
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,105
Here we are, ladies.

1374
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:03,707
Paula, what are
you doing with that?

1375
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,841
What?

1376
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,142
Girls, I don't have a
license for that shit.

1377
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,378
Take it outside!

1378
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,680
Shirley, can I
have some glasses?

1379
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,749
I'm in a crappy mood
and I wanna drink.

1380
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,090
This things taste disgusting.

1381
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,062
I forgot how long
it's take to work.

1382
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,732
I wanna see some trolls
or something, you know?

1383
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,600
You know that's a
waste of time, guys.

1384
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,002
The government would never
allow that on the market.

1385
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,805
Goon, you don't take any
seeds, you're not gonna

1386
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:38,141
Be part of our secret club.

1387
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,643
What secret club?

1388
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:42,145
The secret club Goon
won't be allowed in!

1389
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:50,820
All right.

1390
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,621
Listen to me.

1391
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:57,694
Goon, if you don't partake
in these [inaudible],

1392
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:58,995
I'm gonna blow your
fucking head off.

1393
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:00,797
Will you put that thing away?

1394
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,366
Shut up, or I'll shoot you too.

1395
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:03,667
- First, you have to...
- Margaret.

1396
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:04,368
- Liz.
- Margaret.

1397
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:05,702
Liz, first you have to...

1398
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:09,406
Margaret, I know you're trying
to be the peacemaker here,

1399
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:12,041
But I am sick to
death of the guys.

1400
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,076
Fuck it, girl.

1401
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:14,878
That's what you all should say.

1402
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:19,215
And ask for that stinking,
whore-loving bastard you

1403
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:20,384
Were gonna marry, you should...

1404
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:22,286
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

1405
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:23,119
OK?

1406
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,688
You have to talk about it, Liz.

1407
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,924
You and Joey both have to
stop hiding from each other.

1408
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:29,626
Once you open your receptors,
you'll be surprised

1409
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,495
How clear the message becomes.

1410
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,129
You fucking liberals
are all the same.

1411
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,832
Do you know what I'd do
if I found that stinking

1412
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,334
Bastard handcuffed to my bed?

1413
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,603
I don't wanna think
about this anymore!

1414
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,739
Can we just get drunk?

1415
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:45,141
You girl ever hear
of World War II?

1416
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:48,712
Yeah.

1417
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,814
Yeah.

1418
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,148
You ever hear of the Japanese?

1419
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:56,753
Yeah.

1420
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:57,554
What?

1421
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,160
Oh.

1422
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,895
Hey, Scoop.

1423
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:06,696
Want a scoop?

1424
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:14,538
Man.

1425
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:15,872
Goon was right.

1426
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:18,475
Those seeds are nasty.

1427
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:19,943
Oh God.

1428
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:20,910
[Fart]

1429
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,178
Aw, man!

1430
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,781
Sure do give you gas
though, don't they?

1431
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:25,582
Man, you're classy.

1432
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:26,383
Let me tell you.

1433
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,520
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, all the way from Los

1434
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,122
Angeles, CA, Sloppy Joe Ramsey!

1435
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:46,035
The Bataan Death March
was just the beginning.

1436
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,005
What happened after
was sheer genius.

1437
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:51,274
It's what that rat
bastard Joey deserves.

1438
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,509
This is counterproductive.

1439
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,309
I think...

1440
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,243
Let her finish.

1441
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:57,747
And they marched
the men into a room

1442
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:01,585
And make 'em whip
out their weenies.

1443
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:06,623
Then they take a
glass tube, about 1/16

1444
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:14,197
Of an inch in diameter,
and slowly, ever so slowly,

1445
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:20,103
They insert the tube into
the hole and up the urethra.

1446
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:29,212
Then, adding injury
to insult, they

1447
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,515
Take a blunt instrument and...

1448
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:33,417
Oh my god, that's horrific!

1449
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:34,317
It wouldn't work on Cliff.

1450
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:35,118
The tube's too big!

1451
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:44,060
Aw, honey.

1452
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,328
I was trying to cheer you up!

1453
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:00,009
OK.

1454
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,746
Do Jack Nicholson
as Captain Kirk.

1455
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:03,547
All right.

1456
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:12,622
Hi, this is Captain James T

1457
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:13,423
Hmm.

1458

You think you're so cool!

1459
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,762
Here's what we're gonna do.

1460
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:20,564
I'll be myself over there.

1461
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,008
We will sit down, we will
have a little Romulan ale

1462
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,177
And we'll just call
it a day's work.

1463
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:37,080
There's more fish in the
sea, and they are for me!

Do Marlon Bra... Marlon
Brando as Mr. Brady when

1465
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:45,354
Peter's voice is gonna crack.

1466
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:46,155
All right.

1467
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,757
OK.

1468
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,092
All right.

1469
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:52,195
Peter, I understand you're
coming of age and your voice is

1470
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:59,202
Starting to change,
and... you're gonna have

1471

Cindy's room at night,

1472
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,706

01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,514
Ah, your mother's a bitch!

1474
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:14,417
I pick that witch
and I got an itch!

1475
01:14:14,518 --> 01:14:15,919
And you can scratch it!

1476
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:18,722
Liz, Liz, you have
to get over it.

1477
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,357
You can't just sign
your life over to them.

1478
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,027
You just take it and
run away with it.

1479
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,796
Paula, you're drunk.

1480
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,298
Liz, just look at us.

1481
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:32,235
You made sure that I was the
most unpopular girl in school

1482
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:34,237
And I used to pray
for your death.

1483
01:14:34,337 --> 01:14:35,772
But people change.

1484
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:38,174

lend deeper meaning

1485

1486

No.

1488
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:50,654
I mean, Margaret's right.

1489
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:52,055
The situation has mutated.

1490
01:14:56,125 --> 01:15:03,833
Nobody knows this, but,
um... well, I'm pregnant.

1491
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,134
Sweet Jesus.

1492
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,336
You've gotta abort that thing.

1493
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,437
Oh my god!

1494
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,273
We're going to the
house right now.

1495
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:12,275
Joey has a right to know
what he's throwing away.

1496
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:24,220

1497
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,488
Leon?

1498
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:30,493
OK, we want a first-rate
bistro with the brute sleekness

Pedro, my boss at...

1502

1503
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:44,874
So they can have a lifetime
supply of bacon food

1504
01:15:44,974 --> 01:15:45,675
At the bar?

1505
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:46,643
All right.

1506
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:47,644
I'm gonna need
more things though.

1508
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,052

You gotta calm these guys down.

1517

Damn son of a... somebody's
disturbed my Saturday.

Gotta come out and see
what the hell is going on.

1526

1528

You look like a goddamn freak.

Man, I can't believe he
flipped out like that.

1558

I'm sure once he calms down and
realizes what he did... I mean,

He just can't fire

01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:12,321
I often come here, Emmett.

1637
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,790
Some people think
it's kind of creepy,

1638
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,560
But I find it therapeutic.

1639
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:25,434
My father says I should
be afraid of death,

1640
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:28,804
That I'm going to rot
in Hell most likely.

1641
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:39,648
Emmett, let's
leave town tonight.

1642
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,318
We can go out West.

1643
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:43,119
It's warm out there.

1644
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:50,526
Oh my, Emmett.

1645
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:54,430
You're just full of surprises.

1646
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,731
It's a full moon, Cassandra.

1647
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,184

1648
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,225
Emmett?

1649
01:24:22,325 --> 01:24:24,893
Mhm?

1650
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,595
We're near my
favorite tombstone.

1651
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:32,168
Oh.

1652
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:33,636
Uh.

1653
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,138
[Moaning]

1654
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:35,938
Oh, wow.

1655
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,845
Hey.

1656
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:43,646
Hey, man.

1657
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:44,780
I can't stay in here.

1658
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,614
I'm claustrophobic.

1659
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:48,251
I'll die, man.

1660
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:50,386
GREASE: I can't believe
we went back to Lola's.

1661
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:51,787
JOEY: I told you it
was a bad idea, Ted.

1662
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:52,921
GREASE: Hey, how was
I supposed to know

1663
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,257
Lola was friends with the cops?
CLIFF: Friends?

1664
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:55,258
They were customers, brainboy.

1665
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:56,459
They weren't wearing any pants.

1666
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:58,227
GREASE: That's not the point.
CLIFF: No.

1667
01:24:58,327 --> 01:24:59,628
Joey owes a lot of money.
Goddamn it.

1668
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:00,663
GREASE: Why didn't you tell me?

1669
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,030
I got tons of cash, man.
JOEY: Yeah.

1670
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:03,299
Right.

1671
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:04,233
That's all I need to do...
Start laundering your drug

1672
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,468
Money through the fucking town.

1673
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:07,303
GREASE: Excuse me,
Mr. Ungrateful, Mr...

1674
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:08,504
CLIFF: Shut up.
Shut up!

1675
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,305
We'll get in trouble!

1676
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,443
Boy, am I glad to see you guys.

1677
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:15,544
You gotta get me
outta here, man.

1678
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,346
I'm dying in here.

1679
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:18,314
Paula!

1680
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:20,349
Paula, it was
entirely their idea.

1681
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,151
I mean, ah, they're
on drugs or something.

1682
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:23,286
I was just along for the ride.

1683
01:25:23,386 --> 01:25:24,086
GREASE: Fucking bullshit, man!
That's bullshit!

1684
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:24,787
No, it's a horrible mistake!

1685
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:25,688
Shut up!

1686
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:27,290
Paula, I did nothing wrong.

1687
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:28,757
You have to believe me.

1688
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:29,892
Tell it to the judge, Cliff.

1689
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:30,693
GREASE: Bullshit, man.

1690
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,494
What bullshit.

1691
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:35,598
CLIFF: Paula, call
my mom and dad.

1692
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:36,699
You gotta get me outta here.

1693
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:37,500
Liz?

1694
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,602
Liz, is that you?

1695
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:40,603
You gotta forgive me, Liz.

1696
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:42,338
I was crazed last night.

1697
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:45,341
I mean, I got fired,
and you wanted to put

1698
01:25:45,441 --> 01:25:47,810
That restraining order on me.

1699
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:48,911
And I went looking
for you, baby,

1700
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:50,946
But you weren't at the store.

1701
01:25:51,046 --> 01:25:53,582
All that was there was
that goddamn poster

1702
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,884
Of me and that wedding cake.

1703
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,022
And I guess it was then that
I got a little immature.

1704
01:26:00,122 --> 01:26:02,124
Joey, you break my heart.

1705
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:04,927
I'm sorry, Liz.

1706
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,330
I'll do anything to repay
you for the store, OK?

1707
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,964
I'm not talking
about the store!

1708
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:11,300
I'm talking about Lola's!

1709
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,268
Why'd you go back there, huh?

1710
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:14,803
Oh, nothing happened!

1711
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,439
Ask the cops.

1712
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:17,673
I mean, it was all Ted's idea.

1713
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,443
That stupid fuck wanted
to establish an alibi.

1714
01:26:20,543 --> 01:26:22,545
GREASE: Will you give
me a break already.

1715
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:23,312
CLIFF: It's true, Liz.

1716
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:24,280
It's all his fate.

1717
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,080
GREASE: That's it.

1718
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:25,881
You're dead, Dugan.

What the hell is
going on in here?

1721
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:31,220
Everybody shut up!

1722
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:37,493
Joey, I believe that Liz
has something to say to you.

1723
01:26:37,593 --> 01:26:40,463
I just hope you're
man enough to take it.

1724
01:26:40,563 --> 01:26:43,732
Go ahead, Liz.

1725
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:49,272
Joey, I'm, um,
dropping the charges.

1726
01:26:49,372 --> 01:26:50,939
JOEY: Oh, thank Christ.

1727
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:51,774
GREASE: Bless her, Lord.

CLIFF: Hallelujah.

Shut up, [inaudible]
You're not free yet.

1730
01:26:55,278 --> 01:26:56,178
Let me outta here.

1731
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:58,381
She said she was
dropping the charges.

Liz?

1733
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,652
Joey, I'm pregnant.

of the shotgun, eh, Sloppy?

CLIFF: She doesn't
have to keep it.

1737
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:11,927
Yes, I'm keeping it.

1738
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:14,363
Because it's mine and I want it!

1739
01:27:14,463 --> 01:27:17,099
Yeah, I want one too, you know.

1740
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,834
Yeah, I think it'd
be pretty cool, man.

1741
01:27:18,934 --> 01:27:19,902
Having a little guy around.

1742
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:20,869
Teach it to fly.

1743
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,071
Maybe play a little guitar.

1744
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,106
Hey.

1745
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:26,709
Baby, you gotta give
me another chance.

Hmph.

I'll give you
another chance, Joey.

You're not gonna
regret it, honey.

1750
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,684
There's gonna be
a lot of changes.

01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:38,621
Anything you say, sweetie pie.

1752
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:42,024
And one hell of a
probation period.

1753
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:43,091
That's fine.

1754
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,226
Now come here.

1755
01:27:44,327 --> 01:27:45,027
Give me a kiss.

01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:55,671
Hey, take it to
a hotel room, OK?

1757
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:56,939
I wanna get the fuck outta here.

Oh, and one more
thing, honey pie?

1759
01:28:05,748 --> 01:28:06,949
Yeah, my little dinkie doodle?

1760
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,123

You snore loud enough
to wake the dead, Emmett.

01:28:56,098 --> 01:29:01,470
Thought you got away nice
and clean, didn't you?

1765
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:04,907
I saw you kidnap
her, you bastard.

1766
01:29:07,643 --> 01:29:11,680
And now you are going to pray.

1767
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:19,221
I am gonna stick this
right up your ass

1768
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,691
And blow the shit up into
your mouth where it belongs.

1769
01:29:30,533 --> 01:29:34,069
Daddy, put that thing away.

1770
01:29:34,169 --> 01:29:38,073
Father, put the gun down.

01:29:38,173 --> 01:29:40,108
What's with the suitcase,
my darling child?

1772
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:40,909
Hmm?

1773
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:41,910
Hmm?

Get the candle wax out
of your ears, Preacher.

1777
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,556
Emmett and I are
going to Los Angeles.

you can do about it.

psychopath without bullets?

01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,014
All right?

1813
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:03,151
And do whatever it
is, um, that you do.

1814
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:03,952
OK.

1815
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:10,926
We got him now.

1816
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:11,727
Huh, Boss?

1817
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:21,303
I'm gonna miss you, fucker.

1818
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:23,939
I'm gonna miss you
even more, buddy!

1819
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,173
Let's get your ass
up in the clouds.

1820
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:26,675
I ain't going
anywhere for a while.

1821
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:27,943
Excellent.

1822
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,712
Make sure you make your
court date though, all right.

1823
01:32:29,812 --> 01:32:31,880
Cousin Billy don't
like to be stood up.

1824
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,681
And water the plants.

1825
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:43,626
Step on it, Joey.

1826
01:32:43,726 --> 01:32:47,095
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no!

1827
01:32:47,195 --> 01:32:49,564
Oh, you goddamn monster!

1828
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:54,536
No, no, no. [Inaudible] No, no!

1829
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:02,010
No, no, no!

1830
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:04,980
Baby, come back to mommy.

1831
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,316
How long do you give 'em?

1832
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,618
I dunno.

1833
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:12,087
How long's it take
to get to Vegas?

1834
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:14,222
[Chuckling]

1835
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:15,523
MOTHER: I want my baby!

1836
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,263
Hey, kids.

1837
01:33:21,363 --> 01:33:23,732
How you doing?

1838
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:26,669
Scoop, no hurt feelings?

1839
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:34,509
Oh, by the way, you
left this inside.

1840
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:35,477
Keep it.

1841
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:37,780
I'm gonna write a new one.

1842
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,981
What?

1843
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:41,016
I thought this was your
fucking masterpiece, man.

1844
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:41,917
Nah.

1845
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,385
You know, I... I
feel like the muse

1846
01:33:43,485 --> 01:33:46,088
Is pushing me somewhere else.

1847
01:33:46,188 --> 01:33:48,456
I think I need to pander to the
masses just a little bit more.

1848
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,361
Yeah.

1849
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,830
Well, good luck.

1850
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,965
Thanks.

1851
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:57,766
You take care.

1852
01:34:04,272 --> 01:34:05,473
And Scoop, get a
job, you deadbeat.

1853
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:10,412
Drive safely.

1854
01:34:15,417 --> 01:34:17,019
CLIFF: Could you not grind
the clutch a little more

1855
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:18,120
When you're backing up?

1856
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,587
PAULA: Cliff, just shut
up and let me drive.

1857
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:21,523
CLIFF: Well, then maybe you'd
like to pay for a new clutch

1858
01:34:21,623 --> 01:34:22,324
Then?

1859
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:23,258
PAULA: I said, shut up.

1860
01:34:33,368 --> 01:34:34,569
Buenos dias, Senor Condosta.

1861
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:39,574
Como estas?

1862
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:45,881
Hello, Ted.

1863
01:34:45,981 --> 01:34:49,417
Estas buscando esto?

1864
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,218
The briefcase.

1865
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,727
Estoy muy decepcionado contigo.

1866
01:34:58,827 --> 01:34:59,762
No puedo confiar en ti.

1867
01:35:04,499 --> 01:35:05,200
He's real pissed.

1868
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:20,816
[Gunshots]

1869
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,221
Aw shit.

1870
01:35:30,793 --> 01:35:31,894
Nobody gets the Grease Man.

1871
01:35:31,994 --> 01:35:32,795
Nobody gets the grease.

1872
01:35:35,998 --> 01:35:36,698
Shit.

1873
01:35:36,799 --> 01:35:37,499
Come on!

1874
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:38,500
[Gunshots]

1875
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,301
Goddamn it.

1876
01:35:44,006 --> 01:35:45,407
[Gunshots]

1877
01:37:07,222 --> 01:37:07,923
CLIFF: Come on.

1878
01:37:08,023 --> 01:37:08,723
This station sucks.

1879
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,993
Let me put my CD in.

1880
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:12,394
What are you doing?
PAULA: Get out!

1881
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:13,896
CLIFF: What do you mean get out?
What do you mean?

1882
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,397
What?
Whoa!

1883
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,499
PAULA: Get the fuck out!

1884
01:37:17,599 --> 01:37:20,202
Now you can pedal your
ass home, pansy boy!

1885
01:37:20,302 --> 01:37:22,304
Paula!

1886
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:23,505
Paula, come back.

1887
01:37:23,605 --> 01:37:25,307
That's my car!

1888
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:27,709
Damn it!

1889
01:37:27,809 --> 01:37:30,112
My parents bought me that car.

1890
01:37:30,212 --> 01:37:31,947
Damn, I knew it.
