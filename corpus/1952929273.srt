Ho-young Son, Ye-won Han

4
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:09,094
There is no such way
to go back to yesterday.

5
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:14,532
But my only hope for now is
to turn back to the past,

6
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,501
Even though I have to stay
in the hell.

7
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:28,211
For those who can easily smell the weak,
we were always their food.

8
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,316
Can't you do it better?

9
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,717
Can't you do it better?

10
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,421
One, two.

11
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,014
Three, four.

12
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,024
One, two.

13
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,025
Three, four.

14
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,225
Hey, hey, do you think
we're gonna be okay?

15
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,040
Sink or swim!

16
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,440
How long should I lick his ass?

17
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:03,173
Are u gonna take a hidden camera film
of girls for him forever?

18
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,286
Written and Directed by
Hong-ick Kim

19
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,789
- One, two.
- Three. Four.

20
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,794
The gangster!

21
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,009
There, stop!

22
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,121
Ah! Jesus!

23
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,226
Be careful, you're gonna get hurt.

24
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,127
Ah, my bone, my bone!

25
00:03:56,202 --> 00:04:02,539
Ah, sorry, ok, ok, I will hit above.
Ok, ok, it will finish soon.

26
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,869
It's done, go.

27
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,685
I feel like dying on every step.

28
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:38,308
Hey, did he go? huh?
Look around quickly.

29
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,109
Did he go? answer me!

30
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,118
Move!

31
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,120
Hey!

32
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,823
My first love, Mia Hong.

33
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,952
I met her again after 10 years
at the school

34
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,658
but it seems that she must
have forgotten all about me.

35
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,566
Would you like some?

36
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,268
No, thanks.

37
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,174
Try some.

38
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,287
Hey, hey, are you seriously
thinking of her everyday?

39
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,892
Don't take it wrong I'm taking a film
for the school film festival.

40
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,486
Yeah Right.

41
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,301
She is so wild like a tomboy

42
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,703
I don't think
she is attractive at all.

43
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,808
Are you kidding? You said

44
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,901
you had a bath together
when you were young.

45
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,605
How can you not speak to her a word?

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,017
She doesn't even remember that.
And that was not a bath,

47
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,213
it was just playing in the water!

48
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,118
Idiot!

49
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,956
Can I have a chocolate milk,
dried squid, 3 pizza bread and...

50
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,158
no, no, that one please.

51
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:14,370
Just go and tell her that she had a bath
with you so she should take you!!

52
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,065
What!?

53
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,070
Dan,

54
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,079
What.

55
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,678
Dan, I'm short of 1,300 won.

56
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,759
Why aren't you coming
if you know that well?

57
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:14,963
What are you doing?

58
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,058
Are you done? You stalker!

59
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,960
Hey, shut up!

60
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,971
Have you finished taking a film?

61
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,073
Mia, what's wrong? Are you okay?

62
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,042
Sorry, I will talk to you later.

63
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,966
Look at this, this is so great.

64
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,305
Wow, you look gorgeous like a model.

65
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,114
Is it okay for the students
to access the hotel?

66
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,785
Huh! Even though you are staying
with my father because of his money,

67
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,121
don't you think this is too much?

68
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,527
Don't you have any common sense?

69
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,132
Common sense?

70
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,035
I've been taking care
of a living corpse for 3 years until now.

71
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:04,072
Can you even imagine how that is?

72
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,847
What? Then just leave him!

73
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,478
What the hell are you making
my father miserable?

74
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,888
Well, I think I have to finish
what I've already started.

75
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:24,725
Don't you want to let
your father go in the peace?

76
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:34,999
What the... are you crazy? huh?

77
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,270
What the hell are you doing?

78
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,311
Devils like you... go to hell!

79
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,329
Hey, lady! Are you alright?

80
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,834
Hey.

81
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,910
You look so drunk.

82
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,045
Do you need some help?

83
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,810
You're lucky today.

84
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,014
Because it's not easy to meet
the gentlemen like us.

85
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,388
Shut her mouth.

86
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,862
We're just helping you.

87
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:09,809
Dan, are you still in the bed?
Get up!!

88
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,117
Ah!

89
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,123
Are you crazy?

90
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,422
Get up!!

91
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,312
We are late!
Hey, run!

92
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,100
Please, open the gate.
Please, sir.

93
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:48,237
Dan, Dan, What's wrong?

94
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,877
Ma'am, what's wrong with me?

95
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,824
Have you got bitten by a dog?

96
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,790
What?

97
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,254
It seems that you're infected
with rabies.

98
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,458
What?

99
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,297
High fever, nausea...

100
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,099
and photophobia.

101
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,632
No...It can't be rabies in these days.

102
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,313
In your age, it's more like...

103
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:28,911
the symptoms when you guys do
'that' too much! Take it easy!

104
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,089
Take it off.

105
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:41,763
Ah... I like when these are tight.

106
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,898
Ah! Ah!

107
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:04,149
I couldn't get pizza bread today...
do you think we're gonna be alright?

108
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,016
Hey, what's wrong?

109
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,765
Here we go!

110
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,368
Look, how beautifully these
six coins are going across the desk.

111
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,377
Check the line.

112
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,876
Cheol-seung,
here I brought your snacks...

113
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:30,880
shush!

114
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,684
See? It's an art give it to me.

115
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,696
Hey, Mia He seems so strange.

116
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,203
Look, look, he keeps looking at me.

117
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:58,206
Before I saw him taking me
a film with a little camera.

118
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,304
I'm so hot! Don't you think?

119
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:10,152
Oh, hey Mia, oh my good! Oh, my god!

120
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:17,060
I think he is having a drug or something!
You know, some strange drugs!!

121
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,592
What's wrong?

122
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,865
Dan.

123
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,108
Pizza bread?

124
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,476
Uh... that was sold out so I bought
something else instead of that...

125
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,914
What? Something else?
Are you insane?

126
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,528
How patheic fuck off.

127
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,840
Yo, what's wrong with her?

128
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,639
It's not your business.

129
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,839
Yo, Mia! Are you having a period?

130
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,705
Eun-seok!

131
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,049
Do you really wanna fight with me?

132
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,225
I'm sorry!

Huh, that was not bad.

181
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,375
Hey, Park! What are you doing?
Are you a psycho!

182
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,083
I don't understand a single word
you are talking about.

183
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,389
Hey, Mia! He took a film of something
very interesting about you.

184
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,292
Are you going out with a sugar daddy?

185
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,897
What the hell did you do at the hotel?
This stalker took everything here.

186
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,498
What the hell are you talking about?
Man, fuck you!

187
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,796
Fuck You?

188
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,101
Ya, Fuck You!

189
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,106
What the fuck!

190
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,202
Give it to me.

191
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,910
Take it if you can.

192
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,015
Look at your face,
where is your confidence?

193
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,317
It's not worth to
speak a word to you.

194
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,360
I see, then we can check
this out right here.

195
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,704
Cheol-seung Park!

196
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,393
Mia!

197
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:11,566
Dan, are you okay? You rock!

198
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:15,965
Let's go for lunch!

199
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,538
I'm so sorry.

200
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,303
For what?

201
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,882
Was it funny?

202
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,486
Tell me, was it funny?

203
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,888
If it's that funny,
why don't we watch together?

204
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,700
I don't know what is in there,

205
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,033
but if that is that funny,
Watch with me!

206
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,237
Mia, I've never expected
this would happen.

207
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:16,048
You didn't know this would happen?
Then what did you expect?

208
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,483
Such a stalker.

209
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:23,350
What?

210
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:31,064
If I knew you became this kind of freak,
I wouldn't be so happy

211
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,935
When we had the same class.

212
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:41,511
Do you have any reason to live?

213
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:48,618
Do you have anyone
that you can make happy?

214
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,592
If you don't, just kill yourself

215
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,735
I'm so sorry, sorry

216
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:56,745
They suffer as much as
they wish to die and then

217
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,379
they will die within 3 or 4 days.

218
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,428
Just kill yourself!

219
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,130
There are not many people who have
courage to save other people 's lives.

220
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,644
But today,
one high school student showed us

221
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,147
a beautiful courage
to save the blind lady.

222
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:02,084
There is a disabled woman standing
on the platform.

223
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,782
And one suspicious looking man
is approaching her

224
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,793
and pushed her into
the rail for no reason.

225
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,761
It was very dangerous situation.

226
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:17,697
This high school student is the hero who
saved the blind woman out of the rail.

227
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,396
Today, a miracle happened

228
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:25,898
when the high school student
saved the blind lady out of the rail.

229
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,340
We have to applaud him loudly

230
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:34,147
for having the courage to save
others in this kind of world.

231
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,523
Nowadays, up to the bottom, everyone
is just only thinking of themselves

232
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,424
When every politician
and businessman is corrupted,

233
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,155
this kind of person is a real hero.

234
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,305
Mia, pick up the phone!

235
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:07,707
Dan became a star!
He is a hero! Call me back!

236
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:18,786
Today, a high school student jumped
into the rail and saved a blind woman.

237
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,387
According to the witnesses,
when the train was

238
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,901
approaching to the platform,
a mental patient, Mr Choi pushed the victim

239
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,799
And immediately
one high school student jumped into

240
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,201
the rail and saved the victim
in dangerous situation.

241
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,501
This student had a severe injury however

242
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,306
he just left the scene as soon
as he saved the blind woman.

243
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:41,646
And in this panic situation he was
so naive to look for his subway pass.

244
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,519
These images of him on the internet
made him so famous to be a real hero.

245
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,819
I really wanted to tell him this...

246
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:57,767
When I had a really difficult situation
I sometimes wanted to kill myself..

247
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,071
But now I will try to live.

248
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:12,082
Even though when it's difficult
I will try to be strong.

249
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,477
He is the real hero! You rock!

250
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,081
My hero!! Thank you!

251
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,092
Hero! Thank you so much!!

252
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,092
Dan, it's too late,
what are you doing there?

253
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,529
I'm washing my laundry to help you!

254
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:41,075
Just finish quickly and go to bed!
You have to get up early tomorrow!

255
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,012
Yes!

256
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,563
Dan!

257
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,807
Don't you know
what you've done wrong?

258
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,512
If you ever try to kill yourself again,
I will kill you.

259
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,228
She is the new trainee teacher
of the school Behave yourselves.

260
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,467
Hello, everyone.

261
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,308
I am Yuri Lee, a student teacher
to teach Korean language for 2 weeks.

262
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,047
Nice to meet you all.

263
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,752
Hello, sir.

264
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,659
Hey, look at me.

265
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,429
I'm going to study very hard for you.

266
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,763
So hot.

267
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,781
You!

268
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:34,879
What!

269
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,094
Hey, where are you going?

270
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:47,187
Where are you going?

271
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,633
Who are you?

272
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,498
Haven't you forgotten me already?

273
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,297
What?

274
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,345
Hmm, I look better than this picture.

275
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,391
What are you doing?

276
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,153
Do you remember me?

277
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:18,857
What the hell are you?

278
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,597
Me? Blood drinking species.

279
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:30,173
In history,
they call us a vampire you know?

280
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,072
Do you think lwill believe that?

281
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,568
It's up to you
whether you believe or not.

282
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:42,285
See? You couldn't eat anything.

283
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,786
When you eat something
you want to throw up and

284
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,186
when you go outside in the sun,
you feel like burning.

285
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,591
And when you are around
with girls you are going crazy.

286
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,995
And when you smell the blood,
your heart beats so fast.

287
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:02,737
It's your choice But you have to
realize this is the real situation.

288
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,675
Poor thing, you must have been starving.

289
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,041
Let's go to eat something.

290
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,253
Come on.

291
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,459
She is too short to have anything.

292
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,338
Why don't you pick the menu?

293
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,476
What?

294
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:56,090
Okay, today's menu is the type A blood
which is full of mineral.

295
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,922
1 00 dollors!

296
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,530
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

297
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,125
No, it's ok Don't worry about this.

298
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,938
Ah... this is the taste...

299
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,948
Follow me!
You must be not that hungry.

300
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,725
Please donate blood.

301
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,129
Please.

302
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,668
I don't have enough blood
to feed myself!

303
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,710
Hi, please donate blood.
We are short of blood.

304
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,513
I think I have type B blood

305
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,522
but I think my blood is getting hotter,
is this ok to donate?

306
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,922
No problem!

307
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,023
Come on!

308
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,621
Oh, no!

309
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,724
Hey, let him go!

310
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,929
You let him go!
He wanted to donate blood!

311
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,832
He is short of blood!

312
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,941
We are short of blood too!

313
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,540
What the hell are you doing!

314
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,238
What the hell are you doing!

315
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:59,840
Oh, my god!

316
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,077
- Hey!
- Hey!

317
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,085
Hey, wake up!

318
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,471
Just lie down and take some rest.
You shouldn't move now.

319
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,434
Are you crazy to donate your blood?

320
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,410
If people receive your blood
they will become like you.

321
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,582
Why did you come back?

322
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:53,020
Why not!? I came back
to eat your blood again!

323
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,759
I couldn't leave you like that.

324
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,495
Because anyway you sincerely
worried about me at that time.

325
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:08,374
Even though you will hate me
forever for making you a vampire.

326
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,315
What's done is done.
Don't hesitate.

327
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,813
You are no longer a human being.

328
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,887
But is this ok?

329
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:30,798
Isn't the sun, the cross and the
garlics are really fatal to vampires?

330
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:37,137
That's bullshit. Except for the sun
that we are a little sensitive about.

331
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,942
I am originally a devout Christian.

332
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,946
And garlics are also fine
because Korean loves garlics anyway.

333
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,211
And how long have you been a vampire?

334
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,613
Are you a reporter or something?

335
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,922
Who put me in this kind of situation!

336
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,658
I have to know something to
prepare the life of the vampire.

337
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,859
Okay, okay, relax.

338
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,204
Well, It's been less than
1 50 years I think.

339
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,368
Because that's when there
was western invasion in 1 866.

340
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:19,082
Wow, you don't look that old.
Good for you.

341
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,883
I know, I take care of
myself all the time.

342
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,380
What...

343
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,861
Why were vampires in
Korea at that time?

344
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,157
How did they come here?

345
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:51,209
Vampires have existed
since the history begun.

346
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,507
They were completely
hidden from others.

347
00:45:56,086 --> 00:46:00,455
Some vampires escaped from
the West and came to Korea.

348
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:07,561
And the Christians in Korea had
missions to execute the vampires.

349
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,499
But when the unjust persecution of
the Christian was started by the government,

350
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:15,766
the vampires took the government
side and massacred the Christians.

351
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,610
At that time I became a vampire.

352
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,514
Then isn't there anyway to extinguish
the vampires?

353
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,286
Are they immortal?

354
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,285
Before my scar quickly disappeared...

355
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:43,697
Why? Don't you like it?
Don't you want to live forever?

356
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,395
Do you really like this?

357
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,801
Well, that's up to how you think.

358
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,639
It's not that you cannot die.
You don't have die if you don't want to

359
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,208
Be optimistic!

360
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,339
No, thanks.

361
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:04,018
I just wondered how the life
of the vampire hunter would be.
