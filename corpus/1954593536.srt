1
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,408
The following brooklyn-bound "l" train

2
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:55,147
will depart in approximately seven minutes.

3
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,998
- Hello?

4
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,701
Hhello?

5
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,770
- Franny.

6
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,106
- Mom?
- Franny.

7
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,242
- Mom?

8
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,777
Hello?

9
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,847
- Your brother
was in an accident.

10
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,884
He's in the hospital.

11
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,852
You need to come home.

12
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,941
- The impact occurred in
what's called the pterion,

13
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,276
an especially vulnerable part
of the skull.

14
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,846
You see this
bright biconvex region here

15
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,547
That looks like a lens?

16
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,350
This is what we call a hematoma
to the brain tissue,

17
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,818
a sort of blood clot...

18
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,721
- Can you just tell me
if he's gonna be okay?

19
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,860
- I have to tell you,

20
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,661
he might never come out of this.

21
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,996
We can't really say for sure.

22
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,633
In these situations,
we have no recourse

23
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,503
other than to be patient
and wait.

24
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,160
- You cut off all your hair.

25
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,929
- Not all.

26
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,298
- I loved it long.

27
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,935
- I wanted a change.

28
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,639
- Taxi driver's name is rumnesh.

29
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,309
He has a wife and two kids.

30
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,612
They think he tried to stop
the car in time,

31
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,314
but henry
had his headphones on,

32
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,051
and i guess he didn't look
when he was crossing.

33
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,921
I haven't been paying attention.

34
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,790
He's been, just,
living somewhere in brooklyn.

35
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,659
he comes home sometimes
to do his laundry,

36
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,527
but it's all about music
for him,

37
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,765
and i've been trying to finish
the book and just...

38
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,701
- You couldn't have stopped him
from crossing the street.

39
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:54,339
- I always told him
to look both ways.

40
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,441
You just do your best,
you know?

41
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,944
You just do your best.

42
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,220
Thankfully your father
isn't alive to see all this.

43
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,523
It's just a lot for us
to handle, you know?

44
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,598
Oh, uh...

45
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,201
You're gonna

46
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,836
have to sleep in henry's room.

47
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,406
There's so many boxes
in your room.

48
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,342
- It's okay.
i'll just move the boxes.

49
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,178
- No, i gave your bed
to sylvia.

50
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,350
- Who's sylvia?

51
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,052
- She delivers the mail.

52
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,387
- Why'd you give her my bed?

53
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,990
- Because, you know,

54
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,927
i asked her if she wanted a bed,
and she seemed so happy,

55
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,363
and you're never here, franny.

56
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,165
I mean, you haven't lived here
in years,

57
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,601
and you always complained
about that mattress anyway,

58
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,638
so just don't get all bent
out of shape.

59
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,407
- I'm not bent out of shape.

60
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,441
- Hey, franny, i...

61
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,382
i know you're busy,

62
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,385
and i know you think
this is a waste of time.

63
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,821
I'm not sure if you've listened
to anything else i've sent,

64
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,992
but here's another song
i just finished,

65
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,995
probably the first one
i'm really proud of.

66
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,963
I hope you listen to it.

67
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,906
- Henry.

68
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,308
I-i don't really...

69
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,880
I don't...

70
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,948
I don't really know

71
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,117
What to do now.

72
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,132
Fuck!

73
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,419
- Okay. Enjoy.

74
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,760
- James forester!

75
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,966
- James forester!

76
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,936
- Hey.

77
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,774
Hello, new york.

78
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,773
- Thank you, forester.

79
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,408
- Take care.

80
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,412
- Thank you.

81
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,960
- Thank you.

82
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,898
- All right, man.
- Bye.

83
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,704
- Um, james?

84
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,139
- Hey.

85
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,373
- Um...

86
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,742
I-i really liked the show.

87
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,578
- Thanks.

88
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,547
- My brother was hit by a car
this week.

89
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,050
- I'm...
i'm so sorry to hear that.

90
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,551
- Henry ellis.

91
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,220
You're his favorite.

92
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,654
- Is he okay?

93
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,390
- He's at memorial intensive care.

94
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,692
He's in a coma.

95
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,393
- Jesus, i'm so sorry.

96
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,863
- You don't remember him, do you?

97
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:56,000
He sent a letter to you
or to your record label.

98
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,401
- The...

99
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,803
Yeah, the label gets a lot of letters,

100
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,638
and then it takes 'em a while
to get to me,

101
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,673
so unfortunately...

102
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,008
- Okay.
okay.

103
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,012
well, i brought you something
he was working on.

104
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,482
i thought...
it's really good.

105
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,387
i guess i'm not the only one.

106
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,456
- Thank you.
thanks so much.

107
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,891
- It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

108
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,360
- Oh, i'm franny,
franny ellis.

109
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,430
- I hope henry gets better.

110
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,798
- Thank you.

111
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,880
hey, i made you eggs.

112
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,382
- Thank you.

113
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,383
i just...i can't...

114
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,951
i can't eat right now.

115
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,158
hey, how does this sound
for a title?

116
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,263
<i> tales of monkokobaka</i>
<i> and the dekay tribes.</i>

117
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,899
- Uh, sounds good.

118
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,874
it's so pointless.

119
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,877
how can i even do this
right now?

120
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,079
okay, write.

121
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,701
- Hey.

122
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,680
- Hey.
- I was...

123
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,885
hi.

124
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,254
- I was just in the area
and thought, um,

125
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:41,459
maybe i'd just, you know,
stop by.

126
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,328
didn't know if you liked sugar.

127
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,865
- Thank you.

128
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,369
thanks.

129
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,270
i'm okay.
thank you.

130
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,484
um...

131
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,988
aren't you really busy?

132
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,157
- depends
on how you define "busy."

133
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,195
- I guess i always think
of people like you having...

134
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:22,867
things lined up
every millisecond of the day...

135
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,169
back-to-back meetings
with important people.

136
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,809
- I listened
to henry's song.

137
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,910
it's great.

138
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,179
i mean, i liked it a lot.

139
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,449
- I know.
it's really good, isn't it?

140
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,820
you know,
he would really flip out

141
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,622
if he knew you were here.

142
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,559
he's kind of obsessed.

143
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,494
not like in a freaky way
or anything,

144
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,030
just, you know.

145
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,933
- I could play him something
if...

146
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,602
not if...
not if you don't want me to.

147
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,337
i don't have to.
- No, no.

148
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,473
that would be great.

149
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:05,176
i'm sure he would love that.

150
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,798
- Oh, mom.

151
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,401
um...

152
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,403
this is james forester.

153
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,707
- The singer?

154
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,309
- Yeah.

155
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,277
thank you.

156
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,953
thank you so much for coming

157
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,354
and for the tea.

158
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,190
- Oh, please,
this is the least i could do.

159
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,062
- Oh, sorry.

160
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,870
i'm going
to this place tonight...

161
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:50,841
this club henry likes...
if you want to come.

162
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,043
i-i've never been there before,

163
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,212
but the...
there's a show at 11:00,

164
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,247
and i'm probably gonna go
to this place beforehand,

165
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,384
this other place that he likes.

166
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,720
you're probably really busy
with a lot of other things.

167
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:03,921
- I-i-i'm not...

168
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,489
i'm not playing tonight,

169
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,058
and i don't have any meetings
or anything then either.

170
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,994
- Oh, good.
yeah, i got it.

171
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,795
good. okay.

172
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,098
- Cool.
- Great.

173
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,669
- Oh, where?
- What?

174
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,170
- The place.

175
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,774
- Oh, the...
berry and 11th...north 11th

176
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,142
in williamsburg.

177
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,777
- 9:00?
- Uh, okay.

178
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,045
- Okay.

179
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:07,117
- He's the only 19-year-old
i ever saw with a gramophone.

180
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,687
he was telling me that it broke
a couple of weeks ago.

181
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,432
- Um, where does henry sleep?

182
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,935
- Um, it's right over there.

183
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,503
- Here?
- Yeah.

184
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,030
- Hey.
- Hi.

185
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,899
do you have a gramophone?

186
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,768
- Uh, no.

187
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,973
junk market might have one
down by the b.q.e.

188
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,642
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,481
- What about keyboards?

190
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:49,620
- Yeah, we just got in
a vintage '59 rigaledo.

191
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,990
- Can i, uh...
can i see it?

192
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,793
- Yeah, sure.

193
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,901
check this sweet thing out here.

194
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,805
- Hmm.

195
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,588
so, um...

196
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,526
what's your deal?

197
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,897
- Uh, i, um...

198
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,735
i, um...yeah, i put out
an album five years ago,

199
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:17,474
bought me indie fame
and sort of fortune.

200
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,813
i'm a libra.

201
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,617
- Go on.

202
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:30,354
- Okay, um, i...

203
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,856
i live in a cabin in maine.

204
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:37,728
it's where i normally am
when i'm trying to be creative.

205
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,032
i haven't really been able
to write much of anything

206
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,968
since the last album, though.

207
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,339
last time,
i mean with the album,

208
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,540
it was easy.

209
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:55,145
i just got in my car and drove.

210
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,447
me and tessa,
my ex-girlfriend.

211
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,483
i mean, well, we...

212
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,251
yeah, we broke up
about a year ago.

213
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,387
we were together a long time.

214
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,122
she found someone else.

215
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,189
- Sorry.

216
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,625
- It's all right.

217
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,160
what about you?

218
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,629
- I'm getting my phd
in anthropology.

219
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,499
nomadic tribes in morocco
are my specialty.

220
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:21,271
it must be a lot of work
getting a phd.

221
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,274
- I get to ask
a lot of questions,

222
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,276
and i listen to people.

223
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,744
it's a lot of reading.

224
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,688
i've been reading
henry's journal.

225
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,924
his...reading
his most private thoughts.

226
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,326
i...

227
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,930
i've been going to places
he went to.

228
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,067
i've started recording sounds
he might recognize.

229
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,301
it's just really messed up.

230
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,303
- You're his sister.
i get it.

231
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,805
- We had a fight,

232
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,208
like, our first
real adult fight, you know?

233
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,545
he, um...

234
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,548
he dropped out of college
to be a musician.

235
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,518
i said i thought that
he was making a huge mistake.

236
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,389
i said so many awful things.

237
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,559
we haven't talked
in six months.

238
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,432
he sent me all these links
to videos he'd made,

239
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,001
songs he'd recorded, and...

240
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,207
i didn't open a single one.

241
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,076
i'm sorry. i...
- Hey, it's...

242
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:34,478
it's all right.

243
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,414
i can't even imagine.

244
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,620
you're james forester, right?

245
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:44,421
- Yeah.

246
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,889
- Will you sign my ipod?

247
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,457
- Sure.

248
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,099
- Thank you.
i love your music.

249
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,367
- Thanks.

250
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,021
- I don't speak portuguese,

251
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,523
and so this
isn't gonna be pretty,

252
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,058
but i am the last guy
of the night,

253
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,827
so here you go.

254
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,160
- How long are you here for?

255
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,462
- Two more shows in new york,

256
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:07,097
a wedding.

257
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,366
- Who's getting married?

258
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,268
- I don't know them.

259
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,904
i'm the entertainment.

260
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,839
- Ah.

261
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,441
i never would have pegged you
for a wedding singer.

262
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,411
- 10,000.
three songs.

263
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,445
- That's not bad.

264
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,780
- I'm not proud of it.

265
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,082
last show's in philadelphia,

266
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,251
and then that it.

267
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,054
i'm going back home.

268
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,560
i'm actually kind
of freaked out right now.

269
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:39,829
they're trying to get me to go
and record in berlin after this,

270
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,300
but the truth is,
i'm just stuck.

271
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,538
- What happens
if you don't write

272
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,842
any more songs?

273
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,245
- I'm not really sure.

274
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,289
you know, the best thing
about playing...

275
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,958
you know when you have a feeling

276
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,627
and you don't want
to fade away,

277
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,163
but you don't really know
how to keep it?

278
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,432
well, that feeling comes back
when i play,

279
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,069
like i can keep it.

280
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,238
no...no talking,

281
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,407
no disappointing anyone

282
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,877
for three to five whole minutes.

283
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,313
- You should try
playing longer songs.

284
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,816
- Yeah, i should.

285
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:36,419
- Why don't you try
to choose something

286
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,988
and write a song about it,

287
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,589
like a nose?

288
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,158
- Nose?
- A nose.

289
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,162
- I don't think
nose songs are my thing.

290
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:51,134
- You could write
the greatest song in the world

291
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:54,137
about a nose...

292
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,607
there's a lot
of different types of ears.

293
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,443
there are endless possibilities.

294
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,678
- I can get it from here.

295
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,784
- You all right?
- Yeah.

296
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,389
- Guess i'll see you.

297
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,057
- Yeah.

298
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,026
thanks again.

299
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,740
i don't know.

300
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,746
i'm really sorry, henry.

301
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,885
i didn't mean you were stupid.

302
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,887
i'm stupid.

303
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,291
i'm sorry.

304
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,128
you know i say things.

305
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,331
sometimes
i get too opinionated,

306
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,235
too stubborn.

307
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,404
you have to be okay.

308
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,177
- So i heard
when you're not on the road,

309
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,912
you spend most of your time
in the country.

310
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,214
what are you, like, a hermit?

311
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:25,782
- Um, no.

312
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,617
not...not really.

313
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,052
- You once said
you have no interest

314
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,487
in modern technology,

315
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,491
that all you need is music
and the person you love.

316
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,526
- Uh, yeah.
yeah.

317
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,695
maybe...
maybe i said that.

318
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:43,132
- What's the strangest thing
that's happened to you on tour?

319
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,934
- I was chased by a moose.

320
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,803
what?

321
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,472
- In california.

322
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,530
- Mom?

323
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:28,598
- Franny.

324
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,035
- What are you doing?

325
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,337
- I am making piaya.

326
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,138
- Right.

327
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,472
it's june 4th.

328
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,641
- damn it!
- God!

329
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,110
- Ahh!

330
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,312
get the pillowcase
out of the oven.

331
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,447
- God.

332
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:48,751
- Ugh, so loud!

333
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,387
god, it's so loud.

334
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,455
thank you.

335
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,291
- jesus.

336
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:58,995
- You, um...

337
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,763
you be in charge of...

338
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:01,864
mm...

339
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,267
you be in charge
of the glasses

340
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,736
and the decorations, okay?

341
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,139
thanks.

342
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,287
- There's a cat waving at you.

343
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:01,858
it's one of those mechanical
good luck ones.

344
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,565
- look really good in here now.

345
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,234
actually
it looks pretty horrible,

346
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,737
but it's better than it was.

347
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,109
- It's your half-birthday,

348
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,479
and we're celebrating it.

349
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,653
do you remember
when we were in zurich

350
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,622
for your half-birthday?

351
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,290
you were, like, five.

352
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:38,928
all you wanted were m&ms
and lemonade,

353
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,429
and we couldn't find any.

354
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,332
it was just expensive swiss
chocolate everywhere,

355
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,803
and then finally,
we found some m&ms

356
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,971
after hours of searching,

357
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:53,676
and mom bought you,
like, 50 packs,

358
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,745
bought out the store.

359
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,008
- Happy half-birthday, henry.

360
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,744
sorry about all this.

361
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,913

362
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:37,954
- Hey.

363
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,824
- Sorry if i'm interrupting.

364
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,259
- You...
you are not.

365
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,794
come on in.

366
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:46,028
join the party.

367
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,231
i think we even have
an extra hat.

368
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,398
here you go.

369
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,801
- Um, looks nice.

370
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,504
- It's henry's half-birthday.

371
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,609
- keyboard looks good too.

372
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,479
- Hey, have some persecco.

373
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,781
don't tell the nurses.

374
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:06,782
- Thanks.

375
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,352
- Sure.

376
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:11,153
cheers.

377
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,690
thank you.

378
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,229
turn left.

379
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,167
please.

380
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,603
- You didn't even speak russian.

381
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,572
why did you want henry
to learn it?

382
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:32,308
- I wanted us
to learn it together.

383
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,443
secret language.

384
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:39,348
- Yours and 150 million
other people's secret language.

385
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,484
- I don't speak russian.

386
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,822
- Why do they always
make you learn that?

387
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,724
it is obvious
you don't speak russian.

388
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,860
why do you have to go around
stating that?

389
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,561
- Mom, i just...

390
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,665
i wish you could listen
for two minutes.

391
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,233
- Oh.

392
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,268
oh.

393
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,469
i'm so sorry.

394
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:04,006
that is good coming from...

395
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,207
never mind.

396
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,742
- No, no, no, no.
come on, mom.

397
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,312
tell me.
what were you going to say?

398
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,682
- I was going to say that
that is good

399
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,984
coming from a girl
who didn't even call

400
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:18,287
her own brother back
to say she was sorry.

401
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,125
- You can't tell me that you

402
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,529
thought that dropping out
of college was a good idea.

403
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:30,066
- Franny,
he did not want to go back.

404
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,434
what was i supposed to do?

405
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,703
- You never would
have let me do that.

406
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:37,239
- You never would have wanted
to have done that ever.

407
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,674
and speaking of you,

408
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:42,078
you basically dropped off
the grid for six months.

409
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,479
for six months,

410
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,748
we didn't hear anything
from you and...

411
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,183
oh, is that okay?

412
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,318
- No, i called you.
i did text.

413
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,554
- Oh, yeah.
the famous text, yeah.

414
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,289
- Well, if you would empty
your voicemail

415
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,290
every once in a while.

416
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,291
- Oh, that's it.

417
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:56,692
yup, that's it.

418
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,227
you're right.
you have all the answers.

419
00:49:58,229 --> 00:50:00,663
you came out of my womb
havin' all the answers, man.

420
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,466
- God!
- Oh, my god.

421
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,014
james.

422
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:21,217
would you like to come over
for dinner?

423
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,452
- I have a show tonight.

424
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,787
- Okay.
tomorrow night then.

425
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,655
- Mom.

426
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:29,425
you...
you don't have to, really.

427
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,961
- I would love to.

428
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,695
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

429
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,865
- I'm...
i'm glad you came.

430
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:10,900
- Yeah?

431
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:13,335
i just...

432
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:16,572
decided to last minute, yeah.

433
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:22,078
- do you want...

434
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,814
do you want a star fruit?

435
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,784
- No, thank you.

436
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:31,420
- Yeah, i'm not big
on star fruit either.

437
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,690
- let me see that.

438
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,592
- james, you're up.

439
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:43,999
- Good luck out there.
they're wild tonight.

440
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,794
discman.

441
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,130
- Yeah,
i'm a bit old-fashioned.

442
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:12,301
this is my favorite song
in the world.

443
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,171
- I'm ready.

444
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,715
- This is your favorite song?

445
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,585
- Okay, oh.
not that one.

446
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:30,719
th-that's a guilty pleasure.

447
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,720
it's an old mix.

448
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,989
hold on.
wait.

449
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,758
okay, i think
you're gonna love it.

450
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,182
- This is for you
from katie johnstone.

451
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,084
"hey, james.
give 'er a listen."

452
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,719
i think he's trying
to speak to you as you.

453
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,454
- Give 'er.
give us a listen.

454
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:06,655
- Yeah, yeah.

455
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:10,492
"dear james,
i have been"...

456
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:11,493
oh, my god.

457
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:13,562
- Yeah, it's an epic.

458
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:17,399
- "i would be extremely stoke...

459
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:19,968
"ed
to get a coffee,

460
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,471
"or in my case,
a hot chocolate

461
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:25,340
because i don't like coffee
very much."

462
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:28,811
- You're kidding me.

463
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,946
- "you would like it."

464
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,982
- She sounds like she just drank
a hell of a lot of coffee.

465
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,785
- Wow.

466
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,924
she sort of got the eyes right.

467
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:44,259
- What?
- Yeah, this is hilarious.

468
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:45,561
- Oh, my good...

469
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:49,465
"die, james, die...
james."

470
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,368
- And check out this side.

471
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,038
- "i'm coming, james.

472
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,273
james, james, james, james."

473
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,843
that's my favorite one.

474
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,211
look at the eyes.

475
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:03,679
- I just got kind of worried
about you.

476
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,214
- look at the eyes.

477
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,115
- They're gonna hypnotize me.

478
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:11,687
beautiful.

479
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:12,821
you have to try it on.

480
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,690
- It's gonna be way too small.

481
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:15,858
- It's a medium.

482
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,493
- It's a children's medium.

483
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,461
- I don't...it's cotton.
it'll stretch.

484
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,230
- Really?
- Yeah.

485
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:25,801
- For you.

486
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:31,406
sorry.

487
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:32,608
there.

488
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,816
- I'm ready to go out now.

489
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,907
- You know,
this is really good.

490
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,510
- It's not mine,
the zombies.

491
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,454
- How does the melody line go?

492
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:53,522
- Something like...

493
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,459
- "ulysses now left the haven

494
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:08,230
"and took the rough track up
though the wooded country

495
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,033
"and over the crest
of the mountain

496
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:14,636
till he reached the place
where minerva had said."

497
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:18,106
i actually don't mind
the smell of smoke in my house

498
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:23,211
because it reminds me
of presanitized times, you know,

499
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,181
like paris in the '70s.

500
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,683
- Were you there in the '70s?

501
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,418
- Who wasn't?

502
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,619
- Um...

503
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,954
- Well, i...

504
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,156
okay, a lot of people weren't,

505
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,524
you two for example,

506
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,927
but my god,
i'm sorry you weren't.

507
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:42,698
it was so great.

508
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,100
i got...

509
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:47,069
so much there.

510
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:50,939
i got my master's,

511
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:54,576
lovers...
i won't say how many.

512
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:56,011
don't worry...

513
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:57,279
a husband.

514
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:59,781
i was an arkansas girl
in paris.

515
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:01,216
how great is that?

516
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,820
and then of course,
i did date a famous rock star.

517
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:06,388
who?

518
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,989
- I...
she hasn't even told me.

519
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,958
i'm not even sure it's true.

520
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,093
- Of course it's true.

521
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:12,961
why would i make that up?

522
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,162
this guy was amazing.

523
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,064
he taught me
one of the hardest songs

524
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,733
even to learn on the guitar.

525
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:19,134
-<i> blackbird</i> by the beatles.

526
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,902
- Mm, great song.

527
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,003
never learned it.

528
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:25,674
- Oh, it is a great one,
james.

529
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:27,342
oh, my god.

530
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:31,947
i gave henry one time
for christmas,

531
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,615
and he loved it so much,

532
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:36,785
this unbelievable
green accordion,

533
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:39,254
and he slept with it.

534
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,555
it was a teddy bear.

535
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:42,124
it was like his teddy bear,
you know?

536
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:44,693
- My mom gave me my first guitar
when i was 13.

537
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:48,230
- Yeah, did it have a picture
of a hulu dancer on it?

538
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,398
- Nope, unfortunately...

539
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,002
- Oh, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da!

540
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:55,670
here it is.

541
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:56,838
- Oh, hey, come on.

542
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,909

01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,244
you are a very good girl.

544
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:04,479
i don't know how
you are my daughter.

545
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,947
- Well, you raised me well.

546
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,416
- Yeah, so well.

547
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,502
oh, my god.

548
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,004
that was so bad.

549
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:33,675
why, thank you.

550
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:38,747
franny, what was the song
that you were so obsessed with

551
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:40,315
that, um...

552
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,184
oh...
come on.

553
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:45,420
by america?
by america.

554
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,656
- Oh, i don't remember.

555
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,224
- Oh, you remember.

556
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:51,760
oh, my god.
yes, you do.

557
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:52,994
she remembers.

558
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:56,097
she sang it nonstop,
all the time,

559
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,766
over and over
and over and over.

560
01:03:57,768 --> 01:04:00,502
she sang it
in the school talent show

561
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,571
because it was the '92 election,

562
01:04:02,573 --> 01:04:06,975
and she believed
that it had political subtext

563
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,211
about how much
the country needed

564
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,246
to have bill clinton elected
as president.

565
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,247
- I was eight.

566
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,083
- And here it is.

567
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:16,785
- Oh, no.
no!

568
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:17,786
- No, come on.

569
01:04:17,788 --> 01:04:18,920
you did so good.
- No.

570
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:21,356
- Come on.
you were so good.

571
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,158
- No, i wasn't.
- So good.

572
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,759
- Mom, come on.
this...this is embarrassing.

573
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,294
- I don't believe
in embarrassment.

574
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:27,963
- I am kind of curious now.

575
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:33,435
- Come on, franny.
it'll just make me so happy.

576
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,975

581
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:12,233
- She'll be okay.

582
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,140
- Is that something new?

583
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:00,408
